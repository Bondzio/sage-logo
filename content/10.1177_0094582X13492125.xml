<abstract>
<p>The inherent ambiguities of human rights language and activism in the context of Colombia’s ongoing armed conflict and the way the discourse has been instrumentalized and appropriated by all sides in the conflict have contributed to skepticism about human rights that has dangerous implications for constructing a democratic culture consonant with the formal rights protections enshrined in the Constitution. These ambiguities arise from the complex social and political trajectory of human rights activism in the country, ideological pressures, and general philosophical confusions stemming from liberal moral philosophy. The more sociologically oriented moral philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre provides better resources both for interpreting the problems with human rights activism and ethical discourse in Colombia and for grounding a more cogent ethical response to Colombia’s widely recognized moral crisis.</p>

Estas ambigüedades surgen de la compleja trayectoria social y política del activismo por los derechos humanos en el país, las presiones ideológicas y confusiones filosóficas generales derivadas de la filosofía moral liberal. La filosofía moral más sociológicamente orientada de Alasdair MacIntyre proporciona mejores recursos, tanto para la interpretación de los problemas con el activismo por los derechos humanos y el discurso ético en Colombia como para fundamentar una respuesta ética más convincente a la crisis moral ampliamente reconocida en Colombia.</p>

<p>Human rights in Colombia have long been a moral and political battleground. Just as the country’s social sciences have become a site of conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X13492125">González, Bolívar, and Vásquez, 2002</xref>: 19), so human rights language has been pulled into the fray. Most recently this has been the case with the polemical debates over the nature of human rights violations against trade unionists and the potential for the so-called free-trade agreements between Colombia, the United States, and the European Union to enhance human rights protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0094582X13492125">Escuela Nacional Sindical, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0094582X13492125">Mejía and Uribe, 2009</xref>). Former president Álvaro Uribe Vélez publicly denounced human rights activists as supporters of terrorism and cemented a dangerously authoritarian social consensus that facilitated the overriding of fundamental human rights in the name of “democratic security.” This, combined with the diverse interpretations and emphases of human rights in Colombian civil society and the attempts of some intellectuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0094582X13492125">Orozco, 2005</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0094582X13492125">Restrepo, 2001</xref>) to discredit the interpretations of prominent nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), has contributed to a polarized and confusing climate of opinion in relation to the comprehension and defense of human rights. But the ambiguities and philosophical confusions go back farther, to the discussions generated by the 1991 Constitution in relation to human rights and the armed struggle and to the way human rights were interpreted in the different classifications of political and social violence by NGOs and the state.</p>
<p>The emotive, hyperpoliticized, and ideological context of the Colombian war and the widely recognized moral crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X13492125">Arango, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X13492125">Gómez-Müller, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0094582X13492125">Guzmán, Fals, and Umaña, 2005; López, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0094582X13492125">Pearce, 1998</xref>) identified as a result of the alarming levels of killing and cruelty by all sides in the conflict call for an “ethical response” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X13492125">López, 2005</xref>). The turn to ethics for both explanation and prescription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X13492125">Durán, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X13492125">Hoyos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X13492125">López, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0094582X13492125">Mejía et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0094582X13492125">Rojas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0094582X13492125">Uribe de Hincapié, 1996</xref>) is perhaps partly a result of the failure of the social sciences to contribute to ending the seemingly interminable cycle of political and social violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X13492125">Blair, 2012</xref>). The search for some kind of moral anchor, some fixed ethical grounding for social critique, dialogue, and policy making, is understandable in a context in which political sectarianism, intolerance, and the “dirty war” have transgressed seemingly all moral limits. However, the liberal presuppositions of the Colombian internal discussion and the way the social sciences are implicated in the very conflict they seek to analyze and transform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X13492125">Chambers, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X13492125">Jabri, 2006</xref>) make difficult the development of a cogent moral response based on human rights.</p>
<sec id="section1-0094582X13492125">
<title>A Nonliberal Approach to Interpreting the Colombian Moral Crisis</title>
<p>The Colombian case provides a concrete example of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0094582X13492125">Alasdair MacIntyre’s (1985a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X13492125">1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0094582X13492125">2006)</xref><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094582X13492125">1</xref></sup> view of modern moral language as a manipulative and increasingly ideological discourse that is incapable of rationally grounding its claims and serving as a mediator of conflict and a generator of some minimal ethical consensus for political practice and coexistence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0094582X13492125">MacIntyre’s (1958–1959)</xref> powerful diagnosis of the arbitrariness and ahistorical nature of modern moral argument and the incommensurability of its basic premises and concepts calls into question liberal moral theory (and the moral basis of liberal politics) and, in the Colombian case, the grounding of a “citizen ethics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X13492125">Calderón, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X13492125">Hoyos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0094582X13492125">Peña, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0094582X13492125">Uribe Botero, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0094582X13492125">Uribe de Hincapié, 1996</xref>) based on neo-Kantian, Habermasian presuppositions and the appeal to human rights as a universal bedrock upon which to build such an ethics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0094582X13492125">Tovar, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>MacIntyre’s early forays into moral philosophy occurred during his Marxist years of involvement with the British New Left. His effort to ground a coherent Marxist ethics was a response to the deformations of Stalinism’s historical determinist, means-end morality and ex-Stalinists’ subsequent moral condemnation of Stalinism on the basis of a neo-Kantian appeal to ethical principles. MacIntyre points out that the liberal moral critic of Stalinism effectively inverts the form of moral judgment and moral agency within Stalinism: “The Stalinist identifies what is morally right with what is actually going to be the outcome of historical development” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0094582X13492125">MacIntyre, 1958–1959</xref>: 91). Moral judgments and therefore moral agency are effectively determined by the horizon of historical necessity and therefore ultimately unfree: “The ‘ought’ of principle is swallowed up in the ‘is’ of history.” In contrast, the liberal moral critic of Stalinism appeals to moral principles that stand wholly outside of history. The principles are invoked as valid independently of the course of historical events, and every issue is to be judged on its “moral” merits: “The ‘ought’ of principle is completely external to the ‘is’ of history.” The fragility of the appeal to this kind of ahistorical moral principle “lies in the apparently arbitrary nature of that appeal.”</p>
<p>MacIntyre argues that the loss of a teleological perspective in ethics and politics through the rejection of Aristotelianism at the threshold of the modern era has turned morality and moral-political language into an unintelligible, arbitrary mélange of fragmented concepts and injunctions that precludes rational engagement in conflict and the reaching of consensus. As a result, contemporary moral and political debates cannot be rationally resolved, only arbitrarily settled by the imposition of power or nonrational suasion. Morality has become an instrument of emotivist manipulation. Rather than a set of objective criteria to which we appeal to convince others of the appropriateness or not of some action, it is merely a technique of emotional persuasion dressed up in the terms of an appeal to impersonal standards. At the social level emotivism “entails the obliteration of any genuine distinction between manipulative and non-manipulative social relations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0094582X13492125">MacIntyre, 1985a</xref>: 23). I argue that this diagnosis of emotivism as central to the problematic nature of moral conflict usefully illuminates important aspects of the Colombian moral crisis. For example, the increasingly shrill discourses and “parallel delegitimizations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0094582X13492125">Giraldo, 2003</xref>) of rival conflict actors and the “pathology” of moral and political language, which has degenerated into “the use of terms that no longer convince anyone as they begin to be rendered meaningless by their abuse, misuse, and dull repetition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X13492125">López, 2005</xref>: 196), can be partly explained and elucidated by this diagnosis.</p>
<p>MacIntyre’s central thesis is that moral consensus is impossible in modern cultures because of the fragmentation of previous moral frameworks and the radical incommensurability of first principles and premises, which often appeal to radically different notions such as the importance of individual rights or the priority of collective interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0094582X13492125">MacIntyre, 1985a</xref>). Moral arguments that begin from rival evaluative premises cannot be rationally compared. Thus, according to MacIntyre, “rational consensus upon central moral questions and a fortiori on central political questions has proved impossible within the framework provided by the dominant conception of rationality in modern cultures and . . . therefore in the arena of rational discussion there is radical dissensus” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0094582X13492125">MacIntyre, 1985b</xref>: 238). The failure to address radical incommensurability is a weakness of various neo-Kantian/Habermasian approaches to dialogue and conflict resolution in which free and open discussion is held to be the answer to radical conflict (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X13492125">Cortina, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0094582X13492125">Rojas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0094582X13492125">Uribe Botero, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0094582X13492125">Uribe de Hincapié, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>These discourse ethics approaches appear to view ethics as ahistorical, ultimately detached from particular interests and desires, and because of this consensus is deemed to be possible under idealized conditions of communication and argumentation. However, even if we assume that this might be the case, to approach the creation of these conditions we have to address the fact of rival moral-political standpoints and languages that have partially led to and informed and justified the current state of affairs. Those in control of the media, land, the means of production, and so forth, have particular moral-political standpoints and languages that are radically at odds with the standpoints and languages of those from different strata of society. Part of the strength of MacIntyre’s thesis is that it faces up to this conflictual reality in a sociological and not just a philosophical or linguistic way. Neverthless, albeit in a very different way from the discourse ethics approach, MacIntyre agrees that we need to focus partly on issues of moral language and discourse. As he notes, “it has been precisely at the level of language that the moral inadequacies and corruptions of our age have been evident, and certainly no less so by those with ideological stances than by others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0094582X13492125">1971</xref>: 94).</p>
<p>MacIntyre’s insistence on the depth of linguistic and conceptual conflict recalls the recognition by Marxist and other radical scholars in the 1960s and 1970s that moral-political language could not be neutral or divorced from economic and social structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0094582X13492125">Dussel, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X13492125">Freire, 1996 [1970]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X13492125">Gutiérrez, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094582X13492125">Harvey, 1988 [1973]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0094582X13492125">Petras, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0094582X13492125">Torres, 1972 [1964]</xref>). In the Latin American context of the cold war and the National Security Doctrine, rival interpretations of human rights language abounded, with sharp differences between Western and U.S.-aligned sectors and Latin American popular movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X13492125">Assman, 1978</xref>). Ethical language was highly politicized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X13492125">Comblin, 1979</xref>), liberation theologians argued for a nonneutral “option for the poor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X13492125">Gutiérrez, 1973</xref>), and liberationist philosophers criticized the “Eurocentrism” of hegemonic philosophical categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0094582X13492125">Dussel, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X13492125">1977</xref>). The shift by many intellectuals to the philosophical and political optimism of post–Soviet Union liberalism and civil society,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0094582X13492125">2</xref></sup> however, simply left behind the philosophical problems of moral-political language that Marxists, liberation theologians, and philosophers had highlighted. MacIntyre’s work returns us to these unresolved problems and posits a way of resolving them, while also offering an important critique of the ethical approaches associated with liberationism, Marxism, and other forms of political radicalism.</p>

<title>The Moral Crisis and Human Rights</title>
<p>In the Colombian context, this radicalism led to the emergence of left-wing insurgencies that appealed either directly to Marxist notions of justice or to an amalgam of human rights, radical Christianity, just-war theory, and Marxism, among other permutations. When the Colombian sociologist Camilo Torres joined the Ejército de Liberación Nacional (National Liberation Army—ELN)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0094582X13492125">3</xref></sup> guerrillas he was as convinced of the moral basis for his decision as were those who criticized him on the left and the right (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0094582X13492125">Zuleta, 2009</xref>). Yet it is this moral certainty and conviction that has contributed to conflict dynamics in Colombia. As the philosopher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X13492125">Rodolfo Arango (2002</xref>: 18–19) observes, “Herein lies precisely the bankruptcy of Colombian political culture: an appreciable number of people and social groups are persuaded of the justice of their cause and therefore they believe the means they use to achieve their objectives are legitimate.” When everything is seen as legitimate, there is a moral crisis of distinctions that urgently requires the formulation of an agreement about what is and is not publicly legitimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X13492125">Gómez-Müller, 2008</xref>: 59). However, trapped between the so-called ethics of conviction and the ethics of responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0094582X13492125">Giraldo, 2003</xref>), rival moral positions and arguments in relation to legitimacy and the requirements for peace and coexistence are apparently irreconcilable. Calls for human rights to serve as the ethical foundation of a response to the moral crisis fare no better (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0094582X13492125">Tovar, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The radical breakdown in dialogue and shared moral referents highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0094582X13492125">Torres (1972 [1964])</xref>, which was ultimately understood in terms of class polarization, has also come to fracture movements for human rights and social change, and this has led to confusion and the ideological discrediting of human rights. This devaluation of human rights is arguably one important reason for the lowering of individual and social moral thresholds in Colombia. The extent of social and political polarization in Colombia has also contributed to the instrumentalization of human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0094582X13492125">Restrepo, 2001</xref>), but more is at issue than mere ideological use.</p>
<p>The appeal to human rights has been made in very different social contexts, and the incoherence and disagreements within the human rights “community” reflect this and the deeper philosophical problems of emotivism and incommensurability diagnosed by MacIntyre. These disagreements and philosophical problems call into question the view of one Colombian philosopher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0094582X13492125">Tovar, 2002</xref>: 50), who argues:
<disp-quote>
<p>Given that no agreement can exist between people without rules that fix limits to what is permitted and prohibited, the need for a foundational ethical code is clear. In our time, human rights and international humanitarian law ostensibly serve as such a foundation and come prior to any particular content to the public policies that the opposing parties negotiate. The principles stipulated therein provide the ethical and juridical conditions for any possible accord, and therefore adherence to them cannot remain at the discretion of the disputants.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The problem is that moral rules and norms, as MacIntyre points out, presuppose an important degree of prior social and moral agreement. Moreover, human rights as enshrined in international declarations and charters are the product of particular, contestable social and political contexts and forms. They are not in fact “prior” to any political content but are intimately connected to and emerge out of particular political contexts, structures, and ideological standpoints.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0094582X13492125">
<title>The Trajectory of Human Rights Activism in Colombia</title>
<p>The first human rights organizations in Colombia emerged from embattled leftist political movements struggling for recognition and social transformation in the closed National Front political system during an era of aggressive U.S. imperialism. Originally wary of the discourse of human rights (many felt that it was irredeemably compromised because of its “bourgeois” origins and ideological usefulness and affinity to capitalism and U.S. interests), activists eventually adopted the framework but naturally interpreted and colored it in terms of their political, social, and cultural visions and agendas (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X13492125">Assman, 1978</xref>). Many Latin American activists were initiated into the human rights framework by participation in consciousness-raising groups organized through the Catholic Church, universities, and trade unions. Liberation theology in particular left its imprint on the first human rights activists, who focused on social and economic rights as much as political and civil rights and were driven by an agenda of profound social change. The liberation theologians gradually moved toward a nuanced appropriation of human rights that fitted with the “preferential option for the poor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X13492125">Engler, 2000</xref>), and partiality in human rights language was permitted on the basis that it was unnecessary to defend the rights of those whose rights were not at risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X13492125">Comblin, 1990</xref>). As the liberation theologian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X13492125">José Comblin (1979</xref>: 105) noted, given the repression experienced under the National Security regimes it was not surprising that the various declarations of the Church and social organizations regarding human rights were not “theoretical studies of an ethical doctrine conducted in a vacuum. They [were] public acts of confrontation with a political system.” The state was naturally viewed as the enemy.</p>
<p>In Colombia, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0094582X13492125">Winifred Tate (2007</xref>: 104) points out, similar views on the nature of human rights and the state “profoundly shaped the kinds of violence on which early human rights campaigns focused. . . . The ambivalence toward guerrilla violence extended from defending individuals accused of participation in guerrilla groups to defending the rights of guerrilla groups themselves, using the so-called right to rebellion.” Tate traces the development of these first politicized human rights groups through to the early 1990s, when many became properly professional organizations with paid as opposed to voluntary staff and with increasing connections to the also emerging state human rights agencies and international organizations. This amounted to a seismic shift in the landscape of human rights activism that sparked emotional debates within the Colombian human rights community. A particularly important debate centered on the issue of documenting and categorizing guerrilla violence. For the newly professionalized organizations, guerrilla violence had to be categorized either as human rights abuses or as violations of international humanitarian law. In contrast, for those whose understanding of human rights was formed in the course of engagement with radical politics, criticizing the guerrillas and documenting their violence was unthinkable. In response to suggestions by another human rights activist that they document guerrilla violence, instead of invoking the theoretical argument that only states are party to international human rights treaties and therefore only states can violate human rights,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0094582X13492125">4</xref></sup> one human rights activist in Tate’s account invoked the narrative of political persecution and social injustice from which the guerrillas emerged and with which early activists sympathized and identified. For such activists, human rights are inscribed and given meaning in the context of political struggle for social transformation. As one activist commented, “What is not easy is to recognize that in this country when people are killed because of what they think, the guerrilla is legitimate. And that the state is not legitimate, to think that it is recognized by the international community. What am I basing this on? On human rights” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0094582X13492125">Tate, 2007</xref>: 166). This speaks to the problem of deciding what and who is legitimate (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X13492125">Arango, 2002</xref>: 18–19) as well as indicating the dichotomous moral thinking characteristic of the discourse about the conflict in Colombia.</p>
<p>For externally funded professional organizations like the Colombian Commission of Jurists, in contrast, the human rights organizations had to support and address the victims of all the armed actors in the conflict. This was partly out of a conviction that the “violent abuse of the innocent and defenseless [was] indicative of larger patterns of social injustice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0094582X13492125">Tate, 2007</xref>: 150) and partly out of pragmatic concern for continued international diplomatic support and funding. For activists on this side of the debate, human rights did not displace their political convictions but rather provided a different framework for their continued political activism.</p>
<p>But every concept appealed to brings us back to another dimension of the conflict and the discussion. The notion of the “innocent and defenseless” is bound up with one way of reading the conflict and with a particular view of individual agency in relation to it. The shift in the 1990s toward a humanitarian reading of the conflict and the urgency of attending to hundreds of thousands of displaced people arguably contributed to a view of “passive” victims in need of “paternalistic” humanitarian intervention and the protection afforded by human rights and international humanitarian law. But, in the view of one human rights lawyer, the notion of “protecting the innocent” is far more complicated than merely appealing for adherence to international humanitarian law. The reality of war and the nature of power mean that the abstract principles of international humanitarian law cannot simply be “applied” to such a context. “The war involves everyone. Who is outside of the conflict? How can we distinguish who is part of the war and who is not? In the logic of international humanitarian law, everything is untouchable” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0094582X13492125">Tate, 2007</xref>: 166).</p>
<p>For like-minded activists, adopting international humanitarian law to criticize the guerrillas would fuel the government’s campaign to deflect accountability and responsibility for political violence. Documentation of guerrilla violations and public censure by human rights organizations would, it was argued, be used to shift attention from the state’s overwhelming responsibility for the violence. In this sense Colombian human rights organizations had a “political” conception of human rights, and they have been criticized for adopting this conception instead of an “ethical” one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0094582X13492125">Restrepo, 2001</xref>). However, from a MacIntyrean sociological perspective there can be no such thing as a purely “ethical” conception of human rights. Human rights imply or are embedded in some conception of the good and therefore some political conception and vision.</p>
<p>Other human rights organizations took a different view. Some argued for the use of international humanitarian law to censure the guerrillas on the basis that not doing so would undermine their credibility and legitimacy. When an important number of Colombian NGOs decided after national-level discussions to integrate international humanitarian law into their frameworks and condemn guerrilla “kidnappings” and forced disappearances, as one activist reported, “at stake were the diplomatic relationships. No one doubted the benefit of having the embassies on board. They were huge pillars of support in dark times” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0094582X13492125">Tate, 2007</xref>: 164). In order to keep these diplomatic ties the NGOs had to “take a position.” The final declaration in support of this move was read by a prominent activist who had suffered a forced disappearance in her own family, allegedly “giving her greater moral authority to argue the position.” However, this implies precisely the arbitrary modern notion of moral authority critiqued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0094582X13492125">MacIntyre (1958–1959)</xref>.</p>
<p>The episode reveals the moral complexities and ambiguities faced by social activists in Colombia but also underlines the philosophical incoherence of certain “moral” positions and evaluations in the context of international human rights activism. Activists are often forced to divorce their moral reasoning from the concrete history and context of the conflict and to make moral judgments on the basis of pragmatic considerations. These considerations may of course themselves be based on further moral evaluations in terms of ultimate consequences, but this nevertheless risks making the internal issues less determinate and more abstract. The logic of international human rights defense inevitably moves in this direction and risks leaving social activists morally resourceless and ineffective in the specifically Colombian context of seeking social transformation. The important gains in international profile that may help impede state violence, for example, may also establish a precedent for the state and external institutions to judge guerrilla actions that for many activists, while deplorable, are deeply political and historically rooted. This can lead to the establishment of a moral framework that is inappropriate for addressing and transforming the particular social, political, and moral dimensions of the conflict and, moreover, has important implications in terms of moral <italic>truth</italic>.</p>
<p>The professionalization of human rights organizations highlighted class differences within the Colombian human rights community. Some activists complained that international funding saw once radically committed activists shift to ambiguous positions with different interests. The interests of the “international community” and the matrix of global institutions through which human rights activism was channeled meant, from the perspective of some activists, the inevitable neutering of a wider transformatory and oppositional agenda. “In the name of professionalism, activists were forced to use diplomatic, officialist language, ‘light’ language, and weaken their critique of the state, hiding the seriousness of the human rights situation and the depth of state responsibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0094582X13492125">Tate, 2007</xref>: 153–154).</p>
<p>As Tate points out, the stakes are high in these debates in terms of gaining both domestic constituencies and international support. The proliferation of human rights and other NGOs has brought with it a dependency on and a competition for external funding. Beyond this, though, there are issues of personal moral-political identity. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0094582X13492125">Tate (2007</xref>: 163) observes, “For activists, these debates also signal a shift in political identity and culture; they must decide whether or not they align themselves with radical left movements for social transformation or with an international movement that uses human rights norms to protect vulnerable citizens, establish accountability, and work for social transformation through the defense of the rule of law.” These are significant, consequential issues for Colombian activists and are philosophically and practically important in terms of the way the social transformation they envision is bound up with one or another moral framework for interpreting and using human rights.</p>

<title>The “Authoritarian Spell”: Uribismo vs. Human Rights Activists</title>
<p>While the discourse of human rights has always been subject to political use and abuse in Colombia, this use and abuse intensified during the hard right-wing government of Álvaro Uribe Vélez (2002–2010). The Uribe administration’s “democratic security” policy denied the existence of armed conflict in Colombia, dovetailing with the U.S. post-911 “War on Terror” and treating the insurgent movements as “narco-guerrillas” and terrorists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0094582X13492125">5</xref></sup> A year into Uribe’s presidency, the Colombian Platform for Human Rights, Democracy, and Development, a coalition of 80 human rights, social, and community organizations, published a report on the human rights situation that provided a thoroughgoing contextual critique based on a broad conception of human rights, including economic and social rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0094582X13492125">Plataforma Colombiana de Derechos Humanos, Democracia y Desarrollo, 2003</xref>). Titled <italic>The Authoritarian Spell</italic>, the report went beyond most international human rights reports in its political and social evaluation of the entire ideological project of the Uribe government. From here on, the animosity between the Uribe government and Colombia’s human rights and social organizations led to increasing polarization. In a speech to the armed forces on September 8, 2003, Uribe accused unspecified individuals and groups of using human rights as a political weapon, calling them “writers and ideologues who ultimately give support to terrorism and who cravenly shield themselves with the banner of human rights.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0094582X13492125">6</xref></sup> He went on to compare the official armed forces and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia—FARC) with respect to human rights and to claim that the Colombian human rights organizations were biased in favor of the guerrillas: “Our national armed forces have not the slightest intention of stooping to the level of the terrorists in their disregard for human rights. While the FARC and its accompanying terrorism—while that terrorist organization violates human rights every day, those politicized human rights ideologues rush to defend the FARC on the pretext of defending human rights.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0094582X13492125">7</xref></sup> President Uribe’s attacks associating human rights with guerrilla subversion effectively gave the green light to both the military and the paramilitary forces to target a wide range of human rights defenders and social organizations.</p>
<p>These attacks were aimed not only at national human rights groups but also at internationally respected organizations like Amnesty International. Through repeated criticisms of this kind Uribe created a politicized and bellicose climate of opinion around human rights activism in Colombia, generating the sociological and subjective conditions for the devaluing of human rights as an ethical-juridical concept and framework. The language of human rights was co-opted as part of a Manichean and Machiavellian populist strategy in which rational discussion of human rights issues was replaced by emotive and emotivist appeals, rolling back the social and political gains won via the 1991 Constitution and thereby eroding the bases of a healthy democratic political, social, and legal culture.</p>
<p>The importance of class-based political and economic interests at certain critical conjunctures cannot be underestimated in interpreting the way the state has used human rights discourse to undermine and attack expressions of dissent by the working class and other social and peasant movements. For example, in March 2008 President Uribe’s close adviser José Obdulio Gaviria publicly accused Colombian human rights organizations of being allies of the FARC guerrillas, complaining that “if it were left to these organizations there would be no free-trade agreement” between Colombia and the United States (and, later, the European Union), thereby revealing the real priorities of the Uribe project (<italic>El Tiempo</italic>, March 26, 2008).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0094582X13492125">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>Philosophical Confusions and The Political Use of Human Rights</title>
<p>This social, cultural, and political rollback with respect to human rights was facilitated by philosophical confusions and criticisms perpetrated by certain academics and analysts in relation to human rights. To place these critiques and criticisms in context, it must be recalled that one of President Uribe’s principal aims was to establish a “negotiation” with the right-wing paramilitary groups, which necessitated the creation of an appropriate legal architecture and a favorable climate of public opinion. In 2003 a demobilization agreement was signed between the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia paramilitaries and the government. Academic consultants to the government were hired, and a discourse of “postconflict” reconciliation and reparation began to emerge that prepared public opinion for the creation of the National Commission for Reparation and Reconciliation in 2005. It is therefore easy to understand why criticism of human rights violations by both the government and the paramilitaries elicited strongly negative responses, as it threatened to tarnish the image of the Uribe administration’s long-term ideological and strategic project.</p>
<p>Following the publication of <italic>The Authoritarian Spell</italic>, Eduardo Pizarro Leongómez, then director of the Institute of Political Studies and International Relations at the National University (and subsequently director of the Uribe-installed National Commission for Reparation and Reconciliation), published an opinion piece in <italic>El Tiempo</italic> shortly after Uribe’s now infamous attack on Colombia’s human rights organizations. According to Pizarro, two main currents in the field of publicly prominent NGOs were coming to the fore: “on one side, those NGOs committed to peace and a negotiated solution to the conflict, which have assumed a moderate, responsible and balanced position. On the other side, the human rights NGOs that have adopted a radical, confrontational discourse of denunciation, condemning the state. A careful reading of the <italic>The Authoritarian Spell</italic> report leaves a nasty taste in the mouth” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0094582X13492125">Pizarro, 2003</xref>). Recognizing Uribe’s “mistake,” Pizarro went on:
<disp-quote>
<p>Without doubt, Álvaro Uribe Vélez made a mistake and in future public interventions he ought to change the tone of his comments and criticisms directed at NGOs. However, equally, the NGOs—in particular those oriented toward human rights—should undertake a deep internal reflection: hell is full of men of goodwill. The good they do on the one hand (protecting human rights) they take away with the other (radical, polarizing, and manipulative discourses).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These remarks traded on the prevalent “philosophical” but deeply ideological assertions about the Colombian human rights organizations’ approach, exemplified in a 2001 article published by Luís Alberto Restrepo titled “The Equivocal Dimensions of Human Rights in Colombia.” Restrepo claimed that “at least until 1989, public and private human rights organizations had not even questioned whether it was necessary to defend the rights of all Colombians, without regard to political ideology. Private human rights groups limited their actions to the defense of the rights of leaders of popular and leftist organizations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0094582X13492125">Restrepo, 2001</xref>: 103). Restrepo also repeated the widely held yet erroneous view that “in spite of Colombia’s special circumstances, private human rights organizations have defined the defense of human rights in a traditional and limited sense and completely ignored violations of citizens’ rights by the armed opposition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0094582X13492125">Restrepo, 2001</xref>: 109).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0094582X13492125">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>An ostensibly more sophisticated but ultimately no less ideological and emotivist critique of Colombian human rights organizations was made by the law professor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0094582X13492125">Iván Orozco (2005)</xref> in an important publication around the time that the Justice and Peace Law proposed for the paramilitary “negotiations” and demobilization was being promulgated. Orozco criticized the human rights organization Nunca Más for making too many demands in relation to standards of transitional justice, which he argued needed to be more “flexible” and lenient, less about retributive justice and more oriented toward reconciliation. For Orozco, these demands were related to the “moral epistemology” of Nunca Más, which he considered to be “burdened with the Platonic idea that moral principles are atemporal ‘essences’ that we ‘discover’ . . . and not contingent historical constructions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0094582X13492125">Orozco, 2005</xref>: 285). This he deemed “an error that may have grave implications for a country like Colombia, that may make impossible in the short term, or at least too costly, the transition to peace and the reliberalization of democracy.” Putting to one side the clear ideological elements of Orozco’s critique, we may legitimately ask (following MacIntyre): What is the status of Orozco’s own moral appeal? Moreover, if morality is no more than a series of contingent historical constructions, then we can of course simply construct a set of moral principles to justify any political project. It follows that the notion of morality as setting limits to political or any other human activity becomes unintelligible.</p>

<title>The Liberal Turn and Its Implications</title>
<p>These philosophical confusions and contortions in relation to human rights have to be read in terms of the historical context of important political and social changes both in Colombia and at the global level at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s. A decisive shift in the Colombian human rights landscape occurred in the years immediately following the historic change of the Constitution in 1991, which coincided with the optimism and flowering of liberal civil society in post–Soviet Union Europe. Colombian human rights activists played a significant role in rewriting the charter, which dramatically expanded the rights enshrined in the previous constitution and created new mechanisms through which citizens could claim the implementation of rights denied to them. The experience of the activists who engaged in lobbying the members of the Constituent Assembly translated into optimism about engaging with the state on issues of human rights and effecting social change “from within.” Perhaps inspired by this ostensibly more positive political climate, in 1992 an important group of some 50 Colombian intellectuals wrote an open letter to the leadership of the FARC, the largest guerrilla group that was not involved in the demobilization and peace talks that preceded the constitutional changes, condemning the armed struggle and urging the leadership to seek change through political means. In line with the emerging shift in positions among the Colombian human rights organizations, the intellectuals wrote: “Your war, understandable in the beginning, now goes against the tide of history. Kidnapping, coercion, forced contributions, which are today your most effective instruments, are all abominable violations of human rights. . . . Your war, gentlemen, lost its historical relevance some time ago” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X13492125">Bergquist, Peñaranda, and Sánchez, 2001</xref>: 214–215).</p>
<p>Whereas human rights were once appealed to by those who justified or sympathized with the guerrilla struggle, they were now seen to raise a moral barrier to the kind of action required by such struggle. The reference to history in the letter of the intellectuals is contradictory because it implies the irrelevance of history to the moral evaluation of the war and to moral evaluation generally.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0094582X13492125">10</xref></sup> “Historical relevance” appears to be measured by the “tide of history,” which, it is implied, is one of progress, rights, and civil society. It is hard not to see this particular moral judgment as the photographic negative of the historical determinist morality of Stalinism that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0094582X13492125">MacIntyre (1958–1959)</xref> so cogently critiques. The tide of history and the conception of human rights appealed to are reflections of a particular social order (the liberal, capitalist West), but they are ultimately arbitrary notions that stand outside of history. The guerrillas are condemned on the basis of “human rights,” which are held to be “relevant,” and in contrast their entire historical, social, and political trajectory is deemed irrelevant. Because the guerrillas are not marching in step with the “relevance” of liberal morality, their actions can simply be morally condemned. The question is why the so-called tide of history is more relevant than the actual and particular history of guerrilla struggle in Colombia in relation to any moral evaluation. MacIntyre provides the answer: The tide of history is simply the historical dominance of liberal, autonomous, arbitrary morality in which human rights, although embodying many profound human moral aspirations that have been formulated and discovered through social struggles for modern citizenship, are an increasingly arbitrary and abstract set of norms that are purposefully or inadvertently put to ideological use.</p>
<p>The differences within the Colombian human rights and social activist community over the scope and implications of human rights as a framework for analyzing and denouncing violence therefore reveal and are a reflection of social fissures and fragmentation. The continuously evolving nature of the conflict means that activists are constantly forced to rethink and reframe the categories and classifications they use for defining and denouncing violent acts. The debate over the appropriate classification of state and guerrilla violence in terms of the two different schemes of human rights and international humanitarian law is intricately bound up with historical, philosophical, and moral standpoints and frameworks.</p>
<p>These can of course shift. The debate within the Centro de Investigación y Educación Popular (Center for Research and Popular Education—CINEP) <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0094582X13492125">11</xref></sup> over how its database on political violence is to be analytically framed has shifted over the years. The former director Mauricio García Durán underlined that the debate would continue to have serious implications for the dynamics of the conflict and pointed as an example to the debate about “whether the blowing up of electricity pylons could be considered a legitimate act of war, which would mean it could not be classified as a violation of international humanitarian law, or vice versa” (interview, Bogotá, April 2008). This speaks directly to the normative problematic of the social sciences but in this case has particularly clear implications for the conflict, the kind of knowledge produced about it, the way this will affect many different people’s views, the way the state will react, etc.</p>
<p>Father Javier Giraldo of the Inter-Church Commission for Justice and Peace explained the differences in position between CINEP and Justice and Peace (which collaborated on the Noche y Niebla database on political violence), which centered on whether states alone were responsible for human rights abuses. He told me that the decision that only the state can violate human rights (in terms of political violence) and the guerrillas violate international humanitarian law “was very polemical. CINEP accepted it after a negotiation between the director of Justice and Peace and the director of CINEP, but it was imposed against the wishes of many researchers in CINEP, who did not accept it as an appropriate framework” (interview, Bogotá, May 2008). At one point the collaboration between the two organizations stopped because of irreconcilable differences in relation to characterizing and categorizing acts of violence. CINEP and Justice and Peace separated their databases and analyzed conflict data through their respective lenses. However, a rapprochement occurred after the intervention of a former head of CINEP, who argued that because the split had serious implications for the victims of violence the two sides ought to work out their differences and attempt to develop a shared analytic framework. This was gradually achieved, with Father Giraldo doing the bulk of the intellectual work on the model, but the fragility of the consensus is real.</p>
<p>Father Giraldo told me that the dispute tended to center on the notion of impartiality. There was a strong perception among many in CINEP that they had to take an impartial and “symmetrical” position in classifying and denouncing acts of political violence. Father Giraldo felt strongly that this was misleading and dangerous (interview, Bogotá, May 2008):
<disp-quote>
<p>The recourse to symmetry is very common in the intellectual community and the Church. During the time I worked as executive secretary of Justice and Peace I was subjected to intense pressure by my religious superiors to adopt a symmetrical position in the way Bishop Rivera did in El Salvador after the death of Bishop Romero. The guerrillas would commit two or three violent acts a week and the government three hundred, but he would choose three acts of the government’s and three of the guerrillas’ to achieve a total balance, which would always give the impression that there was a symmetrical violence, not a greater or lesser violence in which one was more legitimate than the other but one in which everything was equal. This was done in an artificial way to force the appearance of symmetry.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The view of international humanitarian law “as universal, egalitarian, and equidistant guidelines for judging violations and abuses of human rights of all actors in the conflict” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0094582X13492125">Orozco, 2005</xref>: 354) has generated debate related to the characterization of the conflict and the violence. The problem is that these supposedly egalitarian guidelines are abstracted from social and political contexts but inevitably formulated and used within particular social and political contexts and structures.</p>
<p>From a MacIntyrean perspective on ethics, this tendency might be connected to the liberal notion of morality as an autonomous realm of pure reason and of moral agency as expressed in abstract reflection on the rational precepts enjoined by morality as such rather than as embedded and embodied in particular historical, social, and cultural contexts and social relationships. In resonance with a MacIntyrean position, Father Giraldo said that many intellectuals who adopt the moral position of impartiality and symmetry do so at a great social distance from the concrete social milieus and struggles of those who are the objects of such moral evaluation: “They have a problem of conscience in that they are far removed from the people who suffer and yet they consider themselves upright and just in comparison to the rest who are the morally bad ones, who are ubiquitous; the good ones are those who coolly observe and take a symmetrical position, those who do not do this are the morally questionable ones” (interview, Bogotá, May 2008).</p>
<p>This desire for balance, impartiality, and symmetry is arguably connected with dominant liberal moral assumptions. The liberal view of the state as neutral and of the democratic political arena as having reached consensus on a moral position that condemns violence impartially is prevalent in the Colombian discussion (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0094582X13492125">Posada, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0094582X13492125">Villegas, 2008</xref>). Not only is this view philosophically and historically highly questionable but also it ignores the systematic role of the state in the conflict. Further, it presupposes a particular evaluative stance in relation to the dominant political and social order—a stance that, from a MacIntyrean perspective, must be called into question in terms of its rational justification.</p>

<title>A future for human rights? From Theory to Practice</title>
<p>The discourse of human rights at the international level is replete with tensions and contradictions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X13492125">Noam Chomsky (1997</xref>: 60) has pointed out, the commitments of international human rights organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are in practice “skewed in accord with Western standards. . . . The Human Rights groups say little about social and economic rights, generally adopting the highly biased Western perspective on these matters.” The case of Human Rights Watch’s biased analyses of the human rights situation in Venezuela is evidence that even respected international human rights organizations can succumb to partiality and ideologically driven distortion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X13492125">Emersberger, 2008</xref>). However, the Colombian situation and MacIntyre’s arguments reveal the inherent philosophical, normative ambiguities of human rights and the difficulty if not impossibility of rendering them an authoritative basis for moral judgment, political practice, and coexistence. When human rights are used to support opposing agendas, it seems that we are left without rational criteria for deciding between them. The challenge, if we are to avoid the use of manipulation and power in settling disputes and making decisions, is to reach a modicum of consensus on the scope and interpretation of human rights.</p>
<p>What future can human rights have in the Colombian context? If MacIntyre’s arguments are correct, then the problems with human rights stem from deeper problems with modern moral argument and moral philosophy. What is needed is participatory local community work toward the generation of some minimal social and political consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0094582X13492125">MacIntyre, 2006</xref>: 155). The liberal and discourse ethics paradigms cannot provide the basis for reaching such consensus because they are confined to an abstract, idealized, and emotivist level (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X13492125">Dussel, 1997</xref>). The alternative to the manipulative deployment of human rights language and abstract appeals to moral principle therefore lies in attempting to reconstruct moral discourse <italic>tout court</italic> through participatory social and political practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0094582X13492125">MacIntyre, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0094582X13492125">Solomon, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Rebuilding the Moral Imagination: Alternative Practices of Resistance and Change</title>
<p>The task is arduous and long-term and will no doubt elicit charges of “utopianism.” However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0094582X13492125">MacIntyre (2006</xref>: 145) notes, the standards and goals of participatory community politics are “not too often realized outside of Utopia, and only then . . . in flawed ways. But trying to live by Utopian standards is not Utopian, although it does involve a rejection of the economic goals of advanced capitalism.” Many Colombian communities and social movements indeed reject these economic goals, seeing them as incompatible with the defense of human rights. Yet there are also many ostensibly progressive civil society organizations that see no contradiction between neoliberal “free-trade” agreements and the protection of human rights. The need for some minimally shared interpretation of human rights in the Colombian context is revealed by this kind of radical disagreement.</p>
<p>I now turn to a brief exploration of one example of the kind of ethically and politically committed community processes through which alternative, more coherent moral-political languages, practices, and consensuses are emerging.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0094582X13492125">12</xref></sup> Colombia’s municipal constituent assemblies are spaces of participatory political practice that are breaking down old sectarian, clientelist modalities and developing an alternative ethical-political language.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0094582X13492125">13</xref></sup> The assemblies emerged in the late 1990s as community responses to the pressures of armed groups, corrupt political practices, and local development needs. Politically and philosophically they found their justification in the 1991 Constitution, which mandated public participation and asserted the sovereignty of the people. Based on the principle of social inclusion, they aimed to facilitate dialogue and the construction of consensus on development priorities and to bypass corrupt political networks based on clientelist practices. Because they emerged in the context of armed conflict, they had to take into account radical disagreement based on deep political and moral differences among members of the community, and this implied the construction of a shared moral-political language through practice.</p>
<p>The notion of developing a culture of respect for human rights was central to these processes. However, historic and ongoing conflict dynamics based on deep-rooted class struggle and antagonism had led to fundamental disagreements about the meaning and scope of human rights. In the case of Tarso municipal assembly (the second and arguably most important in the country), where former guerrillas influenced by liberation theology and the ideas of Paulo Freire decided to seek nonviolent social change, human rights were interpreted very differently by the collectivist peasant activists and the individualistic but “traditional” landowners. These differences continued to resonate throughout the assembly process, in which victims and victimizers, former oppressors and oppressed came together to work and dialogue for the first time. As Freire himself notes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X13492125">1996 [1970]</xref>: 31), oppressors occasionally reach a level of consciousness where they recognize their oppression of others, but this does not necessarily lead to genuine solidarity with the oppressed: “True solidarity with the oppressed means fighting at their side to transform the objective reality which has made them these ‘beings for another.’” Fighting at their side means seeing the world from their perspective, and this implies, to some significant extent, sharing a language and some conception of a common good, of justice and injustice. But, as Freire also points out, the concrete way of life of the former oppressor is literally a world apart from that of the (supposedly former) oppressed, and “any restriction on [their] way of life in the name of the rights of the community appears to the former oppressors as a profound violation of their individual rights” (39), which points precisely to the problem of conceptual incommensurability that MacIntyre highlights. In the case of Tarso, what this radical incommensurability amounted to, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0094582X13492125">David Marulanda (2004</xref>: 36) observes, was “a fragmented society, which limits the possibility of converging in common spaces to discuss things together as well as impeding the organized participation of the local community in the administration of public affairs.” The attempt to develop a participatory public and community culture represented a first attempt to overcome such fragmentation and to develop some shared moral-political language and referents.</p>
<p>Evidence from fieldwork there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X13492125">Chambers, 2010</xref>) suggests that there is consensus that political violence as a mode of seeking social change is not acceptable and that land injustice is one of the main roots of conflict. While the process in Tarso does not aim at a complete harmony of interests or a shared moral identity, it does embody an attempt to move toward a degree of harmony and collective identity by “cultivating the process of agreeing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X13492125">Cox, 1986</xref>: 12). From being a community only in name in which sedimented sectional, class, and political interests were predominant and “traditional” conceptions of order veiled these interests through an ideological appeal to “community” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0094582X13492125">Vélez, 2003</xref>), Tarso has slowly moved toward the construction of a more plural and critical understanding of community that attempts to evade the abstractions and corruptions of modern moral-political language and practice.</p>
<p>In the process of public participation and deliberation, implicit theories and explicit languages of social change, development, politics, and ethics were elaborated. While the constituent assembly process came with a more or less complete moral-political lexicon and conceptual framework elaborated within sectors of the peace movement and wider civil society, the process in Tarso added essential coherence and determinacy to it by developing further linguistic and conceptual resources in connection with its own specific social and cultural context. For example, the formal and legalistic emphasis on human rights drawn from the Constitution was supplemented by a deep awareness of social and economic rights. Political participation was understood to be meaningful and morally valid only if integrally linked to the satisfaction of material needs. Dominant conceptions of political legitimacy were also challenged, as were prevailing notions of power. Therefore, despite undoubted limitations and failings, the Tarso experience reveals the moral and political potential inherent in such alternative, local community practices of resistance and transformation.By facilitating the emergence of contextually rooted moral and political languages through shared political and social practice, the process in Tarso has contributed to the development of critical moral and political subjects who can better defend themselves from ideological and rhetorical manipulation. At the same time, it has contributed to the development of a healthier public political and ethical culture in which the protection of human rights can find fertile ground. This process and others are thereby reducing the ambiguities of human rights discourse and taking the lead in guiding Colombian society out of its moral crisis.</p>

<p>Alasdair MacIntyre is a Scottish philosopher whose book <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0094582X13492125"><italic>After Virtue</italic> (1985a)</xref> is widely recognized as a classic of twentieth-century moral philosophy. In it he develops a profound critique of the liberal philosophical tradition in relation to ethics and politics and posits the thesis that moral and political disagreements in modern Western society are interminable because of a fundamental, although largely unperceived, shift in the nature of morality and moral-political language.</p>

<p>Under the U.S.-led “Plan Colombia,” which President Uribe’s “democratic security” policy complemented, human rights were understood to be a “problem” both for paramilitary activity and for U.S. designs in the country (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0094582X13492125">Sanford, 2003</xref>: 4 and n. 11).</p>

<p>Despite the significant change in style, tone, and discourse of current president Juan Manuel Santos, who has skillfully managed to persuade the majority that he represents a progressive shift away from Uribismo in spite of his central role as defense minister under Uribe, the strategic and ideological deployment of human rights language remains much the same. As the Colombian ambassador Rodrigo Rivera recently stated in an address to the parliamentary subcommission of the European Parliament (<italic>El Colombiano</italic>, March 19, 2012), the FARC is “responsible for the majority of human rights and international humanitarian law violations in Colombia during the last 50 years.”</p>
