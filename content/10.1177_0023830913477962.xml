<p>In January of 2013, Tim Bunnell and Irene Vogel passed Editorship of <italic>Language and Speech</italic> to Joan Sereno and Michael Vitevitch. We would like to thank Tim and Irene for giving us the opportunity to serve our profession at a journal with such a respectable reputation—a reputation that Tim and Irene, as well as the previous editors, worked hard to establish and enhance, and a reputation we will strive to further strengthen.</p>
<p>The complexity of language and speech necessitates that many different approaches and methodologies be employed to fully understand these most human of cognitive abilities. We will continue to publish the best experimental and observational research on this highly interdisciplinary topic. We also welcome and encourage submissions using new methods, taking novel approaches, and examining emerging topics related to language and speech. We also hope to see an increased number of submissions from disciplines other than those traditionally represented in the journal to make <italic>Language and Speech</italic> the premier outlet for research that increases our understanding of the production, perception, processing, learning, use, and disorders of speech and language.</p>
<p>Although Michael Vitevitch and Joan Sereno will handle manuscripts submitted to the journal after January 2013, the 2013 volume of the journal will contain papers that had been accepted by Tim Bunnell and Irene Vogel. Also, a special issue, commissioned by Tim Bunnell and Irene Vogel, on <italic>Parsimony and Redundancy in Usage-Based Models of Linguistic Knowledge</italic> with Daniel Wiechmann, Elma Kerz, Neal Snider and Florian T. Jaeger as the Guest Editors will appear in 2014.</p>
<p>New submissions to <italic>Language and Speech</italic> should be made via the new Sage Track portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/las">http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/las</ext-link>). We are grateful that James Polikoff, the Editorial Manager under Tim and Irene, will remain with the journal to assist with the transition to the new editors and to the new manuscript management system.</p>
<p>We are also grateful that many of the Associate Editors have agreed to stay with the journal; their commitment to the journal made our decision to take on editorship of <italic>Language and Speech</italic> an easy one.</p>
