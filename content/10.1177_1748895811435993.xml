<abstract>
<p>Community safety has often been studied from an institutional perspective as an important adaptation to late modernity, or from a practice perspective as a set of professional activities that are of especial interest because they are developed across institutional boundaries, through partnerships. This article will introduce Wenger’s communities of practice perspective in order to demonstrate how both of these strands of research need to be understood together. Drawing upon an empirical study of the development and working of community safety partnerships in Scotland it will explore the ways in which professional identities and practices around the concept of community safety have been negotiated through practitioners’ participation in emergent communities of practice that need to be understood within the particular institutional, social and political contexts that frame them. It will be argued that to understand practice as ‘situated’ in Wenger’s terms is to acknowledge the dynamic and mutually constitutive relations that connect institutions and lived experience. Such an analysis suggests that there is much transformative potential in partnerships, and that theorizing on broad national and international trajectories of transformation needs to be tested through the study of locally negotiated practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Community safety emerged out of burgeoning interest in locally driven and preventatively focused approaches to the governance of crime, low-level disorder and security that, in the UK at least, had its roots in a broader set of partnership-based initiatives, including Safer Cities and Urban Regeneration, that had been developed throughout the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748895811435993">Crawford, 1998</xref>: 29–64; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748895811435993">Tilley, 2002</xref>: 15–19). It was, from the outset, understood to be an agenda that rested on the boundaries of existing institutionalized responses to such problems. It was not a self-evidently <italic>core</italic> police, social work, fire service or local authority problem, and did not quite resonate within the distinctive professional silos of these institutions. Instead, it was assumed that community safety was something that touched on all of their functions, and which would require their collaboration. Over the last 20 years or so this drive for institutional co-ordination and joint-working produced an extensive infrastructure of partnerships in a host of social policy areas (including things from offender management to health to parenting, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748895811435993">Cowell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748895811435993">Crawford, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1748895811435993">McNeill and Whyte, 2007</xref>) as well as community safety. This has been pronounced in the UK (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895811435993">Crawford, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748895811435993">Henry, 2009</xref>), but the appeal of the partnership approach to dealing with social problems has also been apparent throughout many countries in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748895811435993">Crawford, 2009</xref>: 15), and, for example, within Anglo-American conceptions of community policing that have, with varying degrees of success, been exported more broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748895811435993">Brogden and Nijhar, 2005</xref>). Partnerships have become widely accepted (at least in theory) mechanisms for implementing general policies and specific strategies around the world, and it is such partnerships, and their importance as newly minted institutional spaces, that are the focus of attention here.</p>
<p>There are two main strands of scholarly analysis of partnerships that this article will talk to. The first is the institutional strand. The forging of partnerships between organizations within and beyond the traditional criminal justice field has been identified as an important late modern recalibration of that field, one that is used to evidence the rise of preventative and actuarial rationalities within it, the responsibilization of local agencies and capacities and the fragmentation of state responses to crime and security issues more generally (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895811435993">Crawford, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748895811435993">Garland, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895811435993">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895811435993">Hughes, 2007</xref>). Put simply, community safety partnerships have often been examined as <italic>institutional adaptations</italic> to the social, political and cultural challenges posed by late modernity. On the other hand, community safety has also been identified as an emergent domain of professional practice. It has been studied as the <italic>everyday work and activity</italic> of a growing cadre of practitioners who face distinctive organizational and cultural challenges in light of their divergent institutional backgrounds and who draw upon, develop and nurture particular skills and working practices in this context (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748895811435993">Crawford, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895811435993">Crawford and Jones, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748895811435993">Edwards et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748895811435993">Hughes and Gilling, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748895811435993">Pearson et al., 1992</xref>). It will be argued that both of these strands of research benefit from being understood together, and that it is through understanding the negotiation of practice and professional identity as processes of situated learning bound within particular institutional contexts that their necessary interconnectedness becomes clear. I will begin with a brief discussion of how the institutional composition of the modern criminal justice system can be understood as having framed the practices and mentalities that have animated it at any given period in its development. As newly configured institutional spaces within this infrastructure this, at the very least, is suggestive of the transformative potential of community safety partnerships. Wenger’s communities of practice perspective will then be introduced as a framework through which to identify the specific mechanisms through which everyday practice and activity is continually negotiated around and within these spaces, both shaped by and in turn shaping them. The potential insights of the perspective will be elaborated and developed with reference to an empirical study of emergent practice in community safety partnerships. From this it will be concluded that community safety has transformative <italic>potential</italic>, but that this is fragile and needs to be understood and fostered through the study of locally negotiated practice.</p>

<title>Institutions Think about Crime</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748895811435993">Mary Douglas (1986)</xref> has shown how social institutions and conventions of various kinds (including language, culture, social structures and hierarchies, professions and philosophies) develop, nurture, sustain and underpin seemingly natural ways of thinking and reasoning at any given time. It is ideas that fit and find coherence with the prevailing ideas, categories and methodologies of social institutions that ‘count’ and which shape social practice and understanding of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748895811435993">1986</xref>: 90). For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748895811435993">Douglas (1986</xref>: 67), our abilities to interpret, classify and communicate are dependent on the existence of shared conventions and categories embedded within social institutions. Individuals ‘think’ through institutions. Through a series of diverse illustrations Douglas demonstrated how even those pursuits that apparently prize ‘individual’ thinking and creativity are only possible (and meaningful) because of the shared repositories of knowledge embedded and inscribed within social institutions. For example, we see institutions at play in prescribing the contours of what counts as ‘art’, what the appropriate tools and methods used to create it need to be and what the forms and locations through which it is displayed, performed or otherwise routinely experienced are (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748895811435993">Becker, 1982</xref>). Even the art of ‘mavericks’ is only comprehensible because of its reasonable fit with the institutionalized conventions of art worlds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748895811435993">Becker, 1982</xref>: 233–246). Institutions also underpin the interpretive supports and conventions of scientific communities, defining their spheres of interest, and the accepted methodological tools and resources through which they interpret and study the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895811435993">Fleck, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1748895811435993">Kuhn, 1996</xref>). Much the same can be said for communities of lawyers and the language, categories and accepted styles of reasoning that shape legal (as opposed to non-legal) forms of discourse and argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811435993">Cotterrell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811435993">Fish, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Douglas’ insights have explicitly shaped analyses of the institutional foundations (and transformations) of criminology and criminal justice, and how they have shaped the mentalities and rationalities that have framed mainstream discourse within the field (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748895811435993">Crawford, 1997</xref>: 94; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895811435993">Garland, 2000</xref>: 1). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895811435993">Garland (2000</xref>: 1) has argued that the emergence (or re-emergence) of criminological inquiry focused on the spatial and temporal locations of criminal events, evidenced by the increasing purchase of the situational crime prevention (SCP) perspective on both policy and scholarship from the 1980s onwards, amounted to an ‘epistemological break’ within traditional criminology that needed to be understood through an analysis of institutions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895811435993">Garland (2000</xref>: 2) showed how the term ‘criminal justice’ itself displayed the institutional trammels of the particular crime control institutions (police, courts, prisons) that had emerged and developed over the modern period, and through which responding to crime via investigation, legal process and the punishment and/or treatment of individual offenders had become the orthodox way of thinking and doing things. Rising crime rates, pessimistic social research findings on (actual and potential) system effectiveness and broader changes within both the social fabric and political and cultural discourses around issues of crime, justice and victimization would all begin to call the efficacy of this apparatus of crime control into question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895811435993">Crawford, 2007</xref>: 867–870; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748895811435993">Garland, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895811435993">2000</xref>: 11–14). The styles of thinking that underpinned SCP<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1748895811435993">1</xref></sup> and which had, in fact, been articulated prior to the modern era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895811435993">Garland, 2000</xref>: 3–8 uses Patrick Colquhoun’s work to illustrate this; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1748895811435993">Reiner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1748895811435993">Zedner, 2006</xref>) were only ‘remembered’, to use Douglas’s terminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748895811435993">1986</xref>: ch. 6) because they could now ‘fit’ coherently within the system’s institutional adaptations to the challenges of late modernity in general, and the declining primacy of the State in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748895811435993">Garland, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895811435993">2000</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895811435993">Hughes, 2007</xref>: 28–34).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1748895811435993">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The ways in which institutions have guided the parameters of criminological and criminal justice thinking more generally have also been demonstrated in historical accounts of the field. Although not always made explicit, the role of institutions was nonetheless apparent within, and threaded through, many analyses of the development of criminology in Britain in the twentieth century, good examples being those that were published as a special issue of the <italic>British Journal of Criminology</italic> in 1988 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748895811435993">Downes, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748895811435993">Garland, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895811435993">Martin, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748895811435993">Morris, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1748895811435993">Reiner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1748895811435993">Rock, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1748895811435993">Young, 1988</xref>). From its ‘psychiatric medico-legal’ beginnings in the 1930s, where it was understood as a useful and practical knowledge for classifying offenders and designing interventions and regimes appropriate to their needs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748895811435993">Garland, 1988</xref>: 3, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748895811435993">2002</xref>); to the emerging influence of European positivism as it gained an initial foothold in the academy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895811435993">Martin, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748895811435993">Morris, 1988</xref>); to its more formal institutionalization through the establishment of the Home Office Research Unit, the Cambridge Institute of Criminology, the <italic>British Journal of Delinquency</italic> (later the <italic>British Journal of Criminology</italic>) and the British Society of Criminology, all in the 1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748895811435993">Garland, 2002</xref>: 40; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895811435993">Martin, 1988</xref>: 42); and by its extension through the university expansions of the 1950s and 1970s, which would also cement its heart as being in the social and political sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748895811435993">Downes, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1748895811435993">Rock, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1748895811435993">Young, 1988</xref>) – the development and particular character of British criminology appeared, to a significant degree, to be a story about the changing places where criminology and criminal justice practice got done, by whom and within what institutional parameters.</p>
<p>The point of this discussion is not to suggest a simple history through which criminological thought, and the mentalities and practices of crime control, have been ‘determined’ by institutions. The account provided is a partial sketch only, and is recognized as such. Much more could, for example, have been said about the role of key individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895811435993">Garland, 2000</xref>: 10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811435993">Garland and Sparks, 2000</xref>: 8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895811435993">Martin, 1988</xref>: 35–39), or of the external social and political environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748895811435993">Garland, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895811435993">2001</xref>), or of criminology’s complex relationship with alternative discourses about crime and social order, over which it never had a monopoly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811435993">Garland and Sparks, 2000</xref>: 2–5). Rather, and more modestly, it is to note that institutional spaces <italic>do</italic> matter, and have mattered, in framing and underpinning the ways in which crime, justice, security and safety have been imagined. This being the case, reconfigurations of these institutional spaces, through the development of various kinds of cross institutional partnership, raise important questions about how the understanding of such issues may also, in turn, be reconfigured. Exploring these questions requires us to be mindful of both formal institutions and the negotiated everyday practices that animate, produce and reproduce them. It is to the latter set of processes, and how they might productively be characterized as situated learning in communities of practice, that I now turn.</p>

<title>Situated Learning in Communities of Practice</title>
<p>In order to provide a brief introduction to Wenger’s communities of practice perspective, that quickly illustrates its relevance to the study of community safety partnerships (as well as to the study of criminology and criminal justice organizations more generally) I will begin by distinguishing two interrelated facets of it: it is first, a relational social theory of learning, and it is second, a practical framework through which to study organizations and the management and negotiation of knowledge and practice within them. Each will be discussed in turn.</p>
<p>Wenger characterized his communities of practice perspective as being part of the Marxist tradition within social and political theory in which cognition was situated within particular social, political and cultural conditions, and in which practice was both produced by, and reproduced, those conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895811435993">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>: 38, 50). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811435993">Bauman (1973)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748895811435993">Bourdieu (1977)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1748895811435993">Giddens (1979)</xref> – all of whom also explored the interconnections between, or ‘duality’ of, structure and agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1748895811435993">Giddens, 1979</xref>: 5) – loom large in his account of the theoretical underpinnings of, and direct influences on, his work (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895811435993">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>: 49–52; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811435993">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 11–15). He expressed the relational character of his perspective in the following terms:
<disp-quote>
<p>(L)earning, thinking and knowing are relations among people in activity in, with, and arising from the socially and culturally structured world. This world is socially constituted; objective forms and systems of activity, on the one hand, and agents’ subjective and intersubjective understandings of them, on the other, mutually constitute both the world and its experienced forms. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895811435993">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>: 51)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Broad theoretical influences and orientations noted, the perspective also grew out of specific dissatisfaction with static theories of teaching and learning within education, and a critical preoccupation with apprenticeship (learning ‘in situ’) as a potential corrective to their limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895811435993">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>: 29–31, 39–42). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895811435993">Lave and Wenger (1991</xref>: 62–64) often found apprenticeship to have its own flaws in practice, studying it yielded some important lessons, most crucial of which was the centrality of learning to the human condition itself: that learning was a constant and everyday part of human participation with the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811435993">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 6–7); that it entailed membership (sometimes formal, sometimes informal) of social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895811435993">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>: 52–54; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811435993">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 3–9); and that it was bound up with people’s personal trajectories and histories as they forged new identities through becoming competent participants in all kinds of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895811435993">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>: 51–54; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811435993">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 215). For Lave and Wenger learning was not to be conflated with the classroom, the lecture theatre or even apprenticeships: it was a constant, necessary and ubiquitous feature of life and the situated historical trajectories and relations through which individuals negotiated it:
<disp-quote>
<p>(T)he situatedness of activity appeared to be anything but a simple empirical attribute of everyday activity … It implied emphasis on comprehensive understanding involving the whole person rather than ‘receiving’ a body of factual knowledge about the world; on activity in and with the world; and on the view that agent, activity, and the world mutually constitute each other. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895811435993">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>: 33)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It was primarily in his later work that Wenger sought to explore how his relational social learning perspective could be operationalized as a meaningful, and less abstract, framework through which to examine and unpack processes of learning, knowledge management and identity formation in the lived world. To this end he fleshed out his concept of communities of practice in the context of exploring how it could be applied to the study of organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811435993">Wenger, 1998</xref>; 241–262; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1748895811435993">Wenger and Snyder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748895811435993">Wenger et al., 2002</xref>). Here I will sketch out some of the dimensions of communities of practice as an analytical framework that emerged from this work. I will begin by unpacking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748895811435993">Wenger et al.’s (2002</xref>: 23–47) operational definition of communities of practice (as domain, community and practice) before examining the following dimensions of it as an analytical framework: designed and emergent structures; identification and negotiability; interstitial communities of practice; and boundaries and brokering.</p>

<p>Communities of practice are composed of three interlocking and mutually constitutive ‘structural elements’: domain, community and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748895811435993">Wenger et al., 2002</xref>: 23–47). The domain is the shared project or topic that marks out the boundaries of the enterprise that participants (the community) are engaged in focusing their activities upon. It is the endeavour that participants identify with, and which underpins their resolve and persistence in committing to the activities of the project (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748895811435993">Wenger et al., 2002</xref>: 28). The community of a community of practice refers to those who are engaged in the shared project articulated by the domain – who share a common commitment to it and identify themselves with the pursuit of its activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748895811435993">Wenger et al., 2002</xref>: 28–29). Not all members need to be as fully committed as others, as they will realign their membership over time, becoming fuller or more peripheral members as their commitment to the evolving domain also changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811435993">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 73–74). The practice of a community of practice is a little more complex, referring not only to its activities, but also to the repositories of shared knowledge, routines, short cuts and skill-sets that members construct and evolve through their collective efforts in pursuit of the domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748895811435993">Wenger et al., 2002</xref>: 29). Practice thus includes not only the things that a community of practice does, but also to the thinking and the collective values, ideas, tacit knowledge and methods that frame and give direction and meaning to what they do. The community understands, and makes sense of, the domain, and what ‘counts’ as appropriate activity in pursuance of it, through its practice.</p>
<p>Domain, community and practice should not be viewed separately as they are closely bound up with one another and reconstitute one another as the community of practice evolves. For example, although the scope and character of the domain will suggest the community that will identify with it, the practice that is negotiated by the community through its collective participation and engagement will in turn frame how the domain is understood, potentially recasting it in ways that reconfigure members’ commitment to the domain. It should not be assumed that ‘community safety’ itself, as a notoriously ambiguous and contested concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895811435993">Crawford, 2007</xref>: 889–893; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895811435993">Edwards and Hughes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895811435993">Hughes, 2007</xref>), necessarily characterizes the shared field of interest, or domain, of community safety partnerships, or indeed that ‘partnerships’ can be conflated with communities of practice. Community Safety Partnerships are better understood as institutional designs that do not define a domain or a community of practice, but which have provided institutional spaces in which multiple emergent communities of practice are necessarily negotiated, becoming inscribed within, across and through them (see later). It is to the importance of the distinction between institutional designs and emergent practice (in communities of practice) that I now turn.</p>

<title>Designed and emergent structures</title>
<p>Organizations are, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811435993">Wenger’s (1998</xref>: 244–246) analysis, made up of both designed and emergent structures. Designed structures include everything from the physical fabric of offices and work spaces to the formal policies and regulations that describe what they (ought to) do and how they (ought to) to it, including things like: job descriptions and systems of hierarchy; strategic documents; contracts; policy and action plans; health and safety regulations; time management systems; and accountability mechanisms. Emergent structures evolve within communities of practice as people interpret and orient their activity around the institutional designs of the organization. They are the working rules, routines and understandings through which the practice of the organization actually gets done. Although it is possible for institutional designs and emergent practices to be closely aligned with one another, where formal job descriptions and strategic action plans do actually describe what people do, they are never, for Wenger, identical. They are ‘different entities’, emergent practices forged through interaction and negotiation with institutional design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811435993">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 245). The distinction that needs to be made between what organizations purport to do, and what they do, in fact, do is well understood in the social sciences. In criminology we only need to look at the relationship between policing and legal rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895811435993">Dixon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1748895811435993">Smith, 1986</xref>), or actual court practice against the rhetoric of due process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895811435993">Blumberg, 1967</xref>) to remind ourselves of this. In any case it is clear that partnerships are new institutional designs and that there will, whatever form they may take, inevitably be emergent responses in relation to them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1748895811435993">
<title>Interstitial communities of practice</title>
<p>Interstitial communities of practice are more alluded to than developed by Wenger (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895811435993">Lave and Wenger, 1991</xref>: 41–42) but, as a particular species of misalignment between institutional design and emergent practice, they are important in the context of Community Safety Partnerships. Interstitial communities of practice are essentially those unintended communities of practice that occur where emergent practice becomes out of kilter with, or even contradictory to, the institutional design. Illustrations of what is meant here can be found in analyses of the sometimes unforeseen and unintended consequences of performance management, where targets of performance regimes skew practice away from professional objectives and goals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895811435993">Mike Hough’s (2007</xref>: 205) research into policing in London showed how inappropriately designed quantitative targets around specified categories of crime resulted in practice becoming narrowed around the targets rather than broader policing objectives, with officers expressing the view that: ‘Everything that can be valued can’t necessarily be measured but we’re now a police service that subscribes to the philosophy that what gets counted gets done.’ Similar forms of misalignment can be identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895811435993">Becker’s (1972</xref>: 91–94; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748895811435993">Becker et al., 1968</xref>) research on education where students aligned their practice towards ‘making the grade’ through developing strategic learning techniques (such as trying to predict exam questions) rather than, as teachers purportedly wanted them to, working to master the substantive content of subjects. Again, the point to reiterate is that communities of practice may not necessarily be in expected places in partnerships, or aligned to expected domains. This is especially the case, as we will see below, where much of the work of partnerships does seem to be connected with managing performance measures and auditing requirements, as well as ongoing pressure to secure new funding streams to support activity. These in themselves might become key domains of practice within Community Safety Partnerships that may, or may not, align with the principles and objectives of the enterprise.</p>

<sec id="section7-1748895811435993">
<title>Identification and negotiability</title>
<p>The sense of belonging and commitment that a community feels to a community of practice is, for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811435993">Wenger (1998</xref>: 188–213), shaped by a tension between what he calls identification and negotiability. Identification refers to the investment of self in the community, its domain and associations. Negotiability refers to the degree to which members have the capacity to shape what membership of a community of practice actually means. High levels of identification with a community of practice are indicative of strong levels of cohesiveness of and commitment to it. In organizations the status and perceived value of particular roles may affect levels of identification with it, personnel being less enthusiastic about defining themselves in terms of low status work. As partnership working is a role that has often been found to be at best marginal within member organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748895811435993">Crawford, 1997</xref>: 123–127) identification is a potential problem. However, the strength of identification with a role is also affected by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811435993">Wenger’s (1998</xref>: 248) field of negotiability, which describes the extent to which a community of practice can have an influence on (or can negotiate the contours of) its work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811435993">Wenger (1998</xref>: 248) argues that members of a community of practice will prioritize and focus their energies upon areas in which they feel that they can have an influence and be creative and productive. Where members develop a sense that their field of negotiability is narrow, and that they have little scope to influence and mould the direction and content their practice, they are less likely to have strong identification with a community of practice. Negotiability is thus about the community’s sense of ownership and control over what it means to be a member of a community of practice, and its capacity to do things in pursuance of it. Where identification, in the context of partnerships, draws us immediately to issues around the perceived or actual status of partnership working, negotiability draws attention to the capacity (or lack of) community safety practitioners to be inventive and active in refining what community safety practice is, what it does and how it connects with the practice of member agencies. It draws our attention to resources (economic, cultural, political and personal) and, of course, to issues of power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748895811435993">Crawford, 1997</xref>: 127–133; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895811435993">Crawford and Jones, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748895811435993">Pearson et al., 1992</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1748895811435993">
<title>Boundaries and brokering</title>
<p>Boundaries emerge between communities of practice as they ‘deepen’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811435993">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 253). The tacit knowledge, shared symbols, meanings and practices that build up among members create boundaries between them and non-members. Where communities of practice become highly specialized and technical (such as in IT departments, for example) this might make their discourse particularly incomprehensible to outsiders. However, for Wenger such boundaries are not insurmountable. Brokering across different communities of practice is natural and occurs all the time as we all negotiate multiple, overlapping ‘constellations’ of communities of practice within both our personal and professional lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811435993">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 126–133). In organizations it is precisely those intersections across the boundaries of deep communities of practice that can be the most productive, as innovations and ideas produced through the communities of practice in one department (say, research and development) are interpreted into (brokered) others (say, manufacturing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811435993">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 253–255; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748895811435993">Wenger et al., 2002</xref>: 153–154). Brokers make connections, and translate ideas, between different communities of practice. They need to be members of those communities of practice, but are unlikely to be full, deeply immersed members. Rather, they are likely to work on the periphery of different communities of practice, but may also evolve a community of practice around the brokering role itself (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811435993">Wenger, 1998</xref>: 108–110). Brokering is a key role through which constellations of communities of practice in organizations are joined up and given coherence. Within partnerships it is possible to locate brokering roles throughout the enterprise: such as where members broker between the partnership and their parent agencies; or where those with strategic roles broker the work of teams of practitioners developing initiatives on the ground. In fact, as I will argue below, it is quite possible to view partnership working as being all about brokering. Many community safety partnerships are served by seconded officers (usually from the local authority and/or the police) who work in the partnership for extended periods. In Scotland, these personnel were known as Designated Officers (broadly equivalent to Community Safety Managers in England and Wales; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748895811435993">Hughes and Gilling, 2004</xref>) and they generally had a long-term commitment to the partnership (up to three years) and worked to keep it moving: liaising between different partners; working with government and funding bodies; carrying out and reporting on audits and evaluations; minuting and organizing meetings; and co-ordinating activities with other partnership structures. Much of this work involved brokering across and between communities of practice.</p>
<p>This section has introduced Wenger’s communities of practice perspective, outlined its basic features, components and theoretical orientations and begun to illustrate its pertinence to the study of partnership working in general, and community safety partnerships in particular. As a relational social theory of learning it stresses the necessary intersections between, and duality of, institutional and interactionist accounts of partnerships, and as a practical framework for understanding the negotiation of practice within organizations it provides us with a set of conceptual tools for probing these processes more specifically – for identifying the mechanisms that facilitate and/or inhibit learning within partnerships and for characterizing the emergent professional identities and practices of community safety. The sections that follow draw upon findings from an empirical study of community safety partnerships to elaborate further on some of these discussions, in the process seeking to illustrate better the ways in which viewing partnerships through a communities of practice lens provides insight into the negotiation of professional practices and identities within them, their transformative potential, but also their fragility, and the impediments that face their development.</p>

<title>Situating Community Safety: Emergent Practice and Professional Identities in Communities of Practice</title>
<p>The fieldwork to be drawn on here was conducted as part of a study into the organization and structure of community safety partnerships in Scotland between 2000 and 2004. This was an important moment in community safety’s development because it was a period in which its formal status (as statutory or voluntary) was still a matter of debate, and in which approaches to funding it were in flux (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748895811435993">Henry, 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, community safety partnerships had formally been established throughout all 32 local authority areas by this time. The research involved some scoping of the national picture through analysis of official strategic documents and audit reports, interviews with Scottish Executive Community Safety Unit and Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (CoSLA) officials, and interviews with, and attendance at events organized by, the Scottish Local Authorities Community Safety (SLACS) forum,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1748895811435993">3</xref></sup> but it also involved detailed study of two local partnerships. They were selected, in part, because they were both perceived to be quite well developed, and had moved on from being partnerships on paper only (meaning that the actual experience of partnership working could be explored), but also because they covered quite distinctive geographic and demographic communities, one being primarily rural in character (Northside) and the other being largely urban (Centralside). This allowed regional differences in practice to become apparent and to be explored. Interviews were carried out with a diverse range of partners, from different agencies and at strategic and more ‘coal face’ levels, and some meetings and everyday activities were also observed. The fieldwork was not carried out continuously but its four year timeline did allow the research to reflect on the development of community safety partnerships over time, and how practitioners negotiated changes in personnel, organizational commitment, funding and performance regimes and the like, throughout the period studied. The particular institutional context and design of community safety in Scotland and the negotiation of emergent practices within them will form the bases for discussion of the data, with reflections on partnerships’ transformative potential forming the conclusion.</p>

<title>Situating partnerships: Institutions, contexts and the local</title>
<p>Developments in community safety in Scotland look very similar, but are by no means identical, to those in England and Wales (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748895811435993">Henry, 2009</xref>). This is unsurprising given that the social, political and institutional contexts in which they have been ‘embedded’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1748895811435993">Melossi, 2001</xref>) have long been recognized as having distinctive features, despite the superficial unity of the United Kingdom. The Scotland Act 1998, which provided for the establishment of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, did not create Scottish distinctiveness or autonomy, both of which had, by design, survived the 1707 Union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748895811435993">McCrone, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748895811435993">Paterson, 1994</xref>). Policy making and implementation remained, to a significant degree, locally autonomous and the preserve of policy elites and practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748895811435993">McAra, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748895811435993">Paterson, 1994</xref>). Of particular relevance to the present discussion, it is notable that the legal and criminal justice apparatus (along with education and religion) formally retained their own independent infrastructures: evidenced in relation to the latter through its system of public prosecution and criminal court hierarchy, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1748895811435993">Young, 1997</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811435993">Croall et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, by the 1960s some features of Scottish criminal justice, notably its youth justice system, were showing signs of a growing divergence from England, consolidating its welfarist rationale (in the form of the Children’s Hearings System) at the moment that this became most seriously under challenge south of the border (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748895811435993">McAra, 2004</xref>: 27–32). More generally, on a broad range of social and political indices – from expressions of national identity, voting patterns, party political affiliation, health and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748895811435993">McCrone, 2001</xref>) – Scotland was found to have a character that distinguished it from the other constituent nations of the UK. The same, of course, could have been said of those other nations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748895811435993">Edwards and Hughes (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895811435993">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748895811435993">2009</xref>), for example, have challenged the tendency within criminological scholarship to collapse Wales with England (as ‘England and Wales’), demonstrating how Wales also contained its own distinctive local institutional and political structures and traditions that were sedimented within the specific geo-histories in which community safety practice was imagined, negotiated and ‘invented’. In Scotland, the specific developments in partnership working, long apparent in the field of economic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748895811435993">Paterson, 1994</xref>: 117–123), were in many respects similar to those in both England and Wales, but would ultimately take a different turn and would see community safety being nested within a wider statutory framework for joining up public service co-ordination and delivery (called Community Planning, see later and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748895811435993">Cowell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748895811435993">Henry, 2009</xref>: 99–104), rather than within the crime reduction agenda of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895811435993">Crawford, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895811435993">Hughes, 2007</xref>). While differences should not be overstated, the basic point to be made here is that the situated institutional, political and social contexts in which practitioners throughout and within the constituent nations of the UK have had to negotiate community safety practice have <italic>all</italic> had their own distinctive features underlying the unifying mantra of ‘partnership working’ that <italic>has</italic> been similar to all.</p>

<sec id="section11-1748895811435993">
<title>Situating partnership working: Negotiating emergent practices</title>
<p>Given the constraints of space, it is impossible to provide an exhaustive overview of the fieldwork. However, the necessarily partial sketch that follows does specifically aim to provide illustrations that are evocative of some of the component features of communities of practice outlined earlier, and which demonstrate some intriguing differences in emergent practice both nationally, between Scotland and England, and regionally <italic>within</italic> Scotland. The discussion is organized around three overlapping themes: the contours of community safety; community safety as a valued enterprise; and partnerships as constellations of communities of practice.</p>
<p>There has long been contestation about the meaning of community safety and the contours of its scope and purview, which have been both relatively narrowly construed in terms of crime prevention and crime reduction (often, but not necessarily, of a situational stripe) and quite broadly articulated as being about ‘quality of life’ issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895811435993">Crawford, 2007</xref>: 889–893). Such debate is important when thinking about the potential of ‘community safety’ to act as a domain of practice that effectively marks out the parameters of a collective project, drawing in an interested community willing to commit to the pursuance of it. At one level the ambiguity of ‘community safety’ as a domain was seen by practitioners to be beneficial, in that a broad constituency of potential members could feel that they could identify with it: ‘Where community safety’s involved, and no matter what the project, we could all say “oh, I have an interest in that”’ (Council Services Partner). An open-textured conception of community safety was thus a means through which it could present a domain of practice that would be of interest to a broad community of potential members, unlike crime prevention and fear of crime that were understood to be of interest to all, but ultimately the primary responsibility and focus of the police. As a domain that could be understood in fairly broad terms, community safety was perceived to be effective at generating widespread identification: it got people round the table:
<disp-quote>
<p>Community safety can mean all things to all people and I think that yes we want to have a broader outlook on quality of life and maybe steer away from just focusing on crime and fear of crime … .although crime is an issue for us, it’s not the biggest issue, and we actually should be drawing on the strengths and good things that are actually going on, and trying to sustain them better. (Council Designated Community Safety Officer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although widely articulated by practitioners the emergent interest in ‘quality of life’ issues envisaged by this broad understanding of community safety rather glossed over the fact that much of the work of partnerships, including the strategies and initiatives that actually got developed and implemented under its auspices, were orientated around quite specific issues and objectives that in practice provided more meaningful domains around which communities of practice could coalesce (see below). However, when partnerships were made statutory in Scotland, through the Local Government (Scotland) Act 2003, it was in relation to a broader agenda of good public governance and quality of life, and not in relation to more specific agendas of crime prevention or reduction, as had been the case in England and Wales. There was something of a patchwork of partnerships in all three countries at this time, but through formalizing the partnership infrastructure in terms of Community Planning, designed to co-ordinate and manage other partnership agendas, including community safety (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748895811435993">Cowell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748895811435993">Henry, 2009</xref>: 100–101), rather than in terms of crime reduction as set out by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 in England and in Wales, policy makers in Scotland were, at least symbolically, striking a different note.</p>
<p>As well as being concluded in a slightly different way, the whole debate about whether partnerships should be made statutory at all went on for rather longer in Scotland. In 2000, with the statutory responsibility firmly established in England and Wales, Scottish practitioners in both sites tended to argue in favour of voluntary or exhortatory approaches to partnership working. They felt that such ‘organic’ collaborations tended to work better because they were built on genuine shared interests and commitments, rather than on perfunctory (interstitial) administrative responses to demands from on high:
<disp-quote>
<p>It (the partnership) works because it’s voluntary. Were that statutory it would simply become another political battlefield and would absorb all of its time in its battles rather than simply getting on with it. So I’ve absolutely no illusions about that – it has to be exhortatory and not statutory to make it work. (Enterprise Services Partner)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such a view seemed to be quite broadly held but it was not universal and once statutory obligations did come in, initially through Community Planning, but also through the later Antisocial Behaviour agenda being run through community safety partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748895811435993">Henry, 2009</xref>: 101–102) more and more practitioners felt that it had been beneficial, giving value and lending status to their work and professionalism, and driving out some of the ad hoc and piecemeal practice that had hitherto characterized a lot of partnership working in Scotland (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1748895811435993">Valentin, 1995</xref>). Statutory duties were thus seen as important if work was to be sustainable and ongoing:
<disp-quote>
<p>Perhaps through time we won’t need the statutory whip if you like … it’ll just be a natural occurrence for people to be thinking ‘who else can be involved in this project’ whatever it is they’re taking part in … statutory gives a bit more weight to us … and also, for some of the agencies out there, making it statutory also gives themselves more status because they’ve been brought into a process they’d been excluded from before. It recognizes their value. (Council Designated Officer)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thinking about the value of community safety as an enterprise brings identification and negotiability, and the tensions between them, to the fore. In Wenger’s terms, people are more likely to feel an affinity with a domain of practice, such that they will expend their efforts and energies in pursuance of it, if they believe that it is valued and worth identifying with. This identification will be stronger where practice is negotiable – where people have the resources and capacities to shape how it evolves through their engagement with it. In the context of partnerships, identification was complex and multi-faceted, both within the partnership and its constituent parts (from strategic groups to action teams), and between the partnership and the parent agencies and organizations from which its members were drawn. Particularly in the years just prior to the consolidation and attempted co-ordination of partnerships through Community Planning, many people working within them (particularly at the strategic level and those seconded to partnerships for extended periods) found themselves to be suffering from ‘forum fatigue’ as they attended, or engaged with, what seemed to them to be an ‘overwhelming patchwork of partnerships’. The early drive for partnerships of all kinds, and the ‘congestion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748895811435993">Cowell, 2010</xref>) that followed, was not conducive to fostering strong levels of identification with any of the specific agendas or domains. Indeed, some experienced practitioners in the study characterized the early years of partnership working as being about confusion, uncertainty and the negotiation of what partnership itself meant – asking themselves the question ‘how do we be partners?’ However, identification and practice did emerge around the idea of community safety and some more specific domains of practice embedded within it.</p>
<p>The simple decision to co-locate the seconded Designated Officers, for example, had important real and symbolic effects on the perceived value of community safety as a legitimate field of practice. In Northside Designated Officers were co-located in the Chief Executive’s office of the local council by the time that the fieldwork started. The very fact of co-location was viewed positively by all of the Designated Officers (from the council, the police and the fire service) concerned, in that it allowed them to work more closely with one another, at the same time giving the partnership between them (as individuals, and as representatives of different organizations) a real presence. That their co-location found them in the office of the Chief Executive added to its value, giving them a sense of ‘status’ and ‘credibility’, and that their work was recognized and legitimate. Had their co-location been in a basement office this would have sent out a rather different symbolic message that could have rather adversely affected their identification with, and commitment to, the project of community safety. Indeed, different decisions had been taken in Centralside, where co-location only occurred much later (and not in the Chief Executive’s office) after a period in which there had been a perceived ‘crisis’ in the partnership brought about by a series of movements of personnel in and out of the partnership in quick succession. In Centralside, designing the partnership around co-located Designated Officers was only latterly recognized as an important way of lending it greater coherence, and of signalling commitment to it.</p>
<p>Another key area where identification and negotiability were played out was in relation to funding and resources (and the performance regimes that were inevitably attached to them). Much existing research on partnership working has drawn attention to the inequalities (in terms of resources, personnel, experience and capacity) between members, and how these power differentials can result in partnerships being dominated by particularly charismatic individuals and/or by resource-rich organizations (such as the police) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748895811435993">Crawford, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895811435993">Crawford and Jones, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748895811435993">Pearson et al., 1992</xref>). Research in Northside and Centralside found similar themes at play, but also drew attention to how the funding of partnerships themselves could have profound effects on the emergent practices within them. Funding of community safety in Scotland has taken a number of different forms over the years. It was initially to be supported through the existing budgets of member agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1748895811435993">Scottish Executive, 1999</xref>), with additional funding being made available through more specific pots of Challenge Fund monies (CCTV in 1996 and Crime Prevention in 1999) that partnerships could tender for. This was controversial for some Designated Officers (who would generally be the ones writing tenders) as they were viewed as attempts by central government to ‘skew’ their activity towards crime prevention, whereas they felt that crime was not a key priority. Between 2002 and 2005 the Scottish Executive established a Community Safety Partnership Awards Scheme (CSPAS) in order to provide ‘core’ funding to support longer term approaches to community safety (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748895811435993">Scottish Executive, 2005</xref>). However, this approach was also found to ‘skew’ the work of partnerships and Designated Officers as it ran on an annual cycle and required a considerable amount of documentation to support the applications. Some Designated Officers argued that they were becoming more focused on the bureaucratic tasks of preparing an annual application than they were on thinking creatively and strategically about the development of locally relevant community safety interventions. In both cases (Challenge Funds and CSPAS) Wenger’s concept of interstitial communities of practice sounds a useful note of warning. Funding regimes and the ongoing need for resources to give partnerships some capacity to do things, and to forge a professional practice around community safety (negotiability), ran the risk of generating emergent communities of practice around the fulfilment of these managerial requirements, rather than substantive community safety work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895811435993">Becker, 1972</xref>: 91–94).</p>
<p>The final theme from the fieldwork that I would like to develop here has been threaded through all of the discussion so far: partnerships are ‘constellations’ of communities of practice; they are not a single community of practice. It has previously been noted that community safety was too open-textured and ambiguous a concept to be an effective domain around which people could organize activity, and that interstitial communities of practice around the short-term need for funding could characterize some work within partnerships. The fieldwork found that partners would identify with, and do work orientated around, more specific domains within community safety: domains that were often suggestive of a clearer set of aims and methods from the outset (e.g. working with CCTV, youth activities, wardens’ schemes, road safety initiatives) and upon which participants felt that they could realistically have an effect:
<disp-quote>
<p>Partnership work only works if people within the partnership want to play. So you’ve got to make it interesting and viable for them to do something – whether that’s business, or whether that’s the Council, or whether that’s the Police service, whether it’s individuals – they’ve got to see what’s in it for them. (Safe Cities Partner)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Communities of practice could also be identified within different parts of the partnership and provided a useful framework for thinking about the complex associations and networks that actually constituted them: from the strategic partnership meetings, to the activity of local teams of practitioners implementing initiatives, to the relationships between partnership members and their own organizations. Communities of practice could be seen as threaded through the fabric of partnerships, but they could perhaps be most usefully applied to the work of the seconded Designated Officers. They tended to have the longest affiliation with partnerships (formally for up to two years, but many were extended); they liaised between its different members; they developed, wrote and researched its strategies and funding applications; they carried out consultation and auditing exercises; they designed and in some cases implemented interventions; and they allocated funding to relevant projects. In Wenger’s terms they acted as ‘brokers’ between the constellation of communities of practice embedded within the partnership and through its intersections with other agencies. It was through the Designated Officers that there was a sustained identification with the project of community safety, and the development of important knowledges and skills around it. As brokers the Designated Officers might not have encapsulated all that there was about community safety practice, but they nonetheless remained key to their transformative potential.</p>

<title>Conclusions: The Transformative Potential of Community Safety?</title>
<p>The <italic>potential</italic> for partnerships to be transformative emerges from the earlier discussion of institutions. As newly forged institutional spaces cutting across pre-existing organizational boundaries, partnerships have created formally new contexts within which some of the work of safety and security gets done, and the contexts in which work gets done have been shown to have a bearing on <italic>how</italic> that work gets done (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895811435993">Garland, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748895811435993">2002</xref>). It has been argued that the mechanisms through which that potential might be realized, through learning and the situated negotiation of practice within these new institutional spaces, and within the specific embedded characteristics of local contexts, can usefully be teased apart through a communities of practice perspective. When looking forward, such a perspective also suggests, I will conclude, that there is room for both cautious optimism about the transformative potential of community safety, and for concern about its continuing institutional fragility.</p>
<p>On the optimistic side, years of informal and now formal partnership working do seem to have mainstreamed the very idea of it. Partnership has, for the moment, become tightly embedded within the fabric of public services and criminal justice in Scotland, and elsewhere. Community Planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748895811435993">Cowell, 2010</xref>), arrangements for the management of offenders in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1748895811435993">McNeill and Whyte, 2007</xref>) and government policy on community policing and community engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1748895811435993">Scottish Government, 2009</xref>) all provide examples of ongoing commitment to the ideal of partnerships. As officials populate, animate and broker these structures, moving within them and through them back to their parent agencies, a communities of practice perspective alerts us to how they might learn to think about such work as natural, possibly even coming to find the idea of institutional silos all but unthinkable. The idea that new institutional spaces might prompt a generational transformation in thinking was well articulated by a practitioner back in the early days of the fieldwork:
<disp-quote>
<p>I would like to think that as time rolls on and we recycle officers in each of the agencies … and in some cases people will move between agencies, and there are also conscious secondments … it will, in the course of time, mean we develop in Northside, probably elsewhere in Scotland as well, a cadre of staff who are used to working in this fashion. It’s half a generation away in public administration terms yet, it probably won’t happen in my lifetime, but it’s moving in that direction I think. (Northside Enterprise Partner)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the cautious side, a communities of practice perspective reminds us that areas of work have to be valued and/or resourced if people are to identify actively with them and maintain a commitment to them. It is through sustained engagement that deep communities of practice, containing rich knowledge and expertise, emerge and flourish. The SCSN attempts to mobilize communication and activity among Designated Officers that might continue to have this effect, but as the public funding crisis deepens and budgets are cut back (throughout the UK and elsewhere), the ongoing commitment to partnership becomes a pressing question. Partnerships might have created new institutional spaces, but they might yet be viewed as fragile, having not replaced the old ones which continue to be understood as the ‘core’ components of the system. Time will tell if partnerships can survive the retraction of their institutional members, or if the very idea has already been embedded as ‘core’ to those members. Whatever the outcome it will be borne out of the situated negotiation of practice in which institutions and everyday practices are interconnected and mutually constitutive. Outcomes might well vary, locally and regionally, and will usefully be tested through the study of locally negotiated practice.</p>

<p>A similar story can be told in relation to policing and its study where the institutional trammels of the State long resulted in a conflation between ‘policing’ and its state forms throughout much of the modern period (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1748895811435993">Reiner, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1748895811435993">Zedner, 2006</xref>).</p>
