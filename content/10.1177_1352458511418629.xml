<p><bold>Background:</bold> The frequency and impact of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) to interferon beta-1b (IFNβ-1b) on clinical and radiographic outcomes is controversial.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To assess NAb impact in the BEYOND study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> 2244 patients were randomized (2:2:1) to receive IFNβ-1b, either 250 or 500 µg, or glatiramer acetate, 20 mg, and observed for 2–3.5 years. NAb titers were determined every 6 months. A titer ≥20 NU/ml was considered NAb positive. Efficacy was compared between NAb-positive and NAb-negative patients, using comprehensive statistical analyses, taking into account the delayed appearance of NAbs, the time-dependent changes in the relapse rate, spontaneous reversions to NAb-negative status, NAb-titer level, and also adjusting for baseline factors.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> In the IFNβ-1b 250 µg group, NAb-positive titers were detected (≥ once) in 319 patients (37.0%); of these, 112 (35.1%) reverted to NAb-negative status. In the IFNβ-1b 500 µg group, 340 patients (40.7%) became NAb-positive and 119 (35.0%) reverted to NAb-negative status. In both IFNβ groups, especially the 250 µg arm, NAb-positive status was not associated with a convincing impact on any clinical outcome measure by any statistical analysis. By contrast, in both IFNβ groups, NAbs were associated with a very consistent deleterious impact on most MRI outcomes.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> There was a notable dissociation between the impact of NAbs on MRI and clinical outcomes. On MRI measures, the impact was consistent and convincing, whereas on clinical measures a negative impact of NAbs was not found. The basis for this clinico-radiographic paradox is unknown but it suggests that the relationship between NAbs and the therapeutic effects of IFNβ-1b is complex.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is currently treated with injectable proteins such as interferon beta (IFNβ). Other injected proteins such as erythropoietin, factor VIII and human insulin are often associated with the in vivo production of both binding antibodies (BAbs), and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) directed against the injected protein. It is, therefore, not surprising that a similar occurrence has been reported following the use of IFNβ in MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511418629">1</xref></sup>–<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511418629">11</xref></sup> NAbs against IFNβ usually appear 3–18 months after the start of therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511418629">12</xref></sup> although theyalso often disappear with continued therapy. This disappearance seems conspicuous with NAbs to IFNβ-1b, possible due to the greater proportion of low-titer NAbs in IFNβ-1b as compared to IFNβ-1a treated patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511418629">12</xref></sup>–<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511418629">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>NAbs can be measured using the viral cytopathic effect assay (CPE), which measures the ability of IFNβ to inhibit viral replication in ten-fold reduction units (TRU). Increasingly, however, NAbs are defined either by their ability to inhibit IFNβ-induced Myxovirus protein A (MxA) or MxA mRNA expression in vitro and by their ability to inhibit MxA induction in vivo (e.g. Pachner <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1352458511418629">17</xref></sup>). Regardless, these assays all determine NAbs based on their impact upon the anti-viral properties of IFNβ. Moreover, both CPE and MxA methods provide comparable information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511418629">13</xref></sup> Importantly, bioactivity measures (e.g. MxA expression) in response to IFNβ are highly variable, even at baseline prior to IFNβ exposure, and range from almost no induction to levels of induction orders of magnitude higher.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1352458511418629">18</xref></sup> In addition, these same authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511418629">19</xref></sup> have reported that ‘in contrast to the situation for absent or high NAb levels, the negative correlation of NAb titers with gene expression in the low/moderate range of NAb values (20–100 TRU) was not good’. Such poor correlations, necessarily, will dampen any enthusiasm for the potential use of MxA as surrogate biomarker for the clinical response to IFNβ. Although a good correlation does not necessarily make for a good surrogate, the converse (i.e. a poor correlation) will make the eventual establishment of surrogacy difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511418629">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a simple model, NAbs are thought to reduce or to abrogate the normal biological and treatment effects IFNβ by preventing it from effectively binding to its receptor and, thereby interfering with receptor activation and expression of IFNβ-inducible genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1352458511418629">21</xref></sup>–<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511418629">24</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the IFN system is complex. For example, any ligand attached to IFNβ, which alters the time on receptor or other binding characteristics, could potentially alter (or prevent) signaling. The affirmation of this potentiality is most obvious in the circumstances of the two natural ligands of the IFN cell-surface receptor (IFNAR). Both IFNα and IFNβ bind to this receptor and both activate the same JAK/STAT signaling pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1352458511418629">25</xref></sup> Despite these similarities, however, these two natural ligands produce distinct down-stream induction patterns. This difference in expression must be related to the manner in which these two ligands engage with IFNAR. Consequently, because IFNβ induces hundreds (possibly thousands) of different genes, the possibility that NAbs might impact some IFNβ-inducible proteins differently than others, must be entertained. Moreover, in the specific circumstance of IFNβ, where we do not even know which IFNβ effect is responsible for its therapeutic benefit (or even if this effect is receptor mediated), we need to exercise considerable caution. As noted previously, the validation of a surrogate is already challenging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511418629">20</xref></sup> The validation of a surrogate of a surrogate is even harder.</p>
<p>Moreover, because each molecule induces the expression of hundreds of proteins (in many different cell types), it is possible that a BAb in one context may be a NAb in another (and vice versa). Clearly, as a result of such complexity, the ultimate clinical and radiographic impact of NAbs will be very difficult to predict accurately based on theoretical considerations alone. Moreover, it is important to recognize that none of these surrogate measures (i.e. CPE positivity, MxA expression, MxA mRNA expression or MxA induction) have been validated as a surrogate outcome by generally accepted criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1352458511418629">20</xref></sup> Realistically, therefore, the impact of NAbs on the therapeutic benefits of IFNβ in MS can only be determined based on evidence from clinical observations.</p>
<p>Despite inconsistent clinical evidence from several randomized controlled trials (RCTs), surprisingly, there has still been a vigorous and heated debate about the potential impact of NAbs, both on short-term measures of therapeutic efficacy and on long-term patient outcome (e.g. Goodin <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511418629">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511418629">27</xref></sup> Goodin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1352458511418629">28</xref></sup> Farrell <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1352458511418629">29</xref></sup> Pachner,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458511418629">30</xref></sup> Polman <italic>et al</italic>.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1352458511418629">31</xref></sup> and Sørensen and Bertolotto<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458511418629">32</xref></sup>). This evidence includes studies showing that relapse activity is not different between NAb-<?tjl?>negative and NAb-positive patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511418629">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511418629">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511418629">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511418629">8</xref></sup> and, also, studies showing significant differences in outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511418629">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511418629">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511418629">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1352458511418629">33</xref></sup>–<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1352458511418629">37</xref></sup> Moreover, studies showing an impact of NAbs on disability as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) have been even less conclusive with only a small number of studies (using IFNβ-1a) suggesting any impact at all.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511418629">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1352458511418629">37</xref></sup> By contrast, the impact of NAbs on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)measures such as new T2 lesions and gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced lesions has been far more consistent and convincing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511418629">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1352458511418629">38</xref></sup> MRI is clearly a more sensitive measure of disease activity compared to relapse rate and, thus, in order to explain these apparent discrepancies, one suggestion has been that the clinical data are misleading because the available RCTs have been too short and involved too few NAb-positive subjects to detect reliably an impact on clinical measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458511418629">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458511418629">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1352458511418629">39</xref></sup> In this view, the negative impact of NAbs documented by MRI would also be apparent for clinical outcomes if we only had longer follow-up of more patients.</p>
<p>With regard to the need for more patients, two observational (non-randomized) studies stand out. The first studied almost 7000 patients who received free NAb testing in Europe, North America and Australia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1352458511418629">27</xref></sup> and the second studied almost 3000 patients from Sweden.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1352458511418629">40</xref></sup> Despite these very large sample sizes (and, thus, the considerable statistical power), neither study demonstrated any relationship between the presence of NAbs and a poor clinical outcome. Although Rot and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1352458511418629">40</xref></sup> suggest that the lack of an association between NAbs and clinical outcome is due to the unreliability of clinical measures, this reasoning is clearly circular. Indeed, this suggestion merely assumes that NAbs are deleterious without testing the hypothesis scientifically (i.e. if clinical attacks cannot show the relationship then, <italic>ipso facto</italic>, attacks are unreliable). Regardless, however, because MRI measures were not included, and because both studies had methodological limitations, neither is conclusive.</p>
<p>The Betaseron® Efficacy Yielding Outcomes of a New Dose (BEYOND) study was a prospectively designed RCT assessing the efficacy, tolerability and safety of IFNβ-1b 250 µg (the approved standard dose), IFNβ-1b 500 µg (an experimental dose) or glatiramer acetate (GA) in a large group of patients with relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) over a period of at least 2 years and up to 3.5 years. As such, this is the first study to provide an opportunity to assess the frequency of NAbs and their consequences on clinical and MRI outcomes in a very large number of NAb-positive patients randomized to receive IFNβ-1b. The results from a comprehensive statistical analysis of these data are reported here.</p>

<title>Study design</title>
<p>The BEYOND study was a randomized, parallel group, phase III study conducted across 198 centers in 26 countries worldwide. Details of the study design have been reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1352458511418629">41</xref></sup> A total of 2244 patients diagnosed with RRMS according to the McDonald criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1352458511418629">42</xref></sup> were enrolled into the study. Study participants, 18–55 years of age, had at least one relapse in the year prior to study and had a baseline EDSS score of 0.0–5.0.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1352458511418629">43</xref></sup> Patients were randomized to receive IFNβ-1b 500 µg subcutaneously (sc) every other day (eod), IFNβ-1b 250 µg sc eod, or GA 20 mg sc once daily in a 2:2:1 ratio. Patients were seen every 3 months for at least 2 years. Patients who were randomized early during the recruitment period continued to be followed every 3 months until the last patient had reached the 2-year study endpoint. MRI scans were obtained at baseline and annually thereafter. Outcome parameters included the clinical measures of time-to-first relapse, annualized relapse rate, time-to-confirmed EDSS progression (≥1.0 point compared to baseline) sustained for 3 months, and the MRI measures of Gd-enhanced lesions, new T2 lesions, and the change in volume from baseline to last available scan for Gd-enhanced, T2-weighted and T1-hypointense lesions.</p>
<p>Serum samples were taken at baseline and every 6 months thereafter and NAbs against IFNβ-1b were measured using the in vitro MxA induction assay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1352458511418629">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1352458511418629">45</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1352458511418629">
<title>Relapses</title>
<p>In the BEYOND study, a relapse was defined as a new or recurrent neurological abnormality that was separated by at least 30 days from the onset of the preceding event, lasting at least 24 h, and occurring without fever or infection. A neurological event was deemed as a relapse only if it was associated with an increase in EDSS (&gt; 0.5 point) or functional system scores (&gt; 1 point) — as determined by the blinded, evaluating physician — that was appropriate to the reported symptoms. Patients were seen within 7 days of relapse onset, if possible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1352458511418629">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Analyses were performed for the two IFNβ-1b groups separately including all data available; <italic>p</italic>-values reported are for two-sided tests.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1352458511418629">
<title>Definitions of NAb status</title>
<p>For all analyses, a titer level below 20 neutralizing units (NU) per ml was used as the cut-off for defining NAb-negative status. Titer levels higher than this were used to define different types of NAb-positive status. Thus, NAb-positive patients were categorized as having low (≥20–99 NU/ml), medium (≥100–399 NU/ml) or high (≥400 NU/ml) titers based on their NAb-titer levels. Patients were classified as ‘eventually NAb positive’ if, at some point during the study, they developed NAbs (defined as either ≥1 NAb-positive titer or ≥2 consecutive positive titers 6 months apart). These patients were further split into subgroups of low, medium and high positive NAb titers according to the highest titer observed during the study. Patients were classified as ‘always NAb negative’ if they never acquired NAb-positive status throughout the study period. In addition, for descriptive purposes, patients were defined as reverting to NAb-negative status if they became NAb negative after being NAb positive, and if they remained NAb negative thereafter. NAbs measured more than 30 days after the end of study medication were excluded from these analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1352458511418629">
<title>Assessment of the impact of NAbs on outcomes</title>
<p>The difference between the always NAb-negative subgroup and the eventually NAb-positive subgroup was evaluated by cross-sectional analyses. Because the NAb status of an individual patient may change over time, more detailed analyses compared NAb-negative time periods with NAb-positive time periods and with time periods of low, medium and high NAb titers. This was done by time-to-event analyses considering NAb status as a time-dependent covariate and by longitudinal analyses for repeated outcome measures. Results presented were derived from considering all switches between titer level categories (‘dynamic switching’) without requiring confirmation by a second titer. (Corresponding analyses using a ‘once positive, always positive’ definition of NAb status and, also, analyses requiring confirmation for switches between titer-level categories were undertaken separately and produced similar results; data on file.)</p>

<title>Cross-sectional analyses</title>
<p>Cross-sectional analyses were performed for the two subgroups of the ‘always NAb negative’ and ‘eventually NAb-positive’ patients (the latter subdivided according to titer level of low, medium, high). Time-to-event outcomes (time-to-first relapse, time-to-confirmed progression) were compared between the two subgroups using a log rank test. Relapse rates in patients with at least one positive NAb titer (low, medium or high) were compared with the same rate in patients who were ‘always NAb negative’ using a Poisson regression model. Because NAbs developed at various times during the first year, only relapse rates after the first year of study were considered. MRI outcomes in patients with at least one positive NAb titer were compared with the same outcomes in patients who were always NAb negative and with patients receiving GA using a non-parametric analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).</p>

<title>Time-to-event analyses considering NAb status as a time-dependent covariate</title>
<p>Time-to-event outcomes (time-to-first relapse, time-to-confirmed progression) were also analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard regression model that included NAb status as a time-dependent covariate. Other covariates considered in the model were age, gender, duration of disease, baseline EDSS, presence of Gd-enhanced lesions, baseline T2-lesion volume and occurrence of relapse prior to the study. In a first model, the hazards in NAb-positive time periods were compared to those in NAb-negative time periods (of both the ‘always NAb-negative’ subgroup and the ‘eventually NAb-positive’ subgroup). In a second model, time periods of low, medium or high positive NAb titers were compared to NAb-negative time periods (of both the ‘always NAb-negative’ subgroup and the ‘eventually NAb-positive’ subgroup). Hazard ratios (HR) estimates, together with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are provided to indicate if there is an increased risk associated with time periods of NAb-positive status.</p>

<sec id="section10-1352458511418629">
<title>Longitudinal analyses for repeated outcome measures</title>
<p>Longitudinal analyses were performed to explore the relationships between NAb status and the on-study clinical variables of relapse rate and mean EDSS change. Outcomes during NAb-negative time periods were compared to the same outcomes during NAb-<?tjl?>positive time periods and during periods of low, medium and high titers. Longitudinal analyses were based on the generalized estimating equations approach with an exchangeable correlation structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1352458511418629">46</xref></sup> Specifically, the generalized estimating equation extensions of log–binomial and ordinary regression were used to analyze the risk of a relapse beginning on any day during the study and the mean changes from baseline in EDSS scores. The statistical models included the possibility of linear trends in the measured responses over time. This time trend and the magnitude of any change associated with the switch from NAb-negative to NAb-positive status were estimated simultaneously in this model-based approach. Longitudinal analyses were carried out in all patients and in the ‘eventually NAb-positive’ subgroup on each IFNβ-1b arm. Analyses in all patients were considered primary unless there was a violation of the underlying model assumption that the ‘always NAb-negative’ patients had the same time trend and the same intercept as the ‘eventually NAb-positive’ patients during their NAb-negative periods. If either of these assumptions was violated (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.10), analyses restricted to the eventually NAb-positive subgroup were considered more appropriate.</p>

<sec id="section11-1352458511418629">
<title>Power</title>
<p>Although the BEYOND trial was relatively short in duration (up to 3.5 years), the large patient population ensured substantial power to detect the impact of NAbs on relapse-related outcomes. For example, in the longitudinal analysis comparing outcomes during NAb-positive and NAb-negative time periods for the ‘eventually NAb-positive’ subgroup on the 250 µg IFNβ-1b treatment arm, the estimated power (of a two-sided test at <italic>α</italic> = 0.05) to detect a 50% increase in the relapse risk (i.e. relative risk = 1.5) associated with the switch from NAb-negative to NAb-positive status was 83%; that in the corresponding analysis for all patients on the 250 µg IFNβ-1b treatment arm was 97%. The corresponding powers for the 500 µg IFNβ-1b treatment arm were marginally higher.</p>

<title>NAb characteristics</title>
<p>All patients were observed until the last patient visit. The mean time on study was 2.3 years. NAbs were measured in 861 of the IFNβ-1b 250 µg and 836 of the IFNβ-1b 500 µg treated patients. In the IFNβ-1b 250 µg group, NAb-positive titers (≥20 NU/ml) were detected at least once in 319 patients (37.0%); of these, 112 (35.1%) reverted to NAb-negative status.Similarly, in the IFNβ-1b 500 µg group, 340 patients (40.7%) became NAb positive and, of these, 119 (35.0%) reverted to NAb-negative status. The respective frequencies for patients reaching low (20–99 NU/ml), medium (100–399 NU/ml) or high titers (≥400 NU/ml) were 18.4%, 9.5%, and 9.2% for the IFNβ-1b 250 µg group and 17.5%, 9.2%, and 14.0% for the IFNβ-1b 500 µg group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511418629">Table 1</xref>). When reversion to NAb-negative status occurred, 86% of the time this took place in those individuals who never exceeded a low positive NAb-titer level (i.e. in 198 patients with peak low titers of 231 patients reverting to stable negative status in either dose group, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1352458511418629">Table 1</xref>).</p>

Somewhat larger and slightly more significant estimated effects were obtained when restricting the analysis to the eventually NAb-positive patients.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study represents the largest and most thorough assessment of the effect of NAbs in the clinical setting of an RCT ever published and, as such, it provides considerable insight to the potential impact that NAbs may (or may not) have in patients treated with IFNβ. Prior studies of NAbs in IFNβ-treated MS patients have typically included only a small number of subjects and, in general, have provided conflicting and inconsistent information, especially with respect to the potential impact of NAbs on clinical measures of outcome such as attack rate and physical disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511418629">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511418629">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511418629">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511418629">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511418629">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1352458511418629">47</xref></sup> By contrast, this earlier experience with the impact of NAbs has been much more consistent and convincing for radiographic measures of outcome such as the number of new T2 lesions and the T2-lesion volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1352458511418629">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1352458511418629">38</xref></sup> One early suggestion postulated to explain this apparent dissociation between clinical and radiographic outcomes has been that, because MRI detects many more events and, thus, has greater statistical power, MRI will more readily detect a deleterious effect of NAbs. Moreover, it is argued that NAbs take time to exert their negative impact. As a consequence, these clinical effects should be most pronounced after the first or second year of therapy and, in any short clinical trial (2 years), the effect might easily be missed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458511418629">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458511418629">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1352458511418629">39</xref></sup> By this logic, all that is needed to resolve this apparent clinical–radiological dissociation is to have larger groups of patients followed for longer periods of time. Remarkably, this view has not been supported by the data. For example, in the 5-year BENEFIT study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1352458511418629">48</xref></sup> there was no consistent impact of NAbs induced by IFNβ-1b on clinical outcome measures, despite demonstrating an unequivocal impact on radiographic measures. In the 16-year follow-up study from the original IFNβ-1b trial, despite demonstrating a robust treatment effect in delaying the time to several ‘hard’ disability outcomes (e.g. reaching secondary progressive MS, reaching an EDSS of 6.0 and requiring use of a wheelchair), the presence of NAbs (at any titer level and any degree of persistence) during the RCT had no relationship to (and no discernible impact on) long-term patient outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511418629">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1352458511418629">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present results underscore these earlier findings. Indeed, this is the largest cohort of MS patients ever reported (1745 patients treated with IFNβ-1b) and this cohort was followed prospectively for up to 3.5 years. Moreover, this study includes 659 patients who developed NAbs during the trial and, thus, had excellent statistical power. In addition, these patients were split randomly into two separate treatment groups of a standard approved and an experimental higher dose (each with excellent power) so that the consistency of any reported relationship could be readily determined. Nevertheless, despite these obvious and very important advantages, this study has failed to resolve the dissociation between clinical and MRI outcomes. Thus, after thorough statistical analyses, taking into account the delayed appearance of NAbs, the time-dependent changes in the relapse rate, spontaneous reversions to NAb-negative status, NAb-titer level, and also adjusting for baseline factors, the impact of NAbs on the clinical measures of time-to-first relapse, annualized relapse rate and EDSS progression were either inconsistent or non-existent. Even when marginally significant effects seemed to be present (especially in the experimental 500 µg treatment group), there was a notable inconsistency between the findings in the two IFNβ-1b groups. Finally, even analyses in patients with high titer, persistent NAbs, the very group in whom IFNβ-induced MxA expression is most predictably lost (e.g. Pachner et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1352458511418629">19</xref></sup>), still failed to demonstrate any consistent impact of NAbs on either clinical relapses or progression.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to this marked inconsistency in the clinical impact of NAbs on clinical measures, the impact of NAbs on the MRI measures of outcome was unequivocal. Thus, in both treatment groups of the present study, the impact of NAbs on the number of new T2 lesions and the T2-lesion volume is remarkably consistent, highly significant and showed a clear titer effect with a considerably greater impact on both of these measures being found with higher positive NAb titers. These findings are virtually identical to those reported earlier in the BENEFIT trial evaluating standard IFNβ-1b treatment in patients with a first event suggestive of MS. Thus, in the BENEFIT trial no effects of NAbs on clinical outcomes were observed despite the finding of a clear deleterious impact of NAbs on MRI outcomes using the same comprehensive statistical methodology employed in this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1352458511418629">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite this apparent affirmation of our findings by these other studies, it is still necessary to consider the possibility that the clinical results of the BEYOND trial are, in fact, nothing more than a Type II error. Although it is never possible to exclude completely such a possibility, the BEYOND trial has a huge advantage over other studies in this regard. Thus, the BEYOND included two independent groups (simultaneously randomized) for comparison and in addition, it has both clinical and MRI outcomes measured in the same two groups of patients. Because of these advantages, we can make some important inferences for the BEYOND results with respect to the likelihood of a Type II error. To begin, we note that, if relapses were sufficiently variable, one might easily envision the possibility that both groups might show a deleterious impact of NAbs but that neither comparison would have adequate power to achieve statistical significance. Importantly, however, these are not the circumstances of BEYOND trial results. Rather, both NAb-positive groups failed to show a consistent trend in the expected direction. Consequently, the problem is not of the lack of statistical power; the problem is the lack of any observed effect. Naturally, the lack of any observed effect could still be a Type II error if, for example, the two NAb-positive groups happened (by chance) to be non-representative. If this were the case, however, unlike the power argument (where both comparisons might lack significance for similar reasons), the random error (non-representative) explanation requires the simultaneous occurrence in BEYOND of two independent Type II errors. This seems very unlikely. In addition, and importantly, there was an unequivocal, and consistent, deleterious impact of NAbs on MRI outcomes in the same two NAb-positive groups. In this circumstance, it is extremely hard to make a case that both groups are, somehow, unrepresentative. Consequently, a Type II error seems to be excluded as an adequate explanation for the findings of BEYOND. Rather, it seems far more likely that the observed disassociation between clinical and MRI outcomes (found in each of two separate, randomized groups) is real.</p>
<p>One of the claims which has been made repeatedly during the debate over the clinical relevance of NAbs is that NAbs, especially in high titer, completely eliminate all biological responses to IFNβ (e.g. Pachner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1352458511418629">30</xref></sup> and Sørensen and Bertolotto<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1352458511418629">32</xref></sup>). In general, this claim has been made on the basis of only a very small sampling of the hundreds of known IFNβ-inducible genes or proteins. An exception to this general rule, however, is the study by Hesse and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1352458511418629">24</xref></sup>. This study examined potential IFNβ-induced transcription of 5593 genes in two patient groups; the first with NAbs ( &gt; 20 TRU) <italic>and</italic> with an absent MxA response to IFNβ and the second without NAbs <italic>and</italic> with a preserved MxA response to IFNβ. Using the false discovery rate method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1352458511418629">50</xref></sup> these authors reported no evidence of IFNβ-induced transcription in the NAb-positive group. Nevertheless, even assuming, for the sake of argument, that these authors’ applied the false discovery rate method in a valid manner (which they didn’t), this still could not explain the discrepancy we found between MRI and clinical outcomes in the BEYOND trial.</p>
<p>The reason for the observed dissociation between MRI and clinical measures remains unclear. Notably, such a dissociation in other contexts has been characterized as a ‘clinico-radiological paradox’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1352458511418629">51</xref></sup> and is presumably explained, at least in part, by the frequent occurrence of asymptomatic lesions seen on brain MRI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1352458511418629">52</xref></sup> Moreover, the use of recursive partitioning an stepwise regression analyses to define independent predictors of outcome, the 16-year follow-up of the original IFNβ-1b trial found no independent relationship of MRI measures obtained during the randomized clinical trial to long-term physical disability outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1352458511418629">53</xref></sup> By contrast, MRI measures of new T2 lesions and baseline T2-lesion volume were independent predictors of long-term cognitive outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1352458511418629">54</xref></sup> Such a finding, and the observed dissociation of clinical and radiological outcomes, might be taken to suggest that changes in brain MRI are related less to physical outcomes (relapses and EDSS) and related more to cognitive changes. Such a possibility might help to rationalize why brain lesions have such a high probability (&gt;90%) of being completely asymptomatic, both from the perspective of the patient and from that of the doctor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1352458511418629">52</xref></sup> Nevertheless, previous studies have also shown that MRI and relapse-related outcomes are generally correlated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1352458511418629">55</xref></sup>–<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1352458511418629">58</xref></sup> so that, at this point, any rationale for such a clear dissociation must be considered speculative.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reason for this dissociation, however, certain observations from this trial deserve emphasis. Even if one were to assume that NAbs do have a negative impact on the clinical response to IFNβ, the actual findings suggest that NAbs (regardless of titer) do not appear to completely abrogate this response. Thus, even though there was no placebo group in the trial, the fact that the difference in relapse rates between always NAb negative and eventually NAb-positive patients was less than 10% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1352458511418629">Table 3</xref>), suggests that a substantial amount of the therapeutic benefit of IFNβ-1b still remains, even in the presence of high positive NAb titers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1352458511418629">59</xref></sup> Moreover, even though there was an unequivocal deleterious impact of NAbs on MRI outcomes, NAb-positive patients, at least those with the low and medium positive NAb titers, had a very similar response to patients treated with GA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1352458511418629">Table 5</xref>). Because GA clearly has a favorable impact on MRI outcomes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1352458511418629">60</xref></sup> this observation also suggests that there is still an important residual benefit to IFNβ-1b therapy on MRI outcomes, despite the clearly negative impact of NAbs on these measures.</p>
<p>Taken together, all of these observations suggest that there is a very complex relationship between MxA-defined NAbs and the therapeutic benefits of IFNβ-1b. The fact that the relationship is weakest between the effect of IFNβ-1b on those clinical variables (relapses and physical disability) that have the strongest relationship to long-term outcome;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511418629">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1352458511418629">49</xref></sup> the fact that there seems to be a clear residual therapeutic benefit of IFNβ-1b on both clinical and radiological outcomes even when NAbs are present (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1352458511418629">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1352458511418629">5</xref>); the fact that the large majority of NAb-positive patients will revert to NAb-negative status over time;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511418629">12</xref></sup>–<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458511418629">16</xref></sup> and, finally, the fact that there is no apparent relationship between the presence or absence of NAbs (at any titer or at any degree of persistence) and the long-term physical or cognitive outcome of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1352458511418629">49</xref></sup> indicate that short-term treatment decisions for individuals should not be based solely on the unvalidated surrogate biomarker of CPE-defined or MxA-defined NAb-positive status. Rather, given this complexity, treatment decisions regarding IFNβ should be made in the context of the patient’s disease activity. Thus, if a patient is doing well on IFNβ therapy, they should be continued regardless of their NAb status. By contrast, if they are doing poorly, alternative therapy should be considered (again, regardless of their NAb status).</p>
