<p>Devine’s book is clearly one of the finest books on migrant children’s education to have come out in recent years. Though it is highly contextualized, focusing specifically on the Irish case, the insights it offers could benefit those studying other national contexts with similar immigration experiences (especially in the European context) as well as educators and policy makers who struggle to find productive ways for addressing the challenges posed by immigration. The fact that the book is highly contextualized is certainly one of its strengths because it allows the author to develop her argument by linking the particularities of the different levels involved from the individual to the institutional, the national and the global. This is certainly no easy task especially when one considers the dynamic interplay between these levels, something which Devine accomplishes with skill and conceptual clarity.</p>
<p>The book serves, in many ways, as an exploration of the cultural politics of education in the Republic of Ireland and of the means by which the educational system engages with difference and diversity. To provide a theoretical frame for her argument, Devine draws primarily on the work of Foucault and Bourdieu, expertly using the latter’s concepts of habitus, capital and field to describe the complex and dynamic interplay of forces which shape migrant children’s educational experiences in ways that inform the relationship between policy and practice.</p>
<p>The book provides a historical account of how schooling served as the basis for constructing a particular imaginary of the Irish nation marginalizing along the way all those deemed to be different from the Catholic majority. Devine provides a critical look at the contradictory implications of discourses of inclusion which despite their rhetoric end up segregating ‘immigrant’ from white, Catholic schools. Her aim is to understand the institutionalized practices and processes which normalize ways of understanding ‘self’ (as ‘normal’) and ‘other’ (as ‘not normal’) and how such processes create the larger framework which defines belonging, inclusion and exclusion in a country that has experienced in recent years a significant presence of ‘others’ in its midst.</p>
<p>The author devotes separate chapters to each of a number of key players in the educational process, namely, principals, teachers, parents and students. It is in these chapters that Devine’s argument about the dynamic and complex character of the phenomenon unfolds. She shows, convincingly, that it is individuals who respond but they do so within a larger context impacted by social, cultural, economic and political forces: one does not operate in a vacuum but the individual is neither at the mercy of the system. Thus, principals’ personal histories, including their own dispositions and understandings (both classed and racialized) and previous educational experiences, impact their leadership in practice as they find themselves negotiating different logics of practice framed by, among others, their school’s ethos and the social class and racial identities of the migrant children attending their schools.</p>
<p>The chapter devoted to teachers is particularly interesting because it highlights how the teachers’ situatedness as gendered, raced and classed individuals informs their understandings of what is ‘normal’ and what is ‘integration’, which in turn impacts their practice in the classroom. Devine problematizes teachers’ qualified acceptance of migrant children in their classrooms, which is based on assumptions about the productive contributions the latter are able to make, and the added value that their presence is likely to bring, to the classroom and the school at large. In practice, this might mean that middle-class migrant children are more likely to be ‘normalized’ and integrated because of their class background and their consequent productive capacity.</p>
<p>The chapter devoted to parents provides a critical look at the school–home engagement, focusing on how immigrant parents navigate their way through the Irish educational system by drawing upon the resources they have at their disposal. At one end, it is the parents’ own habitus coupled with their previous experiences of other educational systems which generates their engagement with the school. At the other end, it is what schools and teachers do (or fail to do); as Devine illustrates, simply welcoming parents to school does not in itself create an inclusive school but on the contrary, often ends up reproducing racialized and classed participation.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Devine completes her argument by focusing on children themselves. Her argument, not new to childhood studies scholars but perhaps still novel for many policy makers, is that migrant children are not at the mercy of educational forces but are rather actively involved and contribute to the ongoing processes of integration and accommodation at work. Most importantly, including children’s perspectives enriches our overall understanding of the factors at work. Migrant children’s view of diversity – that diversity is not something that should be recognized simply in relation to them as migrant children but rather a normative characteristic that should be addressed in relation to all school children’s educational experience – is a powerful indication of how migrant children understand and experience existing policy and practice which singles them out and <italic>only</italic> targets them in school.</p>
<p>One of the strengths of Devine’s argument is that the issue of immigration and schooling has as much to do with ‘us’ as with ‘them’ and that exposing the paternalistic attitudes which frame much policy and practice in relation to migrant children’s education goes a long way in understanding ‘our’ role and responsibility in all this. Though she admits that the educational process is messy, Devine argues that this very process involves both reproduction and production, both the potential for consolidating inequalities and social injustice as well as the potential for empowerment, gain and social justice. I choose to take this as a kind of ‘reserved optimism’ about the future, which is as good as one could get these days from attempts to address the challenges of immigration and schooling globally.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this book to scholars and students of education and immigration and those in childhood studies who want to find a refreshingly productive and nuanced analysis of the effects of schooling on migrant children’s lives in our times.</p>
