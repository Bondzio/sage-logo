This locally produced BNP inhibits the contraction of the human myometrium, contributing to the maintenance of myometrial quiescence during pregnancy. We tested the hypothesis that BNP production is increased by fetal membrane stretching, which is predicted to occur in the expanding uterus, and inhibited by epidermal growth factor (EGF), whose production in the fetal membranes increases in late pregnancy. Term fetal membranes were obtained during elective cesarean delivery before labor. Sections of membranes were placed in an isolated chamber containing DMEM: F12 medium (37°C) and stretched with a 35 g weight. Medium and tissue samples were collected at 0, 3, 6, 18, and 24 hours for measurement of messenger RNA (mRNA) and BNP levels in the presence/absence of EGF (2 × 10<sup>−9 </sup>mol/L). Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and β-actin were also evaluated to discard a nonspecific effect of mechanical stretch on protein expression. We found that amnion and chorion stretching increased the BNP mRNA (reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) and protein (radioimmunosorbent assay [RIA]) levels from 18 hours onward. The effect of stretching was inhibited by EGF (2 × 10<sup>−9</sup> mol/L). Stretch did not increase iNOS or β-actin protein levels. We concluded that chorion and amnion stretching may increase BNP expression in the fetal membranes during pregnancy, while increasing biological activity of EGF may decrease BNP production in the chorion and amnion late in pregnancy. We postulate BNP is an important regulator of myometrial contractility during pregnancy, and its production is modulated by both stretch and progressive increase in EGF levels during pregnancy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>fetal membranes</kwd><kwd>brain natriuretic peptide</kwd><kwd>pregnancy</kwd><kwd>women/humans</kwd><kwd>myometrial quiescence</kwd><kwd>mechanical stretching</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-1933719112459219"><title>Introduction</title><p>The precise regulation of gestational length is crucial for a healthy neonatal outcome.

Women were included only after providing informed consent. Placentas were obtained prior to the onset of labor from women undergoing elective cesarean delivery at term for obstetric indications (eg, breech presentation, previous cesarean section). Fetal membranes (chorion and amnion) were excised. The amnion was carefully separated from the choriodecidual membrane by gentle traction, and the decidua was scraped from the chorion. The chorion and amnion were separately maintained at 4°C in oxygenated Kreb buffer until used later the same day.</p></sec><sec id="section4-1933719112459219"><title>Isolated Membrane Chamber Preparation</title><p>To stretch amnion and chorion samples, the amnion and chorion derived from the same patient were cut into 6 cm × 2 cm pieces.

The pH was measured every 6 hours and maintained at 7.42; if altered, the medium was replaced by fresh DMEM:F12 (37°C). The 2 ends of the submerged membrane were attached to a nondistensible thread, and stretch was applied by hanging a lead cube (35 g weight) from each end to generate a force of 0.343 N. The setup created a pulley device with the thread at the chamber wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1933719112459219">Figure 1</xref>). In exploratory experiments, we used different lead cubes. Hanging a lead cube larger than 50 g resulted in the rupture of the tissue, whereas a weight lower than 25 g did not produce changes in BNP expression (data not shown).
