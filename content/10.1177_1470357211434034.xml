<p>Based on frequent discussions with fellow anthropology graduate students in the United States and England, I can confidently assert that many of my generation are offered a history of anthropology where Clifford and Marcus’ <italic>Writing Culture</italic>, a text that recently celebrated its 25th anniversary, is widely accepted as an authoritative text, possibly the last universally accepted member of the anthropology cannon. Much like Bronislaw Malinowski’s <italic>Argonauts of the Western Pacific</italic> and Clifford Geertz’s <italic>The Interpretation of Cultures</italic>, this book is presented by teachers and accepted by students as a pivotal text for understanding the development of anthropological theory and its reflexive turn at the end of the 20th century.</p>
<p>While other canonical texts, like Malinowski’s <italic>Argonauts</italic> and Evans-Pritchard’s <italic>The Nuer</italic> offer blueprints for how to study and write positivist assessments, <italic>Writing Culture</italic> is less interested in product than process. The collected essays highlight the constructed nature of anthropological knowledge, the unspoken and unconscious biases that, according to the authors, mar practically all earlier anthropological writing. For a diseased discipline, reflexivity is the only prescription. Biases can only be rectified when authors turn inward and consider more critically their own position vis-à-vis subjects and larger institutional powers. Professors present the book to current graduate students as constituting the moment a critical rupture occurred in anthropological writing, one that heralded the rise of post-modern approaches.</p>
<p>I should have been more skeptical of this historiography; that’s the precise lesson of <italic>Writing Culture</italic>. I became aware of the flaws of this narrative through the work of Barbara Myerhoff and her film <italic>In Her Own Time.</italic> This 1985 film, released one year before the publication of <italic>Writing Culture</italic>, focuses on Myerhoff and her attempts to fight the breast cancer that ultimately killed her before the completion of the film. To combat the illness, she engages in a variety of curative Jewish rituals. Over the course of the film we see Myerhoff, an avowedly secular woman, become increasingly sympathetic to the rigid rule-bound system that comprises Orthodox Judaism, praising its ability to provide its adherents with two vital human needs: community and spirituality. By the end of the film, she states to the camera that while she cannot imagine taking upon herself an Orthodox lifestyle, she is certain that its rituals will play a role in her future behavior: ‘I’ll never be the same after doing this work. I will never want to lead a life where I’ll have to do without those things again’. She died two weeks after making this declaration.</p>
<p>By focusing on Myerhoff’s attempts to both cure her cancer and understand the behavior of her co-religionists, the film is the epitome of reflexivity. This reflects Myerhoff’s larger intellectual interests. Beginning in the 1970s, Myerhoff was one of the first anthropologists to study their own ethnic community. Her most famous book, <italic>Number Our Days</italic>, focused on a Jewish retirement community in Venice Beach. At the beginning of the book, she writes that she chose to study this community because ‘I would be a little old Jewish lady one day; thus it was essential for me to learn what the condition was like, in all its particulars’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357211434034">Myerhoff, 1978</xref>: 19). She also made a filmic depiction of this topic, a movie also called <italic>Number Our Days</italic>, that won an Oscar for best short-subject documentary.</p>
<p>Myerhoff wrote that she developed her reflexive outlook as a child. The combination of an unhappy childhood and a long illness led her to daydream, stare at items upside down, and see the inverted world as ‘a Platonic shadow of the real world that I inhabited’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357211434034">Myerhoff, 1992</xref>: 337). She helped form the Center for Visual Anthropology at USC in the late 1970s, a department whose ethnographic films offer some of the first substantial critiques of Enlightenment thinking in filmic form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357211434034">Lutkehaus and Cool, 1999</xref>: 435). Beyond pushing the boundaries of content, Myerhoff pushed the boundaries of form, as she taught a workshop in the NYU Department of Performance Studies that required students to compile and perform life histories.</p>
<p>While Myerhoff’s first movie is the better-known film, her second documentary is more emotionally compelling. In part, this is simply because of the subject matter. Watching a woman slowly die on film while desperately trying any method to save herself is both tragic and gripping. In less than 60 minutes, we watch this mother of two slowly lose weight, weaken, and wear away. The movie also works because of, not in spite of, its intensely reflexive nature. While anthropology’s reflexive turn has helped it begin to correct many of the oversights that plagued it throughout the 20th century, it also has, unfortunately, led many authors and filmmakers to create solipsistic and boring works, assuming that merely gazing inward somehow magically results in films and books that are both revelatory and riveting, when, in fact, they are neither. To better understand why this 26-year-old movie still proves effective, we should examine the various ways Myerhoff employs her reflexive gaze. Throughout <italic>In Her Own Time</italic>, Myerhoff pushes the capacity of reflexivity to become a mode of understanding. She uses it in three main ways: reflexivity as locus, reflexivity as method, and reflexivity as theory.</p>
<p>Firstly, reflexivity frames the film’s locus; the movie is about her. This choice was made for purely practical reasons. Myerhoff had been studying the ultra-Orthodox Jews in Los Angeles’ Fairfax neighborhood for several years, but cancer changed her plans. She says in the film’s second scene: ‘I hoped for the kind of professional distance that every social scientist wants to bring to the subject but to do anything except something that touched my own life was time I didn’t have’. By focusing on herself, she collapses the distinction between emic and etic. Her understandings are the insights of both subject and scholar. In 1982, during the dedication of a Jewish community center, she told the assembled crowds that she wanted to study Jews ‘so that I could produce a study that was not merely a scientific report but something with my own emotions as well as mind at work, something that would involve my own identity, and the Jewish identity of those I would work with’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357211434034">Myerhoff, 1992</xref>: xiii). Making herself the subject makes more readily available emotional understandings that no longer need to be filtered through the rational speech of a subject.</p>
<p>Secondly, reflexivity becomes her method. She studies this community and the role of religion by concentrating on behavior and rituals performed specifically for her. Throughout the film, she carries out Jewish rituals with curative powers such as visiting a <italic>mikvah</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470357211434034">1</xref></sup> changing her name, writing a letter to the leader of the Lubavitch hassidic sect, and performing a religious divorce years after she had divorced her husband according to civil law. Without this reflexive method, she might very well never have observed and experienced these practices. Some of these rituals are not commonly practiced even within Orthodox circles, such as name changing, and she would have had a hard time gaining access to these rituals had she not been a participant.</p>
<p>Finally, her reflexivity provides understanding and lets her add a theoretical analysis to the film. At the end of the movie, she explains that her experiences have led her to discover that an important parallel exists between herself and the religious community she is not willing to fully join. In the film, we quite clearly see the physically debilitating effects of cancer on Myerhoff. She tells us: ‘I can’t walk the way I did, eat, breathe, mother my children the way I did’. However, rather than viewing this change as purely incapacitating, she adds: ‘I have some choice still, some days more than others, as to whether I sees those as restrictions or doorways to other possibilities’. She explains that this parallels the religious lifestyles she has encountered. Rather than serving as restrictions, these laws enable their adherents to add rather than subtract from human experience, for this particularistic lifestyle manages to offer its practitioners two vital human needs: spirituality and community.</p>
<p>Perhaps the overriding reason Myerhoff’s reflexivity manages to lead to a compelling film is because she rarely makes mention of it. It is both overt, as the movie is about her illness, and subtle, as she does not constantly feel a need to explicitly remind the viewer of her reflexive process. This subtlety naturalizes her inward gaze, masking the rather audacious character of this seemingly standard documentary. Unlike many of the post-<italic>Writing Culture</italic> texts, she does not focus on the process of reflexivity, but instead, uses it as a mode for simply creating a powerful film. At the end of her movie, commenting on the lessons learned from her Orthodox interlocutors, Myerhoff states that ‘If I can take what they have shown me and pass that through me and out into the world, then my work is done’. By providing us with a stellar example of a successful reflexive work, Myerhoff succeeds in this task.</p>
