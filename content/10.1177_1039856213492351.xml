<sec id="section1-1039856213492351">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>The aim of the study was to evaluate a novel outdoor adventure camping program for individuals with mental illness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1039856213492351">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>The program was developed by YMCA Victoria in partnership with Sport and Recreation Victoria, and mental health service agencies. Orygen Youth Health Research Centre conducted the program evaluation. One hundred and eight individuals from mental health services across Victoria participated in 12 camps. Five camps targeted young people between the ages of 18 and 25 years. Seven camps were run for adults 26 years and older. Participants were assessed at baseline, end of camp, and four weeks following the camp in terms of self-esteem, mastery, and social connectedness. Quality of life was assessed at baseline and four weeks post-camp.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1039856213492351">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Participants demonstrated significant improvements in mastery, self-esteem and social connectedness from baseline to end of the camp; however, these improvements were not sustained by the four-week follow-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1039856213492351">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>We have demonstrated that utilizing the expertise of mental health services and a community recreation provider can benefit individuals experiencing mental illness. More research is required with respect to how to sustain these benefits over the longer term.</p>

<p>Psychopharmacology advances improve symptom outcomes for individuals with mental illness; however, functioning often remains impaired. Social isolation, common in individuals with mental illness, is also associated with poorer mental and physical health in the longer term.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213492351">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Alternative treatment models, such as adventure therapy, encourage social and practical engagement to increase functionality, and provide promise as an adjunct to traditional therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213492351">2</xref></sup> Adventure therapy has been used for individuals with a range of mental health issues including delinquency,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213492351">3</xref></sup> depression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213492351">4</xref></sup> and psychosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213492351">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Adventure therapy involves intentional and facilitated use of tools to guide personal change towards desired therapeutic goals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213492351">6</xref></sup> Camping programs are one type of adventure therapy, with the philosophy of ‘learning by doing’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213492351">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Adventure therapies significantly increase participants’ self-esteem, self-confidence, and a shift towards an internal locus of control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213492351">8</xref></sup> They especially benefit individuals who are withdrawn and have difficulty maintaining social connections. Improvements in anxiety and depression have also been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213492351">9</xref></sup> Such factors have positive influences on rehabilitation outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213492351">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Methodological issues associated with the evaluation of adventure therapy programs include variance in camp programs, small sample sizes, lack of control groups, and absence of standardized assessment tools. Research evaluating the effectiveness of camping programs for individuals with mental illness is sparse.</p>
<p>Following a 2002 review, Sport and Recreation Victoria (SRV), a State Government department, highlighted the inequities experienced by people with mental illness to community run camping and outdoor recreation opportunities. Working with YMCA Victoria, SRV initiated and funded the development of the Mental Health Access and Participation and Industry Mentoring Project, or ‘Journey to Strength’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213492351">11</xref></sup> YMCA Victoria, government representatives, and mental health and community agencies were involved in the planning and development of a four-day camping program with the aim of enabling participants to develop a positive identity, improve social competencies and broaden supportive relationships.</p>
<p>Here we present the results of the program evaluation. It was hypothesized that over the course of the camp and at the four-week follow-up, participation in the program would result in: (a) higher self-esteem and mastery; (b) improved social and occupational functioning; (c) reduced social withdrawal/isolation through encouraging peer support, self-esteem and confidence; and (d) enhanced quality of life (QoL).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section6-1039856213492351">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Clients from nine mental health services across Victoria participated in 12 camps. Five camps were for individuals between the ages of 18 and 25 years; the ‘STEPS’ camps. Seven camps were run for adults with mental illness aged 26 years and older; the ‘HORIZONS’ camps. Whilst the ‘STEPS’ and ‘HORIZONS’ camps were targeting different age groups, the planning and implementation process was very similar for each.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213492351">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Inclusion criteria included a stable mental state, and no risk of harm to self or to others. Informed consent was gathered from all participants, and the study was approved by various institutional ethics committees.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1039856213492351">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Orygen Youth Health Research Centre (OYHRC) conducted the evaluation of the camping program. The evaluation had two goals: (1) to determine the impact of camp participation on self-esteem, mastery, social competence, and QoL in people with mental illness; and (2) to capture participants’ experiences of the program.</p>
<p>A questionnaire battery was administered at baseline (two weeks prior to camp), last day of camp, and approximately four weeks post-camp. A Camp Evaluation Questionnaire was administered on the last day of camp. QoL was assessed at baseline and four weeks post-camp. In the questionnaire battery, demographic information (i.e. age, gender, accommodation, and vocation) was obtained.</p>
<p>The test battery included the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), the Pearlin Mastery Scale (PMS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213492351">12</xref></sup> the Social Connectedness Scale Revised (SCS-R),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213492351">13</xref></sup> the Social Anxiety and Distress Scale (SADS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213492351">14</xref></sup> and the World Health Organization QoL Scale (WHOQoL-Bref).</p>
<p>The Camp Evaluation Questionnaire required evaluation of the camp activities, infrastructure (e.g. staffing), and consumers’ experience of the program (things learnt through participating, highlights and lowlights, improvement suggestions) as well as any advice for future campers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1039856213492351">
<title>The camping model</title>
<p>The camping model has been manualized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213492351">11</xref></sup> Philosophies underpinning the program included partnerships, ‘Challenge by Choice’, social connections, and physical health.</p>
<p>Strong partnerships were important for successful planning and delivery of the programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213492351">11</xref></sup> Partnerships between mental health and recreational sectors allowed individuals to experience the camps, promoted social inclusion, and assisted with reducing stigma through training and educating volunteers and campsite staff.</p>
<p>‘Challenge by Choice’ involves three principles: (1) individuals set their own goals; (2) individuals choose how much of the activity that they are willing to experience; and (3) participation is an informed decision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213492351">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Through group work, participants encountered team building and trust activities that promoted their sense of inclusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213492351">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Individuals with mental illness have poorer physical health and are at greater risk of cardiovascular disease due to lifestyle factors such as poor diets and substance use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213492351">15</xref></sup> The camping program engages all levels of fitness, shapes, and sizes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213492351">11</xref></sup> By providing a safe and supportive environment, participants can challenge their physical abilities.</p>
<p>A range of structured activities were offered and there was some variation in what was offered according to the facilities at the YMCA campsites and the time of year. Activities were developed and sequenced with the intent of promoting positive identity, social competencies, and providing support (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1039856213492351">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In most cases, the camps were offered and delivered for a single mental health service, varying with each camp.</p>

<sec id="section9-1039856213492351">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Staff from mental health services worked closely with YMCA Victoria to aid with participant recruitment and the organization of camping programs.</p>
<p>Pre-camp sessions were scheduled for two months, one month and two weeks prior to the camp. The aim of these sessions was threefold: (1) for individuals to meet other camp participants and become familiarized with their leadership team; (2) for familiarization with the camping program; and (3) for an initial social recreational activity (e.g. horse-riding). The session two weeks prior to camp was attended by an OYHRC member and a brief presentation on the evaluation project was provided. Written informed consent was obtained and the questionnaire battery was administered. Assistance with form completion was provided on an as-needs basis, with questionnaires taking an average of 30 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>Camps were run at YMCA-managed campsites. A leadership team consisting of YMCA volunteers, mental health service staff, and campsite staff facilitated the camping program. Staff from OYHRC attended the last day of the camp and administered the questionnaires, which took 45 minutes to complete on average.</p>
<p>At approximately four weeks post-camp, another social recreational activity was scheduled; providing camp participants the opportunity to reunite, reminisce, and share experiences. A staff member from OYHRC attended this session and administered the questionnaire battery, taking approximately 30 minutes to complete.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics are reported for the total cohort as well as separately for the ‘STEPS’ and ‘HORIZONS’ programs. Although the differences between ‘STEPS’ and ‘HORIZONS’ camps were minimal in terms of content and format, data is presented separately because of the different age ranges of the cohorts. To determine any significant changes in self-esteem, mastery, and social functioning, from baseline to four-week follow-up, a series of mixed models repeated measures (MMRM) analysis of variance were employed. Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> was reported to depict the size of the difference between the different time points; baseline standard deviation was used in the computation. Cohen’s ‘rule of thumb’ was used for interpreting the resultant standardized effect sizes (e.g. medium effect <italic>d</italic>=0.50). Data from the Camp Evaluation Questionnaire were evaluated descriptively.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section12-1039856213492351">
<title>Sample characteristics</title>
<p>120 individuals (males, <italic>n</italic>=77) participated in the camps, and 90.0% (<italic>n</italic>=108) of those individuals partook in the evaluation. Reasons for non-consent included: not interested in the evaluation; psychiatric symptoms such as paranoia; poor literacy; or not attending pre-camp sessions.</p>
<p>Thirty-six individuals (males <italic>n</italic>=25) participated in the ‘STEPS’ camps. Although the age range of 18–25 years was targeted, the actual age range of participants ranged from 17.7 to 33.6 years (<italic>M</italic>=23.8, <italic>SD</italic>=2.8). This discrepancy in ages was a result of convenience sampling through mental health services. Participation numbers in the camps ranged from five to 12.</p>
<p>Seven ‘HORIZONS’ camps were run for 72 adults (males <italic>n</italic>=47) ranging in age from 18.3 to 72.0 years (<italic>M=</italic>41.2, <italic>SD</italic>=11.6). Again, although the age range of 26+ years was targeted, participants’ ages depended on the clients at the particular mental health services. Participation numbers in the ‘HORIZONS’ camps ranged from eight to 14.</p>
<p>Most participants were male, never married, residing in private residences, living alone, had commenced but not completed secondary education, and were on a government pension (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1039856213492351">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>For ‘STEPS’ participants, there was no overall difference between the three time points for all of the measures; however, social connectedness, <italic>F</italic>(2,42.2)=2.55, <italic>p</italic>=.090, and social anxiety, <italic>F</italic>(2,33.0)=3.27, <italic>p</italic>=.051, approached significance. Pairwise comparisons indicated that there were significant improvements seen from baseline to end of camp for social connectedness, <italic>p</italic>=.035, and for social anxiety, <italic>p</italic>=.015.</p>
<p>For ‘HORIZONS’ participants, significant improvements were seen in mastery, <italic>F</italic>(2,90.0)=4.44, <italic>p</italic>=.015, self-esteem, <italic>F</italic>(2,94.3)=5.06, <italic>p</italic>=.008, and social connectedness, <italic>F</italic>(2,88.27)=5.67, <italic>p</italic>=.005. Pairwise comparisons again found that the main differences were between baseline and end of camp (mastery, <italic>p</italic>=.004; self-esteem, <italic>p</italic>=.008; and social connectedness, <italic>p</italic>=.001).</p>
<p>Examination of effect sizes support the results of the MMRMs. Small to moderate effect sizes were observed for baseline to end of camp for self-esteem, mastery, and social connectedness. The effect size for social anxiety was greater for the ‘STEPS’ than ‘HORIZONS’ cohort, and effect sizes were lower for baseline versus four weeks post-camp (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1039856213492351">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Qualitative</title>
<p>All activities were rated favourably, with more challenging activities rated highest. Camp leaders, venue, food, and logistics of camp were well received. Individuals reported on things that they had learnt about themselves through participation in the program. Themes included: (a) better mental and physical health; (b) overall well-being; (c) improved self-esteem; (d) confidence; (e) teamwork and trust; (f) communication and interactions with others.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study highlights collaborative work across government, mental health and community recreational sectors; a relationship that is novel in Australia. Data was collected on a large number of individuals with various backgrounds, disorders, and life stage. Across the cohort, participation resulted in significant improvements in mastery, self-esteem, and social connectedness, with these changes observed between baseline and the end of the camp. The changes were not sustained to a month post-camp.</p>
<p>Camping interventions have an immediate impact on participants by instilling a greater sense of wellbeing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213492351">16</xref></sup> The ‘Challenge by Choice’ philosophy is integral to the camping experience with challenging activities extending participants’ boundaries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856213492351">17</xref></sup> A greater sense of mastery and self-esteem ensues; participants commented: <italic>‘Learned new skills – conquered fear of heights’</italic> (‘HORIZONS’); and <italic>‘I can do everything as well as everyone else, regardless of my size and mental illness’</italic> (‘STEPS’).</p>
<p>Participation in group activities instils social connectedness, with team building and trust activities particularly useful.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213492351">8</xref></sup> One ‘HORIZONS’ participant stated that: <italic>‘I can fit in’</italic> and another ‘HORIZONS’ participant stated <italic>‘I learned to enjoy the company of others’</italic>.</p>
<p>Within the groups, there was not only the formation of friendships and increased connectedness, but an opportunity to further develop social skills such as cooperating with others, building trust, and communication.</p>
<p>Social anxiety reduced significantly from baseline to end of ‘STEPS’ camps. Mental illness impacts on developmental tasks including socializing with friends, attending school, and/or pursuing vocational goals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213492351">18</xref></sup> By providing a nurturing and supportive environment, and supporting social skill development, social anxiety may be reduced, fostering social inclusion. Meaningful social engagements and enhancing social networks can also positively influence self-esteem, coping effectiveness, and promote psychological and physical wellbeing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213492351">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Adventure therapy has positive effects on physical health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856213492351">19</xref></sup> Although not formally assessed, participants commented: <italic>‘I like physical activity’</italic> and <italic>‘fresh air is good for me’</italic>. The need to address physical health issues was also raised: <italic>‘need to lose weight’, ‘I should do more exercise’</italic>, and <italic>‘I smoke too much’</italic>. Examining ways to support these individuals in making changes in health-related behaviours may reduce the risk of later medical complication.</p>
<sec id="section17-1039856213492351">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>A conservative approach to evaluation of the program was adopted given the limited duration of intervention. The length of the program may be too short to sustain outcomes; a problem previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213492351">16</xref></sup> Alternative ways to maintain positive outcomes are needed. One option would be to have regular ongoing activities or support groups offered post-camp. Anecdotally, many participants reported enjoying reuniting one month post-camp to share their experiences and participate in further activity. Linking participants into other YMCA and community-based services could also be beneficial.</p>
<p>Variations to the format in which adventure therapy is delivered could also be considered. For example, at Orygen Youth Health Clinical Program (OYHCP), an annual 10-week outdoor adventure therapy program is run in conduction with Outdoors Inc, a non-profit state-wide recreational provider. Similar to the outcomes reported here, participants in the 10-week program experience a greater sense of self-esteem, accomplishment, and mastery, with significant changes in terms of self-improvement, social skills development, being able to manage symptoms, and effective time management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213492351">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other limitations with the study are small sample sizes and lack of control group. Small sample size was a specific problem for the ‘STEPS’ camps, with only 36 participants. This reduced the chances of detecting overall effects; however, pairwise comparisons supported improvements from baseline to end of camp. A control group would have strengthened the findings of the current study, but finding an appropriate group was difficult. Logistical and resource issues restricted our ability to run more camps and to recruit a control group.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This project highlights the work of multiple sectors towards promoting social inclusion of individuals with mental illness. The positive personal, social mastery and connecting experience of participation creates a window of opportunity for community mental health services to capitalize upon participants’ improved sense of self and social situation. Offering ‘follow-up’ programs for these individuals may sustain these positive changes brought about by the experience over a longer period of time. One participant offered this advice to other prospective campers: <italic>‘Have a go and really challenge yourself! Why? Because you will be amazed by how much you can really do!’</italic></p>

<ack>
<p>This is an evaluation of the impact of the YMCA Victoria’s Journey to Strength camping program for individuals with mental illness. The evaluation was conducted in conjunction with YMCA Victoria, Sport and Recreation Victoria, and local mental health service agencies.</p>
<p>There are several people and organizations that must be thanked for their support for this evaluation project. First, YMCA Victoria must be acknowledged for committing to designing and building a program that enhances that camping sector’s capacity to meet the needs of our broader community. Second, thanks goes to Liz Leorke, Project Director, who developed the model and approached the entire project with much passion, creativity and open mindedness. Third, we acknowledge the contributions from the range of people and organizations that supported the development of the project with their participation on the Advisory Council. Advisory Council members included: David Strickland DPCD – SRV; Pat O’Leary DPCD – SRV, then Integrated Mental Health Service, Royal Children’s Hospital; Bernadette Pound – Mental Health &amp; Drugs Division, Department of Human Services; David Mithen – Maine Connection; Sue Cotton – Orygen Youth Health Research Centre; Liz Leorke – YMCA Victoria; Ann Nicholson – YMCA Victoria; David Pethrick – Australian Camps Association; Melissa Finlayson DPCD – SRV; Isabell Collins – VIMIAC; Marg Brooks – St Lukes; Hans Van Der Graff – Mind Australia.</p>
<p>Fourth, we would like to acknowledge the enormous contributions from the staff from the range of agencies who partnered with YMCA Victoria to get each camping program ‘off the ground’. Partner agencies included St Lukes Bendigo, Maine Connection, Mind Australia, St Vincent’s Victorian Transcultural Psychiatry Unit, Aspire Warrnambool, Centrecare, Peninsula Support Services, Maroondah CCU, Sacred Heart Mission, and Orygen Youth Health Clinical Program.</p>
