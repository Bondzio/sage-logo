<p>In Dreby’s work, the decision to migrate north is most often made to support one’s family. <italic>Divided by Borders</italic> considers themes of marital conflict, gendered expectations of parents, children’s power in families, and how these are affected by the passage of time as they relate to transnational parents and their families. Using a multi-sited methodology typical of transnational scholars, Dreby developed four sources of data that inform her work, including 142 formal interviews with migrant parents, children, and caregivers; field notes from both a site in the lower Mixteca region of Oaxaca and a site in central New Jersey; in-depth interviews and observations with a small group of transnational families over the course of four years; and in-school research composed of several thousand surveys of Mexican school children, interviews with U.S. and Mexican teachers and administrators, and drawings from Mexican elementary school students.</p>
<p>Dreby found three common models of migration among the families she interviewed: fathers who relocate alone, fathers who are later joined by wives, and single mothers who relocate alone; there is a chapter dedicated to a case study of each model interspersed throughout the ethnographic chapters. By simultaneously unraveling the experiences of the parents, children, and caregivers, she finds that the lack of economic opportunity in Mexico leads to migration to preserve the family unit and afford education as a means of ending the cycle of migration with the next generation.</p>
<p>Extended separations relegate relationships to the telephone. Dreby explores communication frequency, subject matter, method, habit, and meaning. Carefully articulated information about the migrant-parent experience and the impact on the children left behind allows for migrants and their families to both concretize their relationships and validate migration decisions for an illusive reality. Miscommunication also creates slippages that allow for eventualities that do not align with the original goals of the migrating parents. In a specific but generalizable exchange, one mother never divulged the strain of a 70-hour workweek in two adjacent fast-food chains that paid for her children’s schooling. Her children eventually dropped out of school, with one ultimately migrating to the United States. Other children similarly underreport academic difficulty (often a result of caregiver limitations or illiteracy), while caregivers negotiate messages concerning ability, financial stability, and intergenerational mobility. Weekly telephone calls, common to all families, are spaces of mis(sed)communication commonplace during separation.</p>
<p>Dreby makes visible the tangible negotiations between families, labor relocation, and subsequent financial support; these ties are substantiated by remittances and supplemented by gifts that more directly characterize a parent–child relationship. Since the main rationale for migration is to work, ostensibly for more money, filial relationships must struggle, with the bonds of family being reduced to the largest possible paycheck. By using material gifts—most often clothes, shoes, school supplies, and electronics—Dreby’s data convey dissonance in relationships (e.g., parents consistently sending the wrong-sized clothes as they are not present to witness childhood development) and also a strong connection to prosperity via social mobility.</p>
<p>Dreby highlights how gender and family structure the lives of families living apart. She implements and makes accessible West and Zimmerman’s “doing gender” to explain that gendered familial roles are more similar than not for migrant mothers and fathers. She draws from Nelson, Bianchi, and Cherlin’s “doing family” to highlight how families are also constructed. While she explains that gender and family are “done,” Dreby does not account for the shifts in these articulations by families that experience migration. In a global context, bodies are not the only mobile element; ideas and knowledge circulate and are modified in their movement. To presume that migrant identities are stable undermines the theoretical argument that they are enacted. While there is a ubiquitous goal of familial reunification in the narratives collected, collapsing “doing” frameworks on individual narratives would have migrants and their families revisiting a “doing” of gender and family that is not attainable as it would be untouched by migration and separation.</p>
<p>This book makes the family-oriented motive for becoming an undocumented worker easily accessible to the nonacademic reader. It offers a productive passage into transnational undocumented labor and its ramifications on the worker and her or his family. It contributes to sociological, migration, and gender studies in the realm of parenting and transnational experience. The breadth of subject positions Dreby is able to present as a result of her multi-sited method and application offers new insights and concerns about contemporary migration scholarship.</p>
