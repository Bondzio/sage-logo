<abstract>
<p>We aimed to determine the bacterial diversity of different oral micro-niches and to assess whether saliva and plaque samples are representative of oral microbial composition. We took minute samples from each surface of the individual teeth and gingival crevices of two healthy volunteers (112 samples <italic>per</italic> donor), as well as samples from the tongue dorsum and non-stimulated and stimulated saliva. DNA was extracted from 67 selected samples of each donor, and the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR and pyrosequenced to obtain, on average, over 2,700 reads <italic>per</italic> sample, which were taxonomically assigned to obtain a geographic map of bacterial diversity at each tooth and sulcus location. Analysis of the data shows considerable differences in bacterial composition between teeth at different intra-oral locations and between surfaces of the same tooth. The most pronounced differences were observed in incisors and canines, where genera like <italic>Streptococcus</italic> were found at 40% to 70% on the vestibular surfaces but were almost absent on the lingual sides. Saliva samples, especially non-stimulated saliva, were not representative of supra-and subgingival plaque in the two individuals tested. We suggest that more precise sampling is required for the proper determination of oral microbial composition and to relate that diversity to epidemiological, clinical, and etiological parameters.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is well-established that the composition of microbial communities varies in different parts of the oral cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034513488119">Segata <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). The tongue, teeth, mucosa, palate, and gingiva have been shown, by both culture and molecular-based approaches, to harbor a distinctive microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034513488119">Aas <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). Thus, oral environments could themselves be heterogenous in their physico-chemical properties and therefore host different bacterial repertoires. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034513488119">Kleinberg and Jenkins (1964)</xref> measured salivary flow and pH in different parts of teeth and showed clear contrasts in pH values between teeth and even in surfaces from the same teeth which were in close proximity. This classic work showed that the oral cavity is home to multiple micro-niches where not only pH, but also oxygen, temperature, or redox potential, among others, can influence the settling of micro-organisms and risk of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034513488119">Fejerskov <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Molecular-based, culture-independent techniques, such as the use of 16S rRNA profiling, have provided important new insights into the diversity of the microbiome within the oral cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034513488119">Crielaard <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Massively parallel pyrosequencing is an open-ended molecular approach that allows for extensive characterization of microbial populations in a high-throughput, cost-effective manner.</p>
<p>It has been stated that, for gathering complete information on the healthy oral microbiome, microbial samples should be obtained from various ecological niches throughout the oral cavity and from precise and well-characterized disease sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034513488119">Nyvad <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>); however, few studies have been published that apply specific sampling for accurate characterization of the different oral micro-niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034513488119">Haffajee <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034513488119">Zaura <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034513488119">HMP, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034513488119">Segata <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that many oral microbiology studies are based on pooled samples from different teeth (see, <italic>e.g</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034513488119">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034513488119">Aas <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034513488119">Bik <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), it is imperative to characterize differences in microbial composition among specific oral locations within teeth and gingival crevices, since this could severely influence the interpretation of results. Thus, the aim of the present study was to analyze the bacterial diversity in two healthy individual oral cavities at various intra-oral niches by targeted pyrosequencing of the V1-V2-V3 hypervariable regions of the small subunit ribosomal RNA. Sampling locations included different dental surfaces of all teeth and different surfaces of gingival sulcus, across the 4 quadrants. In addition, the bacterial diversity of non-stimulated saliva <italic>vs.</italic> stimulated saliva samples from the same individuals was also evaluated and compared with that from dental and gingival locations to evaluate whether the saliva samples frequently used in etiological and epidemiological studies of oral disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034513488119">Quinque <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) are representative of the microbial diversity at the sites where the disease takes place.</p>

<title>Materials &amp; Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0022034513488119">
<title>Donor Selection and Sampling Procedure</title>
<p>Two volunteers were selected for sampling. They were men aged 20 to 30 yrs, non-smokers, with 28 teeth excluding third molars, and in good dental and periodontal health [in both, absence of caries (non-cavitated level), DMF = 0, OHI = 0, GI = 1, and CPI = 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034513488119">WHO, 1997</xref>)]. They had not been treated with antibiotics in the 6 mos prior to the study nor did they report antecedents of routine use of oral antiseptics. The two donors signed a written informed consent, and the sampling procedure was approved by the Ethics Committee from the DGSP-CSISP (Valencian Health Authority), with reference 10/11/2009.</p>
<p>In each individual, supragingival dental plaque samples were taken, 24 hrs after toothbrushing, from vestibular (buccal) and lingual (palatine) surfaces of 28 teeth, each sample with a different sterile spoon excavator. Teeth were not dried before sampling. From the 56 dental plaque samples collected, 32 were selected for PCR amplification, namely, samples from the first incisor, canine, first premolar, and first molar from each quadrant. Additionally, 56 subgingival samples were taken from the same tooth surfaces, by means of 2 sterile absorbent paperpoints (size 25) <italic>per</italic> sample, passed across each gingival sulcus, avoiding contact with the supragingival dental plaque. Again, 32 samples were selected for PCR amplification. A sample from the tongue dorsum was collected with a sterile spoon excavator across the entire surface, with several repetitive strokes to ensure a representative sample. All the samples were taken in the morning, while the donors sat in a quiet atmosphere. Donors also provided a 2-mL non-stimulated saliva sample 24 hrs after toothbrushing by drooling saliva into a sterile Falcon 50-mL tube. A 2-mL quantity of stimulated saliva was collected immediately after, by the use of a sterile paraffin gum.</p>

<title>DNA Extraction, PCR Amplification, and Pyrosequencing</title>
<p>DNA was extracted separately from each sample by means of the MasterPure™ Complete DNA and RNA Purification Kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions, with the addition of a lysozyme treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034513488119">Belda-Ferre <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Thus, no physical lysis treatment was performed, which could influence the diversity detected in the extracted DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034513488119">Kuczynski <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). A PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene was performed with the high-fidelity ABGene DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Epsom, Surrey, United Kingdom) by the use of universal degenerate primers 8F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′) and 533R (5′-GCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAGGC-3′), at an annealing temperature of 52°C and 20 amplification cycles, to minimize PCR amplification bias. Two PCRs were performed <italic>per</italic> sample, and the 2 PCR products were pooled before purification. In 4 gingival samples, a PCR product could not be obtained, and a nested-PCR was performed, in which the PCR product was purified and used as a template for a secondary PCR in which the primers were shifted 3 bp toward the 3′ end and included the pyrosequencing adaptors A and B, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034513488119">Benitez-Páez <italic>et al</italic>. (2013)</xref>. The 500-bp PCR products were purified with the Nucleofast PCR purification kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) and further cleaned by AMPure XP beads (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) before pyrosequencing. The final DNA <italic>per</italic> sample was measured by picogreen fluorescence in a Modulus 9200 fluorimeter (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) so samples could be mixed in equimolar amounts. PCR products were pyrosequenced from the forward primer end only by using a GS-FLX sequencer with Titanium chemistry (Roche). One-eighth of a plate was used for each pool of 20 samples, which were amplified with a different forward primer containing a unique 8-bp “barcode.”</p>

<sec id="section5-0022034513488119">
<title>Sequence Analysis</title>
<p>Reads with an average quality value lower than 20 and/or with more than 4 ambiguities in homopolymeric regions in the first 360 flows were excluded from the analysis. Read ends were trimmed in 10-bp windows if they had a quality value lower than 20. Only reads longer than 200 bp were considered, as well as those without mismatches in the primer region. Chimeric sequences were detected by Mothur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034513488119">Schloss <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), and 5.4% of the reads were filtered out as potential chimeras. Singletons were not excluded from the analysis. Sequences were assigned to each sample by the 8-bp barcode and analyzed with the Ribosomal Database Project classifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034513488119">Cole <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Each read was taxonomically assigned down to the genus level with an 80% confidence threshold, and reads giving no bacterial hits were excluded from the analysis. All figures and statistical comparisons were performed on samples from each individual separately. To estimate total diversity, we clustered sequences at 97% nucleotide identity over 90% sequence alignment length and obtained rarefaction curves using the RDP pyrosequencing pipeline. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was performed with FastUnifrac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034513488119">Lozupone <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The Unifrac analysis compares the 16S-estimated diversity with a phylogenetic approach that takes into account both taxonomically assigned and unassigned reads.</p>

<sec id="section6-0022034513488119" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>After quality filtering, an average of 2,767 sequences of the 16S rRNA gene was obtained <italic>per</italic> sample (range, 790-6,550), which were assigned at the genus taxonomic level, giving a comparative view of the bacterial diversity and composition among teeth and gingival sites. A summary of these differences in composition can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034513488119">Fig. 1</xref>. The top panels show the average bacterial proportions amplified for lingual and vestibular surfaces from the 4 quadrants, in teeth and gingival sulci. Pronounced differences were observed between vestibular and lingual sites of teeth and gingival sulci, indicating that some bacteria are characteristic for certain sites. For instance, genera like <italic>Streptococcus</italic> were found at 29% to 70% and 23% to 57% on the vestibular surfaces of teeth and sulci, respectively, but were found at lower levels on the lingual surfaces of the same tooth (0% to 51%) or sulcus (5% to 21%) in 97% of the samples. At both teeth and gingival sulci, the 3rd and 4th quadrants had a more similar composition than quadrants 1 and 2, and displayed a higher percentage of <italic>Capnocytophaga</italic> and <italic>Aggregatibacter</italic>. The difference in bacterial composition between the upper and lower arcades was significant for both gingivae and teeth (Unifrac distance test with 1,000 permutations, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 in both vestibular and lingual comparisons).</p>

First number at each sample refers to the quadrant and second number to the tooth, including first incisor (tooth 1), canine (tooth 3), first premolar (tooth 4), and first molar (teeth 6). V = vestibular; L = lingual. Graphs from all quadrants are available from the authors upon request.</p>

</fig>
<p>Interestingly, when the compositional pattern along the arches was plotted separately for gingival samples from the vestibular and lingual sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034513488119">Fig. 1</xref>, lower panels), inverse relationships could be found for several bacteria, mainly involving <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, which appeared to increase in proportion when <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> and <italic>Aggregatibacter</italic> decreased, and <italic>vice versa</italic>. A similar pattern was found along teeth (Appendix Fig.). Both on dental surfaces and in gingival sulci, <italic>Veillonella</italic> was present at a much higher proportion in canines than in incisors, premolars, or molars. In most quadrants, <italic>Streptococcus</italic> was found at higher proportions on vestibular compared with lingual surfaces.</p>
<p>In addition to bacterial composition, diversity was also found to vary considerably at different tissues and sites within tissues. Sequences of the 16S rRNA were clustered at 97% nucleotide identity, which is considered the threshold for species boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034513488119">Yarza <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Thus, each cluster of sequences which is at least 97% similar forms an “operational taxonomic unit” (OTU) that serves to estimate the approximate number of bacterial species. Saliva and tongue samples appeared to harbor a considerably higher number of OTUs than teeth or gingival sulci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034513488119">Fig. 2</xref>). Teeth and gingival samples had a similar level of diversity, and the lingual surface of gingival sulci showed the lowest level of OTUs.</p>

A similar result was found for individual MG02 except for saliva samples, with the stimulated saliva showing larger diversity than the non-stimulated saliva.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022034513488119-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>A convenient way to view the similarities among all samples can be provided by a PCoA, where samples are closer to or farther from each other in a multidimensional space, depending on their degree of similarity in bacterial composition. When applied to all samples, the PCoA shows a clear distribution pattern where gingival and dental samples cluster separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034513488119">Fig. 3A</xref>). In addition, vestibular and lingual samples also appear to cluster together with their own type, showing that each of these niches has a distinct bacterial composition.</p>

</fig>
<p>Saliva samples taken from the two individuals showed a higher level of diversity compared with the vestibular and lingual areas of both teeth and gingival sites, suggesting that saliva must contain bacteria from other oral niches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034513488119">Fig. 2</xref>). Stimulated saliva showed a lower diversity than non-stimulated saliva in individual MG01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034513488119">Fig. 2</xref>), but the reverse trend was observed in individual MG02. The latter would be consistent with the removal of bacteria from different oral cavity sites by the mechanical process of paraffin-gum-chewing. However, the PCoA plot showed that the stimulated saliva sample clustered tightly with the tongue sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034513488119">Fig. 3B</xref>). This was confirmed by the comparative analysis of bacterial composition in saliva, tooth, gingival sulcus, and tongue, which showed a remarkable similarity between tongue dorsum and stimulated saliva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034513488119">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

<p>The PCoA plots showed that non-stimulated saliva appeared to have a microbial composition very different from that of teeth and gingival samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034513488119">Fig. 3</xref>). The reason for this lack of correlation can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034513488119">Fig. 4</xref>: Some of the most common bacteria in 24-hour supra-and subgingival plaque (particularly <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> and <italic>Veillonella</italic>) were at very low or even absent proportions in saliva; in addition, saliva also showed several bacterial genera at considerable proportions (including <italic>Prevotella, Rothia</italic>, and <italic>Haemophilus)</italic>, which were at very low levels or even virtually absent on teeth and/or gingival sites. This indicates that some bacteria colonizing the tooth and gingival sulcus are not represented in saliva, and that micro-organisms from oral sites other than the teeth or gingivae are present in saliva in considerable proportions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Analysis of the data presented in this article demonstrates the considerable differences in bacterial diversity and composition between individual sites and surfaces of the oral cavity, underlining the extraordinarily diverse set of micro-niches even within the same anatomic location. Particularly striking were the contrasts in bacterial composition between lingual and vestibular sites, since the proportions of some ubiquitous genera were highly characteristic of the surface sampled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034513488119">Fig. 1</xref>, Appendix Fig.). For instance, <italic>Streptococcus</italic> was found, on average, at 48.2% and 43.8% in vestibular surfaces of teeth and gingival sulci, respectively, whereas it was detected at 23.9% and 12.33% at lingual surfaces. Thus, microbial diversity studies may be strongly biased if only one tooth surface or gingival site is sampled.</p>
<p>The reasons for such variability in microbial composition probably lie in the gradients and variations in physico-chemical features at different locations of the mouth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034513488119">Kleinberg and Jenkins, 1964</xref>). One of these environmental factors affecting bacterial distribution could be oxygen. This is supported by the high proportion of obligate anaerobes like <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> at lingual sites, whereas aerobes or facultative anaerobes like streptococci are highly common at vestibular sites or incisors and canines, which are likely to be exposed to higher levels of oxygen. It is also very likely that pH plays a major role in that distribution pattern, since lingual and vestibular surfaces may have a different buffering effect of saliva. However, the opposite patterns displayed for some bacteria in the lower-panel curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034513488119">Fig. 1</xref> also suggest possible antagonistic effects, which have been supported experimentally in the pairs <italic>Fusobacterium</italic>-<italic>Streptococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034513488119">He <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>) and <italic>Aggregatibacter-Streptococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034513488119">Whitmore and Lamont, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>We believe that this intra-oral variability in microbial colonization patterns should be taken into account when dental plaque samples are pooled for the assessment of bacterial composition. In addition, the fascinating site-specificity of bacteria observed in the present study may have important implications for oral microbiological studies. Neither stimulated nor non-stimulated saliva was representative of the bacterial diversity, composition, and proportions found at supra-and subgingival sites in the two individuals sampled in this study. Given that the tooth surfaces and the periodontal pockets are the sites where dental caries and periodontal disease take place, the use of saliva as a proxy for bacterial composition at those sites may not provide meaningful correlations between bacterial composition and disease status in epidemiological and etiological studies. Although some evidence has been found between microbial composition of saliva and oral diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034513488119">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), a major limitation is that most molecular studies performed thus far are association studies, and the suggested biomarkers have not been tested in a longitudinal clinical study. Therefore, we do not know at present if the observed biomarker candidates are clinically relevant, and neither tests targeting single salivary bacteria nor salivary bacterial tests in combination with clinical parameters have been able to adequately predict the course of caries <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034513488119">Tellez <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). In addition, some of these studies have found an association between microbiota and disease in plaque samples but not saliva, in both gingivitis and dental caries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034513488119">Ling <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034513488119">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), suggesting that saliva may not be representative of the microbial population at the disease site. Carious cavities, for instance, have been found to harbor a different set of bacterial species than dental plaque at sound surfaces, and the bacterial composition varies among enamel, dentin, and deep dentin samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034513488119">Aas <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034513488119">Belda-Ferre <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Thus, including individuals with caries lesions at different stages of disease progression may introduce further ‘noise’ into the detection of salivary biomarkers for caries. A further complication is given by the use of different saliva-sampling protocols in different laboratories, including paperpoints, mouthrinses, and oral swabs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034513488119">Keijser <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034513488119">HMP, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Exploring microbial diversity in the oral cavity offers the possibility for a better understanding of the role of micro-organisms in health and disease (Takahashi and Nyvad, 2012). However, precise and appropriate sampling must be made to relate health and disease status to microbial profiles. The work presented here is based on data from two individuals, and studies with a larger sample size would be needed to confirm the validity of the observed results. The variability of microbial diversity depending on the oral site sampled is nevertheless clear, and we hope that the present study will help to decide the appropriate sampling strategy in future oral microbiological studies.</p>
