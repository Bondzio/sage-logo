<abstract>
<p>Although organizational social networks are known to influence career mobility, the specific direction of this influence is different for diverse employee groups. Diversity in organizational network research has been operationalized on various dimensions such as race and ethnicity, age, religion, education, occupation, and gender. Missing in this stream of research are application and implications of social networks as they influence career advancement of people with disabilities. The objective of this conceptual article is to outline how social network characteristics such as network density, multiplexity, cohesiveness, and homophily influence career advancement of individuals with a disability. The author concludes by proposing that human resource development professionals can engage in structured socialization programs, network audits, focused training, and the creation of an inclusive climate to ensure that social networks do not pose a deterrent to career advancement of minorities such as people with a disability.</p>

<p>The three main theories addressing social networks—the weak tie theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534484312438216">Granovetter, 1973</xref>), structural hole theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534484312438216">Burt, 1992</xref>), and social resource theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534484312438216">Lin, 1990</xref>)—focus on different network properties as representations of social capital that lead to either positive or negative career outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534484312438216">Seibert, Kraimer, &amp; Liden, 2001</xref>). Organizational social networks can enable or constrain career development through ties leading to instrumental assistance such as advice, coaching, protection, and advocacy, and through emotional support, such as counseling, friendship, and role modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534484312438216">Chandler, Kram, &amp; Yip, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534484312438216">Cotton, Shen, &amp; Livne-Tarandach, 2011</xref>). Although networks are instrumental for career mobility, the specific direction of influence of networks on career advancement is different for diverse employee groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534484312438216">Gersick, Bartunek, &amp; Dutton, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Diversity in network research has been operationalized on dimensions such as race and ethnicity, age, religion, education, occupation, and gender, roughly in that order of importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534484312438216">Brass, in press</xref>). Missing in this stream of research is the application of social networks as they influence career advancement of people with disabilities. There is thus a need to start addressing this gap in research, considering the growing global recognition for the need to productively assimilate individuals with disabilities in social and economic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1534484312438216">United Nations Report, 2010</xref>). The objective of the present article is to outline how organizational social network characteristics influence career advancement of individuals with a physical disability. The primary research questions thus are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1534484312438216" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: How do social networks affect the career advancement of people with a disability?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: Do social networks impede, enhance, or not influence the career advancement of people with a disability?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Following prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534484312438216">Brass, in press</xref>), a social network is defined as a set of actors and a set of ties representing some relationship between the actors. Such networks reflect relatively stable patterns of behavior, interaction, and interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534484312438216">Brass, in press</xref>). Career advancement is viewed as any positive job mobility or movement as experienced by employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1534484312438216">Vardi, 1980</xref>) or as an accomplishment of any desirable work-related outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312438216">Arthur, Khapova, &amp; Wilderom, 2005</xref>). Disability is defined as an impairment that limits a major life activity, but allows for gainful employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1534484312438216">Ren, Paetzold, &amp; Colella, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534484312438216">Stone &amp; Colella, 1996</xref>). Disability in the present article refers to physical disability to maintain boundaries given that a physical disability has different implications for network building as compared with a mental disability (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534484312438216">Stone &amp; Colella, 1996</xref>). Based on prior network research directly relevant to career advancement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534484312438216">Bartol &amp; Zhang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312438216">Brass, 1995</xref>) and disability research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312438216">Kulkarni &amp; Lengnick-Hall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534484312438216">Stone &amp; Colella, 1996</xref>), the following network characteristics are considered in the present article: density, multiplexity, cohesiveness, and homophily. Each of these is defined in the following sections.</p>
<p>Although structural properties characterizing the whole network (e.g., density) are seen as being separate from properties of individual relationships (e.g., strength; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312438216">Brass, 1995</xref>), research shows that the network structure can strongly influence how people interact and develop relationships with specific others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1534484312438216">Völker &amp; Flap, 2001</xref>). Notably, researchers argue that individual characteristics such as personality can be seen as a result of historical accumulation of positions in various network structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534484312438216">Brass, in press</xref>). Furthermore, human resource development professionals may be more able to alter organizational networks than individual characteristics. Given these reasons and to maintain boundaries for the present article, I focus only on organizational network characteristics and not the individual’s position in the network or the individual’s personal attributes. Thus, the influence of networks across organization careers is also outside the scope of this article.</p>
<p>It is important to initiate conversations in the area of career advancement of people with a disability given the following reasons. First, research shows that both the relational context and the content influence a person’s career mobility in organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534484312438216">Gersick et al., 2000</xref>). Career mobility is seen as a combination of individual motivation and human capital, and the role of support of important others who can help refine and signal the human capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534484312438216">Lee, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1534484312438216">Wayne, Liden, Kraimer, &amp; Graf, 1999</xref>). Those with a disability are especially at a disadvantage with regards to complete relational inclusion and may remain an underutilized labor pool as their talent usually remains underrecognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312438216">Lengnick-Hall, Gaunt, &amp; Kulkarni, 2008</xref>). People may not associate with those with a disability, and the lack of relationships as shaped by the organizational social structure may harm the career advancement of such groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534484312438216">Stone &amp; Colella, 1996</xref>). Thus, a network perspective will offer a more nuanced understanding of careers of employees with a disability.</p>
<p>Second, although disability research alludes to the fact that networks influence recruitment and organizational adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312438216">Kulkarni &amp; Lengnick-Hall, 2011</xref>) no theoretical or empirical conversations have yet focused on effects of social networks on career advancement of those with a disability. The present article can provide some direction to such conversations. Such conversations will help determine the sociostructural barriers that human resource development professionals can also act upon to create truly inclusive environments. Indeed, most employers have formally established policies and practices aimed at equal opportunity, but they do not focus on the social patterns facing minorities in the workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534484312438216">Friedman, Kane, &amp; Cornfield, 1998</xref>) from which career liabilities can arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534484312438216">Labianca &amp; Brass, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1534484312438216">Stone and Williams (1997)</xref> have comprehensively outlined how each step in the selection process can put forth impediments for those with disabilities. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534484312438216">Stone and Colella (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1534484312438216">West and Cardy (1997)</xref> have outlined models depicting cognitive and social processes underlying judgments regarding access, treatment, and accommodation requests of those with a disability. The present article can further add to this literature stream by proposing a network perspective in understanding career mobility of those with a disability. This perspective can take us yet another step closer to holistically understanding organizational treatment of those with a disability.</p>
<p>Third, research regarding career advancement of those with a disability shows that they lag behind the majority without disabilities in terms of performance ratings, promotion rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534484312438216">Bressler &amp; Lacy, 1980</xref>), and potential for promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534484312438216">Krefting &amp; Brief, 1976</xref>). Globally, those with a disability are usually underemployed compared with their counterparts without a disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534484312438216">Harrington &amp; Fogg, 2010</xref>). It is quite likely there are network explanations to such findings. For example, it is possible that employees without a disability simply do not know or engage adequately with those with a disability to make accurate performance assessments. It is also likely that lack of such social engagement may mean skills and interests of those with a disability are not given appropriate consideration when allocating tasks or a job, leading to lowered actual or perceived performance.</p>
<p>Fourth, it is especially crucial to understand career advancement of those with a disability. Managing careers for those with a disability is tougher than for those without a disability. Research points out that the rate of labor force underutilization for persons with disabilities is approximately double that of their nondisabled counterparts, and unemployment rates are also higher for those with a disability than for those without (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534484312438216">Harrington &amp; Fogg, 2010</xref>). In their 2011 World Report on Disability, the World Health Organization, in conjunction with the World Bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1534484312438216">World Health Organization and World Bank, 2011</xref>), estimates that about 15% of the world’s population lives with some form of disability, and this number is only likely to increase due to aging populations and the increase in chronic health conditions.</p>
<p>Finally, the present article can help expand the application of social network research to career mobility of different employee groups. For example, network characteristics may have different implications for different employee groups such that network characteristics are actually quite subjective and in the minds of employees. Future empirical research may also help determine whether those with a disability face social barriers similar to ones faced by other minorities in the workplace. Such research will hold practical utility for human resource development professionals.</p>
<p>In the following sections, I define each network construct, explain implications of the construct for career advancement in general, and for people with a disability in particular. As there is no organizational social network research specific to those with a disability, I draw upon network research specific to minorities to build some of the arguments in this article. Although a distinct group of marginalized individuals, those with a disability can be viewed as facing the same issues as other minorities given their numerical status and the stigma they face in social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1534484312438216">Towler &amp; Schneider, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Characteristics of Networks</title>
<sec id="section2-1534484312438216">
<title>Density</title>
<p>Network density is defined as the ratio of the number of actual links to possible links in a network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312438216">Brass, 1995</xref>). Density thus reflects connectedness among actors within a network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1534484312438216">Tichy, Tushman, &amp; Fombrun, 1979</xref>). High network density implies that many actors are connected with each other while few are connected in sparse networks. Dense networks do not have many structural holes, or positions, where an individual can serve as a tie between two disconnected actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534484312438216">Burt, 1992</xref>). Both dense and sparse networks influence career mobility in different ways and serve different career functions.</p>
<p>Dense networks directly influence career outcomes by serving psychosocial functions associated with work satisfaction, organizational commitment, and organizational socialization, all of which are in turn associated with career and developmental outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534484312438216">Lee, 2003</xref>). Research shows that small, dense networks lead to better defined role and performance expectations, which are important for performance and career advancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534484312438216">Podolny &amp; Baron, 1997</xref>). Dense networks also indirectly allow for career advancement by protecting meritocracy. This is because connected networks afford surveillance or monitoring function. People in such networks worry about reputational risks and, hence, engage relatively less in unethical behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534484312438216">Brass, Butterfield, &amp; Skaggs, 1998</xref>) or in self-serving or opportunistic behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534484312438216">Labianca &amp; Brass, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Sparse networks primarily aid career advancement through structural holes or brokerage positions among disconnected actors. This is because such gaps allow actors to act as a medium between disconnected others and thereby control their environment specifically by controlling the flow of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312438216">Burt, 1997</xref>). Sparse networks and associated structural holes also allow actors access to important information at opportune times and allow the actor’s interests to be represented in a positive light at the right time and at the right places. These features are clearly associated with one becoming powerful and one’s career advancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312438216">Burt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534484312438216">Lee, 2003</xref>). Research supports the association between a sparse network, information and resource acquisition, and enhanced career mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534484312438216">Podolny &amp; Baron, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534484312438216">Seibert et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, when competing for career opportunities, a well-defined organizational identity, including clear and consistent expectations about one’s role, are as important as knowing whom to consult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534484312438216">Podolny &amp; Baron, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>With respect to research with minorities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534484312438216">Granovetter (1983)</xref> argues that minorities are more likely to have a dense set of strong tie relationships, given their greater need for social and emotional support. However, these dense relationships may only exist with similar others. Furthermore, such relationships and segregation from the majority lead to a situation where minorities are unlikely to even form a bridge among or with actors that can provide access to the social environment in which the employer operates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534484312438216">Fairchild &amp; Robinson, 2004</xref>). Thus, research indicates that irrespective of dense or sparse networks, minorities remain firmly on the fringe of the social collective.</p>
<p>It is likely that the density or connectedness experienced by the majority within organizations may not be a reality for minority employees such as those with a disability. This is because of interactional barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484312438216">Boyle, 1997</xref>), lower interdependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534484312438216">Chatman &amp; Flynn, 2001</xref>), and other negative biases against those with a disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312438216">Lengnick-Hall et al., 2008</xref>). Boyle argues that most individuals have negative biases against those with a disability and experience psychological discomfort when interacting with those with a disability. Interactions hence tend to be avoided by both parties. Other research shows that demographic heterogeneity leads to group norms emphasizing lower cooperation. Although increased contact over time attenuates this effect, heterogeneity leads to lowered interdependence during work activities even when incentives are based on collective output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534484312438216">Chatman &amp; Flynn, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Those with a disability also encounter biases about their competence or ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484312438216">Boyle, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312438216">Lengnick-Hall et al., 2008</xref>). Given their numerical status, minorities especially face greater scrutiny and have fewer mentoring relationships and fewer advancement opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1534484312438216">Thomas &amp; Chrobot-Mason, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534484312438216">McFarlin, Song, and Sonntag (1991)</xref>, through their survey of Fortune 500 companies, found that attitudes toward those with a disability tend to cluster. This meant that individuals who more likely to feel that the disabled have higher absenteeism rates were also more likely to feel that disability accommodation is expensive, that people with a disability experience slower advancement, and that they are poor performers.</p>
<p>It is thus likely that those with a disability remain segregated in otherwise dense groups, given lower relational acceptance and lower performance expectations, and thus, detrimentally affecting their career advancement. They may also not be able to form connecting ties in a sparse network based on their relative nonacceptance as interaction or collaboration partners. Both these situations imply suboptimal or negative career outcomes. Future research can thus examine the following propositions:</p>
<list id="list2-1534484312438216" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Proposition 1</italic>: People with disabilities are less likely to belong to dense networks and less likely to form bridges in sparse networks comprising nonminority actors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Proposition 2</italic>: Segregation from the majority in dense networks and inability to form bridges in sparse networks imply suboptimal career advancement outcomes for people with disabilities.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1534484312438216">
<title>Multiplexity</title>
<p>Multiplexity is defined as the degree to which network relationships are multidimensional or have common actors. For example, when one has a coworker who is also a friend outside of the workplace, this social tie with the coworker is considered to be multiplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534484312438216">Granovetter, 1973</xref>). Multiplex relationships can help with instrumental benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534484312438216">Cotton et al., 2011</xref>). People offer and seek help to and from those with whom they feel psychologically safe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534484312438216">Bamberger, 2009</xref>). This is likely to happen in networks where people have multiple ties with each other. Research shows that multiplex networks where people trust one another and benefit each other are usually small and homophilic, from a social and affective perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1534484312438216">Völker &amp; Flap, 2001</xref>). Such networks are in turn associated with greater career-related help in the form of exposure, sponsorship, protection or friendship, counseling, and acceptance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534484312438216">Higgins &amp; Kram, 2001</xref>). Multiplex relationships also indirectly lead to career outcomes by constraining unethical behavior. This is because people do not wish to break multiple ties with their interaction partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534484312438216">Brass et al., 1998</xref>). It is thus likely that when ties are multiplex in nature, career mobility is determined more by meritocracy than by cronyism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534484312438216">Begley, Khatri, &amp; Tsang, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Some research shows that mutliplexity of ties within the organization is weaker for minorities than for the majority. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534484312438216">Ibarra (1995)</xref> states that because cross-race relationships are usually weak, minorities may develop nonoverlapping social and work-related circles in the workplace. Furthermore, since minorities usually have affective ties with similar others within and outside the workplace and are not always part of the majority social group, their workplace ties are unlikely to be multiplex as compared with those who are in nonminority groups. Consequently, minorities are relatively more deprived of multiplex social ties and associated social resources such as coaching and information about opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534484312438216">Friedman et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Some disability-specific research also indicates that those with a disability may develop nonoverlapping social and work-related circles in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312438216">Kulkarni &amp; Lengnick-Hall, 2011</xref>). Notably, those with a disability may harm their own social integration by reflecting a perceived negative societal attitude toward them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1534484312438216">Zernitsky-Shurka, 1988</xref>). Zernitsky-Shurka’s study of two disability rehabilitation groups (visible and emotional disabilities) showed that both groups expressed the most positive evaluation toward the person without any disability and the most negative evaluation toward the other stigmatized group. Furthermore, both groups negatively evaluated the person who was in the same position as them, that is, in the process of rehabilitation. Notably, persons with a physical disability evaluated their successfully rehabilitated in-group member less positively than they evaluated a person without any disability.</p>
<p>Given self-selection out of social ties and imposed segregation, it is unlikely that people with disabilities possess multiplex ties within their workplace. They are thus unlikely to enjoy career benefits stemming from multiplex relationships in an organizational network. Future research can examine the following propositions:</p>
<list id="list3-1534484312438216" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Proposition 3</italic>: People with disabilities are more likely to self-select out of multiplex social ties and to face imposed segregation in multiplex nonminority networks.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Proposition 4</italic>: Weaker multiplexity of ties implies suboptimal career advancement outcomes for people with disabilities.</p></list-item>

<title>Cohesiveness</title>
<p>Cohesiveness is defined as actors’ affinity for each other and a desire to remain part of the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312438216">Brass, 1995</xref>). Cohesion can also be reflected in strength of ties between actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312438216">Burt, 1997</xref>). Strong or cohesive ties are those that are of long duration, exercised frequently and emotionally close (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534484312438216">Granovetter, 1973</xref>). Actors with such ties have similar information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534484312438216">Bartol &amp; Zhang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312438216">Burt, 1997</xref>), and they generally adopt similar attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534484312438216">Brass, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>Research indicates that ties conveying resources and information are associated with career advancement, but ties conveying identity and expectations are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534484312438216">Podolny &amp; Baron, 1997</xref>). Strong ties seem to work better for women and newly hired managers, whereas weak ties are associated with early promotions for others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534484312438216">Burt, 1992</xref>). Notably, network cohesion may lead to unethical behaviors given similar attitudes, high social influence, and high communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534484312438216">Brass et al., 1998</xref>). Ties thus serve different purposes and are inconsistently associated with career advancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534484312438216">Lee, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Research examining the influence of social inclusion on career mobility shows that employees from a minority group may be on the periphery of otherwise cohesive groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534484312438216">Gersick et al. (2000)</xref> conducted interviews with business school faculty and found that social ties directly influence career mobility, and negative ties can be as consequential as helpful ties. Women respondents in this study told more stories of harm, and men talked more about help through social ties. These researchers concluded that different relational experiences lead to different career logics (or ways of striving for career success). Their results also showed that women’s interactions turned into tests of relational acceptance more than periods for reputational enhancement.</p>
<p>Minorities may thus begin from positions of insecurity when starting their careers, and this may lead to a hesitant approach toward relationships and network building. Ties thus inform individuals’ about their value in the social system and shape their beliefs about what their careers can or ought to be. Inclusion or strong close ties are thus significant as they influence career advancement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534484312438216">Gersick et al. (2000)</xref> argue that when careers are seen as tests that produce anxiety, individuals may divert attention away from tasks leading to detrimental career outcomes. Career outcomes may also be hurt in the presence of such a hesitant approach toward network building. This is because career outcomes are more influenced by informal relationships than by formal mentoring programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534484312438216">Underhill, 2006</xref>) and because opportunities for short-duration mentoring episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534484312438216">Fletcher &amp; Ragins, 2007</xref>) may remain lacking.</p>
<p>Theories of social identity and self-categorization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534484312438216">Tajfel, 1981</xref>) have been leveraged to explain the lack of relational cohesion or acceptance of those with a disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534484312438216">Shore et al., 2009</xref>). Category-based thinking especially lowers cohesiveness or increases social isolation of those with a disability in organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534484312438216">Klimoski &amp; Donahue, 1997</xref>). Apart from self-limiting behaviors that those with a disability may display, career advancement is also affected by a token or out-group status for those with a disability. Such an out-group status implies lack of role models, lack of mentors, and lack of critical feedback leading to stalled or slow careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534484312438216">Jones, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Those with a disability indeed obtain and act upon subtle negative cues they get from their social environment, especially with reference to seeking help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312438216">Baldridge &amp; Veiga, 2001</xref>), and research shows that they refrain from making requests (e.g., for accommodation) so as not to impose on others or hurt their image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312438216">Baldridge &amp; Veiga, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534484312438216">2006</xref>). It is unlikely then that a situation of perceived out-group status, lack of mentors, or low possibility of critical feedback is conducive to career-related help seeking, or career-related conversations. Indeed, the very notion of career success may mean inclusion more than promotions or recognition for those with a disability. Future research can thus examine the following propositions:</p>
<list id="list4-1534484312438216" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Proposition 5</italic>: People with disabilities are less likely to belong to cohesive networks comprising nonminority actors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Proposition 6</italic>: Lower cohesion with the majority network implies suboptimal career advancement outcomes for people with disabilities.</p></list-item>

<sec id="section5-1534484312438216">
<title>Homophily</title>
<p>Homophily is defined as the degree of similarity based on identity or organizational group affiliations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534484312438216">Marsden, 1988</xref>). Homophily implies that similarity breeds connections in social ties. Thus, people’s personal networks are typically homogeneous with respect to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily has implications for interactions that people experience. This is because homophily translates into network distance and number of relationships among similar others. Furthermore, ties between nonsimilar individuals dissolve at a higher rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534484312438216">McPherson, Smith-Lovin, &amp; Cook, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Although spatial, temporal, and social proximity helps foster relationships, people prefer relationships and interactions with similar others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534484312438216">Brass, in press</xref>). Such similarity may be gauged based on distinctiveness in a specific context. Distinctiveness theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534484312438216">McGuire, 1984</xref>) suggests that people tend to identify with others with whom they share characteristics that are relatively rare in a particular social context. Similarity is thus specific to the context.</p>
<p>Homophily may influence careers through ease of communication and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534484312438216">Ibarra, 1995</xref>). Results of a multicity study show that since homophilic ties ease interaction and take relatively less time to develop and manage, employers rely on similarity when hiring people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534484312438216">Fairchild &amp; Robinson, 2004</xref>). Other research shows that similarity or homophily is associated with conversations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534484312438216">Ingram &amp; Morris, 2007</xref>) and with accumulation of overall social capital that directly influences career mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534484312438216">Friedman &amp; Krackhardt, 1977</xref>). Research further shows that both self-selection of homophilic ties and exclusion by others based on differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534484312438216">Mehra, Kilduff, &amp; Brass, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534484312438216">Mollica, Gray, &amp; Treviño, 2003</xref>) influence career outcomes directly and indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534484312438216">Friedman &amp; Krackhardt, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>Mehra et al. found that individuals identify, interact, and form friendships with similar others when they belong to a relatively rare social category (e.g., race or gender). Such numerically underrepresented groups were also likely to face exclusionary pressures and biases given their visible differences as compared with the majority. Thus, minorities were more likely to be structurally marginal and more on the periphery of social networks as compared with the majority groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534484312438216">Mehra et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Other research shows that a minority individual’s human capital or education does not necessarily lead to his or her manager’s assessments of his or her career potential. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534484312438216">Friedman and Krackhardt’s (1977)</xref> study showed that education did not translate into managerial assessments of career potential for Chinese and Asian Indians as compared with assessments for European Americans. This is because Chinese and Asian Indians were seen as less similar to self in the U.S. context as compared with European Americans, who were seen as more similar. Friedman and Krackhardt argue that social capital, which is contingent on patterns of attraction and avoidance, mediates the relationship between human capital and promotion decisions. Thus, similar others accumulate both social and instrumental ties leading to career enhancement, whereas minorities have more trouble establishing themselves in dominant social networks that can enhance their careers. Dissimilarity can also lead to negative social ties and, hence, social liabilities in the form of performance, promotions, and income attainment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534484312438216">Labianca &amp; Brass, 2006</xref>). Even when there is no animosity, stereotyping, or discrimination, harmless similarity preferences lower chances of organizational success for minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534484312438216">Friedman et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Disability research has applied tenets of the field of relational demography (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1534484312438216">Tsui &amp; O’Reilly, 1989</xref>) and stigma theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534484312438216">Goffman, 1963</xref>) to demonstrate that dissimilarity is associated with lower liking and integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312438216">Colella &amp; Varma, 2001</xref>). Review studies also indicate that perceptions of dissimilarity will predict negative organizational treatment and outcomes for people who have disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534484312438216">Shore et al., 2009</xref>). Career advancement of those with a disability will be particularly influenced also because leaders may perceive those with a disability as less similar and, hence, may experience less affect for them and may expect less contribution from them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312438216">Colella &amp; Varma, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Other organizational actors who may have input into career outcomes may also sideline people with disabilities based on discrediting attributes or stigmas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534484312438216">Goffman, 1963</xref>) as they try to avoid interactions fearing stigma by association (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534484312438216">Kulik, Bainbridge, &amp; Cregan, 2008</xref>). Finally, some research, as indicated earlier, shows that those with a disability may prefer homophilic ties and approach similar others more for advice and social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312438216">Kulkarni &amp; Lengnick-Hall, 2011</xref>). Overall, similarity-based preferences or homophily may leave those with a disability on the social margins within majority groups, and thereby, negatively influence their career advancement. The final set of propositions, thus, is as follows:</p>
<list id="list5-1534484312438216" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Proposition 7</italic>: People with disabilities are more likely to leverage homophilic ties within their organizational networks.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Research Proposition 8</italic>: Homophilic ties alone imply suboptimal career advancement outcomes for people with disabilities.</p></list-item>

<title>Combined Structural Effects and Other Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>So far, effects of individual network characteristics on career advancement of people with disabilities have been articulated. However, network characteristics are intertwined and, hence, together have implications with regards to career outcomes. For example, actor similarity or homophily may lead to cohesion or strong ties among the majority group. This is because frequent interactions take place with similar others that can lead to (or are indicative of) strong ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534484312438216">Lin, Ensel, &amp; Vaughn, 1981</xref>). Furthermore, interaction between dissimilar actors is likely to be infrequent, not always reciprocated, unstable, uniplex, weak, and possibly likely to dissolve relatively quickly. Similarity of actors may be positively related to the density or connectedness of the network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534484312438216">Brass, in press</xref>). We can argue that, when those with a disability are disadvantaged based on lack of similarity with the majority, it may also mean they are not part of the dense or connected network and not part of cohesive or affinity majority groups. They thus remain peripheral actors and do not enjoy career benefits of access to and control over resources that someone more central and more connected may enjoy.</p>
<p>Those with a disability may quite well experience different structural and relational worlds as compared with the majority who do not have disabilities. Future research can postulate and examine the additive or multiplicative effects of various network characteristics on career advancement of people with disabilities. For example, does it matter that such groups of people are perceived as different yet have dense connections that allow them access to critical career-related information at opportune times? Which network characteristics matter the most as far as career outcomes for those with a disability are concerned?</p>
<p>As indicated earlier, to initiate conversations in an area where no research exists, I have focused only on macro network characteristics and not on the individual’s position in the network or the individual’s personality or other characteristics. Future research can examine all of these simultaneously. Indeed, although a social structure influences interaction, repeated interaction over time also leads to social structure. Social structures can thus be modified gradually over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534484312438216">Brass, in press</xref>). It is then likely that as contact with people with disabilities increases, stigmas and preconceived negative biases give way for deeper and more meaningful interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534484312438216">Stone &amp; Colella, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Alternatively, it is likely that initial ambivalent or negative expectancies and responses get amplified over time (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534484312438216">Katz &amp; Glass, 1979</xref>). Researchers can conduct field studies to answer these questions. Such studies will determine the degree and direction in which disability influences social interaction. For example, does the socialization period allow people to change or form opinions about relational acceptance of someone they saw as being different during the recruitment and selection phase? Does the socialization phase cement all future interactions and network acceptance of the individual with a disability? At what temporal and event threshold point does a “different” person become an in-group person who partakes benefits of cohesion enjoyed by the majority? Answers to these questions also have clear practical implications for human resource development.</p>
<p>Another fruitful area of research is the examination of the macro external institutional context, as it influences organizational social networks. Research shows that the institutional environment determines the different kinds of social relationships that people invest in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1534484312438216">Völker &amp; Flap, 2001</xref>). If that is the case, does the network and associated career reality differ for those with a disability when the organization is situated in certain prodisability institutional environment? For example, will those with a disability be recipients of affinity when the organization is situated in an environment where equal opportunity laws are more in force? Or will the majority take that to mean forced cohesion, and consequently, treat the person with a disability as being different and leave them on the social periphery?</p>
<p>Finally, to maintain boundaries, I excluded any conversation about the role of the individual. However, career mobility or other outcomes are a function of both human and social capital and of individual and organizational career management strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534484312438216">De Vos, Dewettinck, &amp; Buyens, 2009</xref>). Thus, future research can expand the present framework to understand how those with a disability themselves play a role in shaping and leveraging organizational social networks. Disability severity and type also have implications for building and leveraging social ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534484312438216">Stone &amp; Colella, 1996</xref>). It is likely the enactment and leverage of social networks is even more inhibited for those with learning disabilities, with consequent (and more negative) implications on career outcomes.</p>
<p>Boundaries of present ideas can also be extended to conceptualize research across organization and job type. It is likely that certain industries (e.g., information technology and software services) hire and include those with a disability more so than organizations from other industries (e.g., manufacturing). This may be based on industry needs for legitimacy, or simply, ability to accommodate and leverage those with a disability in certain jobs. This may imply that social networks and career outcomes are different for different types of work environments. Although some research indicates that performance concerns and concerns about majority employees’ negative reactions to those with a disability are universal across industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312438216">Lengnick-Hall et al., 2008</xref>), this is a fruitful area of research. As a related point, social networks are situated within and influenced by the organizational culture, values, and norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534484312438216">Chandler et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the exclusive and combined influence of the organizational culture and social networks on career outcomes of those with a disability also merits attention. Such research can point to environments more conducive to the formation of social networks that can in turn have positive career advancement implications for those with a disability.</p>

<title>Implications for Human Resource Development Practice</title>
<p>Given clear implications of social network structures on career advancement of employees with a disability, what can human resource development professionals do to improve their situation? A few suggestions are outlined in this section. Human resource development professionals can start from the very beginning, as soon as one enters the workforce. For example, it is known that those with a disability face social and inclusion barriers right from their organizational entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534484312438216">Colella, 1994</xref>). Human resource development professionals can help with structured socialization programs such that those with a disability can initiate relationships with possible mentors and others who can give them instrumental advice and other psychosocial support. Such ties will help minority employees assimilate faster and better into the overall social network. Such support can also be extended by employers during periods of role transitions. Assigned mentors can help their protégés with a disability as well as ensure that they know enough to navigate the organizational social landscape independently.</p>
<p>Human resource development professionals can also conduct periodic network audits to determine whether, which, and why particular network characteristics systematically marginalize certain employees. Such assessments can map the flow of communications and the degree of connections among employees and also point to individuals who are isolated because of processes or biases. Processes can then be rectified by job and process redesign, and biases can be reduced through training. Education through training of both coworkers and the focal person with a disability will help with complete relational assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534484312438216">Colella, 1994</xref>). For example, minority employees can be trained to become proactive and shape their social networks or form network groups. Having more contacts indeed increases the chances of locating mentors and of gaining useful career-related information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534484312438216">Friedman et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, human resource development professionals can build modules for periodic and focused sensitivity training. Such training can be aimed at building cohesion among all employees and for creating an organization-specific identity. Such cohesion and a common identity may lead to feelings of homophily or similarity and, thus, may lead to a sense of true inclusion. Instrumental or work-related help giving and seeking may improve given these efforts and thereby enhance career outcomes of minorities, such as those with a disability.</p>
<p>However, it is likely that training alone is insufficient to bring about workplace changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534484312438216">Burke &amp; Hutchins, 2007</xref>). Hence, the effectiveness of such training can be further enhanced by human resource development professionals through the creation of a macro climate for diversity management. Research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534484312438216">Rynes &amp; Rosen, 1995</xref>) indicates that broader organizational context and the support of the top management in particular enhance both the adoption and the perceived success of diversity training initiatives. The same research points to the importance of dedicated diversity managers and formalized policies. Human resource development professionals can certainly help build inclusive social networks through creation and enforcement of diversity policies (e.g., regarding evaluations or career advancement) and by serving as diversity managers or by helping organizations find such personnel. Focusing on all of the above suggestions will help ensure that the workplace is truly accepting of all perspectives, which can enhance both organizational and individual learning and create a strong and common identity among all employees (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534484312438216">Chrobot-Mason &amp; Thomas, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>No research has yet focused exclusively on organizational social networks as they influence career advancement of those with a disability. The present article is based on the premise that the network features known to be instrumental for career mobility of those without a disability may not work in favor of minorities, such as those with a disability. People with a disability may especially be at a disadvantage with regards to complete relational inclusion and may remain an underutilized labor pool. Understanding how organizational social networks can be a source of support or hindrance to those with a disability is thus important in order to fully leverage the human capital of all employee groups. The present article offers a starting point for future research in the form of various ideas and propositions. Such explorations will also help establish boundary conditions for the application of social network research specific to career mobility of diverse sets of employee groups.</p>
