<body>
<p>Thanks to the editors of the journal for inviting responses to our earlier article, and thanks to Lampert; Lewis, Perry, Friedkin, and Roth; and Zeichner for accepting the invitation and clarifying, extending, and questioning the ideas we proposed. We begin by gratefully acknowledging the responders for reinforcing a number of primary points we tried to make and for amplifying them through useful extensions. Some of these extensions suggest settings in which the work we propose for improving teaching could thrive and achieve the preferred “scenarios” imagined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022487112449869">Lampert (2012)</xref>.</p>
<p>The useful settings described by the responders include creating “teacher inquiry communities” from the beginning of teacher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022487112449869">Zeichner, 2012</xref>), designing “instructional guidance systems” in which the work of improving teaching can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022487112449869">Lampert, 2012</xref>), and providing instructional supports that enable teachers to engage in this work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487112449869">Lewis, Perry, Friedkin, &amp; Roth, 2012</xref>). The three supports identified by Lewis et al.—high-quality teacher manuals, teacher learning within practice, and collegial learning—echo many of the points in our article and add a richness of detail by describing the lesson study process common in Japan.</p>
<p>We hope to continue the conversation about improving teaching by focusing on two points that deserve further consideration: the willingness or motivation of teachers to engage in the work of improving teaching and the prioritizing in teacher education of improving teaching versus training teachers. The willingness of teachers to work directly on improving teaching is underdeveloped in our article, but we see our position as quite consistent with the more complete treatment given this point in the responses, especially by Lampert. We argue briefly in our article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022487112449869">Hiebert &amp; Morris, 2012</xref>, p. 95) and more forcefully in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022487112449869">Morris and Hiebert (2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022487112449869">2011</xref>) along with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022487112449869">Lampert &amp; Graziani, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487112449869">Lewis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022487112449869">Gallimore, Ermeling, Saunders, &amp; Goldenberg, 2009</xref>) that working directly to improve teaching as part of a professional community provides the most authentic and rewarding intellectual challenge that can keep teachers engaged in the profession. The compelling motivation is twofold: (a) seeing the effects of improving teaching, even in small ways, on changes in students’ learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022487112449869">Gallimore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022487112449869">Stigler, 2010</xref>) and (b) teachers seeing themselves as contributors to a professional knowledge base from which others can benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022487112449869">Lampert &amp; Graziani, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022487112449869">Morris &amp; Hiebert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022487112449869">Stigler &amp; Hiebert, 1999</xref>). The key is for teachers to see themselves, along with researchers and curriculum writers, as coauthors of the methods and materials they use and continue to improve.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022487112449869">Lampert (2012)</xref> points out in her response, the “will” to teach, and teach well, is a cultural rather than individual trait. We believe the development of this culture is driven by a professional ethos that places the study and improvement of teaching in the hands of teachers. Lampert appears to support the point we have made often in this regard: shared learning goals (and associated values) create the demand to produce and to use effective teaching methods that are shared and eagerly received by other teachers. This demand arises naturally when many teachers are trying to help their students achieve the same learning goals. Excellent examples of the development of this professional ethos are found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487112449869">Lewis et al.’s (2012)</xref> description of lesson study, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022487112449869">Lampert and Graziani’s (2009)</xref> description of an Italian language school, and in the University of Delaware mathematics education group’s description of their teacher preparation program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022487112449869">Berk &amp; Hiebert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022487112449869">Hiebert &amp; Morris, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022487112449869">Jansen, Bartell, &amp; Berk, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The second point we want to make amounts to an elaboration of the central thesis of our article: there are significant benefits in foregrounding direct attention to studying and improving teaching, and then treating the learning of teachers as a natural outcome of this work. We voiced this claim in our article, and we repeat it here because we believe it has been too often neglected when designing systems of teacher education and we believe the reverse approach—foregrounding the training of teachers—has not been especially successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022487112449869">Zeichner, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Our central thesis is that effective teaching means teaching <italic>something</italic> well to a particular group of students. Learning to teach something well is best achieved by directly studying and improving instruction of <italic>this</italic> content and, in the process of repeated cycles of implementing and refining instructional methods and materials, to abstract the recurring routines and core practices that become keys to effective practices. In this sense, we see the work of improving teaching and learning to teach as tightly intertwined, even more integrated than described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022487112449869">Zeichner (2012)</xref>. However, we argue for a sequence that reverses that suggested by Zeichner. We conjecture that learning to teach particular content from a particular curriculum to a particular group of students and, gradually, extracting the core practices of teaching is <italic>more</italic> developmentally appropriate than that promoted by the reverse sequence. At the least, we believe the sequence we propose minimizes the transfer problem we raised in our article and echoed by Zeichner.</p>
<p>We do not believe that the learning of teachers is inconsequential or should be left to chance. We also do not believe we are forcing a choice between teaching and teachers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022487112449869">Lampert, 2012</xref>). Rather, we are arguing as strongly as we can that it is worth examining what teacher education could look like if it focused teachers’ attention directly on improving teaching, in context, and helped teachers create the kinds of artifacts that could hold the knowledge gained during this process, and then treated the learning of teaching as the natural outgrowth of this work.</p>
<p>As a corollary, we see nothing to prevent a full array of core practices emerging from this work. Whatever recurring practices are essential for teaching <italic>this</italic> content to <italic>these</italic> students would emerge as candidates. This includes practices often neglected, such as cultural competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022487112449869">Zeichner, 2012</xref>). In general, it seems to us that which practices emerge as critical for effective teaching and get learned by teachers because they recur across multiple lessons is an empirical question. This is exactly the kind of knowledge that would be gained by multiple teachers working in a coordinated way (sharing learning goals and results) across diverse groups of students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022487112449869">Morris &amp; Hiebert, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>We conclude by playing out an example posed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022487112449869">Lewis et al. (2012)</xref> to make more concrete the distinctions we are proposing. At the end of their response, Lewis et al. describe the case of learning to teach about solar energy. They point out that in Japan this task was envisioned as one in which, leading up to including the topic in the curriculum, many teams of teachers and researchers applied to develop lessons to achieve the learning goals set by the National Ministry of Education. Over the course of several years, many teachers and researchers worked together to develop, implement, and revise model lessons. Many other teachers attended the lesson trials, and discussed more and less effective ways of teaching <italic>this</italic> content to <italic>these</italic> students. This process was the context in which teachers learned to teach about solar energy. Lewis et al. note that it has been difficult for them to get government funding in the United States to implement a similar system. It is not hard to imagine that the conventional approach to this task in the United States would be to design preservice or inservice courses to train teachers in the content of solar energy along with particular pedagogical strategies for teaching science. Teachers would then be asked to integrate what they had learned and transfer it to the classrooms in which they worked to begin teaching about solar energy. They would be left alone with a textbook written by outside experts that contained lessons on solar energy. No expectations would exist for teachers to improve these lessons over time, especially in a way that would be incorporated into the commercial curriculum. We draw the contrast here in stark terms to highlight the different systems that result from which approach is foregrounded. The approaches of attending to teaching versus teachers do not need to be mutually exclusive but foregrounding the improvement of teaching creates a different system of educational study and improvement than foregrounding the training of teachers. We think foregrounding the study and improvement of teaching, with teacher learning treated as a natural consequence, is worth more serious consideration than it currently receives.</p>
