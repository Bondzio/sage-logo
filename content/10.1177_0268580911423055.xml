<abstract>
<p>This article examines the effects of adolescent noncompliance (e.g., breaking of rules, flouting of norms) on occupational attainment in unstable and unpredictable societies. The authors suggest that the effect of adolescent noncompliance on occupational attainment depends on the unpredictability of the society and propose that adolescent noncompliance has <italic>positive</italic> effects on the occupational status of young adults in unpredictable societies. Using longitudinal data from the Paths of a Generation study, the authors estimate the impact of adolescent noncompliance on occupational status in former Soviet regions at two time points: (1) before the transition (stable society) and (2) in 1997–9, after major societal changes (unstable and unpredictable society). They find that adolescent noncompliance does not affect occupational attainment before the transition; however, it does increase the chance of being a manager after the transition. In addition, it is found that after the transition, adolescent noncompliance has positive effects on occupational attainment in the private sector but not in the state sector, providing further evidence of the positive effect of noncompliance in unpredictable societies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In this article we focus on the effect of adolescent noncompliance on subsequent occupational attainment in unstable, unpredictable societies. Contrary to previous findings in stable societies, we propose that adolescent noncompliance has positive effects on occupational attainment in rapidly changing, unstable post-Soviet societies (for examples from stable societies, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0268580911423055">Davies and Tanner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0268580911423055">Tanner et al., 1999</xref>). We investigate the effects of adolescent noncompliance in school (such as flouting of norms), measured before the collapse of the Soviet Union, on the occupational status of young adults both before and during major societal changes. We compare the effects of adolescent noncompliance in stable and unstable societies. We argue that rapidly changing norms and laws created a highly unpredictable transition from a command economy. This transition gave an advantage to those less dependent on direction from authorities. For people accustomed to obeying authorities and following rules, unpredictability makes it especially hard to adopt successful career strategies. In contrast, adults who are experienced in breaking rules and challenging authority during adolescence are less handicapped by uncertainty and unpredictability of norms, rules, policies and laws. In addition, we argue that because of greater unpredictability in the new private sector than in the more stable state sector, the positive effects of noncompliance are more consequential in the private sector.</p>
<p>Labor force attainment in transitional societies has been relatively well studied (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423055">Gerber, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0268580911423055">Titma et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0268580911423055">2003</xref>). However, this literature has focused primarily on standard predictors of attainment, such as gender, parental background, school type, completed education, and rural–urban location. Nontraditional mechanisms especially relevant to transitional societies are rarely considered. A notable exception to this is research on the impacts of Communist Party membership on labor force outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0268580911423055">Gerber, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0268580911423055">Titma et al., 2003</xref>). Our study examines another nonstandard mechanism. We propose that certain associations or interrelations differ greatly between stable and unstable societies. We focus on rule-breaking because clarity in norms and laws is a major feature that differentiates stable societies and unstable transitional societies. The unpredictability in norms and laws in transitional societies creates a situation in which the effect of rule-breaking on occupational outcomes should differ from what occurs in stable societies. Thus, we contend that the degree of predictability of the social environment acts as a scope condition shaping how noncompliance affects life outcomes. We draw on the life course literature linking the experiences in adolescence to attainment in young adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0268580911423055">Elder, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0268580911423055">Titma and Tuma, 2005</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-0268580911423055">
<title>Noncompliance and outcomes in stable societies</title>
<p>The effects of adolescent noncompliance on adult outcomes have been analysed in both the psychological and sociological literature. Research in psychology generally considers such effects from the perspective of adolescent risk-taking; whereas sociological and youth development research concentrates on the effects of noncompliance and similar concepts over the life course. Generally, noncompliance is conceptualized as a type of deviance and therefore as resulting in negative sanctions and adverse outcomes. In this study we conceptualize noncompliance as rule-breaking in school (skipping school; arguing with teachers; not following school rules). Thus, it is different from general definitions of deviance because it does not include criminal, destructive, or violent behavior. Therefore, we focus on previous research that has explicitly examined noncompliance or nonconformity, or on previous research that has considered very minor deviance related to breaking school rules, such as skipping school.</p>
<sec id="section3-0268580911423055">
<title>Risk-taking as opportunism</title>
<p>Adolescent risk-taking is analysed by two different theoretical perspectives in psychology: (1) ‘risk-taking as trouble’, believed to lead to early school dropout, violence and crime; and (2) ‘risk-taking as opportunism’, related to experimentation, autonomy and identity development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0268580911423055">Lightfoot, 1997</xref>). The first agrees with the general sociological perspective that views noncompliance as leading to negative life outcomes. The second perspective recognizes that risk-taking, which could be also conceptualized as breaking social norms, could be related to agentic qualities of adolescents whose risk-taking is both future- and goal-oriented. Social psychologists also connect noncompliant behavior to greater leadership ability and to intellectual competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0268580911423055">Crutchfield, 1955</xref>) and to more self-confidence in evaluative situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580911423055">Crowne and Liverant, 1963</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580911423055">Chassin et al. (1988)</xref> claim that, in some situations, deviance denotes independence and autonomy (‘constructive’ deviance). Their research focused on smoking and found that adolescent smokers who are higher on ‘constructive’ deviance are less influenced by their peers, have a higher internal locus of control and are less alienated from school and family. Thus, the psychological literature suggests that under certain conditions, noncompliance can be related to personality characteristics that are socially acceptable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0268580911423055">
<title>Negative effects of noncompliance</title>
<p>The sociological and youth development literatures, however, have adopted a consistently negative view of the effects of adolescent noncompliance. Noncompliance in adolescence is linked to dropping out of school and lower educational achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580911423055">Alexander et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0268580911423055">Tanner et al., 1999</xref>), and to anti-social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0268580911423055">Gottfredson and Hirschi, 1990</xref>). The sociological literature strongly suggests that conformists tend to have higher educational and occupational attainment. Adolescent noncompliance is thought to have a direct negative effect on educational attainment, but mainly an indirect negative effect on occupational attainment, operating through its effect on educational attainment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580911423055">Alexander et al. (1997)</xref> found that poor attitudes and undisciplined behavior among children in the first grade have a strong impact on eventual school success. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0268580911423055">Tanner et al. (1999)</xref> concluded that all measures of adolescent delinquency (including skipping school) have negative effects on occupational status, as well as on educational attainment. In addition, they found that skipping school increased the likelihood of being unemployed as an adult. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0268580911423055">Davies and Tanner (2003)</xref> found that even fairly weak sanctions on deviance, such as being suspended or expelled from school, have subsequent negative effects on occupational attainment.</p>
<p>All of the aforementioned studies of noncompliance were conducted in relatively stable societies that were not undergoing major societal changes. We focus, however, on the effect of noncompliance on occupational attainment in unstable and unpredictable societal conditions. We anticipate that the relationship between noncompliance and occupational attainment differs from what the traditional sociological literature suggests when using stable societies as a baseline.</p>
<p>We expect that in a highly predictable society in which norms and laws are well established and consistent, those who comply with the rules are advantaged because they are rewarded for being compliant, or at least they are not punished. In contrast, in a society in flux, the situation may be the opposite. Someone who is accustomed to following authorities’ rules may lack the initiative to operate successfully in an unpredictable society. Unpredictable situations are likely to impede the efforts of compliant individuals in adopting successful behaviors. Also, compliant individuals are more likely to invest in previously existing career paths that are less risky and relatively stable, even though those career paths may be adversely affected by social changes.</p>
<p>People with experience in not complying with rules are comparatively advantaged in transitional situations because they do not expect guidance from regulations and authorities. Adults who were noncompliant youth might be more willing to take risks in situations where it is unclear what is allowed and what is not allowed. Therefore, they may find it easier to operate in an unpredictable society and may achieve greater economic success than people who are accustomed to being compliant. Thus, we argue that minor to moderate noncompliance of adolescents in school helped to prepare adults for the weakening of authority and rule structures after the collapse of the Soviet Union: they were less handicapped by the lack of clear norms, by changing policies and by contradictory laws common to transitional societies.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section5-0268580911423055">
<title>Societies in transition: Post-Soviet societies</title>
<p>In the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union, there was uncertainty in three distinct areas relevant to our study of the effects of noncompliance: (1) laws, (2) norms, and (3) the opportunity structure. Changes in these three areas lasted for a number of years, making it unclear which economic activities were permitted by laws and approved by societal norms. Under these conditions, the consequences of adolescent noncompliance on adult occupational outcomes could be positive rather than negative.</p>
<sec id="section6-0268580911423055">
<title>Changes in laws</title>
<p>Fluctuations in laws covering property rights, taxes and contracts in post-Soviet societies are well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0268580911423055">Hahn, 1996</xref>). Starting in 1991, former Soviet republics and smaller administrative units began to create their own laws, which often contradicted regulations at higher administrative levels. For example, in its constitutional charter, Russia’s Kurgan oblast claimed the unilateral right to pre-empt federal laws, whereas the Sverdlovsk oblast obtained the federal government’s approval for this.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0268580911423055">1</xref></sup> Still more confusing, some tax laws were changed retroactively in Ukraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0268580911423055">Van Zon, 1998</xref>). Contradictions in state policies were common in all post-Soviet countries because of gaps in legal coverage, rushed and reissued regulations and legal differences at different administrative levels. It was very difficult for an average person to know what new laws would come into being and what those new laws might allow or forbid.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0268580911423055">
<title>Changes in norms</title>
<p>A similar type of uncertainty applied to social norms. Comparing the extent of change in values from 1991 to 1995, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0268580911423055">Lauristin and Vihalemm (1997)</xref> found a considerably larger shift in values in rapidly changing Estonia than in relatively stable Sweden. They reported that the speed of change varied by subpopulations, such as generational cohort and minority/majority ethnic group status. Thus, both the speed of normative change and the lack of uniformity in norms across subpopulations contributed to uncertainty in social norms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0268580911423055">
<title>Changes in the opportunity structure</title>
<p>In the Soviet Union the labor market was heavily controlled by authorities and legislative structures. Institutional and legal arrangements in socialist societies, such as residence permits and tenure-related benefits, and social condemnation of active job-shopping limited voluntary labor mobility by design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423055">Gimpleson and Lippoldt, 2001</xref>). Tenure and loyalty were rewarded. During the transition from the Soviet regime, the opportunity structure in the labor market began to change, as evidenced by shifts in barriers to entry, job vacancies and job allocation.</p>
<p>First, the state’s centralized allocation of jobs was discontinued near the end of the 1980s and completely dismantled by 1992. Until then, graduates from an institution of higher education were allocated to a position in which they were required to stay for two to three years before they were permitted to initiate their own career moves. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423055">Clarke (1999)</xref>, before 1992, almost two-thirds of those completing higher education and half of those completing technical education were assigned to their first jobs.</p>
<p>Additionally, the industrial distribution of jobs changed after the collapse of the Soviet command economy. Manufacturing declined abruptly in all post-Soviet areas. In Russia, the sharpest decline in industrial production occurred in 1992–4, when output in most branches of industry fell by 45 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423055">Clarke, 1999</xref>). Light industry (e.g., textile, clothing and shoe manufacturing) was almost extinguished within Russia by 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580911423055">Clarke, 1999</xref>). In addition, there were steep declines in employment in the large and medium-sized enterprises that were the main employers in the Soviet command economy. In contrast, employment in small businesses grew significantly. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0268580911423055">Gimpleson and Lippoldt (2001)</xref>, labor turnover (i.e. the net change in employees in enterprises) in Russia was higher for blue-collar workers than for white-collar workers. They argued that much of the turnover was linked to the reallocation of labor from large and medium-sized enterprises to smaller firms.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0268580911423055">
<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>We argue that the effect of adolescent noncompliance on occupational status is different between a stable society and an unstable society that is experiencing changes in norms, laws and the opportunity structure. As proposed by earlier research, we expect adolescent noncompliance to have <italic>negative</italic> effects on occupational status in stable societies.</p>
<p><italic>H1</italic>: Adolescent noncompliance has negative effects on adults’ occupational status in stable, predictable socioeconomic environments.</p>
<p>Before 1992, the normative and legal environment in the Soviet Union was relatively stable and clear; the opportunity structure was set by the authorities. Thus, it was a stable, predictable society. Therefore, we expect hypothesis H1 to apply for the relationship between adolescent noncompliance and occupational status before the collapse of the Soviet Union (i.e. before 1992).</p>
<p>However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, all three structural conditions discussed in the previous section – uncertain norms, confusion about laws and a changing opportunity structure – existed. We argue that those accustomed to following rules found it more difficult to operate in an environment where norms, rules and laws were in flux. It is likely that the unpredictable environment made it difficult for those who were compliant to adapt successfully in the labor market as the rules to follow were continually changing. On the other hand, those with the experience of not complying with rules were less affected by unpredictability as they were less concerned about following rules and less dependent on having clear directions from authorities. We also think that they were more likely to take on new types of jobs (i.e. jobs in new industries or in new types of enterprises, such as work in the private sector). Therefore, we propose that those with the experience of breaking school rules were actually advantaged in terms of occupational attainment in unstable, unpredictable socioeconomic environments.</p>
<p><italic>H2</italic>: Adolescent noncompliance has <italic>positive</italic> effects on adults’ occupational status in <italic>unstable, unpredictable</italic> socioeconomic environments.</p>
<p>However, even in unstable and unpredictable societies, the level of predictability can vary across economic sectors, such as between private and state sectors. Following the logic above, the positive effect of noncompliance should be stronger in the less predictable and more unstable economic sectors.</p>
<p><italic>H3</italic>: Adolescent noncompliance has greater <italic>positive</italic> effects on adults’ occupational status in the <italic>least stable and least predictable</italic> economic sectors of a society.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the private sector was less regulated and changed much more rapidly than the state sector. The state sector retained the practices and organizational structures of the Soviet era to a considerable extent. Thus, even though change occurred in all sectors of the economy, uncertainty was much more prevalent in the private sector than in the state sector. For this reason, we expect that adolescent noncompliance has either no effect or only weak positive effects on occupational attainment in the state sector, but has a clearly positive effect on occupational attainment in the private sector.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0268580911423055">
<title>Data</title>
<p>To test our hypotheses about the effects of adolescent noncompliance, we use data from the Paths of a Generation (PG) study, initiated and directed by Mikk Titma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0268580911423055">Titma and Tuma, 1995</xref>). PG is a longitudinal study of a sample of one generation of youth in selected regions of the Soviet Union who were about to graduate from secondary school in 1983–4. We use the data from the first and the fourth waves of this longitudinal study. At the time of the first wave, the respondents were typically 17–18 years old. At the time of the third follow-up (the fourth wave) in 1997–9 the respondents were typically 32–33 years old. Our main independent variable, adolescent noncompliance, is measured during the first wave of the study when respondents were in secondary school. Our two dependent variables come from the last (fourth) wave of the study: (1) occupation of the first job is measured retrospectively (first job before the end of 1991); and (2) occupation at the time of the fourth wave of the study. Five former Soviet regions are included in the study: Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, the Kurgan region of Russia and the Kharkiv region of Ukraine. The total sample size is 7822 respondents; the regional sample sizes vary from 1194 in Kurgan to 2167 in Latvia.</p>
<sec id="section11-0268580911423055">
<title>Adolescent noncompliance</title>
<p>The Soviet educational system was highly centralized and governed by near-universal rules. The rules ranged from a centralized curriculum to student uniforms and clear norms of behavior in school. Schools were hierarchical, and school authorities’ rules were rarely challenged openly. As a representative of the educational institution, the teacher was always taken to be correct within a classroom, and the principal was always correct in matters concerning the school. Those who disobeyed school rules received negative sanctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0268580911423055">Tuma and Titma, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>For example, student uniforms were required at all levels of school. If a student omitted an item (e.g., left a hat at home), punishment was expected (e.g., the student was sent home to get the hat). Similarly, skipping school and being late were not tolerated. Students were not permitted to argue with teachers or to speak up in class unless called upon by the teacher. When students wanted to speak, either on their own initiative or in response to a teacher’s question, they had to signal this by raising an arm. Even students’ movements during breaks between classes were regulated: students were often required to walk in a circle, two students at a time, like fish swimming in a bowl.</p>
<p>Because the schools in the Soviet Union were centrally directed and governed by near-universal rules, conceptualizing noncompliance as rule-breaking in school gives us a relatively consistent concept of noncompliance across the different regions of the Soviet Union. In addition, it ensures that we measure noncompliance before entering the labor force, i.e. chronologically before the outcomes of interest.</p>
<p>Specifically, our measure of adolescent noncompliance is based on secondary school students’ responses in 1983–4 (wave 1) to three questions pertaining to: (1) skipping school (never, rarely, sometimes and often); (2) having conflicts with teachers and school authorities (no, yes); and (3) disobeying school rules (disagree strongly, disagree, agree and agree strongly). Approximately 33 percent of all youth reported only compliant behaviors. Another 35 percent reported one noncompliant behavior. Almost 25 percent reported two noncompliant behaviors; and 8 percent of respondents reported all three noncompliant behaviors.</p>
<p>Of the three types of noncompliant behaviors, not following school rules was reported the most frequently (by 50 percent of all respondents). Skipping school (sometimes or often) was reported by 38 percent of the respondents. Conflicts with teachers and school authorities were reported even less often (by 20 percent of the respondents). Those who reported any single noncompliant behavior were more likely to report another type of noncompliance (χ<sup>2</sup> test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>We employed Item Response Theory to create an index of noncompliance using the graded response model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0268580911423055">Samejima (1969)</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0268580911423055">2</xref></sup> The final scale of noncompliance was transformed to vary between 0 and 1.

<title>Occupational stratum</title>
<p>The occupational stratum of the respondents’ first full-time job before 1992 and their job at the third follow-up (fourth wave) in 1997–9 was reported in the fourth wave of the study. Occupation is measured using the 1988 ISCO (International Standard Code of Occupations) scale. For simplicity, we reduced this coding to seven strata, one of which was ‘not working’. The occupation of the first job was used if the first full-time job occurred before 1992. About 9 percent of respondents had never had a job before 1992. About 30 percent of respondents had a first job as a skilled or unskilled worker (used as a reference group, labeled ‘worker’); 7 percent as a worker in agriculture; 12 percent as a salesperson, service-worker, or clerk; 17 percent as a semi-professional; 21 percent as a professional; and about 4 percent as a manager.</p>
<p>The same coding scheme was applied to the respondents’ occupation in 1997–9, where it was found that about 23 percent of respondents were ‘not working’, 20 percent were workers, 5 percent worked in agriculture and 11 percent worked in sales, services, or as clerks. In addition, about 13 percent were semi-professionals, nearly 20 percent were professionals and about 8 percent were managers. The percentage of people without a job is higher in 1997–9 (23 percent) than for the first job before 1992 (9 percent). This is probably because occupational status at 1997–9 refers to a point in time; whereas occupational status of the first job is recorded if the person ever had a full-time job before 1992.</p>

<sec id="section13-0268580911423055">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>We control for several variables widely used in the attainment literature: gender, urban/rural location, parents’ and respondent’s years of education and grade point average (GPA) in the last academic year of secondary school. We also control for the region, using the Kharkiv region in Ukraine as an omitted category (Kharkiv is selected because it is closest to the average level of change among the five regions included in the study). Region is effect-coded, thus the regression coefficients indicate a difference from the overall mean of regions and do not estimate the difference from the Kharkiv region. Social psychological characteristics have been included in a number of attainment studies (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0268580911423055">Pulkkinen and Caspi, 2002</xref>) and are hypothesized to be especially important during the transition from a socialist system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0268580911423055">Pals and Tuma, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0268580911423055">Słomczyński and Mach, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0268580911423055">Titma and Tuma, 2005</xref>). Therefore, we include 1983–4 measures of self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0268580911423055">Rosenberg, 1965</xref>) and locus of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0268580911423055">Rotter, 1966</xref>). Both measures are described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0268580911423055">Pals and Tuma (2004)</xref>. We also control for participation in the Soviet second economy – the informal sector of the Soviet economy. It is measured retrospectively at wave 4 (1997–9) as engagement in entrepreneurial activities before 1992, which was before private business was widely legalized in the former Soviet Union. A respondent participated in the Soviet second economy if he or she engaged in any of the following activities either with or without a license: trading; making or growing things to sell; providing services to others for payment; or working in one’s own business. About 10 percent of the sample was engaged in the Soviet second economy; only about half a percent of respondents reported any licensed entrepreneurial activities. Participation in the Soviet second economy, often an illegal entrepreneurial activity during Soviet times, may have prepared people to operate in the unpredictable transition following the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We examine the effect of adolescent noncompliance on occupational status of the first job before 1992 in order to compare the effect of adolescent noncompliance during a relatively stable period (before the collapse of the Soviet Union) to its effect during a relatively unstable period (1997–9; after the collapse of the Soviet Union). According to our hypotheses, adolescent noncompliance has either no effect or a negative effect on occupational status before the collapse of the Soviet Union (H1; stable and predictable society) but a positive effect on occupational status in 1997–9 (H2; unstable and unpredictable society).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0268580911423055">Table 2</xref> presents the results of the multinomial logistic regression of the status of the first job before 1992 (thus, in a stable society); the estimated effects are relative to skilled and unskilled workers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0268580911423055">3</xref></sup> Including adolescent noncompliance in the model does not significantly improve the model fit. Adolescent noncompliance increases the likelihood of not having worked compared to having a first job as a worker, but it does not significantly affect the likelihood of a first job as a manager, professional, or semi-professional rather than as a skilled or unskilled worker. Thus, before the major societal changes, adolescent noncompliance does not have a positive effect on the status of the first job. Rather, it may have a negative effect as it increases the chances of not having had a first job before 1992. Those who were noncompliant in secondary school were less likely to enter the labor force before 1992 than those who were compliant. However, the effects of adolescent noncompliance are not significant for any of the occupational strata except for not having a job. Furthermore, years of education increases the chances of not having a job before 1992 rather than being a worker. This indicates that for some, the reason for not having a job before 1992 could have been that they were still students.</p>

<p>Interestingly, participation in the Soviet second economy does not affect occupational status of the first job before 1992. Participation in the Soviet second economy is a proxy for being able to operate in an uncertain environment, since the activities in the Soviet second economy were not legally permitted. However, this experience does not have any influence on occupational status before the major societal changes – before the unpredictability of the society.</p>
<p>Another interesting result refers to regional differences. The likelihood of being a manager or a professional as compared to the likelihood of being a worker is higher for youths in Estonia and Latvia, but not in the Kurgan region of Russia. In Belarus, the coefficients for both managers and professionals are significant and negative; this indicates that, compared to other regions, it was more difficult for youth to fill these positions in Belarus.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0268580911423055">Table 3</xref> reports the results of a multinomial logistic regression of the status of the respondent’s occupation in 1997–9 (thus, the occupational status in an unstable and unpredictable society). The traditional predictors of occupational attainment exhibit the expected patterns of effects. The occupational status of the first job before 1992 has significant effects for many categories of the status of the job in 1997–9. This is not surprising; it means that the status of the first job is a strong predictor of career achievement later in life.</p>

<p>In contrast to our findings regarding the occupational status of the first job before 1992, participation in the Soviet second economy increases the likelihood of being a manager in 1997–9. We found that the experience of operating in the uncertain environment of the Soviet second economy did not affect the status of the first job before 1992, when society was still relatively stable. However, this experience is clearly useful for the job market in 1997–9; it increases someone’s chances of being a manager. At the same time, those who participated in the Soviet second economy are also more likely to be without a job in 1997–9 or to work in agriculture or as a semi-professional. The regional difference disappears for the likelihood of being a professional. The same pattern as in the Soviet period, however, is observed for the likelihood of being a manager. Young people in Estonia and Latvia are more likely to work as a manager than the youth in other regions.</p>
<p>Including adolescent noncompliance in the model improves the model fit significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The effect of adolescent noncompliance on occupational status in 1997–9 is different from its effect on the first job before 1992. Adolescent noncompliance does not increase the likelihood of being unemployed in 1997–9 (in contrast to its effect before 1992). Further, it significantly increases the chances of being a manager in 1997–9. To reveal the magnitude of the effect more clearly, we translated the coefficient to a percentage change in odds. A one standard deviation increase in adolescent noncompliance increases the odds of being a manager as compared to a worker by 11 percent. Changing noncompliance from the lowest score (0) to the highest score (1) increases the odds of being a manager as compared to a worker by 74 percent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0268580911423055">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>To test the hypothesis regarding differing effects of adolescent noncompliance in the state and private sectors (H3; state sector being the relatively stable one and private sector being the more unpredictable sector), we divided the occupational categories in 1997–9 into two groups: the occupational strata in the private sector (working in private firms, self-employment and working in joint stock companies)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0268580911423055">5</xref></sup> and the corresponding strata in the state sector (state companies, state-financed firms and kolkhozes).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0268580911423055">6</xref></sup> The effects of adolescent noncompliance are basically the same in the state and private sectors for lower-status occupational outcomes, such as being an agricultural worker or a clerk or a semi-professional. However, the effects of noncompliance on both professionals and managers differ in the two sectors. Therefore, the final model, reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0268580911423055">Table 4</xref>, distinguishes between the state and private sectors for professionals and managers but does not distinguish these two sectors for other occupational strata. Being a worker is still the reference category. Adding adolescent noncompliance to a model with only control variables increases the fit of the model significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<p>The first column for both professionals and managers refers to the private sector; the second refers to the state sector. The effects of adolescent noncompliance differ for professionals and managers in the private and state sectors. Adolescent noncompliance does not affect the likelihood of being a professional or a manager rather than a worker in the stable state sector, but it does significantly increase the likelihood of being a professional or a manager rather than a worker in the unpredictable private sector. A one standard deviation increase in adolescent noncompliance increases the odds of being a professional in the private sector by 24 percent and the odds of being a manager in the private sector by 16 percent.</p>
<p>Those who were noncompliant in adolescence seem to be better equipped to succeed in the private sector after the collapse of the Soviet Union than those who were compliant as adolescents. The two significantly positive effects of adolescent noncompliance in the private sector suggest that adolescent noncompliance makes a greater difference in unstable, unpredictable social environments, such as those in the private sector.</p>
<p>To understand the results better, we compute the estimated effects of adolescent noncompliance on the likelihood of becoming a professional or a manager in both state and private sectors, holding all other variables constant. We vary only the level of adolescent noncompliance and calculate the predicted probability of being a professional or a manager in each sector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0268580911423055">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The solid lines show the estimated effects of adolescent noncompliance in the private sector; the dashed lines represent the corresponding effects in the state sector. For both professionals and managers, adolescent noncompliance has essentially no effect on the probabilities of being a professional or a manager in the state sector. In fact, its effect on the probability of being a professional in the state sector is actually slightly negative, although not significant. In contrast, the predicted probability of being a manager or a professional in the private sector increases sharply as adolescent noncompliance increases. The predicted probability of being a professional in the private sector for a typical male who was completely compliant in adolescence is about .02, whereas it is about .06 for an otherwise similar male who was noncompliant as an adolescent. The predicted probability of being a manager in the private sector increases from .06 to .10 as adolescent compliance increases from the most compliant to the most noncompliant.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We argue that societal transition and the unpredictability of social context determine the effects of noncompliance. An unstable and unpredictable society is characterized by ambiguity in norms; confusion about what is and is not permitted; uncertainty of what is and what is not legal; what might be the punishment for breaking the law; and an abundance of new possibilities that an innovative individual might exploit to get ahead. We find that, in this kind of unpredictable society, those who were noncompliant as adolescents are better able to adapt to, and profit from, the change in norms and laws than those who were more compliant as adolescents.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that the effects of adolescent noncompliance on labor market outcomes vary by the level of unpredictability in society. We use two different approaches to test this hypothesis. First, we compare the effects of adolescent noncompliance on occupational status before and after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the relatively stable society before the major societal changes (i.e. before 1992), we find that adolescent noncompliance has no significant impact on the occupational status of the first job. However, during the period of rapid societal changes in the years just after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when the society was unpredictable, adolescent noncompliance significantly increases the likelihood of working as a manager.</p>
<p>A second test of the argument that the effects of noncompliance depend on societal context distinguishes between working in the state and private sectors. In the relatively well-regulated and stable state sector we find that adolescent noncompliance does not have a significant effect on occupational status. However, adolescent noncompliance significantly increases the chances of being a manager or a professional (the highest occupational statuses) in the new and rapidly developing private sector. Both tests support the general argument of our research: the effects of adolescent noncompliance on labor market outcomes are different in social environments with different levels of unpredictability. Contrary to the general notion that adolescent noncompliance always has negative effects, our research shows that in unpredictable environments, noncompliance can have <italic>positive</italic> effects on occupational outcomes.</p>
<p>Several mechanisms might be behind the positive effects of adolescent noncompliance on occupational attainment in unpredictable societies. Our data do not allow us to differentiate between these mechanisms. We speculate that those who were accustomed to complying with school rules before the collapse of the Soviet Union were less comfortable in the unpredictable rapidly changing society because they were trying to follow the many new rules and laws. After the collapse of the Soviet Union the regulations were often not in place or changed rapidly – making strict compliance very difficult. Those with the experience of breaking rules were more comfortable in the circumstance of unclear norms and rules and less worried about punishment for ignoring regulations, and thus were more comfortable operating in an unpredictable society. We see this especially clearly in the comparison between the relatively stable state sector and unstable private sector: adolescent noncompliance has strong positive effects on occupational status in the private sector (increasing the likelihood of being a professional or manager) but not in the state sector.</p>
<p>The argument presented here is important for several reasons. The first and most obvious is the need to consider how effects of noncompliance depend on societal context. We find positive effects of adolescent noncompliance on occupational attainment in rapidly changing, unpredictable social structures and the absence of any positive effect in the earlier, relatively stable structures. Thus, the mechanisms that operate in stable societies do not necessarily apply in transitional, rapidly changing societies. Sometimes social changes affect the nature of the relationships between different phenomena. Distinctive explanations may be needed to describe the mechanisms that apply in rapidly changing societies.</p>
<p>Second, this study sheds light on the importance of differentiating between the kinds of noncompliance based on the seriousness of rule-breaking. The effects of criminal deviance on occupational status are unlikely to be the same as what we found using the much milder measure of adolescent noncompliance – even in rapidly changing societies. Criminal deviance in adolescence probably increases the likelihood of adult criminal activity in all types of societies. Sometimes crime leads to monetary gain, but it rarely increases social status.</p>
<p>Our study focuses on a single generation – people who were 17–18 years old and in secondary school in 1983–4, entered the labor force in the final few years of the Soviet Union and were in their early thirties in 1997–9. The data do not allow us to investigate the effects of noncompliance on occupational outcomes for older adults in this generation or for other generations, whatever their ages.</p>
<p>Further research is needed to investigate the more general applicability of the theoretical ideas presented here. But there is no reason to believe that the patterns we have found are particular to post-Soviet societies or to other societies undergoing a transition from socialism or communism. Rather, we think that the arguments made here are likely to apply in any societal structure with a high level of unpredictability. New industries and start-up companies illustrate settings with high levels of unpredictability due to unsettled norms, ill-defined regulations and unclear structures of authority. In such settings, adolescent noncompliance may offer benefits to adults seeking to get ahead. Alternatively, similar conditions could potentially be found in other societies in transition that have experienced major legal and economic changes. It remains to be seen whether the positive effects of adolescent noncompliance in transitional post-Soviet societies will persist after these societies develop more stable economic and social systems. The mechanisms that we have hypothesized here may cease to operate in societies where new social changes have already become institutionalized.</p>
