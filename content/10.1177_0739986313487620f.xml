<p>What is the truth behind the “American Dream” and what are the harsh realities faced by immigrant youth who are often excluded from reaping its benefits? Lisa Patel grapples with this particular question as she describes how newcomer immigrant youth, namely, those who are undocumented, offer a unique perspective on the laws of inclusion and exclusion in America. Patel’s ethnographic study tells the stories of immigrant youth through a sociological lens to analyze not just how immigrant youth experience the United States but the core ways in which national, economic, social, and political borders are drawn and redrawn. Instead of encountering the idealized “American Dream,” Patel argues that immigrant youth often encounter a number of new “borders” in U.S. society (long after the physical migration they experience from one country to another is completed) that constantly remind them of their exclusion from the mainstream and of the countless obstacles they face toward economic and social mobility.</p>
<p>Each chapter of the book opens with an ethnographic description followed by an analysis of its context. The narrative descriptions were gathered from student respondents at an all-immigrant, public high school in Boston, and a school the author collaborated with for 6 years. The themes of many of the chapters align with many of the political, social, and economic issues faced by immigrant youth such as the implications of involuntary migration, financial barriers and lack of human capital to gaining legal status, the psychological toll of undocumented status on youth, high rates of emotional and physical abuse to immigrant females, restrictive origin-culture gender constructs, family separation and reunification patterns, language brokering by these youth for their immigrant parents, and finally the number of educational challenges they face in U.S. society. Patel also argues that despite the attractiveness of legal status in this nation, the barriers to inclusion for many of these immigrant youth do not cease after they gain documentation. Often after this milestone, the undocumented status of other family members, namely, their parents and siblings, still presents obstacles to their eligibility for financial aid (given the need for parental tax documents for eligibility) and the possibility of going away to college considering their roles as financial pillars and cultural anchors of their immediate families.</p>
<p>Aside from focusing on the many challenges faced by immigrant youth toward complete inclusion in American society, there is also a large focus on the pedagogy of schooling immigrant youth. Patel argues that although no teacher preparation program can begin to fully prepare teachers to deal with marginalized student groups that face many different kinds of challenges, training teachers to be good <italic>learners</italic> (rather than robots who solely strive for efficiency and improving test scores) could go a long way. Throughout her time at Franklin High School, Patel describes constantly witnessing immigrant students engaging in “studenting”—figuring out the requirements of an assignment or test to get the best grade—rather than authentic learning. The contemporary structure of schooling, she argues, is to blame for this. She claims that although many teacher education programs tend to focus on how to create good learning environments for students in classrooms, these programs do not often differentiate between pursuing the simple completion of an academic task and genuine learning. Furthermore, policies such as No Child Left Behind and those pursued by the Obama administration in improving the national school system via a staunch focus on improving test scores only exacerbates this problem, moving the focus from learning to performance. Patel argues that due to this structure in schools, even the most dedicated and well-intentioned teachers find their hands tied and forced to focus on state requirements rather than fostering critical thinking in the classroom. She stresses that unless these requirements are revisited with the narratives of these immigrant students in mind, they will continue to allow many to fall through the cracks of the U.S. educational system.</p>
<p>Patel concludes on a hopeful note by describing the process of “rethinking contact zones” to provide immigrant youth with opportunities for growth and success amid the myriad of challenges they face. Contact zones are described as “The social spaces where cultures meet, clash, and grapple with each other, often in contexts of highly asymmetrical relations of power, such as colonialism, slavery, or their aftermaths.” She urges local communities to implement programs such as the internship program inspired by her research, which was designed to provide immigrant youth with exposure to different social circles to research, understand, and change what counts as success and intelligence across different contexts. By doing so, Patel argues these youth will have access to the analytic and linguistic tools necessary to name their realities and determine for themselves what meaningful inclusion would and should look like.</p>
<p>I found the points raised by Patel regarding the often tumultuous narratives of immigrant youth in U.S. society and the overarching argument of her work to be extremely compelling and insightful. Her use of empirical evidence woven throughout her exploratory, ethnographic account supported her arguments as she simultaneously used logos and ethos to express her points to readers in a powerful way. However, one way in which the work fell short for me was the depth of description given of her key respondents. On reading the first pages and discovering the ethnographic nature of the book, I was prepared to get an in-depth look at the lives and voices of these immigrant youth given the many years she spent with them. However, there were relatively few direct quotations.</p>
