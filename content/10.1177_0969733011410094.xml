<abstract>
<p>Caring for older persons is both rewarding and consuming. Work with older people in Finland has been shown to be more burdensome than in the other Nordic countries. The aim of this study was to try out a Finnish version of the Stress of Conscience Questionnaire (SCQ) and explore stress of conscience in staff caring for older persons in Finland. The data were collected from the nursing staff (<italic>n</italic> = 350) working with older people in health centre wards, municipal and private nursing homes, and municipal and private dementia care units in Finland. It emerged clearly from the results that Finnish nursing staff mostly felt that they did not have enough time to provide good care to patients, and this gave them a troubled conscience. They also felt that the demanding work taxed their energy, a consequence being that they could not give their own families and loved ones the attention they would have liked. </p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Working with older persons in health and social care is both rewarding and consuming. Studies in the Nordic countries<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011410094">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011410094">2</xref>
</sup> showed that care providers experienced their work as meaningful and that they were satisfied with their work, but that they also experienced work as physically and mentally burdensome. Compared to the other Nordic countries, caring for older persons in Finland was experienced as more burdensome, feelings of inadequacy were more common and the threat of violence highest.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011410094">1</xref>
</sup> Other studies have shown staff caring for older persons to feel that they have too much responsibility and too little formal power, that they are undervalued, vulnerable and not appreciated, and they have feelings of guilt and shame.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011410094">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011410094">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011410094">5</xref>
</sup> One of the factors explaining job satisfaction in nursing homes is the amount of time available to assist the residents with daily life activities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0969733011410094">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0969733011410094">7</xref>
</sup> </p>
<p>Personnel caring for older persons can thus be said to experience many forms of stress. Workplace stress is a multi-factorial phenomenon involving the relationship between the individual and the environment, where aspects in the environment are perceived as more or less stressful in relationship to the individual’s coping resources.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733011410094">8</xref>
</sup> A prolonged feeling of stress can result in stress-related diseases and burnout.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011410094">9</xref>
</sup> The feelings of physical and mental strain, the feeling of inadequacy and of not having enough time to assist the residents, which were reported in the studies mentioned above, can all be seen as expressions of not having adequate resources to cope. In nursing homes stress can originate from the workplace as a whole, from interactions between the care provider and co-workers at unit level and from interactions between the care provider and the residents and their families.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0969733011410094">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011410094">11</xref>
</sup> </p>
<p>Ethical challenges, such as respecting the autonomy of the resident, acting in a fair manner and fulfilling professional responsibilities and duties, have been shown to be one source of stress in nursing homes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0969733011410094">11</xref>
</sup> The concepts ‘moral stress’ and ‘moral distress’ refer specifically to the way in which care providers react to ethical challenges. Moral stress is experienced when struggling to make a decision in a situation where two ethical principles are in conflict with one another and the care provider has difficulties deciding what would be the right thing to do.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0969733011410094">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011410094">13</xref>
</sup> Moral distress again is experienced when the ethically correct line of action is known but is not carried out because of internal constraints, such as personal failings, or external constraints, such as shortage of staff, lack of time or organizational barriers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011410094">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011410094"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011410094">15</xref>
</sup> Lützén et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011410094">16</xref>
</sup> used the concept ‘moral stress’ to refer to both types of ethical stress. They identified nurses’ moral sensitivity to the vulnerabilities of patients, external constraints and nurses’ feeling that they have no control over the situation as preconditions of moral stress.</p>
<p>In Sweden, Norberg and colleagues have identified and studied an additional type of stress, stress of conscience. They use the term ‘stress of conscience’ to refer to stress related to troubled conscience; conscience refers to an inner voice, a moral compass or a set of integrated moral values guiding people how to be or how to act.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733011410094">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011410094">18</xref>
</sup> Troubled conscience is experienced when a person acts against his or her integrated moral values, when there is a discrepancy between the inner voice and the action taken or omitted.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733011410094">19</xref>
</sup> In order to measure stress of conscience a questionnaire (SCQ) was developed and validated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011410094">18</xref>
</sup> Studies of nurses and nurses’ aides in care of older persons showed that lacking the time to provide the care the patient needed and experiencing work to be so demanding that the care provider did not have enough energy to devote to her/his family had the highest scores on the SCQ.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733011410094">20</xref>
</sup> There was also a strong relationship between stress of conscience and burnout.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011410094">21</xref>
</sup> </p>
<p>Since caring for older persons in Finland has been shown to be more burdensome than in the other Nordic countries,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011410094">1</xref>
</sup> it would be interesting to find out whether stress of conscience is higher in the Finnish staff than Swedish. The aim of this study was to try out a Finnish version of the SCQ and explore stress of conscience in personnel caring for older people in Finland.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0969733011410094">
<title>Sample and dropout</title>
<p>The data were collected from the nursing staff working with older people with dementia in health centre wards, municipal and private nursing homes, and municipal and private dementia care units in Finland using stratified sampling. Health care centre wards (<italic>N</italic> = 307), municipal (<italic>N</italic> = 388) and private nursing homes (<italic>N</italic> = 53), municipal (<italic>N</italic> = 37) and private dementia care units (<italic>N</italic> = 14) formed five different strata, from which 436 employees from 45 institutions were chosen using systematic sampling.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733011410094">22</xref>
</sup> In Finland, nursing homes are the most common form of long-term care facility, traditionally administrated through social services, and provide care for residents whose physical and cognitive performance have deteriorated. Health centre wards provide care for the most ill and frail long-term residents. Dementia care units provide nursing care with specially trained staff for older people in the various stages of dementia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0969733011410094">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The data were collected between April and August 2009. The care management at each institution was contacted via telephone and their willingness to participate in the study was inquired. In the case of a positive reply, procedures concerning the permission to carry out the study were agreed upon. Questionnaires were then mailed to the contact person at the institution, who handed them out to the care personnel using random sampling. Participation in care of older persons with dementia was used as the selection criterion of the study. The questionnaire was mailed along with a cover letter in an envelope in which the respondent could seal the questionnaire after filling it in. The respondents had two weeks to respond to the questionnaire. After this, the envelopes were collected in a centralized manner in a return envelope that the institution’s contact person mailed back to the researcher. The response rate was 80.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 350). </p>
<p>Data were collected using a questionnaire that included measures of participants’ perceptions of conscience, stress of conscience and moral sensitivity: a total of 45 items. In this article the results achieved from the Stress of Conscience Questionnaire (SCQ) are presented. </p>
<p>The Swedish SCQ consisted originally of 10 items and was later comprised into nine items. In the Finnish version we decided to use all the original 10 items in order to test how the original scale worked. The Swedish SCQ consists of 10 items, each of which is divided into two parts, A and B. Part A concerns how often a selected stressful care situation occurs in the participant’s workplace. Participants are asked about 10 specific situations and the responses are given on a six-point Likert-type scale: ‘never’ (= 0), ‘less than once/six months’ (= 1), ‘more than once/six months’ (= 2), ‘every month’ (= 3), ‘every week’ (= 4), and ‘every day’ (= 5). Part A of each item is followed by part B, which asks about the degree of troubled conscience that each situation evokes when it occurs. The response is given on a 10-centimetre visual analogue scale ranging from ‘no, not at all’ (= 0) to ‘yes, it gives me a very troubled conscience’ (= 5). The participants were asked to respond to each item based on their personal experiences. An index was created as a measure of the stress related to troubled conscience by multiplying Part A of an item (how often a certain situation occurs) by Part B of the same item (how much troubled conscience the situation evokes when it occurs). For example, if a participant estimated a specified situation to happen every day (marked as 5 on the scale) and that specified situation gave him or her a very troubled conscience (marked as 5 on the scale) the SCQ index for that situation was 25. (18,20.)</p>
<p>The SCQ was translated from Swedish into Finnish by a professional translator. After that it was translated back to Swedish by a Swedish speaking RN, who had not seen the original version. Finally the second author (AS) and the professional translator reviewed and agreed upon the Finnish translation. </p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The research data were analysed statistically using SPSS for Windows 16.0. Distribution of variables was analysed using frequency and percentage distributions and descriptive statistics. </p>
<p>The variables (10) concerning Stress of conscience were condensed into two factors using explorative factor analysis (Varimax rotation). The variables with the highest loading on the resulting factors were formed into sum variables, whose internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0969733011410094">Table 1</xref>
). Since item no 5 correlated very weakly with the other variables, it was left out of the factor analysis. </p>

<title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>The application for the permission to carry out the study was made to senior nurses, consultants or social care managers. The cover letter mailed along with the questionnaire directed at nurses working in institutional care of older people with dementia informed them that participating in the study was voluntary and that the responses would be handled confidentially. The data were collected from 45 institutions and 350 nurses, meaning that the sample size was adequately large to protect the respondents so that individual respondents could not be identified. Handing out the questionnaire and returning it to the researcher was organized via institutional contact persons, which ensured that the identity of the respondents remained unknown. According to Finnish regulations, a review from an ethical committee was not necessary since the study involved only staff. </p>

<p>Only 23% of the respondents had participated in continuing education in the care of older people with dementia within the past year, while 40% of the respondents had not participated in continuing education at all. The respondents’ participation in continuing education in the care of older people with dementia correlated in a statistically highly significant manner with types of institutions (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and types of employment (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Over half of the nurses working in private dementia treatment units (58.8%) and 25.7% of nurses working in municipal dementia treatment units had participated in continuing education within the past year, while nearly half (47.7%) of nurses working in municipal nursing homes and 45.4% of nurses working in health care centre wards had not participated in continuing education at all. 73.20% of locums and 32.7% of nurses in permanent employment had not participated in continuing education at all.</p>
<p>Nearly half (45%) of the workplaces had between 10 and 20 patients. 18% of the workplaces were care units with more than 30 patients, and health care centre wards had the highest number of care units with more than 30 patients (36.6%). The highest number of respondents with education of registered nurses (41.8%) worked in health care centre wards, while 18.7% of respondents working in private dementia treatment and only 12% of respondents working in municipal dementia treatment were registered nurses. The majority of respondents who had education outside social and health care (11.5%) worked in municipal nursing homes (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p>Nearly 40% of the respondents (38%) reported that the care plans of clients and residents with dementia were reassessed and updated biannually in their workplace, while 31% reported that the care plans were reassessed and updated less frequently. Reassessing and updating of the dementing patients’ care plans was statistically very significantly linked with the type of institution (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Over 40% of municipal nursing homes (41.5%) and 35.5% of health care centre wards reassessed and updated the dementing patients’ care plans less frequently than biannually, while only 12.5% of private dementia treatment units reassessed and updated the dementing patients’ care plans that infrequently.</p>
<p>The use of primary nurse system was also statistically very significantly linked with the type of institution (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Nearly 40% (38.2%) of health centre wards did not use a primary nurse system, while each of the private nursing homes and private dementia treatment units used it. Primary nurse system means a method of organizing nursing care in which one nurse (the <italic>primary nurse</italic>) is responsible for assessing the older person, planning appropriate care, and evaluating the progress of that person throughout his or her stay in, for example, the nursing home.</p>

<title>Lack of inner strength and external forces</title>
<p>The items of stress of conscience (10) were loaded onto two factors. Variables included in the factors were formed into two sum variables: lack of inner strength and external forces (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0969733011410094">Table 1</xref>). </p>

<p>The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to study the lack of inner strength in groups of background variables. Statistically significant differences could be observed between the length of experience in working in the care of older people with dementia (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004) and different types of number of beds (<italic>p</italic> = 0.01), and somewhat significant differences in groups of different types of employment (<italic>p</italic> = 0.05). </p>
<p>Respondents with 10-19 years of working experience in the care of older people with dementia had the highest index of the SCQ (mean = 13.0, SD = 4.7), while respondents with less than five years of working experience in the care of older people with dementia had the lowest index (mean = 10.2, SD = 5.1). Respondents working in work units with more than 30 residents had the highest index of the SCQ (mean = 13.0, SD = 5.2), and respondents working in work units with fewer than 10 residents had the lowest index (mean = 8.6, SD = 4.7).

Respondents with vocational training in nursing had a higher index of the SCQ (mean = 8.4, SD = 4.1) than others: practical nurses (mean = 6.5, SD = 3.5), respondents who had other Social and Health Care branch education (mean = 8.2, SD = 3.9) and respondents who had education outside Social and Health Care (mean = 6.0, SD = 5.5). Respondents with two children living at home had the highest (mean = 8.6 SD = 4.0) and respondents with one child living at home the lowest index of the SCQ (mean = 6.2, SD = 3.7). Respondents who had chosen their current workplace because no other care work was available had the highest index of the SCQ (mean = 10.0, SD = 3.1), while respondents who had ended up working in the care of older people with dementia against their own will (e.g. on grounds of having been transferred from another ward) had the lowest index of the SCQ (mean = 6.3, SD = 1.5).</p>

<title>Reliability of the study</title>
<p>The questionnaire used in the study was based on an indicator used in earlier studies. The value of Cronbach’s alpha coefficient, used to study the internal consistency between two sum variables formed on the basis of factor analysis, was 0.66 for lack of inner strength and 0.76 for external forces. According to Polit and Beck,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011410094">24</xref>
</sup> internal consistency is sufficient if Cronbach’s alpha coefficient is above 0.6. The response rate of the study was 80.3%, which can be regarded as high, considering that the questionnaire was sent by mail and the topic of the study was ethically sensitive.<sup>

<title>Evaluation of the results</title>
<p>Respondents experienced that the stressful situation that occurred most commonly was the lack of time to provide the care needed by the older patients. They also felt that they mostly had to deal with incompatible demands in their work. Respondents experienced that these situations gave them a troubled conscience. These results are consistent with the findings of Glasberg et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011410094">18</xref>
</sup> </p>
<p>The items ‘How often do you lack the time to provide the care the patient needs?’ (item 1) and ‘Is your work in health care ever so demanding that you don’t have the energy to devote yourself to your family as you would like?’ (item 7) had the highest calculated SCQ index scores. These results are similar compared to the results of Juthberg et al. (21), who also studied staff caring for older persons. However, the mean of calculated indexes of Finnish nurses were 10.78 (item 1), 9.88 (item 7), 9.28 (item 9), 8.68 (item 3) and according to Juthberg et al. (21) the mean of calculated indexes were in Sweden 9.75 (item 1), 8.52 (item 7), 3.92 (item 9) and 5.82 (item 3), which indicates that the Finnish nurses experienced a higher level of stress in these areas. The items ‘Do you ever find yourself avoiding patients or family members who need help or support?’(item 5) and ‘Is your private life ever so demanding that you don’t have the energy to devote yourself to your work as you would like?’ (item 6) had the lowest calculated SCQ index scores. These results are consistent with the findings of Juthberg et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011410094">21</xref>
</sup> </p>
<p>Respondents stated also that item 10 ‘Do you ever feel that others are bothered by your willingness to provide good care?’ gave them less often a troubled conscience. </p>
<p>As the scores of Finnish nurses were on some points higher than those of Swedish nurses, caring for older people may be assumed to be more challenging in Finland than in Sweden, and Finnish nurses to be more stressed than the Swedish ones. The findings of Kröger et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011410094">1</xref>
</sup> also show that institutional older care is perceived as more burdensome in Finland compared to other Nordic countries. We assume, as also Noro et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733011410094">25</xref>
</sup> and Vähäkangas et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733011410094">26</xref>
</sup> have pointed out, that in Finland care of older people is probably understaffed.</p>
<p>Participants who had long working experience and who worked in wards with more than 30 beds experienced higher lack of inner strength than others. Long working experience gives deeper understanding of good care of older people with dementia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011410094">27</xref>
</sup> According Saarnio and Isola<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733011410094">28</xref>
</sup> attempts were being made to reduce the use of physical restraints in institutional elderly care by using alternative methods and long working experience promoted especially the use of alternative methods. On the other hand, large wards pose incompatible demands on nurses. Participants with a permanent post also had higher lack of inner strength than locums. The reason for this may be that they are well motivated and are also aware of the life span of older persons with dementia. Therefore, registered nurses react more sensitively to internal demands and feel more powerlessness than locums.</p>
<p>Registered nurses experienced higher external forces than others (e.g. practical nurses). Participants with two children living at home also experienced higher external forces than others. The education of registered nurses is multifaceted and longer, and they may have deeper understanding of the good care of older people. We suppose that registered nurses have more responsibility for the good care of older people because they are usually leaders of nursing teams in Finland. </p>
<p>There is an interesting finding associated with respondents’ background data, specifically the organization of nursing work. According to nearly 40% of the respondents working in health care centre wards, a personal/primary nurse system was not used in their workplace; instead, work was organized in some other way. This means that nurses must care for a large number of older patients, with little chance to look into the situation of individual patients. This may be one reason for the feeling of inadequacy and ‘troubled conscience’ seen among nurses working in elder care. </p>

<sec id="section17-0969733011410094">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The indicator (SCQ) used in the study worked reliably and the response rate was high. The indicator should therefore be utilised in the future when examining the perceptions of work-related stress among nurses working with older patients, clients and residents in Finland. The Finnish version of the SCQ should also be tested in other health care areas.</p>
<p>It emerged clearly from the results of this study that Finnish nursing staff mostly feel that they do not have enough time to provide good care to older patients, and this gives them a troubled conscience. Nurses also feel that the demanding work taxes their strength, which is why they cannot give their family and loved ones the attention they would like to give them. Nurses caring for older persons in institutions thus have a troubled conscience both at work and in private life. Constant battling with a troubled conscience and conflicting demands may in the long run pose a real threat to coping and well-being at work. It is therefore important to tackle the threats to coping at work in time, not only by increasing staff resources, but also by looking at issues related to the organization and management of work. </p>
