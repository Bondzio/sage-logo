            <p>This article discusses the application of a statistical process control methodology to improve the quality of real-time clinical trial monitoring, an especially valuable tool for data monitoring committees. This article outlines a method that may have value in bringing a data-based approach using the measures of site performance to define patterns of similarity or dissimilarity between the sites. These can then be used to provide an efficient and objective mechanism to identify those sites for closer scrutiny, monitoring, or further training, either at the end of the study or on an ongoing basis.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Currently, clinical trials lack a widely accepted effective quality management system—that is, a framework that embodies continuous feedback and improvement, first described by Deming.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861511427864">1</xref>
            </sup> Although this does not exist for clinical trials, the quality by design efforts for pharmaceutical medicine manufacture embodied in International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidances Q8 and Q9 establish a quality systems framework and are thought to both improve quality and reduce regulatory oversight activities. Application of a similar system for clinical trials has been urged at the highest levels of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>
         <p>Currently, however, quality in clinical trials is guided by Good Clinical Practices and ICH guidelines. The most widely accepted method of quality control seems to be clinical monitoring. Recent work by the Clinical Trial Transformation Institute (CTTI) finds that approximately 80% of industry studies employ clinical monitors as a quality management system, but that number drops to less than a third when looking at academia, government, and nongovernmental organization sponsored studies. Despite the widespread use of monitoring, CTTI reports that monitoring strategies vary widely, and there is little evidence to support any particular monitoring approach. An exception may be the ADAMON project in Germany, for which specific risk-based monitoring strategies have been implemented prospectively in an effort to improve quality and reduce overall monitoring burden.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861511427864">2</xref>
            </sup> However, even in this latter case, clinical monitoring, because it is by nature a post hoc compliance activity, is an “inspection-based” activity, not a “quality-based” system.</p>
         <p>We believe that the emergence of real-time data, in concert with clinical data standards, will allow for the development and deployment of clinical trial statistical process controls (SPCs). Statistical process controls are methods of monitoring, controlling, and, ideally, improving a process through statistical analysis. In general, SPCs aim to measure the process and improve it by eliminating unnatural variances.</p>
         <p>Statistical process controls are not new to health care or clinical trials. As early as 1981, Chalmers et al<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861511427864">3</xref>
            </sup> used retrospective clinical trial data to propose a standard model for quality assessment clinical trials using statistical process controls. Pfadt et al<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861511427864">4</xref>
            </sup> focused primarily on showing how SPC methodologies can be applied to answer questions about baseline stability and variability. Also, Green<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861511427864">5</xref>
            </sup> demonstrated that SPC methodologies can be applied within the field of behavioral health care. Svolba and Bauer<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861511427864">6</xref>
            </sup> applied traditional SPC tools such as control charts and breakpoint analysis to accumulating clinical trial data. By examining such variables as recruitment and laboratory values, they evaluated the effects of trial interventions and protocol amendments on overall trial performance and quality. Similarly, Benneyan<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861511427864">7</xref>
            </sup> used Shewhart-type statistical control charts to monitor quality-related issues surrounding adverse event (AE) reporting. Vardacki et al<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861511427864">8</xref>
            </sup> demonstrated a combined metadata-data clinical trial process model that they proposed as a framework on which a quality management system can be built. Rostami et al<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092861511427864">9</xref>
            </sup> detailed their database audit strategy as an example of SPC methodology that improved their efficiency for capturing high-quality clinical data.</p>
         <p>These methods have validity for specific application of SPC methodologies such as database lock and adverse event. However, for active in-trial quality process control, there is a need to generate a tool that will provide a real-time picture of whether a trial is proceeding within acceptable limits or whether an intervention may be necessary. Perhaps nowhere is this need greater than in the context of the data monitoring committee (DMC), also known as the data safety monitoring board (DSMB). To quote the FDA guidance, “The DMC advises the sponsor regarding the continuing safety of trial subjects and those yet to be recruited to the trial, as well as the <italic>continuing validity and scientific merit of the trial</italic>” (emphasis added).<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092861511427864">10</xref>
            </sup> Simply put, if the DMC can detect that this trial is likely to fail due to operational variation, thereby invalidating the results of the trial, it must introduce interventions that will correct the variation without otherwise harming the integrity of the trial. For instance, if it detects behavior that would unmask unblinding or otherwise threaten trial integrity, it can suggest modifications to the protocol, retraining of site personnel, or even discontinuation of certain sites. However, as an outside body, the DMC does not have the expertise to debate individual data points. Rather, it needs a more generalized tool to detect high-risk clinical trial behaviors.</p>
         <p>We propose just such a generalized approach to clinical trial monitoring for the DMC. Our general assumption is that whereas there is no absolute standard of high-quality clinical trial performance, there is a relative one—that being a generalized site mean. In general, we presuppose that clinical trial populations across time, therapeutic area, and trial design defy any common standard; each trial generates its own “normal.” For example, on a per site basis, the “correct” amount of adverse events is not too many and not too few; the proper enrollment rate is not too fast and not too slow. The best quality metric, therefore, is “just right.” Sort of a Goldilocks approach.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092861511427864">11</xref>
            </sup> Our SPC measure—call it the Goldilocks estimate—encompasses a user-defined spectrum of clinical and metadata variables and assumes that excessive cumulative variation from the mean is akin to crossing a limit in traditional control chart terminology. This Goldilocks SPC tool, although it does not focus on any one particular trial performance criterion, allows the users to specify and rank various criteria according to the clinical and regulatory risks in real time.</p>

         <title>Introduction to the Model</title>
         <p>This article describes and develops how the performance measures relevant to the particular clinical development program and type of study may be identified and their relative importance refined and then incorporated using a multidimensional scaling approach to chart the relative positioning of the sites within the study for one or more of the identified domains of site metrics. Visual inspection of the generated plot can then be used to identify those sites that may be outperforming or underperforming relative to the other sites in the study.</p>
         <p>The suggested method uses measures of similarity or dissimilarity among the key indicators of performance and between the pairs of sites. These measures can take into account the scale of measure of each indicator—qualitative measures such a number of participants, percentage of participants enrolled of those screened, and qualitative measures indicating perhaps the type or location of the site. Measures can be in different domains of site performance—for example, recruitment and retention in the study, protocol compliance, and operational characteristics (queries, time to resolve queries). These measures can represent individual site characteristics (time in study) or aggregate measures across the participants screened or enrolled at the time from either a site perspective (number of participants, percentage with adverse events) or a per participant enrolled measure (such as average time to resolve queries, average number of queries).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section3-0092861511427864">
         <title>Metric Selection</title>
         <p>To be able to assess interinvestigational site differences, site-level metrics are required. If the metric is to be applied across several studies, then, in general, most metrics will have to take into account the differences between the studies. Most commonly, unless running under the same protocol, studies will contain different visits, different numbers of procedures, and differing numbers of patients. So, for example, if the patient count per site was to be considered a metric, then this may well need to be rescaled to reflect the proportion of the study that the number represents. If the number of withdrawals is to be taken into account, then this also needs to be rescaled not only by the number of patients entered by a site but also by the duration of the study for reasonable comparability between contributing sites in studies in the same development program/therapeutic area. Even then, the comparison may be unfair as one study may in fact be more difficult than another.</p>
         <p>The comparability of metrics thus may be more constructed within a single study, and in most cases since operating with the same data collection requirements, metrics for operation and study conduct based on, say, withdrawals, protocol deviations, data queries, adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities need only to be averaged per participant (screened, enrolled, or randomized). Clearly, for an independent DMC or DSMB, this would also include treatment group status. This is not to say that the absolute numbers of participants screened or enrolled in the study would not be excluded as a variable but, when used in conjunction with other major metrics, the size of the site in terms of its contribution to the study is included only once as an effect. Naturally, other performance aspects based on the numbers of participants available to the site can be incorporated as metrics—so the ratio of screened to treated participants can be included alongside the numbers of participants treated by the site.</p>
         <p>For ongoing studies and measures of performance taken during the course of the study, there is a requirement to use as much data as available. Without changing the metrics during the course of the study, there needs to be some account taken of the amount of data participants have completed. In the previous consideration for multiple studies, the number of visits or procedures completed by a patient would differ potentially between studies. In an ongoing scenario in the same study, there is a similar impact. Especially in longer term studies (ie, studies that last 6 months or more), the measurement of performance needs to take into account how much of the study each patient has completed. This could be a weighting based on the visits completed or the duration of a patient’s current participation. But as the initial screening and baseline measures may include a larger number of procedures than at subsequent visits, a weighting based on procedures completed may be more appropriate. Thus, AEs may be controlled by a time factor to give not just a rate of AEs per patient but an AE rate per patient per week. Indeed, a raw withdrawal rate would appear to be reasonable, but for an ongoing study, some allowance has to be taken into account in such a measure for the current duration of ongoing participants who have yet to withdraw to create a more reflective measure of the current state of participants at that site.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section4-0092861511427864">
         <title>Current Selection</title>
         <p>Using the metric solutions to in-process monitoring and identification of “aberrant” sites, some solutions then use the comparability of those metrics across different studies. The metrics must be suitably adjusted to compare the performance of the current sites with historical behavior of sites. This is usually based on each single metric. The range of behavior of sites on the chosen metric has been previously defined, and thus comparing the sites in the new study with that range enables some identification of those sites whose behavior is not in line with past experience.</p>
         <p>Generally, this requires that there also be some sense of a direction in the metric that determines an improvement in behavior.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section5-0092861511427864">
         <title>Dissimilarity/Similarity Indexes</title>
         <p>The method proposed attempts to compare a range of metrics site to site, and thus, as a starting point, the method requires one to index the similarity (or dissimilarity) between a pair of sites over the range of applicable metrics.</p>
         <p>An example of such an index might be built around ranking the sites on each of the raw metrics and then summing the squares of the differences between the ranks on each metric between 2 sites. Small differences across a range of metrics would imply the pair of sites was ranked closely over the range of metrics. Large differences indicate the sites were consistently ranked more disparately.</p>
         <p>There are many variants of these types of indexes that use the raw value of the metrics, usually standardized—that is, the sum of squares of the differences or the absolute value of the differences between each measure used for the pair of sites.</p>
         <p>If the metrics were more qualitative in nature, then a raw or weighted agreement index could be used to indicate similarity (a value of 0 if the 2 sites under consideration had the same value for the qualitative measure, a value 1 otherwise). If the qualitative measure had some ranked categories, then the ranking of those values could be used to weight the difference when the 2 sites differed on that measure.</p>
         <p>Ideally, then, the different types of metrics could even be used to form a composite similarity index.</p>

         <title>Methods</title>
         <p>A matrix of the similarities indexes between each pair of sites can be used in several statistical techniques, including cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling. The idea of these methods is to reduce the dimensionality of the n × n matrix to map the sites into a simpler structure—as points on a line in 1 dimension, as points on a graph (2 dimensions), or perhaps a 3-dimensional chart—choosing a dimension that would provide an adequate representation of the positioning of the sites in that space.</p>
         <p>Cluster analysis is more about finding groupings of similar objects—working from the whole set and splitting into ever smaller similar groups or, alternatively, pairing similar sites into ever larger groups.</p>
         <p>Multidimensional scaling is a method to portray the similarity matrix in a low number of dimensions by placing the groups within that space, much in the same way as taking the pairwise distances between cities and then re-creating their geographical relationship as a whole in a 2-dimensional map.<sup>

            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>The methods for finding a suitable mapping of the distances/dissimilarities can be found by minimizing a function called Stress, which is a measure of the lack of fit (in simple terms, a residual sum of squares) between the distances between the objects in the intended space and the dissimilarities. The methods described by Kruskal<sup>

            </sup> and others are programmed and readily available.</p>
         <p>The issues to resolve with the method are to find a reasonable dimension in which the dissimilarities are best represented. This can be assessed by the proportion of the variance that can be accounted for in that dimension. This is in essence a measure of correlation <italic>R</italic>

            </sup>. Values in excess of 0.6 are thought to be at least minimally acceptable. The reliability of the result can also be assessed using methods such as removal of one object at a time, akin to the jackknife approach in other situations. To further establish the stability of the modeling, test/retest reliability can also be adopted. This would use, for example, the data for the same sites at a later stage in the study. The method would be reapplied and the positioning would be compared to the original.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>This article demonstrates that process controls can be successfully used for mid-course detection of clinical trial process abnormalities. Furthermore, the same SPC methodology can be used for measurement of the effectiveness of mid-trial interventions. Although previous work focused on improvement of the clinical trial process,<sup>

            </sup> our method focuses on midstream clinical trial improvement—a model applicable to the charge of the DMC or DSMB, especially for detection of unblinding behavior. However, it is reasonable to hypothesize that this approach could be used for study management to detect overall deviations that are evident from blinded analysis.</p>
         <p>This model is just a start and suffers from several limitations. First, it has been developed within the context of a pilot study. Second, it has not been validated against a variety of clinical studies or clinical trial designs. Third, by presupposing that the generalized mean is the arbiter of quality, the model will not a priori detect breakthrough performance—currently, this would require examination of outlier sites and building the knowledge back into the model. Finally, generalizability of findings depends on using study data tabulation model (SDTM) data for the real-time clinical database, and although the use of SDTM is growing, it is by no means universal.</p>
