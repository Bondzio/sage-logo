<abstract>
<p>Prosocial motivations and reciprocity are becoming increasingly important in social-science research. While laboratory experiments have challenged the assumption of universal selfishness, the external validity of these results has not been sufficiently tested in natural settings. In this article we examine the role of prosocial motivations and reciprocity in a Pay What You Want (PWYW) sales strategy, in which consumers voluntarily decide how much to pay for a product or service. This article empirically analyses the only PWYW example in Spain to date: the <italic>El trato</italic> (‘The deal’) campaign launched by the travel company Atrápalo, which offered different holiday packages under PWYW conditions in July 2009. Our analysis shows that, although the majority of the customers did not behave in a purely self-interested manner, they nonetheless did so in a much higher proportion than observed in similar studies. We present different hypotheses about the mechanisms that may explain these findings. Specifically, we highlight the role of two plausible explanations: the framing of the campaign and the attribution of ‘hidden’ preferences to Atrápalo by its customers, which undermined the interpretation of <italic>El trato</italic> as a trust game.</p>

<title>Résumé</title>
<p>L’importance accordée aux motivations prosociales et à la réciprocité dans la recherche en sciences sociales est de plus en plus grande. Si les expérimentations en laboratoire ont questionné le présupposé d’égocentrisme universel, la validité de ces résultats n’a pas été suffisamment testée en milieu naturel. Les auteurs de l’article examinent le rôle des motivations prosociales et de la réciprocité dans une stratégie commerciale de Pay What You Want (PWYW [Vous décidez du prix]) où les consommateurs décident eux-mêmes du prix d’un produit ou d’un service. L’article est une analyse empirique du seul cas de PWYW connu à ce jour en Espagne: la campagne <italic>El Trato</italic> (The deal [Le marché]) lancée par l’agence de voyage <italic>Atrápalo</italic>, qui en Juillet 2009 offrait différents ‘bouquets vacances’ dans des conditions de PWYW. L’analyse montre que, bien que la majorité des clients ne se soit pas conduite de manière purement intéressée, ils l’ont cependant fait plus largement que ce qu’on avait pu observer dans des études similaires. Les auteurs présentent différentes hypothèses quant aux mécanismes pouvant expliquer ces résultats. Deux explications plausibles sont mises en avant: le ciblage de la campagne commerciale et l’accusation portée par les clients de préférences ‘cachées’ attribuées à <italic>Atrápalo</italic>, qui a pu fausser l’interprétation d’<italic>El Trato</italic> en tant que jeu de la confiance.</p>

<title>1 Prosocial motivations, reciprocity and Pay What You Want (PWYW)</title>
<p>Prosocial motivations and reciprocity are becoming increasingly important in social-science research. Individuals are said to have social motivations when they exhibit no indifference to the preferences of others. Prosocial motivations constitute a subclass of social motivations that share a concern for the well-being of others, typically absent in other types of social motivations such as envy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0539018412441756">Fehr &amp; Schmidt, 2006</xref>). Reciprocity, by contrast, is not strictly speaking a prosocial motivation; it entails accepting unnecessary costs for paying back the conduct of others in the form of returning favours, rewarding instances of cooperation or punishing those who fail to cooperate. Prosocial motivations and reciprocity are both distinct from self-interested motivations.</p>
<p>In recent decades, experimental research in the social sciences has seriously questioned the assumption of universal self-interest that dominates rational-choice and neoclassical economic theory, and has uncovered evidence for the existence of reciprocal behaviour and various forms of prosocial motivations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0539018412441756">Bohnet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0539018412441756">Camerer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0539018412441756">Camerer &amp; Fehr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0539018412441756">Elster, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018412441756">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0539018412441756">Falk &amp; Fischbacher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0539018412441756">Fehr &amp; Gintis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0539018412441756">Fehr &amp; Schmidt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0539018412441756">Gächter &amp; Thöni, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0539018412441756">Lopes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0539018412441756">Meier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0539018412441756">Rabin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0539018412441756">Tena, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0539018412441756">Woodward, 2008</xref>). Experimental research has shown that, under conditions of anonymity, the majority of individuals faced with the task of making economic decisions in which they gain and lose money make payments when they could have done otherwise. People are not indifferent to the preferences of others or to issues of distributive justice, they trust others and appear keen to respond to the trust placed in them by others, and censure those who behave as free-riders, often at a considerable cost to themselves. Aversion to inequity, altruism and reciprocity appear to be in good health in our species, and coexist alongside self-interest in the repertoire of human motivations. The real question seems to be what institutional conditions favour the activation of one rather than the other type of motivation. However, social experimentation under laboratory conditions raises questions about the external validity of the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0539018412441756">Andersen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0539018412441756">Benz &amp; Meier, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0539018412441756">Gneezy &amp; List, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0539018412441756">Guala, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0539018412441756">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0539018412441756">Levitt &amp; List, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0539018412441756">Zelditch, 2007</xref>). Would people continue to behave prosocially when facing similar situations outside the laboratory?</p>
<p>The aim of this article is to examine the extent to which the motivations demonstrated in the laboratory guide the behaviour of individuals in natural situations by means of a case study. In recent years, some companies and institutions have introduced ‘Pay What You Want’ (PWYW), a system in which the price of certain goods or services is determined by the customers themselves. This type of economic practice provides an opportunity to study social motivations in a natural experiment or quasi-experiment. In PWYW the buyers of a good or service pay any amount they wish. This means the rules of commercial exchange will have less effect on their decisions, opening the possibility of social norms or considerations about fairness playing a larger role. This makes these cases especially interesting for sociological research. Examples of PWYW systems that have attracted scholarly interest include the online music sales practices of the rock group Radiohead or the Magnatune record label (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0539018412441756">Regner &amp; Barría, 2009</xref>), the Google Answers service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0539018412441756">Regner, 2009</xref>), the sales campaign by NH Hotels in Holland and Belgium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0539018412441756">Gautier &amp; van der Klaauw, 2012</xref>), the sale of photos in an amusement park (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0539018412441756">Gneezy et al., 2010</xref>), and consumption in certain restaurants, snack bars and cinemas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0539018412441756">Kim, Natter &amp; Spann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0539018412441756">Riener &amp; Traxler, 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0539018412441756">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our study we have analysed what is to our knowledge the only PWYW system introduced in Spain: the <italic>El trato</italic> (‘The deal’) campaign run by the travel company Atrápalo SL. The specific goals of this article are to compare the results of <italic>El trato</italic> to other similar PWYW studies, and to attempt to identify the mechanisms that explain the behaviour of the participants in the campaign. Compared to other studies, our research produced some uncharacteristic findings: although the results were consistent with the experimental evidence on social motivations (the majority of the clients paid something even when the rational self-interested option would have been not to pay anything), both the amounts paid and the percentages of those who paid were noticeably lower than what is observed in other PWYW cases. This makes <italic>El trato</italic> a case of special interest to social scientists and entrepreneurs alike.</p>
<p>Further, our study contributes to the literature on prosocial motivations in natural settings by exploring two possible situational mechanisms that might explain this anomalous result: the framing of the advertising campaign associated with the PWYW practice (showing how some elements of the campaign neutralized the obligation of the clients to act reciprocally) and the presence of contextual cues that favoured the attribution of ‘hidden’ preferences to the company Atrápalo under conditions of incomplete information.</p>
<p>Finally, the present article contributes to the research into PWYW practices by analysing a specific case comprising a combination of features that have yet to be studied in the literature on the topic. First, in contrast to other cases, in <italic>El trato</italic>, for customers to enjoy the product under conditions of PWYW, they were required to expend some ‘effort’ by ‘grabbing’ a product on the website before others did. Second, the real-market value of the products was relatively high, and <italic>El trato</italic> was the first case of using PWYW in a travel company. Third, a significant amount of time elapsed between the enjoyment of the product and the payment decision. Finally, as mentioned before, the advertising campaign for <italic>El trato</italic> and the specific design of the PWYW mechanism allowed for framing effects and suspicions about the company’s real intentions to intervene in prosocial and reciprocity motivations. This unique combination of features allows the present study to offer a novel contribution to the casuistry of PWYW practices and participative pricing in general.</p>

<sec id="section3-0539018412441756">
<title>2.1 The El trato campaign</title>
<p>Atrápalo SL is a company offering budget leisure and holiday services in Spain. In July 2009, Atrápalo launched the <italic>El trato</italic> campaign, proposing a radically novel approach to purchasing services in the tourist sector. Customers were offered a series of holiday packages: weekends in spas, nights in hotels, short trips and flights. The novelty of this campaign was that, upon returning from their holiday, customers could voluntarily determine the amount they wanted to pay for the package consumed, including not paying anything at all.</p>
<p><italic>El trato</italic> was preceded by an advertising campaign consisting of press advertisements, roadside billboards and publicity on Atrápalo’s own website. The innovative nature of the campaign even received media attention on some television channels. In addition, Atrápalo carried out a mailing campaign to all its registered users to inform them of the existence of <italic>El trato</italic>, and the conditions of using this new service. On 7 July 2009, Atrápalo opened a section on its blog entirely devoted to <italic>El trato</italic>, offering information about the campaign and its progress; this section provided a channel that enabled direct communication between customers, and between customers and the company.</p>
<p><italic>El trato</italic> operated as follows. A permanent link on the Atrápalo website led to the <italic>El trato</italic> page, which displayed a list of holiday packages already available and those soon to become available. For commercial and advertising reasons, not all the packages were made available at the same time, but the website allowed customers to consult the date and time at which every package would become available. Holiday packages were made available between 7 July and 23 July, excluding Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
<p>Customers had to pay close attention to the change in status of the product they were interested in. The number of packages offered was limited, and in some cases even restricted to a single product (e.g. a weekend in a specific spa for a specific date). Once the product changed from ‘inactive’ to ‘available’, the customer who first accessed the page and made the booking earned the right to enjoy the product under the conditions of <italic>El trato</italic>. Atrápalo defined this process as ‘grabbing’ the available holiday packages. A customer could only ‘grab’ one of the packages, however: once a product was grabbed, access to any remaining packages for that customer was blocked.</p>
<p>Every holiday package had an immovable date, although they all fell within the period between 14 July and 24 July 2009. On the day following their return, customers would receive an e-mail reminding them to fulfil their part of the <italic>El trato</italic> deal by declaring the amount they were willing to pay, which included the option of paying nothing at all. If customers did not respond within a few days, they would receive another reminder. If this was again unsuccessful, an attempt was made to contact customers by telephone to inform them that they had been sent a link to indicate the amount they had decided to pay. While accessing this link, customers were informed about the market price of the product they had enjoyed, and a form was displayed in which they were asked to indicate how much they wanted to pay and, in a separate box, to write a short explanation of the reasons for this decision. To complete the process, customers were asked to fill out a small survey with personal information and their opinions about their experience with <italic>El trato</italic>.</p>
<p>Atrápalo offered 486 packages in total, all of which were taken up. They offered 158 short breaks, with an average price of €172; 278 hotel stays, with an average price of €238; 36 holidays valued at €1084 on average; and 14 flights with an average price of €336. The market price of the products varied extensively, from €40 (a night for a hotel for two persons) to €2938 (a 7-night holiday for two in Egypt). The total value of all the products booked through <italic>El trato</italic> amounted to €137,066.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0539018412441756">
<title>2.2 Data</title>
<p>Atrápalo provided us with complete itemized (anonymous) information on each of the packages offered and booked. For each product we obtained: the market price of the product; the date of the booking; the date the product was consumed; the type of product (break, holiday, flight or hotel); the number of nights, where appropriate; the gender of the person booking the <italic>El trato</italic> offer; the amount paid for each product; and the statements indicating the reasons why a certain amount was paid. We also gained access to the responses to the questionnaire,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0539018412441756">2</xref></sup> which provided information on <italic>El trato</italic> customers, including residential area (province), age, marital status (married/with partner or single), number of children, profession, annual salary and number of holidays per annum. Finally, we obtained customers’ opinions about the service, in particular a description of the service (open response), an evaluation of the service (on a scale from 1 to 10), an indication of what they most and least liked (open response), whether they would consider using <italic>El trato</italic> again and whether they would recommend <italic>El trato</italic> to their friends. In addition, we used two types of qualitative information to support the interpretation of the results: texts of the <italic>El trato</italic> advertising campaign, and comments made by the administrators and participants on the Atrápalo blog.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0539018412441756">
<title>2.3 Methodology</title>
<p>In the first instance, we ran a series of hierarchic linear regression models to analyse the influence of some variables on the payments. This allows us to examine to what extent the payment made can be explained either by particular features of the product or by the socio-demographic profile of the customers. Nominal and ordinal variables were expressed in dummy variables. The list of the variables can be consulted in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0539018412441756">Appendix 1</xref>. The models presented have been prepared using a forward regression method, including at every step the variable whose coefficient of partial correlation with the dependent variable was higher (eliminating the influence of the variables already included), provided their inclusion contributed an additional, statistically significant explanatory factor (for this reason, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0539018412441756">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0539018412441756">4</xref> contain only those independent variables that fulfilled this condition).</p>
<p>In a second phase, we conducted an interpretive analysis of the textual and qualitative information. Our aim was to elicit plausible mechanisms as a basis for the explanation of the results. We cannot indicate direct causes of the decision to pay a certain amount, as the data does not allow us to distinguish between genuine reasons for a decision to pay and the ad hoc rationalization or justification of such a decision. Nevertheless, following the methodology of mechanism-oriented qualitative or interpretive social science, defended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018412441756">Elster (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0539018412441756">2009</xref>), the qualitative analysis offers us useful elements for understanding the way customers interpreted the context (i.e. how they interpreted an offer by Atrápalo); analysing the framing of the campaign and its effects on customers’ behaviour; and indicating certain mechanisms that might explain the significant statistical relations between the quantitative variables revealed by the regression analysis.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>In total, 80.9% of the customers ‘honoured the deal’ by filling out the required form, and 53.5% paid an amount larger than €0. This result differs markedly from what we would expect if customers had acted like the rational self-interested individuals of standard economic theory: in actual fact, the majority decided to pay a positive amount, thereby incurring a cost without having any need to do so.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0539018412441756">3</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the percentage of ‘payers’ turned out to be markedly lower than what was observed in recent similar PWYW cases (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0539018412441756">Table 5</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0539018412441756">4</xref></sup> Only the pioneering experience of the rock band Radiohead registered a lower percentage of payers (only 38%).</p>
<p>Note that, among those who paid €0, the majority (58.9%) nevertheless accepted the cost of nominally honouring the deal by filling out the required form and responding to Atrápalo’s email messages. This seems to indicate that the majority of customers felt that not paying or making very low payments was morally and socially acceptable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0539018412441756">
<title>3.2 Volume of payments</title>
<p>The customers’ payments totalled €7011 or a mere 5.1% of the €137,066 at which the combined products were valued. This cannot be considered a success from a profitability point of view, except in the unlikely event that Atrápalo would have earned even less selling these products in the traditional way. This is also a slightly anomalous result compared to other PWYW cases analysed to date, in which an average payment below the market price<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0539018412441756">5</xref></sup> was compensated for by an increase in consumers (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0539018412441756">Table 5</xref>). Because the number of products on offer in the <italic>El trato</italic> campaign had been decided in advance, this mechanism of compensation was not available to Atrápalo.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0539018412441756">
<title>3.3 Absolute payments</title>
<p>The average payment across products was €14.4, but when taking into consideration only those customers who made an actual payment, the average increases to €27 per product. As we can see from the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0539018412441756">Figure 1</xref>, apart from the €0 payment point, the round numbers (€10, €20, €30, etc.) acted as focal points around which most decisions were concentrated. We can also see that €10 and €20 are the most frequent payments, whereas €50 seems to act as a final focal point.</p>

<title>3.4 Relative payments</title>
<p>The <italic>El trato</italic> holiday packages were very diverse, both in terms of type of product and its price. It is not the same to pay €40 for a product valued at €100 than for one valued at €1000. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0539018412441756">Table 2</xref> therefore also displays the distribution of relative payments, defined as a percentage of the market price of the package booked. On average, customers paid 7.9% of the market price. Only 13.3% of customers paid an amount above 20% of the market price of the product, while most of those who decided to pay spent 10% of the market price or less.</p>

<p>This again is a relatively uncommon finding in PWYW research: the relative payments are typically higher and, in some cases, payments are even higher than the market price. Only a study of souvenir photos by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0539018412441756">Gneezy et al. (2010)</xref> found a lower relative payment of 7.1%. A low relative payment of 18% can also be observed in the case of Five Star hotels in the NH Hotels campaign. This seems to suggest the presence of a ‘magnitude effect’ in determining payment: the higher the market price in absolute terms, the lower the proportion of the price that customers actually pay. This effect has already been observed in similar cases, such as tipping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0539018412441756">Azar, 2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0539018412441756">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0539018412441756">Chapman &amp; Winquist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0539018412441756">Green, Myerson &amp; Schneider, 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>3.5 Regression analysis</title>
<p>We undertook a regression analysis to examine the influence of three different factors on customers’ payment decisions: customer characteristics such as gender, age, marital status and number of children;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0539018412441756">6</xref></sup> the influence of subjective factors such as the evaluation of the service; product characteristics such as the type of product, the duration of the trip, or the market price.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0539018412441756">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The regression results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0539018412441756">Table 3</xref>. Column 4 offers the results the best model obtained to predict absolute payments, which is based on 4 of 13 independent variables: the market price of the product, the customer’s evaluation of the service, if the package was of the ‘weekend-break’ type (combined journey and hotel accommodation), and the age of the customer (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0539018412441756">Appendix 1</xref> for details). Nevertheless, the model is capable of explaining only 17% of the variation in absolute payments.</p>

<p>The fact that the ‘weekend-break’ product type is positively correlated with absolute and relative payments may be explained by a ‘cannibalizing’ effect of the payment on the rest of the products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0539018412441756">Gneezy et al., 2010</xref>). A ‘weekend break’ is typically an ‘everything-included’ type of product, with customers having faced relatively few additional expenses directly related to the trip. However, this is not the case when the product consists of a flight (accommodation must be purchased separately), or a number of nights in a hotel, in which case the customer is required to pay for transport. In these cases, the additional expenses that the customer incurs may ‘cannibalize’ the ex post payment of the product under PWYW conditions. In short, customers are likely to already have depleted their travel budget during their trip, affecting the subsequent decision of how much to pay for the product already consumed.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the perceived quality of the product (or the evaluation of the service) has a positive impact on the absolute and relative payment. Likely, this impact has been reinforced by the fact that Atrápalo is a big company where customers have no ties of allegiance or personal affinity (compared to, for instance, a small restaurant or a rock group), and also because the product had been already consumed when the payment decision had to be made. In this case, the relatively low-mean service evaluation (5.81 in a 1–10 scale) seems to support the assumption that many customers believed the product offered by Atrápalo was not of high quality (see Section 4.2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0539018412441756">Kim, Natter &amp; Spann, 2009</xref>, report a similar effect).</p>
<p>The age effect too is unsurprising. It is reasonable to expect younger customers to make lower payments, explained by combining on-average less income with lower social expectations to offer high payments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0539018412441756">Riener &amp; Traxler, 2011</xref>). Younger customers also have a greater availability to travel at any moment and a higher ability to ‘grab’ <italic>El trato</italic> deals due to the frequency and duration of their connections to the Atrápalo website, which supports the theory that the poor revenue performance of <italic>El trato</italic> is partly due to a self-selection effect (see Section 4.3).</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0539018412441756">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0539018412441756">4</xref> show that the market price of the products (information customers are made aware of when they decide on payment) correlates positively with absolute payment but negatively with relative payment, confirming the existence of the aforementioned ‘magnitude effect’.</p>

<title>3.6 Comparative summary of the different PWYW cases</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0539018412441756">Table 5</xref> sets out a comparative summary of the different PWYW studies to date, and illustrates some of the aspects traditionally examined in those studies. For example, face-to-face interaction when making the payment decision or the possibility of loyalty to a product or a company seem to have a positive effect on the levels of payment. The possibilities of self-selection and ‘cannibalizing’, by contrast, seem to have a negative effect. Information about market prices or reference prices, the fact of being able to enjoy the product before deciding on the payment, and of being able to inspect it before buying it all seem to lack a clear influence. However, it is likely that a strong interaction exists between the different situational factors listed in the table, suggesting that a reliable meta-analysis could be carried out only with a relatively high number of cases.</p>

<title>4 Discussion: Other mechanisms for explaining payment decisions</title>
<p>Given the low level of variance explained by regression analysis, the results presented in Section 3 encourage us to explore additional qualitative evidence. In Section 4, we identify several contextual mechanisms operating at the level of individual action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0539018412441756">Barbera, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0539018412441756">Hedström, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0539018412441756">Hedström &amp; Swedberg 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0539018412441756">Noguera, 2006</xref>) in an attempt to explain the payment-decision patterns of <italic>El trato</italic>’s customers. These mechanisms advance our understanding of the interaction between contextual ‘micro-structures’ and the (prosocial) ‘micro-motives’ of the agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0539018412441756">Gächter &amp; Thöni, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Our main hypothesis is that the observed high frequency of small payments indicates the compatibility of social motivations or norms, such as honouring trust, responding to a gift or avoiding feelings of guilt, with an economic rationality of not accepting excessive or unnecessary costs. Other studies have found evidence of the influence of social norms on voluntary payment behaviour (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0539018412441756">Kim, Natter &amp; Spann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0539018412441756">Pruckner &amp; Sausgruber, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0539018412441756">Regner, 2010</xref>). The dominant hypothesis in this literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0539018412441756">Riener &amp; Traxler, 2011</xref>) holds that non-compliance with social norms imposes costs in addition to the economic cost: these non-compliance costs can take the form of internal costs, when the aforementioned norms are internalized, but also external costs through the social control and associated social penalties imposed by third parties.</p>
<p>In our case, potential non-compliance costs are internal, since the payment decision was private, anonymous and not observable by the other customers. Of course, the outcome of the decision was observed by the staff of Atrápalo, but the nature of the campaign meant that the company rejected applying any type of penalty against non-payers. Moreover, <italic>El trato</italic> being a one-shot game implies there was no possibility of a penalty afterwards.</p>
<p>Individuals with internalized norms of reciprocity were therefore faced with a trade-off between fulfilling reciprocal norms and their economic interest in making low payments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0539018412441756">Elster, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018412441756">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0539018412441756">Regner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0539018412441756">Riener &amp; Traxler, 2011</xref>). In our case, we argue this trade-off was primarily resolved through two contextual mechanisms: (1) a framing process that made it morally acceptable to ‘take advantage of’ Atrápalo; (2) the possibility of adducing that Atrápalo was misguiding their customers in some way, that the company was not really ‘trusting’ them and wanted to obtain an additional hidden benefit. Let us examine each of these mechanisms in turn.</p>
<sec id="section14-0539018412441756">
<title>4.1 Framing the experience</title>
<p>In experimental social science and psychology, framing effects emerge when different definitions of a particular situation change the behaviour or the judgement of the individuals involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0539018412441756">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 2000</xref>). In general, individuals do not behave in the same way in all social contexts. Before acting, we first classify a situation in different types and subsequently activate ‘styles’ of behaviour that fit each type of situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018412441756">Bicchieri, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0539018412441756">Weber, Kopelman &amp; Messick, 2004</xref>). On certain occasions it is small cues that are apparently of little importance in the design of experiments that trigger one kind of interpretation of the situation instead of another. Outside the laboratory, studies have also shown the importance of framing when it comes to activating or reinforcing examples of prosocial behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0539018412441756">Frey &amp; Meier, 2004</xref>). The so-called Model of Frame Selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0539018412441756">Kroneberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0539018412441756">Kroneberg, Heintze &amp; Mehlkop, 2010</xref>) has successfully shown that, in particular circumstances, ‘actors who generally support a moral norm can use neutralization techniques to justify their breaking it and to disclaim moral responsibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0539018412441756">Kroneberg, Heintze &amp; Mehlkop, 2010</xref>: 267); those techniques may be made available to them by means of a particular description (or ‘frame’) of the situation. So, whether or not a prosocial motivation or norm produces clear effects on behaviour depends on the presence of a particular frame that activates the norm or motivation, or on the absence of a frame that causes them to be deactivated.</p>
<p>In the case of <italic>El trato</italic>, the definition of the situation preferred by Atrápalo was that of an agreement based on trust and honesty. However, both the publicity campaign and the procedure designed to obtain one of the holiday packages incorporated several frames that appear to be at odds with this description. These frames may have been crucial for customers to justify making a small payment without generating cognitive dissonance or a perception of having reneged on the deal; in other words, the frames provided customers with techniques for neutralizing reciprocal obligations. We have identified at least four different frames in <italic>El trato</italic>. Contrary to the trust and honesty frame preferred by Atrápalo, we outline three other frames which carry the message that it is acceptable not to pay, or to pay only a very small amount, without acting immorally or improperly.</p>
<sec id="section15-0539018412441756">
<title>4.1.1 The honesty and trust frame</title>
<p>The most suitable frame for Atrápalo presented <italic>El trato</italic> as an ‘agreement based on honesty’, in an attempt to activate the social norms of trust and reciprocity. The campaign appealed explicitly to these norms. Atrápalo trusted its customers in the expectation that they would act reciprocally by paying a ‘fair’ price. Consider for instance these phrases taken from the advertising campaign:</p>
<list id="list2-0539018412441756" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>‘<italic>We believe that the vast majority of people are honest</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘El trato <italic>consists in … the commitment that, if you liked your trip, you should pay us what you think it was worth</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘<italic>You can rest assured that we are offering you the best items, not just the cheap ones</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘<italic>We believe in your honesty</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘<italic>It’s like a virtual handshake</italic>.’ The campaign logo portrayed a handshake, and the explicit mention of the values of fairness and justice also supported the trust frame: customers were urged to ‘<italic>pay what they believe to be a fair price</italic>’, thereby distancing them from their purely rational interest and inviting them to respond fairly according to the value of the experience enjoyed:</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘<italic>If you liked the experience, pay us what you consider to be a fair price. If you didn’t like it, don’t pay us anything</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘<italic>All you have to do is go; and when you come back, just tell us what you think is a fair price to pay</italic>.’</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In a typical sequential trust game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0539018412441756">Bohnet, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0539018412441756">Camerer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0539018412441756">Camerer &amp; Fehr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0539018412441756">Camerer &amp; Weigelt, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0539018412441756">Cook &amp; Cooper, 2003</xref>), a ‘trustor’ makes an offer to a ‘trustee’, who can subsequently respond by honouring this trust or not (for example, by making a payment or donation, performing a service, or expending a certain level of effort), if she accepts the offer. <italic>El trato</italic> produces a social context that closely resembles the structure of a sequential trust game:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0539018412441756">9</xref></sup> the trustor voluntarily makes himself vulnerable to the decision of the trustee, the trustee has the option of taking advantage of the trust deposited in him or her by the trustor; there exists no strict contractual definition of what constitutes an appropriate response from the trustee; and the trustee plays the role of ‘dictator’ when it comes to determining the payment to the trustor. In addition, the quotations from the <italic>El trato</italic> advertising campaign cited above evoke the most frequent attitudes of the trustor in a trust game: trust in the honesty of the trustee and an expectation of reciprocity from him (i.e. the payment ought to correspond to the quality of the product offered). The trust game in all its variants is used in experimental social science to analyse trust and reciprocity, but also perceptions of trustworthiness or expected reciprocity of the trustor.</p>
<p>In our version of the game, Atrápalo is the trustor and the customers are the trustees. The trustor chooses which products to offer under PWYW conditions. Once the trustor makes an offer, each trustee (i) can either respond by honouring the trust by expending a level of effort (e<sub>i</sub>), which implies a cost for the trustee and a gain for the trustor, or take advantage and not honour the trust. For simplicity, we suppose that honouring the trust is equivalent to making a payment (e<sub>i</sub> &gt; 0), whereas not honouring the trust is equivalent to taking the trip and paying nothing after returning (either by not filling out the form, or by filling out the form but paying only €0).</p>
<p>The preference ordering of rational, self-interested players is as follows. First, Atrápalo always prefers to offer deals, expecting the customers to honour the trust placed in them with some level of e<sub>i</sub> &gt; 0. This option allows Atrápalo to put forward products that are difficult to place on the market at that particular moment in the hope of obtaining better returns under the PWYW system than under a conventional sales strategy. But Atrápalo prefers the conventional sales route over deals in which the customer chooses not to pay anything (e<sub>i</sub> = 0), since putting the products on the market means that there is always the possibility of obtaining an income higher than 0. Second, when being offered a deal, customers prefer to respond with e<sub>i</sub> = 0 rather than to respond with e<sub>i</sub> &gt; 0. The strategic situation can be represented by an extensive form game with ordinal payments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0539018412441756">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>As can be seen, the equilibrium in this game consists of Atrápalo not making an offer (1,0).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0539018412441756">10</xref></sup> This equilibrium is suboptimal compared to the result in which Atrápalo offers a deal and the customers honour the trust placed in them (2, 1). However, as we outlined before, <italic>El trato</italic> moves away from this equilibrium: Atrápalo decided to trust its customers by offering deals, and most of the customers (53.5%) did indeed honour the deal by paying more than €0. This result is in line with those obtained from numerous laboratory experiments analysing the trust game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0539018412441756">Berg, Dickhaut &amp; McCabe, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0539018412441756">Bohnet, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0539018412441756">Camerer, 2003</xref>:100; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0539018412441756">Camerer &amp; Fehr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0539018412441756">Camerer &amp; Weigelt, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0539018412441756">Levitt &amp; List, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0539018412441756">
<title>4.1.2 The free or ‘bargain’ price frame</title>
<p>In addition to ‘trust’ and ‘honesty’, the most prominent headlines of <italic>El trato</italic>’s publicity campaign suggest a pure commercial exchange in which one of the parties offers a bargain:</p>
<list id="list3-0539018412441756" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>‘<italic>Go on holiday without paying</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘<italic>Go on holiday and pay what you like. Go, and when you come back we’ll talk</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘<italic>Can you imagine booking a holiday, enjoying it, and then when you come back deciding how much you want to pay?</italic>’</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Accepting a bargain in a commercial exchange is not only rational behaviour but is also socially ‘appropriate’ and morally acceptable. This interpretation is consistent with the behaviour of those who paid €0, or made small symbolic payments. In this frame, customers who are guided wholly or partially by social motivations are now faced with a trade-off: a merely symbolic payment can be seen to represent the ideal commitment solution between appropriately taking advantage of a perceived bargain and respecting social norms of trust and reciprocity. A customer who is both keen to take advantage of a perceived bargain and willing to fulfil the terms of the agreement faces a cognitive dissonance that can be resolved by paying a symbolic amount.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0539018412441756">
<title>4.1.3 The equality-of-opportunities frame</title>
<p>Certain aspects of the campaign’s publicity appealed to the idea of equal opportunity. <italic>El trato</italic> offered an opportunity to enjoy a holiday to everyone, even to those who could not afford to pay market prices. The following statements support this interpretation:</p>
<list id="list4-0539018412441756" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>‘<italic>Everyone deserves to have a good holiday, or at least a break for a couple of days</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘<italic>We will only provide one deal per person, because we want the highest possible number of people to enjoy them</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘<italic>We will be activating the packages gradually over a period of days, so that everyone has a chance to enjoy them</italic>.’</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>With this, Atrápalo appeared to implicitly acknowledge that it was aiming for payments below the market price of the product, and that customers in some sense had a ‘right’ to enjoy the holidays offered irrespective of their subsequent payment. As before, this characterization of <italic>El trato</italic> contradicts the agreement based on the trust frame.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0539018412441756">
<title>4.1.4 The reward-for-effort frame</title>
<p>In a final type of framing, the procedure by which potential customers gained access to a booking may have also involuntarily encouraged non-payment or payments involving low amounts. Because the deals were ‘launched’ on particular days and at certain times, obtaining a deal can be seen as a competition between customers for a scarce commodity, with successfully ‘grabbing’ a holiday interpreted as a deserved ‘prize’. The customer who manages to ‘grab’ the holiday may therefore think he or she has gained the right to enjoy it merely because of the effort and dedication devoted to ‘grabbing’ the holiday in a fair competition with other players.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0539018412441756">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several customer opinions expressed in the blog describe the considerable investment of time and attention needed to ‘grab’ a product:</p>
<list id="list5-0539018412441756" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Blog user 1: ‘<italic>I am an Atrápalo user who was refreshing El trato’s Web page every 5 seconds from 2.00 pm to 4.30 pm</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Blog user 2: ‘<italic>I have been refreshing El trato’s Web page every 5 minutes since 9 o’clock this morning, and now it’s 6.24 pm</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Blog user 3: ‘<italic>I nearly wore out my finger refreshing the Web page</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Blog user 4: ‘<italic>Being on holiday, I got up at 7.30 in the morning and I have been on the computer all day</italic>.’</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Considering the product as a prize ‘earned’ because of the effort previously invested also helped to ensure that the ‘grabbing’ procedure was interpreted as a contest. Some of the blog’s customers and visitors expressed this view:</p>
<list id="list6-0539018412441756" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Customer 1: ‘<italic>To me it’s like a game. The one who grabs it first wins. It’s the reward for refreshing the page minute by minute and getting up several days at 7 o’clock in the morning</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Customer 2: ‘<italic>It may be because of the excitement of winning a prize that I think all this is perfect</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Blog user 5: ‘<italic>I never won anything. I hope I get lucky … Let’s see if it’s my turn this time</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Blog user 6: ‘<italic>I’m talking about the way the contest works</italic>.’</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>During the days in which the products were launched, the forum administrators did their best to counter the dissemination of this interpretation of the promotion:</p>
<list id="list7-0539018412441756" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Administrator 1: ‘<italic>El trato is neither a contest nor a draw. It‘s a different way of making use of destinations that would otherwise remain unused</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Administrator 2: ‘<italic>El trato is not a contest … Nothing is being given away</italic>.’</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Nevertheless, the task of countering this interpretation was a huge one and was unlikely to be a success, particularly since the procedure for ‘grabbing’ a deal was very similar to that of a contest. Furthermore, some of the comments made by the blog administrators, constantly referring to ‘luck’, may have helped to reinforce this interpretation:</p>
<list id="list8-0539018412441756" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Administrator 3: ‘<italic>That’s also the essence of the promotion, that you have to grab the destination if you are lucky!</italic>’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Administrator 4: ‘<italic>Amongst all the clicks, the booking will go to the luckiest user</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Administrator 5: ‘<italic>You’ll have to be the fastest one, and you’ll need a dose of luck to be the luckiest one</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Administrator 6: ‘<italic>The range of destinations is limited, and you have to be lucky to grab one as soon as possible</italic>.’</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Once again, to interpret bagging a deal as a matter of luck implicitly transmits the idea that the product may be enjoyed at a much lower cost than the market price. In this way, the ‘reward-for-effort’ frame reinforces the ‘bargain’ and ‘equal opportunity’ frames in transmitting the message that it is permissible and appropriate not to pay anything, or to make a very low payment.</p>

<title>4.2 Questioning Atrápalo’s preferences</title>
<p>In this section we focus on a second mechanism, one that might have led many customers to attribute to Atrápalo a preference ordering that differs from the one outlined above in the trust game. In fact, the ‘bargain’ frame (and, indirectly, the ‘rewarding-effort’ frame) is likely to trigger speculation amongst customers about benefits of <italic>El trato</italic> for Atrápalo over and above obtaining a good price. Let us review three possible interpretations.</p>
<sec id="section20-0539018412441756">
<title>4.2.1 Overvaluing</title>
<p>A first interpretation is that Atrápalo was obtaining a larger return by overvaluing the holidays when they informed the customers of the market price of the product, attempting to affect the payment decision by raising the reference price. This is how some of the visitors to the blog interpreted <italic>El trato</italic>:</p>
<list id="list9-0539018412441756" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Blog user 7: ‘<italic>I’m sure not even they believe the real value price they quote, at least not as far as flights are concerned</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Blog user 8: ‘<italic>Why do you estimate its value as more than double what it really costs?</italic>’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Blog user 9: ‘<italic>As for the suggested price, the truth is it seems a bit inflated to me</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Blog user 10: ‘<italic>The hotel has its own discount on its regular tariffs that give a much cheaper price than the one Atrápalo was quoting</italic>.’</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Amongst those who finally ‘grabbed’ a product some expressed a similar belief:</p>
<list id="list10-0539018412441756" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Customer 3: ‘<italic>I think that the real price you quote is a bit over the top though</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Customer 4: ‘<italic>I think the real prices are a bit exaggerated</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Customer 5: ‘<italic>The only negative side is that the trip is not really worth the €95 that they suggest</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Customer 6: ‘The real price is pushed up a bit.’</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>What is important about these statements is not so much that customers mentally lowered the reference price, but rather that they demonstrate how some customers perceived that Atrápalo was dishonestly trying to make a profit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0539018412441756">
<title>4.2.2 Low quality</title>
<p>A second interpretation pointed to the fact that the products Atrápalo offered were of low quality, with the exception of some ‘loss-leader’ products included only to generate interest in <italic>El trato</italic>. Experimental evidence suggests that PWYW systems may induce individuals to reason that ‘if it’s free then it has no value’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0539018412441756">Shampanier, Mazar &amp; Ariely, 2007</xref>) or ‘if it’s very expensive, then it doesn’t really cost that much’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0539018412441756">Gneezy, Carmon &amp; Nelson, 2009</xref>). Regarding the latter type of reasoning, the products offered by <italic>El trato</italic> were in general more expensive than those of other PWYW campaigns. Some of <italic>El trato</italic>’s advertising texts may have contributed to this interpretation:</p>
<list id="list11-0539018412441756" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>‘<italic>Many tourist destinations may remain empty or unoccupied this summer, and this doesn’t seem to make a great deal of sense to us</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘<italic>It seems wrong to us that there are so many wonderful tourist destinations which, if nobody does something about it, will end up being empty or unoccupied this July</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘<italic>Let's be honest, we also need to sell. So we believe that this deal benefits all of us</italic>.’</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>One possible reading of these phrases is that <italic>El trato</italic> was offering products that did not have enough value to succeed on the market at their market price. Some customers expressed this view:</p>
<list id="list12-0539018412441756" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Blog user 11: <italic>‘This is nothing more than a promotional stunt where they show a lot of hotel nights and flights on impossible dates and a few trips that will not have had any takers. The price of all this is zero because none of it is sellable … The two or three things that could be or are worthwhile, are only the price of the promotion, and you have to kill yourself for them.’</italic></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This idea may also be strengthened by some of the forum administrators’ comments:</p>
<list id="list13-0539018412441756" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Administrator 7: ‘<italic>With this offer we are in fact promoting destinations that might otherwise remain unused, and we let every user pay the price that he or she considers to be fair</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Administrator 8: ‘<italic>The aim is to take advantage of the destinations that have yet to be purchased by customers</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Administrator 9: ‘<italic>[El trato] is an ingenious way of taking advantage of destinations that would otherwise be unused on dates in the near future</italic>.’</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This interpretation would fit well with the long list of reasons offered by customers who argued, in response to an open question in the survey, that the trip was not worth it. And this interpretation also supports the positive correlation between the evaluation of the service and the absolute and relative levels of payment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0539018412441756">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0539018412441756">4</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0539018412441756">12</xref></sup> The main insight is not that these reasons may serve only as ad hoc rationalizations justifying a low-payment decision, but rather that non-payment was an appropriate response given that it was possible to argue that the holiday was of a low quality. This way non-payment can be construed as breaking neither the letter nor the spirit of the deal. This mechanism constitutes an effective way to resolve the cognitive disharmony of customers who wanted to respect the deal but at the same time minimize costs.</p>

<sec id="section22-0539018412441756">
<title>4.2.3 Free publicity</title>
<p>Finally, a third interpretation of the customer–Atrápalo exchange seems to have been a widespread belief among customers that the real objective of <italic>El trato</italic> is the added publicity associated with the campaign. This is how customers put it in their blogs:</p>
<list id="list14-0539018412441756" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Blog user 12: ‘<italic>Atrápalo already has what it wanted, i.e. publicity and a huge boost, if you think what a TV advert costs … and they have only put 300 holidays on offer. Even if they pay for them all themselves, they still end up winning because they’ve appeared in all the media and it hasn’t cost them a penny!</italic>’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Blog user 13: ‘<italic>I think that you win on a marketing level</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Blog user 14: ‘<italic>I congratulate Atrápalo for this intelligent business idea. It’s clear that although the promotional offer of 300 trips is true, if only for the benefits in terms of publicity and marketing that this brings, the business works out profitably for them</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Blog user 15: <italic>Of course, if you had to pay the equivalent in TV advertising, you would spend twice as much as it costs even if nobody paid! Word-of-mouth publicity is priceless!</italic>’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Blog user 16: ‘<italic>You have all this worked out and you view it as an investment in marketing and publicity. Plus what they pay you for the deals so that you don’t lose much at all or use it to cover your expenses, it works out more than profitable for you</italic>.’</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A number of <italic>El trato</italic> customers raised the same idea in the survey:</p>
<list id="list15-0539018412441756" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Customer 7: ‘<italic>I don’t think the aim of this marketing campaign is for the customers to pay what they think is fair but rather to have a record of visits and to make sure that the word gets around, and I’m sure that you have achieved this.</italic>’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Customer 8: ‘<italic>You are going to get a great deal of profit from the publicity, which in the end is what it was all about</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Customer 9: ‘<italic>And since it has been such a great marketing campaign, I shall allow myself to exploit it a little</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Customer 10: ‘<italic>I expect your goal was to get publicity, and that’s what you’ve achieved with this.</italic>’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Customer 11: ‘<italic>Let’s be honest, this is a publicity stunt by you, for which we are very grateful, but we are going to make use of it, and so, since you give us the option of going free …</italic>’.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Customer 12: ‘<italic>I think it’s all a magnificent marketing campaign! … I imagine that you were already expecting that these customers were not going to pay you anything like the real value of the packages that they had acquired. But I am sure that you worked out the returns on this investment very well before launching this campaign, and therefore, even if all the 300 customers who acquired one of these offers paid €0, you would easily recover this investment and more</italic>.’</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Also, in this case, the messages from Atrápalo may have unintentionally reinforced this way of interpreting the situation:</p>
<list id="list16-0539018412441756" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Administrator 10: ‘<italic>Atrápalo gains in terms of brand exposure, the supplier wins because it sells destinations that might otherwise remain empty, and the user can enjoy it at a very special price</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Administrator 11: ‘<italic>El trato is a marketing campaign that we run every year</italic>.’</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The logical conclusion for many customers is that Atrápalo had already obtained what it was looking for without needing to receive an additional payment, and therefore fairness requires that the other party to the deal should obtain a benefit as well; in this case, a free holiday or one purchased at a symbolic price:</p>
<list id="list17-0539018412441756" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Blog user 18: ‘<italic>They have already obtained the publicity they wanted and I have got the holiday, so everyone is happy</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Customer 13: ‘<italic>We paid a symbolic price because we thought that this deal was a marketing campaign. We have fulfilled our part by talking about you, and you have succeeded in obtaining publicity by appearing in the mass media and thanks to the word-of-mouth publicity provided by those participating in the contest</italic>.’</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>All these beliefs about the ‘real’ benefit for Atrápalo indicate that a group of customers was attributing a preference ordering to Atrápalo that was significantly different from the one the company was portraying in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0539018412441756">Figure 2</xref>. For these customers the ‘real’ game might be expressed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0539018412441756">Figure 3</xref>, again with ordinal payments.</p>
<fig id="fig3-0539018412441756" position="float">
<label>Figure 3.</label>
<caption><p>The <italic>El trato</italic> game with the preferences attributed to <italic>Atrápalo by some customers</italic></p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0539018412441756-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In this alternative game, the customers’ dominant strategy continues to be to respond with a zero effort. But this time, the equilibrium (1, 2) is no longer suboptimal: Atrápalo offers the deal and the customer does not pay. The preferences attributed to the company by the customer modify the logic of the game, which in the eyes of the latter stops being a game of trust. The customer is no longer in a position of trustee, since Atrápalo is not incurring any risks by offering a deal and thus not genuinely ‘trusting’ the customer to respond in a particular manner. This revised game implies that those with prosocial or reciprocal motivations may no longer feel the obligation to respond with a certain effort, explaining both the number and level of small contributions and the substantial number of non-payments.</p>
<p>Our study of <italic>El trato</italic> seems to contradict the common assumption that in PWYW experiences ‘because the firm explicitly exposes itself to financial risk, a customer is unlikely to infer sinister ulterior motives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0539018412441756">Gneezy et al., 2010</xref>: 326). Based on the qualitative evidence, it is plausible to conclude that precisely the attribution of such ‘sinister ulterior motives’ to the company played a crucial role in explaining the low number of payers and the low level of payments obtained.</p>

<sec id="section23-0539018412441756">
<title>4.3 Other situational mechanisms</title>
<p>In this section, we briefly outline some other situational factors that might be considered possible explanations of the results, although in our case, for various reasons, they turn out to be rather inconclusive.</p>
<sec id="section24-0539018412441756">
<title>4.3.1 Self-selection bias</title>
<p>The lack of randomization when sampling participants may produce selection bias. Selection bias can have an impact on how decisions are made, since it is conceivable that PWYW may attract customers prone to ‘free-ride’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0539018412441756">Gautier &amp; van der Klaauw (2012)</xref> present evidence that in NH Hotels’ PWYW campaign there was a self-selection bias of this kind. In their experiment, the voluntary participants in the PWYW offer (those who made the bookings after the campaign had been announced) paid less frequently and less generously than the involuntary participants (those who had made their bookings before the campaign was announced, and therefore without knowing that the payment would be free).</p>
<p>Did such a ‘free-rider’ selection effect take place in our case? Since all the participants were volunteers, the available information does not allow us to confirm this question, although some of the data suggests that this may have been the case. Young people between 20 and 30 years are dominant amongst those who filled out the survey (59.2%), as are people with a medium to low income level (37.2% of subjects earn between 12,000 and 19,000 euros per annum). A significant proportion of them may have interpreted <italic>El trato</italic> through the ‘equality-of-opportunities’ frame as an opportunity to enjoy a holiday that they might not otherwise have been able to afford. Several opinions of those surveyed seem to point in this direction:</p>
<list id="list18-0539018412441756" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Customer 14: ‘<italic>You have made it possible for me to spend a day away, which as a pensioner I wouldn’t normally be able to afford.</italic>’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Customer 15: ‘<italic>Thanks to you I was able to have the holiday that I thought I wouldn’t be able to have this year, since I am currently unemployed and wouldn’t have been able to afford it</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Customer 16: ‘<italic>Thanks to this offer I have enjoyed staying at a place that I wouldn’t have been able to afford in normal circumstances at the moment</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Customer 17: ‘<italic>The truth is that if it had not been for this promotional offer we could not have done this at all this summer given the bad economic situation we are suffering</italic>.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Customer 18: ‘<italic>I was interested in this offer because if it had not been for this I couldn’t have made the trip, since it would be impossible for me to pay for it as things stand</italic>.’</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>For all these customers, then, the deal was regarded from the beginning as an opportunity for travelling free or at a symbolic price. However, in <italic>El trato</italic> this likely ‘free-rider’ effect has had a much more significant impact on payments than it had in other PWYW campaigns where self-selection was also possible (like NH Hotels, or restaurants; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0539018412441756">Table 5</xref>), so the mechanisms proposed in sections 4.1 and 4.2 seem still necessary to explain the difference.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0539018412441756">
<title>4.3.2 Effects of reputation and anonymity</title>
<p>Since <italic>El trato</italic> was a one-shot game played under conditions of anonymity, effects of reputation observed in the experimental literature on cooperative behaviour were absent. The payment decisions cannot be influenced by the desire to gain or to preserve a ‘good social reputation’ as a cooperating, trustworthy person. Similarly, the absence of face-to-face interactions in the <italic>El trato</italic> transactions likely deactivated the influence of social emotions, such as embarrassment, when making payments.</p>
<p>However, studies about PWYW fail to provide conclusive evidence on this point. For instance, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0539018412441756">Gautier &amp; van der Klaauw (2012)</xref> report that the high percentage of payers in the NH Hotels experiment may have been due to the absence of anonymity at the time of making the payment decision (payments had to be made in front of a hotel employee at a counter, with those who decided to pay nothing being asked to explain their decision), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0539018412441756">Regner &amp; Barría (2009)</xref> show very high payments under conditions of anonymity similar to those observed in <italic>El trato</italic>, and, conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0539018412441756">Gneezy et al. (2010)</xref> show low relative payments under conditions of face-to-face interaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0539018412441756">
<title>4.3.3 The type of trustor</title>
<p>Experimental research in the social sciences has demonstrated that the subjects in an experiment do not reach similar decisions regardless of the type of agent they interact with. In general, exchanges between equals more frequently produce decisions characterized by trust, generosity or altruism. Applying this point to our case, since one of the parties in <italic>El trato</italic> is a relatively big company and the other an individual, we should not expect payments to be made by applying criteria of ‘justice’ or ‘fairness’. There exist mechanisms capable of countering this unequal status between trustor and trustee. Face-to-face interaction has already been mentioned. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0539018412441756">Gneezy et al. (2010)</xref> suggest another possibility when they distinguish between paying because the customer really wants a product and paying as a way of supporting the seller (for instance, because one of the treatments involves donating part of the money paid to charity). Moreover, perceptions of unequal status may be affected when the trustor is a small business like a restaurant or café, or mediated because it concerns a cultural product for which one feels an affinity, such as online music. As we suggested before, none of these mechanisms was present in case of <italic>El trato</italic>.</p>

<title>5 Conclusion</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘Everyone wants to commit a villainy without having to feel like a villain. … Do you understand what a great art this is, to reconcile such irreconcilables?’ (Symington to Tichy in <italic>The Futurological Congress</italic>, Stanislaw Lem, 1971)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Laboratory experiments and field studies have both shown that the activation of prosocial motivations and of reciprocal behaviour is sensitive to contextual conditions. In the PWYW campaign carried out by Atrápalo, the particular nature of these conditions implied ambivalent results. On the one hand, it should be emphasized that the majority of the participants in the experience diverged from the rational self-interested behavioural equilibrium predicted by conventional economic theory, thus confirming the results of contemporary experimental social science. On the other hand, <italic>El trato</italic> produced results that also varied significantly from other PWYW studies, both in the proportion of customers failing to display prosocial motivations or reciprocity, and in their intensity when they did appear.</p>
<p>In this article, we have presented a plausible explanation for these results, arguing that one should bear in mind two additional mechanisms to those traditionally studied in PWYW experiences. First, the framing of <italic>El trato</italic> made it possible to understand the situation in various ways that effectively neutralized the ‘trust-and-honesty’ frame that the company was attempting to associate with <italic>El trato</italic>. Second, <italic>El trato</italic> allowed numerous customers to attribute ‘secret’ and even ‘dishonest’ motives to Atrápalo, enabling them to justify a strategy of non-cooperation when it came to deciding the payment for the holidays they had taken. Both may help to explain the high level of non-payment and the small amounts of payment amongst the customers. Although the majority of <italic>El trato</italic>’s customers were motivated prosocially, they had to resolve the trade-off between economic rationality and the social norms of reciprocity and trust. Customers had to make use of the opportunity that <italic>El trato</italic> was offering them to travel at low cost, while simultaneously justifying making use of this opportunity to themselves and to the company as something appropriate and ‘honouring the deal’. Atrápalo handed them the resolution of this trade-off on a plate by introducing internal contradictions in the framing of <italic>El trato</italic>: like the Symington character in Lem’s fantasy, they encouraged the customers ‘to commit a villainy’ without having to feel ashamed about it.</p>
<p>Our analysis suggests that exchanges under PWYW (or similar) conditions are an excellent opportunity to study social motivations and their interaction with institutional design in a natural setting. As the number of experiences of this type increases, and particularly when we can ensure a more fluid contact between researchers and those in charge of companies and institutions, it will be possible to make progress in responding to a number of questions that could not be explored in depth in this study, such as what influence does the heterogeneity of agents have on prosocial motivations, or what specific processes activate one frame rather than another. This would open up new opportunities for carrying out genuine natural experiments or quasi-experiments that could be extremely fruitful for social-science research.</p>

<p>PWYW is part of a set of business strategies for fixing prices with the participation of the consumers, among which the auction is the classic example. A recent type of practice similar to PWYW is Name Your Own Price (NYOP), in which the buyer makes an offer, but the seller can refuse the offer if the price does not reach a pre-established threshold (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0539018412441756">Kim, Natter &amp; Spann, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>The response rate for the questionnaire was 62.6%. In the three experiments with PWYW experiences reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0539018412441756">Kim, Natter &amp; Spann (2009)</xref>, the response rates for a similar questionnaire were 68% (in a restaurant buffet), 64% (in a cinema) and 33% (in a café). The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0539018412441756">Regner (2010)</xref> on online music recorded a response rate of 44.5%.</p>

<p>As Riener &amp; Traxler affirm (2011: 1), in PWYW experiences, ‘individuals who are solely driven by monetary self-interest should pay nothing’. This point applies even more when an individual’s payment is essential for neither the existence of the company nor the product in question, so that a positive contribution can never be an equilibrium in the game regardless of whether it is a single interaction or a repeated game. In the same way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0539018412441756">Gneezy et al. (2010</xref>:326) observe that ‘if people only cared about money, they would pay the lowest price possible’, which under PWYW conditions is equivalent to not paying anything at all.</p>

<p>The fact that, in cases like that of Magnatune, the company stipulated a minimum price of five dollars per download does not affect the substance of the comparison, as it attempts to ascertain what percentage of the customers accepted costs over the minimum, regardless of whether this was €0 or US$5.</p>

<p>We did not include a ‘salary’ variable in our regression model for two reasons. First, the response rate for this item was very low. Second, the coefficients of correlation of this variable with the dependent ones were also very low (<italic>r</italic> = 0.015 for absolute payment and <italic>r</italic> = 0.003 for relative payment), so that excluding them from the regression did not mean sacrificing the model’s explanatory capacity.</p>

<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-0539018412441756">
<label>7</label>
<p>It is worth adding that we also analysed whether the moment of the payment decision had any influence. This is important since, between signing the deal and deciding to pay, customers could have been exposed to discussions on the Atrápalo blog, and in particular to comments from those who had returned from their holidays (some of which were televised). Similar studies have reported significant variations related to the moment of decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0539018412441756">Riener &amp; Traxler, 2011</xref>). However, in our case the payments fluctuated without any clear-cut pattern throughout the whole period.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0539018412441756">
<label>8</label>
<p>Residue analysis does not permit a better adjustment. For example, in the case of the regression for the absolute payment, 6 anomalous cases were detected (with residues greater than 3), but the regression calculated without these 6 cases had a lower explanatory capacity, and generated another 7 anomalous cases, and so on. It was decided to present the regression results with all the cases.</p>

<p>To a lesser extent, we could also model <italic>El trato</italic> as a gift-exchange game, designed to detect similar motivations as the trust game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0539018412441756">Akerlof, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0539018412441756">Bellemare &amp; Shearer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0539018412441756">Camerer &amp; Fehr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0539018412441756">Camerer &amp; Weigelt, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0539018412441756">Fehr, Kirchsteiger &amp; Riedl, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0539018412441756">Gneezy &amp; List, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0539018412441756">Levitt &amp; List, 2007</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0539018412441756">Bohnet (2008)</xref> distinguishes between two types of trust game, the investment game and the binary-choice trust game, and <italic>El trato</italic> fits the second type.

<p>Since the customer’s dominant strategy is e<sub>i</sub> = 0, Atrápalo will maximize its expected utility by not making an offer. ‘No offer’ is a Nash equilibrium as there is no incentive for either player to deviate unilaterally.</p>

<p>The name of the company, Atrápalo, means ‘grab it’ in Spanish and can be read as endorsing the notion of a competition.</p>

<p>Amongst those who honoured the deal by answering the questionnaire, those who assessed the service negatively (0–4 on the scale) paid something in 43.9% of the cases, while those who offered a positive assessment (7–10) did so in 82.5% of the cases.</p>
