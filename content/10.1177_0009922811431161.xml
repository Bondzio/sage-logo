<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A recent American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) debate of the Environmental Health Special Interest Group was held on May 1, 2011 and discussed the dilemma of sunscreen protection to prevent skin cancer versus the need for sun exposure to ensure vitamin D adequacy in children. This historic perspective examines this dilemma relative to a recent AAP policy statement on ultraviolet radiation and its hazards (March 2011), the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on dietary intakes of calcium and vitamin D (November 2010), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines on sunscreen package labeling (June 2011). The first 2 reports recommend a dietary supplement of vitamin D to meet requirements, recognizing the rising rates of skin cancer related to exposure to both ultraviolet A (UVA) and ultraviolet B (UVB) wavelength rays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811431161">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811431161">2</xref></sup> The FDA guidelines would force sunscreen manufacturers to more thoroughly label the extent of UVA and UVB protection. The factors considered behind the recommendations of all 3 reports are discussed in depth in this perspective. Importantly, concepts of the role of sunshine on circulating vitamin D values and in the prevention of rickets have evolved over time and are often influenced by contemporary views of the healthfulness or harmfulness of sunlight exposure. The IOM and AAP reports result in a dilemma relative to vitamin D sufficiency in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811431161">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811431161">2</xref></sup> Both these well-balanced documents are based on best evidence and speak to the potential toxicities of UV rays A and B and of hypervitaminosis D. Simply put, the dilemma is that with rising rates of skin cancer related to exposure to UVA and UVB wavelengths, one should liberally use sunscreen and limit sun exposure. In contrast, a large segment of the population has been shown to be vitamin D deficient or insufficient, particularly dark-skinned individuals, the elderly, children, and pregnant women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811431161">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811431161">4</xref></sup> The efficient use of appropriate sunscreens will block out 95% to 98% of UVB wavelength rays and, hence, a requirement for vitamin D supplements may be indicated or, more likely, essential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811431161">2</xref></sup> Whereas components of this recent debate are new, some are very old. At least 5 major paradoxes concerning vitamin D and the sun are pertinent and have been debated over the past 400 years, as the effects of sunlight and diet have been reframed and reinterpreted for at least 120 years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922811431161">Table 1</xref>). First, should vitamin D be considered an essential nutrient or mainly a compound derived from cutaneous photosynthesis after UVB radiation exposure? Second, although vitamin D sufficiency should be ensured, at high serum 25(OH)D concentrations a serious vitamin D toxicity can occur. Third, vitamin D in a real sense is not a vitamin; it is a prohormone that affects bone health and that has nonosseous properties, both of which depend on further metabolism to 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> vitamin D.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811431161">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811431161">6</xref></sup> Four, how can one define vitamin D sufficiency? Are serum 25(OH)D values an unequivocal surrogate biomarker? Is a serum value of 20 ng/mL sufficient to ensure bone health and adequate for its nonosseous roles? Five, should one be exposed to enough sunshine to synthesize vitamin D adequately and risk skin cancer, or should one greatly limit sun exposure by avoidance, clothing, and sunscreen, and rely on dietary vitamin D supplementation to potentially reduce skin cancer rates?</p>

<title>Paradox 1: The Sources of Vitamin D</title>
<p>The vitamin D deficiency disorder of rickets was puzzling. It really emerged at the onset of the industrial revolution (circa 1610) in the United Kingdom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811431161">7</xref></sup> and was termed “The English Disease.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811431161">8</xref></sup> Although claims of earlier examples of rickets may be correct,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811431161">9</xref></sup> the severity and prevalence of the disorder after 1650 meant it was an epidemic disorder. The 16th century in the United Kingdom was the beginning of the industrial revolution, which was fueled by coal. The output of British coal grew roughly 6-fold between 1750 and 1830.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811431161">10</xref></sup> We now know that the soot particles in the hazy skies above cities absorbed UVB wavelength (270-315 nm) rays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811431161">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811431161">2</xref></sup> The high prevalence of rickets that arose seemingly from nowhere was confusing to physicians of the 17th through early 20th centuries and was a serious health problem.</p>
<p>From 1850 to 1920, rates of rickets were up to 60% in the urban areas of North America, the United Kingdom, Northern Europe, and Northern China.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811431161">11</xref></sup> Because of the crowding in dark tenements of the children of factory workers, the dominance of air polluting coal as a fuel, sooty skies, and their nutritionally inadequate and scarcely affordable high starch, low fat, and low protein diet, these children developed rickets. This serious and crippling bone disorder was ultimately cured or prevented after the discovery of vitamin D by McCollum et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922811431161">12</xref></sup> and the vitamin D<sub>2</sub> (ergocalciferol) supplementation of dairy products by Hess and Anderson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811431161">13</xref></sup> and, independently, by Steenbock and Black.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811431161">14</xref></sup> Following this, nutritional rickets actually became rare, and despite recent increasing rates of rickets,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811431161">15</xref></sup> the incredible prevalence and severity of rickets had disappeared in the United States by the 1930s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811431161">16</xref></sup> At nearly the same time as classic dietary studies of cod liver oil use were performed by McCollum’s team, Hess and Steenbock in animals, and from Harriett Chick’s examination of rachitic Viennese orphans, the role of sunshine and UVB wavelength exposure as a cure for rickets was being recognized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811431161">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922811431161">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922811431161">18</xref></sup> The stimulus for exposure of rachitic children to sunshine or the use of quartz crystal mercury vapor light was based on the earlier observations of Theodore Palm in 1890. Palm, a medical missionary, extensively reviewed the geography of rickets and noted a prevalence of the condition in urban areas and at northern latitudes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811431161">19</xref></sup> Thirty years later, during and or immediately after World War I, the mid-European intake of fats and fish by Austrian and German children was severely limited because of a blockade by Allied navies. These mid-European children suffered with marked rickets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922811431161">20</xref>(p551)</sup> Huldschinsky<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922811431161">21</xref></sup> used quartz crystal lamp exposure of children’s skin; these lamps emitted UV ray wavelengths as low as 270 nm and led to a therapeutic cure, and even prevention, of rickets. He showed radiologic evidence that UV exposure of one limb could cure nonexposed limbs, and surmised that a substance was produced in the skin that acted on bone. Later, Hess in New York and Steenbock in Wisconsin independently demonstrated the value of UV irradiation of both food and skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922811431161">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922811431161">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922811431161">17</xref></sup> This led to a frenzy of sunshine exposure of children, such that a 1931 Children’s Bureau monograph<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811431161">16</xref></sup> strongly advocated tanning of infants and the use of cod liver oil (“sunshine in a bottle”). That vitamin D could arise from dual origins, dietary and photocutaneous, was understood by 1930.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922811431161">22</xref></sup> At this time, the value and importance of sunlight exposure was stressed, with scant recognition of the cutaneous damage by UV light.</p>

<title>Paradox 2: Vitamin D Insufficiency VersusToxicity</title>
<p>Overdosing with oral vitamin D led to a toxicity that was mainly recognized in the late 1930s and 1940s. The level at which vitamin D is safe and at which it becomes toxic was and still is difficult to know precisely. Vitamin D is a substance that can result in toxicity because of increased absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestine. The toxicity is caused by hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, resulting in lassitude, sometimes coma, and even death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922811431161">23</xref></sup> It is certain that the amount of vitamin D in human milk (40 to 80 IU/L) is insufficient to prevent rickets and additional supplementation is required.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922811431161">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922811431161">25</xref></sup> More recent studies have shed light on this sufficiency–toxicity paradox.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922811431161">24</xref></sup> Solar exposure by nursing mothers can elevate breast milk vitamin D values, but these generally remain &lt;100 IU/L.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922811431161">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922811431161"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922811431161">27</xref></sup> Oral supplementation of the mother is a far more effective method of raising milk vitamin D content. At a daily dose of 6400 IU daily to the mother, the milk value was 873 IU/L. This was safe in the short run and there were no upward spikes in the serum values of the nursed infants’ circulating 25(OH)D concentration and no apparent short-term evidence of vitamin D toxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922811431161">27</xref></sup> In a randomized, controlled trial pregnant women with a singleton pregnancy received vitamin D at 400 IU, 2000 IU, or 4000 IU daily. The highest 25(OH)D concentrations in mother and newborn infant were at the 4000 IU daily dose with no apparent safety issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922811431161">28</xref></sup> As the current AAP Policy states, all breast-fed infants, regardless of race or ethnicity, require vitamin D supplementation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922811431161">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>By tradition, when cow milk was supplemented in the 1930s, a concentration of 400 IU/L (10 µg/L) was chosen because that was the amount of vitamin D found in a teaspoonful of cod liver oil of the times.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922811431161">30</xref></sup> This arbitrarily set level in milk has since remained unchanged. In 1997, an IOM committee advocated a recommended daily allowance of 200 IU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922811431161">31</xref></sup> The AAP Committee on Nutrition later increased the recommended dose to 400 IU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922811431161">29</xref></sup> Over the past several years, with numerous reports of populations at risk for vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, recommendations for higher daily doses, up to 4000 IU in adults, have come from leaders in vitamin D nutrition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0009922811431161">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0009922811431161"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0009922811431161">34</xref></sup> Vieth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811431161">15</xref></sup> has even stated that a daily dose of 10 000 IU is safe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811431161">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>What biomarkers define vitamin D toxicity other than hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria? The level of 25(OH)D in the serum associated with hypercalcemia is approximately 150 ng/mL, or possibly even higher. Whether this value always denotes toxicity is somewhat controversial, and the actual toxic value may be only at persistent levels &gt;200 ng/mL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811431161">15</xref></sup> The signs and symptoms of toxicity relate to hypercalcemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922811431161">23</xref></sup>: feeding difficulties, polydipsia, polyuria, constipation, irritability, lassitude, diminished weight gain, and increased tendon reflexes. Biochemical indicators include azotemia, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and mild hypokalemia. Bone resorption can be present, when evaluated by X-ray examination. Nephrocalcinosis, detected by ultrasound, is common. The polyuria is vasopressin resistant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922811431161">23</xref></sup> Hypervitaminosis D was felt to be responsible for the demise of some early arctic explorers who ingested polar bear liver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0009922811431161">35</xref></sup> Vieth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811431161">15</xref></sup> made the point that the toxicity of ingesting polar bear liver relates to extraordinarily high vitamin A content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811431161">15</xref></sup> It is noteworthy, however, that one cannot develop vitamin D toxicity from sun exposure because the cutaneous vitamin D synthesis pathway is switched over to production of the inactive metabolites tachysterol and lumosterol before toxic levels accumulate. The production of these inactive metabolites occurs in the skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0009922811431161">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>By tradition, the daily dose of oral vitamin D that can be associated with early hypervitaminosis D is probably in excess of 2000 IU in infants and more than 4000 IU in older children, but these early reports have been questioned. The initial studies of the upper limits of vitamin D intake in infants were those of Jeans and Stearns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0009922811431161">37</xref></sup> and Stearns et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0009922811431161">38</xref></sup> These investigators reported that daily doses of 1800 to 6300 IU vitamin D could inhibit linear growth. Unfortunately, the data from these studies were never subjected to statistical analysis and patient numbers were small. A further complication was the difference in the period of follow-up between controls and experimental groups. A much more well-controlled study in the mid 1960s demonstrated that in 3 groups of infants fed 300 IU, 550 IU, or 1380 to 2170 IU daily, no differences in growth, length, weight, or serum calcium were found.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0009922811431161">39</xref></sup> The clear safety of 2000 IU daily in infants has been shown in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0009922811431161">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0009922811431161">40</xref></sup> The recent IOM report reviews data that indicate that 4000 IU daily can be given safely to children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811431161">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>Paradox 3: Osseous Versus Nonosseous Properties</title>
<p>Only in the 1960s was it established that vitamin D had to be further metabolized to be activated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811431161">6</xref></sup> It is now well established that vitamin D is a prohormone that promotes skeletal health via the well described vitamin D–parathyroid hormone–bone feedback loop. The biologic action of vitamin D occurs following 2 bioconversions; first to a liver metabolite, 25(OH)D, and then to a renal metabolite, 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>D. Synthesis of these compounds is regulated by 2 specific cytochrome p450 enzymes, (25-hydroxylase and CYP27B).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922811431161">6</xref></sup> The active metabolite, 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, acts after binding to a vitamin D receptor and enters the nucleus of the cell in the form of a heterodimer with a retinol receptor (RXR), which then becomes part of a complex that binds to the vitamin D response element of the promoter region of a gene. Following this DNA binding there occurs upregulation and increased transcription of some 200 to 300 proteins and peptides. These products include calcium binding proteins, which augment intestinal calcium absorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0009922811431161">41</xref></sup> As serum calcium rises, the secretion of parathyroid hormone and activity of CYP27B decline and the feedback loop is completed.

<p>The osseous properties of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D depend largely on the circulating concentrations of this metabolite.

<title>Paradox 4: Vitamin D Sufficiency Versus Insufficiency</title>
<p>How can one define vitamin D sufficiency? Does the serum 25(OH)D concentration denote an unequivocal surrogate biomarker? One school of thought is that vitamin D deficiency is defined by a serum value of less than 20 ng/mL and that insufficiency is defined by values in the range of 20 ng/mL up to 30-40 ng/mL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811431161">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0009922811431161">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0009922811431161">36</xref></sup> Other experts are of the opinion that less than 20 ng/mL qualifies as deficient and more than 20 ng/mL is sufficient. According to several large population surveys, including sequential National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, substantial numbers of infants, children, pregnant women, and the elderly could be considered vitamin D deficient or insufficient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811431161">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811431161">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811431161">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0009922811431161">42</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0009922811431161"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0009922811431161"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0009922811431161">45</xref></sup> These findings, strong urging from the vitamin D community, and requests from the United States and Canadian governments led to a new IOM report on vitamin D adequacy that was published in November 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811431161">1</xref></sup> The committee provided an exhaustive review of studies on potential health outcomes. The conclusions from this report (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922811431161">Table 2</xref>) are based on evidence from prospective, randomized double-blinded clinical trials (as are all IOM reports) that are focused on the osseous effects of vitamin D. The report stated that there is little direct evidence for the nonosseous effects of vitamin D: Reports on nonosseous effects are observational and epidemiologic and have variable results but are not prospective or double-blinded. The evidence for osseous effects is solid, including analysis showing that a serum value of 20 ng/mL vitamin D is adequate to ensure bone health in more than 97.5% of the population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811431161">1</xref></sup> This most recent IOM committee report recommended a daily allowance of 400 IU (10 µg) for infants and 600 IU for older children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811431161">1</xref></sup> The intense focus of the report on bone health and the general lack of comment on the nonosseous role of vitamin D has led to sharp criticism from several vitamin D scientists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0009922811431161">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0009922811431161"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0009922811431161">34</xref></sup> This paradox of a nonosseous role for vitamin D as well as an established osseous role and the precise serum 25(OH)D value associated with sufficiency for each role is currently undergoing greater scrutiny. A number of prospective trials are in process and can be viewed at the ClinicalTrials.gov registry and results database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">http://clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link>). To date, the evidence does not support a fully established role for vitamin D in cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, preventing fractures from falls, immune response, neuropsychological functioning, physical performance, preeclampsia, or reproductive outcomes. The epidemiologic claims that vitamin D can prevent several forms of cancer (eg, breast, prostate, colon) have thus far not been upheld by randomized controlled trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0009922811431161">46</xref></sup> In essence, the implication concerning nonosseous roles of vitamin D that come from the IOM report is that there may be a biological plausibility and/or an epidemiologic association. However, there is not consistent, conclusive, or sufficient evidence to support a daily dose or a range of serum 25-(OH)D concentrations associated with nonosseous functions of the vitamin.

<title>Paradox 5: Sunshine Is Necessary for Optimal Bone Health Versus Its Harmful Effects</title>
<p>The fifth paradox relates to the role of sunshine and UVB exposure in vitamin D nutrition, which depends on time spent in the sun, latitude, season, zenith angle of the sun, air pollution, and skin melanin content. If one’s sunshine exposure is limited, vitamin D must be supplied in the diet by dairy products and vitamin D–containing foods such as fish or in dietary supplements.</p>
<p>Arguing against the notion of achieving vitamin D sufficiency by sun exposure is the real fear of and the rising incidence of skin cancer, especially basal cell carcinoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0009922811431161">47</xref></sup> Today, many adults who grew up in the “sun is healthy” era are the victims of this cancer epidemic.

<p>Why does sunshine appear to be more hazardous now than in the past? If true, what contributes to this increased intensity of UVB rays? The skies were darker between 1600 and 1960 because coal was the major fuel for home heating and for industry. What had occurred was that the population growth during the industrial revolution far outstripped available supplies of wood, and coal and coke became the main fuel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0009922811431161">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0009922811431161">50</xref></sup> Newcastle and other British mining districts supplied 5/6 of the world’s coal in 1700, and all are located well above 35° north, where scant UVB rays strike the earth’s surface in late fall, winter and early spring because of the lengthening zenith angle of the sun. Moreover, the cities where coal consumption was the highest had the greatest haze in their skies and the highest rates of rickets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922811431161">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>The 19th century was particularly marked by atmospheric haze, not only because of coal consumption and particulate matter in the air but also because of volcanic ash that circulated in the atmosphere for many years. Four catastrophic volcanoes erupted between 1815 and 1902: Tambora, Krakatoa, Santa Maria, and Mount Pelée.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0009922811431161">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0009922811431161"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0009922811431161"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0009922811431161">54</xref></sup> Lava and ash eruptions rose into the atmosphere, blocking sunlight and absorbing UV rays. Mount Tambora (1815) was the most explosive eruption in 1300 years. Its volcanic explosivity index was 7, which is 170 times stronger than Mt. St. Helen’s eruption in 1980.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0009922811431161">52</xref></sup> In 1816, the aftereffects of the eruption caused “the year without a summer.” This year was marked by crop failure, snow where it was usually not seen, lakes where ice remained all year, massive inflation in food costs and serious starvation. Krakatoa (1883), in the Sunda Straits region of Indonesia (as was Tambora), was so loud it was heard 3000 miles away<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0009922811431161">54</xref></sup> and led to a tsunami killing 40 000 people. The 1902 eruptions of Santa Maria in Guatemala and Mount Pelée in Martinique were murderous, and ash darkened the skies of the northern hemisphere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0009922811431161">53</xref></sup> Some of the most beautiful sunsets in art were painted after these eruptions. Joseph Mallord William Turner’s sunsets in the 1820’s, Edvard Munch’s painting, <italic>The Scream</italic>, in 1893 and Walter Sickert’s views of Venice after 1902 are examples. All these major 19th-century volcanic events lead to a general atmospheric dimming, which blocked the amount of UV rays striking the earth’s surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0009922811431161">55</xref></sup> Volcanoes in the 20th century have not been as intense and the ash is more localized. Atmospheric dimming has fallen since 1990.</p>
<p>Beginning between 1950 and 1965, 3 major events influenced atmospheric conditions and set the stage for the atmosphere of today. These were (<italic>a</italic>) the use of other fuels, especially nuclear energy, hydroelectricity, and noncoal hydrocarbons, which improved the haze caused by coal and coke use; (<italic>b</italic>) the rising release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from aerosols, whose influence will persist in the stratosphere until 2050 or later; and (<italic>c</italic>) aggressive campaigns against atmospheric and other emissions as industrialized nations embraced an awareness of the environment of the air and the water surface of the earth that has continued unabated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0009922811431161">55</xref></sup> Examples of accepted environmental recommendations are ever-stricter auto emission standards, the nearly universal abandonment of coal-fueled rail trains and ships, a requirement for filtered smoke stacks, a decline in the soot and particles released from massive iron and steel works, and the disappearance of the burning of tires, leaves, and garbage all too common in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
<p>Dimming, an atmospheric science term, influences the penetrance of UVB rays; this phenomenon had been increasing in the atmosphere until 1990 and is always intensified after a volcanic eruption. The predominant cause of dimming is CFCs, and their production has been regulated since 1978.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0009922811431161">56</xref></sup> Of all events influencing solar UV wavelength exposure, none is more dramatic than CFCs leaving the troposphere and entering the stratosphere, where they are struck by UV rays, breaking the carbon–chloride bond and forming free radical Cl-. This Cl- radical reacts with ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) to yield O<sub>2</sub> + free radical Cl-. A chain reaction is set up that continues until the Cl- is precipitated as acidified rain. Highly stable CFCs were banned by the Montreal Protocol in 1978. The newer CFCs are less stable and are destroyed before reaching the stratospheric ozone layer. The older CFCs, although no longer produced, will likely remain as reactants in the stratosphere for 40 to 50 years or longer. This depletion of a protective ozone layer has allowed more UVB rays to penetrate to the earth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0009922811431161">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reduction in particulate matter released into the atmosphere does not equate to a reduction in the release of CO<sub>2</sub> and greenhouse gases, which may increase as more fuel is consumed in the industrialization of China, India, and Indonesia. CO<sub>2</sub> release generally does not influence UV A and B rays.</p>
<p>Increased UV exposure also comes from snow, sand, and increased boating, which all cause exposure to reflected sunlight. Also, the population center of the United States is moving southward and westward, which causes more sun exposure. Most worrisome, however, is the use of tanning booths, especially by young people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811431161">1</xref></sup> Tanning booths emit UVA rays, which are associated with skin aging and skin cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0009922811431161">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0009922811431161">56</xref></sup> High-energy UVB rays cause direct DNA damage and produce typical mutations, including pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts. The types of mutations arising from these compounds are found in non-melanoma skin cancers. Melanomas carry a BRAF mutation if they are on sun-exposed sites. The common BRAF mutation, a T1799A single nucleotide substitution, is secondary to oxidative damage due to UVA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0009922811431161">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0009922811431161">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0009922811431161">57</xref></sup> The fact that UVA rays lead to melanoma forms an even greater argument for why individuals with skin type I or II (fair skin that burns easily) should use sunscreen. The light in tanning booths does not result in sunburn, but can increase skin cancer rates because of excessive UVA exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811431161">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The FDA has recently taken measures to establish standards for testing the effectiveness of sunscreen products, and regulations that require sunscreen labeling that accurately reflects test results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0009922811431161">Table 4</xref>). Manufacturers of sunscreen will be given guidance on how to test and label their products in light of these new measures. Sunscreen products that are not broad spectrum or that are broad spectrum with SPF values from 2 to14 will be labeled with a warning that reads: “Skin Cancer/Skin Aging Alert: Spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer and early skin aging. This product has been shown only to help prevent sunburn, not skin cancer or early skin aging” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.FDA.gov/sunscreen">http://www.FDA.gov/sunscreen</ext-link>, June 14, 2011). Also, sunscreens cannot claim protection immediately on application (eg, “instant protection”) or protection for more than 2 hours without reapplication, unless they submit data and get approval from FDA. There has also been a data request for safety and effectiveness information for sunscreen products formulated in certain dosage forms (eg, sprays).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In the end, the 5 paradoxes can be reconciled. Vitamin D comes from both ingestion and exposure to UVB rays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0009922811431161">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0009922811431161">58</xref></sup> There is wide latitude in the dosage of the vitamin that can be ingested. Excessive sunshine exposure should be avoided by use of shade and sunscreen. Caucasians and East Asians, particularly those who burn and do not tan, require extensive sunscreen protection. Maintaining vitamin D adequacy in the face of sun protection strategies will require dietary supplementation. The precise serum 25(OH)D level that reflects appropriate vitamin D sufficiency will require ongoing study, as recommended by the recent IOM report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811431161">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, vitamin D is not a drug or even a vitamin. It is a prohormone that requires dietary supplementation if photocutaneous synthesis is inadequate to meet daily needs. From 1600 to 1930, hazy skies limited UVB exposure and rickets was common. Today, we have lost the protection of the ozone layer so we need to avoid the sun. Vitamin D is vital for life because, in its most biologically active form, it binds to receptors in more than 30 tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0009922811431161">41</xref></sup> Following heterodimerization with one of several retinoic acids, 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>D acts as a transcription factor in the synthesis of 200 to 300 peptides and proteins whose osseous properties are secure and whose nonosseous biologic properties are being more widely recognized and are now becoming the subject of prospective randomized clinical trials. The next IOM report on calcium and vitamin D reference intakes will likely reflect these expanded properties of vitamin D as these trials are concluded.</p>
