<abstract>
<p>The <italic>Global Partnership for Effective Diabetes Management</italic>, established to provide practical guidance to improve patient outcomes in diabetes, has developed and modified recommendations to improve glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes. The <italic>Global Partnership</italic> advocates an individualized therapeutic approach and, as part of the process to customize therapy, has previously identified specific type 2 diabetes patient subgroups that require special consideration. This article builds on earlier publications, expanding the scope of practical guidance to include newly diagnosed individuals with complications and women with diabetes in pregnancy. Good glycaemic control remains the cornerstone of managing type 2 diabetes, and plays a vital role in preventing or delaying the onset and progression of diabetic complications. Individualizing therapeutic goals and treatments to meet glycaemic targets safely and without delay remains paramount, in addition to a wider programme of care to reduce cardiovascular risk factors and improve patient outcomes.</p>

<p>A main outcome of such a discussion is the appreciation that a ‘one-size-fits-all’ strategy for managing type 2 diabetes will not provide a great deal of treatment success. Such an approach does not take into consideration the heterogeneity of the patient population (i.e. phenotype, genotype, age, disease duration, complications status, susceptibility to medication adverse effects, education etc.), requiring that individualized management should be employed along with full consideration of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in the context of multifactorial interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1479164113490765">7</xref></sup> Moreover, in the past decade, new pharmacological options have been made available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes after metformin failure, and more options are advanced in development such as sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.</p>
<p>Added on top of metformin, the different pharmacological options are associated with a similar level of efficacy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1479164113490765">3</xref></sup> although they differentiate with respect to other features (effect on body weight, risk of hypoglycaemia, potential CV safety/protection etc. [<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1479164113490765">Table 2</xref>]). Given these new options, the <italic>Global Partnership</italic> already advocated the need for an individualized therapeutic approach, and in an attempt to facilitate customized treatment, we identified specific type 2 diabetes patient subgroups that require special consideration and proposed practical advice for setting glycaemic targets for these groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1479164113490765">7</xref></sup> A patient-centred approach has also been recommended by several organizations, such as the Canadian Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, and more recently, this approach was included in the updated joint position statement of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1479164113490765">8</xref></sup> Herein, we review the recent evidence to refine our recommendations on individualization of therapy in terms of glycaemic targets and choice of treatment.</p>

<title>Defining glycaemic targets: the evidence</title>
<p>Hyperglycaemia defines diabetes, and glycaemic control is fundamental to management of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1479164113490765">9</xref></sup> The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) established that early intensive glycaemic control in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients is associated with significantly decreased rates of microvascular complications (retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1479164113490765">10</xref></sup> For macrovascular complications, a trend towards a reduced rate of myocardial infarctions (MIs) was observed in patients treated with intensive therapy, although this was not statistically significant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1479164113490765">10</xref></sup> Ten-year follow-up of patients in the UKPDS, during which glycaemic control was similar between groups, demonstrated that the benefit of intensive therapy (i.e. reduction in microvascular complications)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1479164113490765">10</xref></sup> was maintained over the long term.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164113490765">11</xref></sup> Analysis of the long-term UKPDS data also showed that those patients treated intensively to achieve glycaemic control received a benefit in terms of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and total mortality reduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164113490765">11</xref></sup> These findings from the long-term follow-up led to the concept of a ‘legacy effect’ for both micro- and macrovascular complications resulting from early and intensive glycaemic control,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1479164113490765">11</xref></sup> and highlight the importance of optimizing metabolic control as early as possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1479164113490765">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other intervention studies (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes [ACCORD], Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Magnetic Resonance Controlled Evaluation [ADVANCE] and Veterans’ Administration Diabetes Trial [VADT]) that included patients with known CVD or multiple CV risk factors who had type 2 diabetes for a longer period than those enrolled in the UKPDS confirmed the benefits of intensive glycaemic control to reduce microvascular complications, predominantly nephropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1479164113490765">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1479164113490765"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1479164113490765">15</xref></sup> However, results from these individual trials did not demonstrate a reduction in macrovascular complications with an intensive therapy regimen and, in fact, treating to a HbA<sub>1c</sub> target of &lt;6% (&lt;42 mmol/mol) (and achieving &lt;6.5% [&lt;48 mmol/mol]) in the ACCORD study was associated with an increase in mortality of 22%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1479164113490765">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the neutral or negative outcomes on macrovascular complications in these studies despite the benefits on microvascular disease, the temptation to relax measures that reduce hyperglycaemia would seem understandable. It is vital, therefore, that these results are viewed in context,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1479164113490765">16</xref></sup> and new analyses are considered that not only reinforce the need to reduce glycaemia effectively (in order to manage the risk of microvascular complications) but also clarify the benefit of early and intensive control of hyperglycaemia on macrovascular disease.</p>
<p>In ACCORD, ADVANCE and VADT, the overall CV mortality rate was actually substantially lower than originally expected, although this most likely reflects general improvements in type 2 diabetes management such as multifactorial therapeutic strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1479164113490765">7</xref></sup> The study duration of these trials (3.5–5.6 years) may have been too short for any significant benefits of tight glycaemic control on CV outcomes to become apparent (as opposed to the 10-year follow-up in the UKPDS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1479164113490765">16</xref></sup> Furthermore, the patients enrolled in the short-term studies had a history of poorly controlled long-standing diabetes together with either micro- or macrovascular complications,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1479164113490765">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1479164113490765"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1479164113490765">15</xref></sup> and were therefore at higher risk of negative outcomes than their counterparts in the UKPDS (newly diagnosed patients with no prior CV events).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1479164113490765">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>A meta-analysis of the UKPDS, Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events (PROactive), ADVANCE, ACCORD and VADT studies found that intensive therapy achieving a modest 0.9% (10 mmol/mol) reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> was associated with a 17% reduction in non-fatal MI and a 15% reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) compared with conventional therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1479164113490765">17</xref></sup> Further meta-analyses have also evaluated the effectiveness of good glycaemic control in preventing or delaying the onset of macrovascular complications and provide potential explanations for the lack of apparent benefits seen in landmark trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1479164113490765">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1479164113490765"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1479164113490765">20</xref></sup> A Cochrane review of intensive glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes (including 20 trials and ~30,000 patients) reported a significant 14% reduction in non-fatal MI with intensive glycaemic control, although no differences in all-cause or CV mortality were reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1479164113490765">18</xref></sup> In this analysis, patients who had poor glycaemic control at baseline (higher fasting blood glucose or HbA<sub>1c</sub>) were less likely to benefit from intensive control in terms of all-cause mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1479164113490765">18</xref></sup> Pooled analyses have also suggested that the presence of CVD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1479164113490765">20</xref></sup> a higher degree of obesity and longer duration of diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1479164113490765">19</xref></sup> are factors associated with poorer outcomes in patients receiving intensive glycaemic control.</p>
<p>Retrospective analysis of ACCORD data suggested that episodes of severe hypoglycaemia may be associated with a high mortality rate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1479164113490765">21</xref></sup> possibly reflecting the intensive escalation of therapy in those patients failing to achieve the low HbA<sub>1c</sub> target of &lt;6% (&lt;42 mmol/mol).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1479164113490765">16</xref></sup> However, the higher mortality rate in the intensive therapy arm was not related to the incidence of hypoglycaemia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1479164113490765">21</xref></sup> and a post hoc analysis later showed that the excess mortality actually occurred in patients who did not achieve their HbA<sub>1c</sub> target (or who had displayed substantial hyperglycaemia).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1479164113490765">22</xref></sup> That is, intensive therapy in individuals with poorly controlled diabetes may, in fact, carry a higher risk of mortality than in patients with better controlled disease.</p>
<p>The ADVANCE investigators also pointed out that hypoglycaemia rather than being a trigger for CV events may represent a marker for vulnerability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1479164113490765">14</xref></sup> A post hoc analysis of data from ADVANCE reported that reducing HbA<sub>1c</sub> to less than 7% (53 mmol/mol) was not associated with an added benefit in terms of CV risk reduction but also showed that lowering HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels even further did not appear to be harmful.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Good glycaemic control remains the cornerstone of managing type 2 diabetes and plays a vital role in preventing or delaying the onset and progression of diabetic complications. Treating a heterogeneous population of patients as a homogenous group is impractical and does not take into account the variety of factors that affect patients with type 2 diabetes. As such, the ‘<italic>10 steps to get more type 2 diabetes patients to goal</italic>’, developed by the <italic>Global Partnership</italic>, continue to offer a valuable way of ensuring patients achieve and maintain their glycaemic targets. This article builds on earlier publications, expanding the scope of practical guidance to account for newly diagnosed individuals with complications and for women with diabetes in pregnancy. Individualizing therapeutic goals and treatments to meet those goals remains paramount, as is the recognition that early and intensive glycaemic control to achieve near-normal HbA<sub>1c</sub> targets, while essential in some patient subgroups, is not applicable to every patient with type 2 diabetes.</p>
