        <p>Less supervision by the executive system after disruption of the right prefrontal cortex
          leads to increased risk taking in gambling because superficially attractive—but
          risky—choices are not suppressed. Similarly, people might gamble more in multitask
          situations than in single-task situations because concurrent executive processes usually
          interfere with each other. In the study reported here, we used a novel monetary
          decision-making paradigm to investigate whether multitasking could reduce rather than
          increase risk taking in gambling. We found that performing a task that induced cautious
          motor responding reduced gambling in a multitask situation (Experiment 1). We then found
          that a short period of inhibitory training lessened risk taking in gambling at least 2 hr
          later (Experiments 2 and 3). Our findings indicate that proactive motor control strongly
          affects monetary risk taking in gambling. The link between control systems at different
          cognitive levels might be exploited to develop new methods for rehabilitation of addiction
          and impulse-control disorders.</p>

    <p>Flexible behavior and decision making require an executive control system, which oversees
      subordinate processes and intervenes when outcomes become suboptimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797611434538">Monsell &amp; Driver, 2000</xref>). Impairments in executive
      control lead to maladaptive behavior because irrelevant motor actions are not inhibited.
      Similarly, less supervision by the executive system leads to impaired decision making because
      distracting information and suboptimal choices are not suppressed. Studies in the clinical and
      neuroscience domains suggest that executive control of the motor system may share mechanisms
      with high-level decision making. For instance, the latency of stopping motor responses is
      prolonged in pathological gamblers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797611434538">Goudriaan, Oosterlaan, de Beurs, &amp; Van Den Brink, 2006</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797611434538">Lipszyc &amp; Schachar, 2010</xref>). Similar
      response-inhibition deficits have been observed in other impulse-control disorders, such as
      ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797611434538">Chamberlain &amp; Sahakian,
        2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0956797611434538">Nigg, 2001</xref>), or in
      individuals with substance dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797611434538">Bechara, Noel, &amp; Crone, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797611434538">de Wit, 2009</xref>).</p>
    <p>Cognitive neuroscience studies suggest that brain areas associated with inhibiting motor
      output also regulate risk-taking behavior by suppressing superficially attractive but risky
      choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797611434538">Cohen &amp; Lieberman,
      2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797611434538">Knoch et al., 2006</xref>).
      For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797611434538">Knoch et al. (2006)</xref>
      used transcranial magnetic stimulation to show that temporarily disrupting the right
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)—which is important for executive control of motor
      actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797611434538">Bogacz, Wagenmakers, Forstmann,
        &amp; Nieuwenhuis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797611434538">Garavan,
        Ross, &amp; Stein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797611434538">Ivanoff,
        Branning, &amp; Marois, 2008</xref>)—led to increased risk taking in gambling. On the basis
      of such findings, researchers have proposed that efficient control of impulses and urges in
      different domains relies on overlapping inhibitory mechanisms that allow people to suppress
      thoughts, actions, and decisions that are inappropriate, suboptimal, or potentially harmful
        (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797611434538">Chambers, Garavan, &amp; Bellgrove,
        2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797611434538">Crews &amp; Boettiger,
        2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797611434538">Goudriaan, Oosterlaan, de
        Beurs, &amp; Van den Brink, 2004</xref>). However, direct support for such claims is scarce
      and mostly limited to correlational findings.</p>
    <p>Therefore, we sought to uncover direct evidence that inhibitory motor control shares
      mechanisms with decision making when gambling by examining how these processes interact in
      multitask situations. Intuitively, people assume that the brain isolates decision making in
      different domains, with problems at higher cognitive levels (e.g., “should I take a day off or
      go to work?”) solved independently of problems at motor levels (e.g., “should I reach for that
      hot saucepan?”). However, behavioral scientists have shown that making multiple decisions
      simultaneously typically leads to impoverished behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0956797611434538">Marois &amp; Ivanoff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0956797611434538">Pashler &amp; Johnston, 1998</xref>). For example, using a
      cell phone in the car hinders driving performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0956797611434538">Strayer &amp; Johnston, 2001</xref>). Similarly, monetary
      decision making might become less regulated in multitask situations because concurrent
      executive processes usually interfere with each other. Therefore, people might place riskier
      bets when gambling in multitask situations than in single-task situations because the
      executive system would be less able to suppress the tendency to pick higher and more
      appealing—yet also more risky—amounts.</p>
    <p>But are the effects of multitasking on gambling and decision making necessarily detrimental?
      In the study reported here, we asked whether executive control in a concurrent task might
      actually reduce rather than increase risk taking in gambling. Specifically, we examined
      whether instructing participants to occasionally stop a motor response while they made
      monetary decisions encouraged them to place safer bets. Evidence of such a transfer of control
      between cognitive domains would have two important implications. First, it would provide
      direct support for the hypothesis that there is an overlap in executive mechanisms that
      regulate motor responses and decision making. Second, it could open new avenues for the
      treatment of psychiatric disorders that are linked to impaired inhibitory control, such as
      ADHD, substance abuse, and pathological gambling.</p>
    <p>We examined the interaction between motor control and gambling using a novel behavioral task
        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797611434538">Fig. 1</xref>). Participants were asked to
      gamble on one of six monetary amounts; however, participants were informed that the higher the
      amount, the less probable a win. Thus, selecting higher amounts constituted a more risky bet,
      whereas selecting lower amounts constituted a safer bet. Risk taking in our task consisted of
      preferring relatively higher amounts that carried a higher probability of losing (and in case
      of the most risky options, a negative expected value)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0956797611434538">1</xref></sup> over lower amounts that carried a lower
      probability of losing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797611434538">Boyer, 2006</xref>);
      this is the same behavior that pathological gamblers engage in when, for example, wagering on
      horse races.</p>

        <p>Example sequences for (a) no-signal trials and (b) signal trials in Experiment 1. In both
          types of trials, participants were presented with a display showing six numbers that
          indicated the number of points that could be won on that trial. These numbers were aligned
          above the letter keys to which they were assigned. The bars started rising after a 3.5-s
          delay and stopped at the top line after 1.333 s or 1.667 s (arrows are for illustrative
          purposes only). On no-signal trials, participants had to choose a number before the end of
          the trial but not sooner than 0.25 s before the bars reached the top line. On signal
          trials, the top of the bars turned black before the top line was reached. On these trials,
          participants either had to refrain from responding (stop group) or make an extra response
          by pressing the space bar after choosing a number (double-response group). On no-signal
          trials, participants received the chosen number of points if they won, and they forfeited
          half the chosen number of points if they lost; on signal trials, subjects won or lost a
          fixed amount (see the Method section for details). At the end of each trial, participants
          were told how much they had won or lost and what their current balance was.</p>

    <p>In Experiment 1, participants performed the gambling task throughout the session. In some
      blocks (dual-task blocks), they also undertook a secondary task. The nature of the secondary
      task depended on the condition participants were assigned to. In the double-response
      condition, the secondary task required participants to occasionally execute an additional
      response when an extra signal occurred. Research has shown that monitoring for occasional
      signals and preparing additional responses increase dual-task demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0956797611434538">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2009c</xref>). If executive processes
      at different levels of control interfere with each other, then participants should place
      riskier bets in dual-task blocks than in single-task blocks (in which participants had to
      perform only the gambling task) because the executive system would be less able to suppress
      the tendency to choose the riskier amounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797611434538">Cohen &amp; Lieberman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797611434538">Knoch et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
    <p>In the stop condition, participants tried to stop themselves from making a choice when a
      signal occurred. Three accounts offered opposing predictions regarding participants’ choice
      behavior in the stop condition. According to the interference account, cross-task interference
      in multitask situations should cause participants to place riskier bets in dual-task blocks
      than in single-task blocks. By contrast, the transfer account holds that occasionally stopping
      motor responses should induce a general state of cautiousness that may propagate across
      cognitive domains. When preparing to stop, people make proactive adjustments and become more
      cautious in executing motor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797611434538">Aron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0956797611434538">Verbruggen &amp;
        Logan, 2009c</xref>). If there is an overlap between mechanisms that regulate motor
      cautiousness and mechanisms that control gambling behavior, then cautiousness may transfer
      between domains; consequently, preparation for stopping motor responses might encourage
      risk-aversive behavior. Finally, according to the independence account, the cognitive
      processes involved in motor inhibition and gambling are mechanistically distinct; therefore,
      performing a double-response or stop task should not influence monetary decision making.</p>
    <p>In Experiment 1, we found support for the transfer account. We therefore conducted two
      additional experiments in which participants completed a stop task or a double-response task
      prior to the gambling task, to test whether motor inhibition training leads to more cautious
      gambling behavior later in time.</p>

          <title>Procedure</title>
          <p>Stimuli were presented on a 19-in. LCD monitor against a gray background. The task was
            run using the Psychophysics Toolbox (Version 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797611434538">Brainard, 1997</xref>). On each trial, six vertical bars
            of equal height were arrayed left to right above a horizontal line; there was a second
            horizontal line at the top of the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797611434538">Fig. 1</xref>). Each bar was associated with a different
            monetary amount and a specific response key (the “d,” “f,” “g,” “h,” “j,” or “k” key of
            a keyboard). Subjects were instructed to select one of the amounts by pressing the
            corresponding key, and they were informed that the probability of winning decreased as
            the amount increased. Rather than simply presenting the amounts from lowest to highest,
            we varied the order from trial to trial to prevent choice from being driven by
            spatial-attention or response-bias effects (which might occur, for example, if higher
            amounts were consistently presented on the right of the screen).</p>
          <p>At the start of each trial in the single-task blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797611434538">Fig. 1a</xref>), there was a 3.5-s delay, and then the
            bars started rising together. All bars reached the top line simultaneously after 1.33 s
            on low-bar trials (in which the distance between the bottom and top lines was
            approximately 7.5 cm) or after 1.67 s on high-bar trials (in which the distance between
            the bottom and top lines was approximately 9 cm). We manipulated bar height to test for
            effects of choice latency (see Supplementary Analyses Experiment 1 in the Supplemental
            Material available online). Trials ended 0.25 s after the bars reached the top line. The
            long time intervals (average = 5 s) and the initial phase in which the bars did not rise
            ensured that there was minimal time pressure to make a decision. Participants had to
            make a response before the end of the trial but not sooner than 0.25 s before the bars
            reached the top line. We used the moving bars and the response-window restrictions to
            ensure that stop signals could be presented at an optimal moment (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797611434538">Coxon, Stinear, &amp; Byblow,
              2007</xref>). Feedback was presented at the end of each trial to indicate how much
            participants had won or lost and what their current balance was. The feedback screen was
            replaced by a blank screen after 2.5 s, and the following trial started after a further
            0.5 s.</p>
          <p>In dual-task blocks, the procedure was the same as in single-task blocks on two of
            every three trials; however, on one of every three trials (signal trials), the top of
            the rising bars turned black just before reaching the top line (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797611434538">Fig. 1b</xref>). On signal trials in the double-response
            group, participants had to press the space bar of the keyboard with either thumb after
            they had indicated their monetary choice. They had to press the space bar within 0.25 s
            after the bars reached the top line. On signal trials in the stop group, participants
            tried to refrain from making any response on the keyboard. In both groups, the moment of
            signal presentation was dynamically adjusted using a tracking procedure, which ensured
            that each individual would succeed in making the double response (double-response group)
            or withhold the response (stop group) on approximately 50% of the signal trials.
            Initially, the bars turned black 0.266 s before the top line was reached. When
            participants successfully stopped their response or pressed the space bar in time, this
            delay was decreased by 0.033 s on the following trial, which made it harder to
            successfully stop or execute the double response. When participants failed to stop or
            execute the double-response in time, the delay was increased by 0.033 s. At the
            beginning of each block, a cue (“NO-SIGNAL BLOCK” or “SIGNAL BLOCK”) was presented in
            the center of the screen.</p>
          <p>On each trial in both single- and dual-task blocks, participants could win or lose
            points. The exact amount depended on the stakes (low, medium, or high). The numbers of
            points participants could win in the low-stakes condition were 112
              (<italic>p</italic><sub>win</sub> = .15), 64 (<italic>p</italic><sub>win</sub> = .27),
            32 (<italic>p</italic><sub>win</sub> = .39), 16 (<italic>p</italic><sub>win</sub> =
            .51), 6 (<italic>p</italic><sub>win</sub> = .63), or 2 (<italic>p</italic><sub>win</sub>
            = .75). When participants lost, they lost half of the amount they gambled. A random
            number generator determined whether a participant won or lost. On each trial, a number
            between 0 and 1 was selected; when the generated number was smaller than the probability
            of winning the chosen amount, participants won; otherwise, they lost. Amounts decreased
            exponentially to make the higher amounts more attractive. Without revealing the exact
            probabilities, we informed participants at the beginning of the experiment that the
            probability of winning was lower for higher amounts. Because we could not infer which
            response participants were planning to execute on successful stop-signal trials, the
            number of points won or lost on all signal trials was fixed. Participants won 10 points
            on successful signal trials and lost 10 points on unsuccessful signal trials in both the
            stop and double-response groups. Thus, on double-response trials, participants always
            won or lost 10 points, regardless of their choice. Similarly, on unsuccessful stop
            trials, participants always lost 10 points, regardless of the amount they indicated with
            their incorrectly executed choice response.</p>
          <p>In the medium-stakes condition, all amounts were two times greater than in the
            low-stakes condition; in the high-stakes condition, amounts were four times greater than
            in the low-stakes condition. We manipulated the stakes for several reasons: to increase
            selection demands, to encourage processing of the different amounts on each trial, and
            to encourage participants to consider the relative risk or benefit of each amount. The
            three stakes occurred in random order with equal probability, and participants were not
            explicitly informed whether the trial featured low, medium, or high stakes. Each
            participant’s starting balance was 2,500 points. At the end of the experiment, the total
            amount won was converted to money (1,000 points = £1).</p>
          <p>The experiment started with a short practice phase that consisted of a single-task
            block and a dual-task block. Practice trials were conducted following the same procedure
            used for test trials. The balance of points won or lost was reset after this practice
            phase. The experimental phase consisted of four single-task blocks and four dual-task
            blocks of 36 trials each. There was a short break between each block, and single- and
            dual-task blocks alternated.</p>

          <title>Betting scores</title>
          <p>For each participant, we calculated a betting score by taking the average of all his or
            her choices (range = 1–6). Choice 1 corresponded to the smallest amount, which had the
            highest probability of winning (hence was the safest bet). Choice 6 was the highest
            amount, which had the lowest probability of winning (hence was the most risky bet).
            Consequently, a higher average betting score indicated that participants preferred
            riskier bets with a lower probability of winning.</p>

        <title>Results and discussion</title>
        <p>Approximately 50% of responses on signal trials were correct, which confirmed the
          effectiveness of the tracking procedures (failed double responses = 46%, failed stops =
          47%). Thus, there was no consistent difference in success rates on signal trials between
          the groups (<italic>F</italic> &lt; 1). Even though we did not use separate tracking
          procedures for each stake, additional analyses showed that the percentage of failed signal
          trials was similar for each stake (low stakes = 47%, medium stakes = 46%, high stakes =
          49%; <italic>p</italic> &gt; .39). This was true for both groups (i.e., the interaction
          between stake and group was not significant, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .18).</p>
        <p>To test the effect of multitasking on gambling, we compared betting scores between
          dual-task and single-task blocks. We concentrated specifically on no-signal trials. This
          allowed us to isolate the behavioral effects of monitoring for extra signals and preparing
          to either make a double response or to stop the first response (in dual-task blocks),
          compared with conditions without such demands (single-task blocks).</p>
        <p>We analyzed betting scores using a mixed analysis of variance with block type (single
          task vs. dual task) and stake (low, medium, high) as within-subjects factors and group
          (double response vs. stop) as a between-subjects factor (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0956797611434538">Table 2</xref>). Results showed that participants in the
          double-response group tended to place more risky bets in dual-task blocks (mean betting
          score = 2.77) than in single-task blocks (mean betting score = 2.72; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0956797611434538">Fig. 2a</xref>), but this effect failed to reach
          significance. More important, however, participants in the stop group showed the opposite
          result: They not only became more cautious when making their choices (as indexed by longer
          choice latencies; see Supplementary Analyses Experiment 1 in the Supplemental Material),
          but also placed overall safer bets in dual-task blocks (mean betting score = 2.62) than in
          single-task blocks (mean betting score = 2.77), <italic>F</italic>(1, 23) = 4.7,

        </fig>
        <p>The effect of block type in the stop group shows that preparing to stop motor responses
          encourages cautious monetary decisions and that this cautiousness counteracts and reverses
          the detrimental effects usually associated with multitasking. Thus, multitasking does not
          necessarily lead to increased risk taking in gambling; concurrent executive processes can
          make people generally risk aversive when these processes regulate cautiousness at a motor
              level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0956797611434538">2</xref></sup> This
          conclusion was supported by a significant two-way Block Type × Group interaction
            (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). There was also a main effect of stake, which indicated
          that betting scores were lower when stakes were high (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; mean
          betting scores: high stakes = 2.29, medium stakes = 2.68, low stakes = 3.18). No other
          effects reached significance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0956797611434538">Table
            2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Additional analyses of specific choices showed that participants in the stop group tended
          to select the most risky bets (Choice 6) less often in dual-task blocks than in
          single-task blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0956797611434538">Fig.
              2b</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0956797611434538">3</xref></sup>
          Furthermore, for the dual-task blocks in the stop group, there was a preference for Choice
          1 (the safest option), which had a lower expected value than did Choices 3 through
              5.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0956797611434538">4</xref></sup> Thus, it appears
          that participants in the stop group became overly cautious in dual-task blocks, as taking
          a certain amount of risk was rewarded in our gambling task. Further analyses also showed
          that the difference in betting scores between block types in the stop condition was not
          caused by differences in choice latencies, effects of probability learning, estimation of
          the expected value of the choice options, block order, increased variability, or priming
          of participants to focus more on either wins or losses (see Analyses of Average Standard
          Deviation and Supplementary Analyses Experiment 1 in the Supplemental Material). Finally,
          a closer inspection of the distribution of keys selected by participants demonstrated that
          in all conditions, participants took amounts into account when they made their choice (see
          Table E4 in the Supplemental Material).</p>

      <title>Experiments 2 and 3</title>
      <p>Experiment 1 demonstrated that simultaneously regulating motor performance and making
        monetary decisions does not necessarily lead to increased risk taking in gambling. On the
        contrary, preparing to withhold a motor response encourages a cautious executive control
        state that generalizes to seemingly unrelated monetary decisions. Next, we asked whether
        motor cautiousness would also influence monetary gambling when these processes were
        separated in time. A recent study showed that performing an inhibition task in which
        participants had to ignore words led to depletion of executive control resources; this
        caused more risk-taking behavior in a subsequent gambling task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797611434538">Freeman &amp; Muraven, 2010</xref>). This finding seems at
        odds with the results of Experiment 1. However, we propose that in our gambling task,
        proactive motor slowing—which is prominent in the stop task but not necessarily in other
        inhibition tasks—counteracted any depletion effects and encouraged risk-aversive monetary
        decision making.</p>
      <p>In Experiments 2 and 3, we tested whether this transfer of cautiousness would still be
        present when the gambling task followed the stop task. Both experiments consisted of two
        phases: a training phase, which did not involve gambling, and a test phase, in which
        participants chose among different amounts they could win. The test phase did not involve an
        additional task; therefore, all test blocks were identical to the single-task blocks from
        Experiment 1. The only differences between Experiments 2 and 3 were that Experiment 2
        included a control group that immediately started with the gambling task, and the test phase
        in Experiment 3 was conducted 2 hr after the training phase was completed.</p>

          <title>Procedure</title>
          <p>In addition to the double-response and stop groups, Experiment 2 included a control
            group, which started immediately with the gambling task. The double-response and stop
            groups started with a training phase in which the primary task was to identify a go
            stimulus (square vs. diamond) as rapidly and accurately as possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0956797611434538">Fig. 3</xref>). On no-signal trials,
            participants saw a central fixation point for 0.75 s, after which either an open square
            or an open diamond surrounded the fixation point for 1.5 s. Participants responded with
            their left or right hands, respectively (“c” or “m” on a keyboard) to identify the
            stimulus as either a square or a diamond.</p>

              <p>Example trial sequence from the training phase of Experiments 2 and 3. On no-signal
                trials, participants saw a central fixation point, after which either an open square
                or an open diamond surrounded the fixation point. Participants had to hit either “c”
                or “m” on the keyboard to indicate “square” or “diamond.” Signal trials began in the
                same way, but the shape around the fixation point turned bold after a variable
                stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA), which was initially set at 0.25 s and subsequently
                adjusted using a tracking procedure (see the Method section for details). The
                boldface was removed from the shape after 0.25 s, and the nonboldface shape remained
                on-screen for the remainder of the trial. Participants tried to either withhold a
                response (stop group) or generate an extra response by pressing an alternate key
                (double-response group).</p>

          </fig>
          <p>Signal trials (25% of all training trials) began in the same way as no-signal trials,
            but the outline of the diamond or square shape turned bold after a variable stimulus
            onset asynchrony (SOA). On these trials, participants in the double-response group had
            to press the space bar as quickly as possible with either thumb after they pressed “c”
            or “m”; participants in the stop group were instructed to refrain from responding. The
            SOA between the go stimulus (the shape) and the signal was initially set at 0.25 s. In
            the stop group, the SOA was continuously adjusted according to a tracking procedure so
            that participants would be able to stop on approximately 50% of trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0956797611434538">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2009b</xref>).
            When participants made a response, the SOA decreased by 0.05 s on the following trial
            (signal-respond trial); when participants successfully stopped, the SOA increased by
            0.05 s on the following trial (signal-inhibit trial).</p>
          <p>In the double-response group, we simulated a tracking procedure to produce a similar
            range of SOAs as in the stop group (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0956797611434538">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2009c</xref>, for a similar
            procedure). In the simulation, we used an estimate of the reaction time to the stop
            signal (0.225 s). This value was based on findings of our previous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0956797611434538">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2009a</xref>).
            When the latency of the first response on a double-response trial was shorter than the
            SOA plus 0.225 s, the SOA decreased by 0.05 s on the following trial (viz.,
            signal-respond trial); when the latency of the first response on a double-response trial
            was longer than the SOA plus 0.225 s, the SOA increased by 0.05 s on the following trial
            (viz., signal-inhibit trial).</p>
          <p>The training phase of Experiment 2 consisted of 10 blocks of 72 trials each (~30 min in
            total), with a short break between each block. No points were awarded in the training
            phase. Participants took a 2-min break after the training phase, then began the test
            phase, which consisted of 7 blocks of 12 trials each. The control group started
            immediately with the test phase. During the test phase, participants completed the same
            gambling task as in the single-task blocks of Experiment 1 (thus, all trials were
            no-signal trials in the test phase). The training phase of Experiment 3 consisted of 15
            blocks of 56 trials each (~35 min in total). The test phase followed the training phase
            after 2 hr. During this 2-hr delay, participants were free to leave the lab but were
            asked to report what they had done after they returned for the test phase. There were 14
            blocks in the test phase of Experiment 3.</p>

        <p>Results of Experiment 2 revealed a reliable aftereffect of executive control training on
          gambling behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0956797611434538">Fig. 4</xref>).
          Participants in the stop group took 10% to 15% less monetary risk than did participants in
          the double-response group, <italic>F</italic>(1, 52) = 6.1, <italic>p</italic> = .02,
              η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .11, and the control group, which did not

              η<sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup>2</sup> = .17. This finding demonstrates that motor
          cautiousness in the stop task transferred to monetary decision making, even when the stop
          and gambling tasks did not overlap in time. There was a numerical trend for higher betting
          scores in the double-response group than in the control group, which would be consistent
          with a depletion account; however, the difference was not significant (<italic>p</italic>

        <p>Thus, the cognitive characteristics of the training phase were crucial: Cautiousness
          transferred from the training phase to the test phase only when the training phase
          involved stopping and not when it involved executing a second response. This conclusion
          was supported by a significant main effect of group (<italic>p</italic> = .003; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0956797611434538">Table 3</xref>). A closer inspection of
          choice proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0956797611434538">Fig. 5</xref>) showed

          Experiment 3 showed that participants in the stop group took 10% to 15% less risk than did
          participants in the double-response group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0956797611434538">Fig. 4</xref>). The main effect of group was again
          significant (<italic>p</italic> = .03; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0956797611434538">Table 3</xref>). As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0956797611434538">Figure 5</xref> shows, participants in the stop group
          selected Choice 1 more often than participants in the double-response group did,
            <italic>p</italic> &lt; .011. When we collapsed across Choices 5 and 6, the frequency of
          making this choice differed significantly between the stop and double-response groups,
            <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05.</p>
        <p>Taken together, the results of Experiments 2 and 3 show that cautiousness at a motor
          level influences gambling behavior, even when motor training and monetary decision making
          occur at least 2 hr apart. The effects in the test blocks did not correlate with the
          outcome of the stop process in the training phase and were not caused by differences in
          choice latencies (see Supplementary Analyses Experiments 2–3 in the Supplemental
          Material). Furthermore, analyses of choice proportions showed that after stop training,
          participants specifically avoided the two most risky bets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0956797611434538">Fig. 5</xref>). On the basis of these findings, we propose
          that the requirement to occasionally stop a motor response can train people to become
          cautious and less impulsive when they make monetary decisions. This increased cautiousness
          might overcome the previously observed effect of depleting the executive control system
            (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797611434538">Freeman &amp; Muraven,
          2010</xref>).</p>
        <p>A recent study showed that participants who were instructed to be cautious in a
          stop-signal task (similar to the one used here in Experiments 2 and 3) consumed less food
          in a subsequent test phase than participants who were instructed to respond as quickly and
          impulsively as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797611434538">Guerrieri,
            Nederkoorn, Schrooten, Martijn, &amp; Jansen, 2009</xref>). Unfortunately, the lack of
          an appropriate control condition in this previous study obscures the underlying basis of
          this effect, which could have arisen due to increased cautiousness, increased impulsivity,
          or a combination of both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797611434538">Guerrieri et
            al., 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, these findings are consistent with our observation that
          engaging in an inhibitory motor task can boost behavioral caution and reduce
          impulsivity.</p>
        <p>Future work should further explore how stopping-induced cautiousness and reduced motor
          impulsivity can transfer to various clinically relevant behaviors, including cigarette
          smoking and consumption of food and alcohol (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797611434538">Friese, Hofmann, &amp; Wiers, 2011</xref>). Mechanisms
          that regulate stopping and motor cautiousness might also overlap with mechanisms that
          govern the choice between a small, immediate reward compared with a larger but delayed
          reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797611434538">Kim &amp; Lee, 2011</xref>;
          but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797611434538">Dalley, Everitt, &amp;
            Robbins, 2011</xref>). If there is indeed such an overlap, we would predict that stop
          training should bias intertemporal choice toward larger delayed rewards.</p>

      <title>General Discussion</title>
      <p>A convergence of evidence shows that decision making depends on two information streams:
        automatic processes that are associative and often emotionally driven, and reasoning
        processes that are rule governed and rational (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797611434538">Evans, 2008</xref>). Suppression of the former in favor of
        the latter requires executive control processes. In the study reported here, we focused on
        how executive processes regulate decision making when people gamble. When gambling, most
        people realize that the odds are against them; in economic terms, they often know that the
        expected value of high-risk gambles is negative. As such, research on gambling can reveal
        important information about how people regulate choice when they are presented with
        superficially attractive but risky options.</p>
      <p>We found that situational factors have a substantial impact on the executive control of
        decision making in a gambling task. In Experiment 1, motor cautiousness reduced risky
        betting in a novel gambling task, thus showing that concurrent executive processes need not
        interfere detrimentally. Instead, control in the motor domain can transfer to other
        decision-making domains, in this case monetary gambling. Furthermore, we found that training
        people, even briefly, in controlling their own motor actions can induce cautious and
        risk-aversive decision making for at least 2 hr afterward (Experiments 2 and 3). In these
        experiments, occasional motor inhibition reduced monetary risk taking by approximately 10%
        to 15%. This effect size is comparable to those found in previous studies that have
        manipulated risk taking using brain-stimulation methods. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797611434538">Knoch et al. (2006)</xref> found a 15% increase in risk
        taking in the Cambridge Gambling Task after transcranial magnetic stimulation of the right
        DLPFC; in contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797611434538">Fecteau et al.
          (2007)</xref> found a 10% decrease in risk taking using the Balloon Analogue Risk Task
        following prefrontal transcranial direct current stimulation. Combined with evidence that
        transcranial direct current stimulation can potentiate learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0956797611434538">Nitsche et al., 2008</xref>), these findings suggest that
        brain stimulation could augment the training effects we have found.</p>
      <p>We propose that increased motor cautiousness, which is a prominent feature of the stop
        task, reduced risk-taking behavior when making monetary decisions. Future studies should
        examine whether similar effects can be obtained through alternative methods of inducing
        motor caution, for example, by instructing people to favor accuracy over speed in a standard
        choice task. Many studies have shown that participants are more cautious when they are
        instructed to respond as accurately as possible, and we have proposed previously that
        strategy adjustments in the speed-accuracy paradigm resemble those in the stop-signal
        paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0956797611434538">Verbruggen &amp; Logan,
          2009c</xref>).</p>
      <p>From a theoretical perspective, our results suggest that executive processes at motor
        domains share mechanisms with monetary decision making and gambling. Recent cognitive
        neuroscience studies have shown that frontal brain areas involved in action monitoring and
        response inhibition might also be involved in monetary decision making in gambling tasks
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797611434538">Clark, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797611434538">Knoch et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly,
        studies have shown that the latency of stopping a motor response is prolonged in
        pathological gamblers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797611434538">Goudriaan
          et al., 2006</xref>). However, such correlational findings are difficult to interpret
        definitively. Instead, our results show that motor control can causally modulate risk taking
        in monetary gambling. This functional overlap suggests that inhibitory motor control and
        gambling share executive resources, which opens new avenues for the investigation of
        cognitive and neural mechanisms of executive control at different processing levels.</p>
      <p>More generally, our results show that exerting executive control over actions and decisions
        can be practiced (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797611434538">Friese et
          al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797611434538">Muraven,
        2010</xref>). These findings have potential clinical relevance because impairments in
        executive control, and particularly stopping, have been linked to the development of several
        impulse-control disorders, including ADHD, substance abuse, and pathological gambling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797611434538">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0956797611434538">Verbruggen &amp; Logan, 2008</xref>).
        Furthermore, recovery from addiction requires inhibition of repetitive addictive behavior
          (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797611434538">Crews &amp; Boettiger, 2009</xref>).
        Consistent with the idea that response inhibition is critical for recovery, the findings of
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797611434538">Goudriaan, Oosterlaan, De Beurs, and
          Van Den Brink (2008)</xref> showed that motor disinhibition was a strong predictor of
        relapse in gamblers. Similarly, motor-inhibition efficiency predicted the treatment outcome
        in people with eating disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956797611434538">Nederkoorn, Jansen, Mulkens, &amp; Jansen, 2007</xref>). Therefore, the link we found in
        the present study between proactive motor control and monetary risk taking in gambling
        suggests promising new avenues for clinical therapy that target motor inhibition.</p>

          <p>We replicated this finding in a pilot experiment (<italic>N</italic> = 40), in which
            the procedure was the same as in Experiment 1, except that we used fixed signal delays.
            In this experiment, there was a significant Group × Block Type × Stake interaction
              (<italic>p</italic> = .008). Separate comparisons showed that in the stop group, the
            dual-task effect corresponded to a reliable decrease in betting scores for low stakes,
              <italic>F</italic>(1, 19) = 8.0, <italic>p</italic> = .01, and medium stakes,
              <italic>F</italic>(1, 19) = 6.0, <italic>p</italic> = .02; there was also a strong
            trend for high stakes, <italic>F</italic>(1, 19) = 3.9, <italic>p</italic> = .06. In the
            double-response group, the dual-task effect instead led to increased betting when stakes
            were low, <italic>F</italic>(1, 19) = 5.2, <italic>p</italic> = .03; there was no
            reliable dual-task effect for medium and high stakes (both <italic>p</italic>s &gt;
            .12). Thus, multitasking tended to increase betting in the double-response group but
            decrease betting in the stop group. However, because the probability of stopping was
            lower than the probability of responding in time on a double-response signal trial, we
            sought to replicate this finding in Experiment 1, in which the moment of signal
            presentation was dynamically adjusted in both groups.</p>

          <p>In the stop group of the pilot experiment, we found that the probability of making

            5 was lower (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .0027) in the dual-task blocks than in the
            single-task blocks. In addition, the probability of making Choice 6 tended to differ
            between block types, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .056. When we combined the data of
            Experiment 1 and the pilot experiment to increase power (<italic>N</italic> = 44), we
            found that the probability of making Choice 1 in dual-task blocks (.270) was
            significantly higher than the probability of making Choice 1 in single-task blocks
