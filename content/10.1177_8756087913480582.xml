<p>I am pleased to announce that I. Sedat Gunes has accepted the position of Associate Editor for this journal. Sedat has been a consistent reviewer and is a great help in making this journal a significant source of scientific and engineering information on plastic film and sheeting. I look forward to working with him and providing useful information to you, our readers.</p>
<p>On the inside cover of the January 2013 issue of Physics Today there was an ad for Inside Science. The ad asked the following question: A neutron is negatively charged: True or False?</p>
<p>The ad goes on to say: “This answer may seem obvious, but research consistently shows that many members of the general public – voters, taxpayers, decision makers – lack even a basic understanding of rudimentary scientific concepts and an awareness of what scientists do. The inside science web site <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.insidescience.org">www.insidescience.org</ext-link> addresses this gap by providing accurate, engaging news content that draws general audiences into science and guides them through the steps of critical and logical thinking that are involved in scientific advances. Did you get the obvious answer to the above question? Perhaps you can use this web site to spread the word about what we do as scientists and engineers to make this a better world.</p>
<p>The first of the six papers in this issue “Water vapor permeability and tensile properties of poly(l-lactic acid)/synthetic mica nanocomposites prepared by melt blending” by Soraia V Borges, Marcos L Dias, Victor JRR Pita, Chiaki Azuma and Marali V Dias is about blending Poly(L-lactic acid)/synthetic mica (Somasif) nanocomposites in a mixing chamber according to a factorial experimental design as a function of temperature, rotor speed, nanofiller concentration and residence time.</p>
<p>The next paper “Iodine doped, semi-conducting nylon 6 polymers” by K Sreelatha and P Predeep used Iodine doping to study conducting nylon 6 films and investigate the doped material in terms of electrical, structural and optical characteristics.</p>
<p>The third paper “Effects of thermal and UV aging on antibacterial properties of linear low-density polyethylene and poly(vinyl chloride) films containing nano-silver colloid” by Ratchanee Chinkamonthong, Apisit Kositchaiyong and Narongrit Sombatsompop studied the antibacterial performance and the physical, structural, and mechanical properties of linear low-density polyethylene and poly(vinyl chloride) resin doped with nanosilver colloid.</p>
<p>M Whitt, K Vorst, W Brown, S Baker and L Gorman in their paper “Survey of heavy metal contamination in recycled polyethylene terephthalate used for food packaging” quantified nickel, chromium, cadmium, antimony, and lead in post-consumer polyethylene terephthalate extruded sheet and thermoformed samples, using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry.</p>
<p>The fifth paper “Mechanical and water barrier properties of soy protein isolate film incorporated with gelatin” by Huiyu Bai, Jing Xu, Ping Liao and Xiaoya Liu is about the effect of gelatin contents on visual, mechanical, water barrier properties and surface hydrophobicity of solvent cast films.</p>
<p>The last paper by Barry Moris “Troubleshooting coextrusion film problems by considering process–property relationships” looks at the complex multilayer film coextrusion process where many processing and structure design factors affect performance.</p>
<p>Continuing with the idea that film and sheet is used to package food and that safety is important let us look at myth number 5 from the US government food safety web site:</p>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/basics/myths/">http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/basics/myths/</ext-link></p>
<p>Myth #6: The only reason to let food sit after it's been microwaved is to make sure you don't burn yourself on food that's too hot.</p>
<p>Fact: In fact, letting microwaved food sit for a few minutes (“standing time”) helps your food cook more completely by allowing colder areas of food time to absorb heat from hotter areas of food.</p>
<p>The bacteria that cause food poisoning multiply quickest in the “Danger Zone” between 40° and 140° Fahrenheit. That is why it is important to have your refrigerator set at 37°F (2.8°C) and to cook or reheat food to above 140°F (60°C) preferably to 165°F (74°C).</p>
<p>And while many people think they can tell when food is “done” simply by checking its color and texture, there's no way to be sure it's safe without checking the temperature.</p>
<p>And a final thought.</p>
<p>“A little sincerity is a dangerous thing, and a great deal of it is absolutely fatal”. <bold>Oscar Wilde</bold></p>
