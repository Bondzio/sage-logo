<p>In <italic>Collision Course: Ronald Reagan, the Air Traffic Controllers, and the Strike that Changed America</italic>, Joseph A. McCartin chronicles the rise and fall of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO). His book hits its climax with President Reagan’s August 5, 1981 firing of 11,345 striking controllers and the ensuing decertification of the union PATCO, some two and half months later. While McCartin views Reagan’s actions as a seminal moment in American labor-management relations, his real story is the gripping tale of more than two decades of labor conflict between the nation’s air traffic controllers and the Federal Government. In other words, this arresting drama culminates in, rather than commences with, the 1981 PATCO walkout, an incident he calls the “most significant strike of the late twentieth century” (p. 10), and the beginning of a rapid decline in unionization and labor power in the United States.</p>
<p>As the dust jacket aptly describes, the book’s first chapter “begins with an arresting account of the 1960 midair collision over New York City that cost 134 lives and exposed the weaknesses of an overburdened [air traffic] system.” The author then provides an overview of events leading up to Reagan’s August 3, 1981 news conference, which occurred two days before the fatal firing of the controllers. During this press briefing, the President declared PATCO’s work stoppage an illegal strike in violation of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. In keeping with the law, which prohibited federal employees from such walkouts, Reagan also issued the controllers an ultimatum to either return to work within 48 hours or forfeit their jobs. As McCartin mentions later, perhaps the most ironic part of this announcement, is the fact that PATCO leaders endorsed Reagan in the 1980 Presidential Election, after feeling abandoned by the Carter Administration.</p>
<p>The chapters to follow provide a detailed review of how this prominent moment in American labor relations “came about and how it changed America” (p. 14). However, McCartin’s work is not merely an historian’s account of these happenings, but a story revealed through the eyes of those who actually lived it. In this vein, in the early chapters, the tale is told through interviews with two former controllers and initial organizational leaders, Mike Rock and Jack Maher. Equally inspired by the 1960 New York disaster, the pair banded together, first with local colleagues from New York’s Hangar 11, and thereafter with others region-wide and nationally, to confront an unresponsive Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and establish America’s first air traffic controllers union. Also prominent here is the organization’s first executive director, the well known defense attorney F. Lee Bailey, and Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson.</p>
<p>In the middle chapters, as organizational power shifted from the radical controllers to a more moderate group, John Leyden, PATCO’s President from 1970–1980, took center stage. Other important players were Presidents Nixon and Carter, both of whom the union supported with high hopes, but who eventually came to fail them. Later, as the union grew disillusioned with Leyden’s leadership, and again turned more militant, Robert Poli became the main character. It is Poli who was in charge in 1981, when Reagan pulled the plug on PATCO.</p>
<p>It is important to point out that McCartin’s chronicle does not paint Reagan as the main villain, but rather as the perfect finisher. While there is no doubt that the reader is left with the impression that Reagan landed the final fatal blows to PATCO, the author clearly portrays Nixon and Carter as the Presidents who landed the damaging body blows and headshots which put PATCO on the ropes to its demise; Johnson and Kennedy are also indicted. Conversely, the air controllers and the public are seen as victims of a system that put commerce and on-time arrivals ahead of safety.</p>
<p>In contrast with Reagan’s portrayal of the controllers as ruthless, un-American radicals set on bringing America’s air travel to a halt, McCartin reveals how even the most vocal PATCO leaders were essentially moderate, middle-class, law abiding, former enlisted servicemen who were merely seeking to improve their work conditions. Here, the author is at his best, poignantly describing how controllers were subjected to long hours within a highly pressurized environment, supervised by unsympathetic and hierarchically-driven former military officers working for the FAA. In fact, status divisions and class conflict between these two groups represent a central theme running through the first half of the book. Within this context, McCartin sides with the controllers, who he sees as essentially working-class stiffs turned activists, dedicated to enhancing air safety through the revamping and modernization of an obsolete air traffic system.</p>
<p>While there certainly is much to praise, there are a couple of small criticisms for McCartin’s book. First, the title, dust jacket, and opening salvo all too heavily suggest that the book’s main focus is the PATCO-Reagan affair. In reality, it is not until Chapter 9 out of 13, and some 220 pages, before Reagan becomes a key figure in the drama. Related to this, while the 20-year richly contextualized history is vital to the book’s main themes, the author occasionally gets bogged down in the early details, and thus devotes a little too much space to the first decade of the conflict. As a result, the 1970s and even the Reagan aftermath, are given the short shift, and the reader grows weary before the play’s final act.</p>
<p>These comments notwithstanding, McCartin’s book is recommended reading for those in history, political science, sociology, economics, and labor studies, and others interested in social movements, American labor history, and in the current state of unions and management/labor relations in the United States.</p>
