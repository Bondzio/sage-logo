<p>Curiosity drives good history. Too often it was in short supply in early studies of the history of human rights, which treated the subject matter as so self-evidently sensible that its rise to current pre-eminence failed to seem surprising. This collection of essays is indicative of a sea change in the field. The authors are representative of a rapidly growing cohort of scholars writing about the recent history of human rights, and not just the quantity of scholarship but the tone and agenda have taken a dramatically new turn. The essays in this collection, first presented at a 2008 conference in Berlin, reveal puzzling juxtapositions, disjunctures, anomalies and contradictions where once inevitability and linear progress were assumed. The recent history of human rights is no longer a simple morality tale but a complex and fascinating set of stories deeply revealing of the political and intellectual life of the second half of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>To cite one example, take a question that earlier literature had largely failed to address: why was Pinochet’s Chile the target of the most vociferous human rights campaign of the 1970s? As Jan Eckel notes in a densely packed essay that condenses years of deep, multi-archival research, the activism of the 1970s is typically depicted as a natural reaction to a spate of horrific abuses. Yet some regimes more murderous than Pinochet’s received little attention, and the decade as a whole, as Eckel comments, was just as notable for the campaigns that were <italic>not</italic> waged as for those that were. As part of a broad explanation of the factors that made the Chilean case such a cause célèbre, Eckel assesses the motives of the highly diverse set of voices that mobilized against Chile, including the West, the Soviet bloc, and many Third World countries, making a strong case that a unique constellation of political forces created ‘a kind of negative consensus’ (330), rather than a shared humanitarian concern, that made UN measures against the regime possible. The free flow of information from the country was also critical for making it a focus of attention, as activists mobilized new forms of information gathering and publicity. Samuel Moyn, the author of a much-discussed revisionist account of the history of human rights, brings a similar, clear-headed curiosity to the immediate post-war years and finds that despite the later identification of human rights as a project of the secular left, in the 1940s some Western European thinkers like the French Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain claimed human rights under the mantle of a Christian personalist communitarianism. The original context of the European embrace of human rights after 1945, Moyn argues, was thus ‘linked to the conservative defense of human dignity’ (105).</p>
<p>Like Moyn’s identification of conservative and Christian sources of post-war human rights, Lora Wildenthal’s essay on the West German international lawyer Rudolf Laun reveals surprising conjunctures. Laun was the first in his profession to contend that the Allies had violated Germans’ human rights, and his placement of Germans as victims of human rights abuses, along with his arguments for group rights and a ‘right to a homeland’, ensconced human rights on the right of the West German political spectrum in the immediate post-war years. Benjamin Nathans situates human rights in yet another unfamiliar context, far from the liberalism we associate with human rights. In a fascinating analysis of the various Soviet constitutions as well as the letters ordinary citizens wrote as part of the drafting campaigns, Nathans charts Soviet law and discourse about rights (and duties) from the 1930s to the 1970s, treating Soviet conceptions of rights not as mere fictions but as a part of human rights history.</p>
<p>Other essays also situate human rights outside purely Western contexts: Jennifer Amos on the Soviet regime’s post-Stalin embrace of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, for limited purposes in international forums; Celia Donert on Charter 77 and the Roma; Dirk Moses on Bangladesh’s failed effort after the Indo-Pakistan War to try Pakistani soldiers for genocide and war crimes; Fabian Klose on the use of human rights standards by anti-colonial insurgents in Kenya and Algeria to embarrass the colonial powers; and Andreas Eckert, covering a broader sweep, on the limited embrace of human rights by African nationalists.</p>
<p>Stefan-Ludwig Hoffmann’s introduction to the volume, well worth reading, is a sharp and compelling historiographical review that sets the tone for the rest of the collection in its effort to denaturalize human rights and recast them as a conflicted and conflicting language of political contestation. Most of the authors of these essays are writing books on the recent history of human rights, proof that the future of this field will be exciting indeed.</p>
