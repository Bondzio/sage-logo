<abstract>
<p>Against a backdrop of system redesign in the NHS, the Infection Prevention Society and Royal College of Nursing have collaborated to produce a toolkit to support the implementation and use of infection prevention indicators as part of the quality assurance processes in the commissioning and contracting cycles. The toolkit is presented in this article.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Reducing healthcare associated infection (HCAI) remains high on the Governments safety and quality agenda. Since 2008 there has been a legal requirement on all healthcare and social care providers, including NHS organisations, to implement The Health and Social Care Act 2008, Code of Practice for the NHS on the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections and related guidance. Other drivers for change, while not exhaustive, may include:</p>

<p>The toolkit provides an overarching framework to help meet the challenge of reducing and sustaining reduction of HCAIs. It has been developed to support emerging commissioning organisations (commissioning support units or Clinical Commissioning Group [CCG]) in England to ensure that the structures, objective setting, monitoring and governance arrangements and resources for the prevention, control and reduction of HCAI are in place. As health and social care commissioning develops, it is essential that processes are in place to ensure the smooth transfer of commissioning authority from one organisation to another, and that duties and accountabilities in relation to reducing HCAIs are maintained without any detriment to patients or the quality of NHS service provision.</p>

<title>Goals and aspirations – zero incidence of avoidable HCAI</title>
<sec id="section3-1757177413478276">
<title>Expectation of commissioning organisations</title>
<p>Commissioners and providers of health and social care do not accept that HCAI is an inevitable part of, or an acceptable risk related to, health or social care. Commissioning organisations will support providers, while holding them to account for their performance with regards to surveillance of infections, and the implementation and sustained improvement of infection control practices and procedures to reduce HCAI.</p>
<p>In pursuit of the aspiration for zero incidence of avoidable HCAI, commissioning teams will systematically review local objectives across the organisations from which they commission services. This will include the review of surveillance data to monitor progress against nationally set trajectories for specific organisms and other agreed performance indicators.</p>
<p>All commissioning organisations are obliged to be sufficiently assured that all services, commissioned or contracted by them or on their behalf, are compliant with:</p>

<title>Expectations of provider organisations</title>

<title>Guide to using the IPC commissioning indicators</title>
<p>The Infection Prevention Society (IPS) and Royal College of Nursing (RCN) have developed the toolkit for existing and emerging commissioning organisations to support the commissioning of IPC along with the development and implementation of the commissioning framework in practice. The toolkit consists of a basket of indicators for consideration in the commissioning contract and an example of a local HCAI reduction plan.</p>
<p>It is recognised that some organisations may be more highly developed in their measuring and reporting of indicators than others, however, there should be a common aim across the commissioning board to standardise these where possible, while fostering additional opportunities for quality improvement at local level. Commissioners of health and social care require provider organisations to assure clean environments and safe practices to prevent HCAIs This assurance process should not seek to mirror other compliance or regulation requirements, moreover it should seek to affirm assurance by focussing on improvements needed, based on local requirements. Ideally this should be a shared process between commissioners and providers, with the overall joint aim of improving patient safety.</p>
<sec id="section6-1757177413478276">
<title>Indicators</title>
<p>Indicators help organisations to understand, compare, predict outcome and improve care. They should align contractual requirements to compliance with the Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2012–2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177413478276">Department of Health, 2011</xref>) and be used to assist the delivery of the Public Health outcomes Framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177413478276">Department of Health, 2012b</xref>). Indicators should reflect requirements to implement best practice guidance set at national, regional and local levels to ensure the priorities for infection prevention are in the contracts. This toolkit presents the indicators in the format of the national contract (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1757177413478276">Table 1</xref>), to enable users to lift detail and place it into individual provider contracts. Note that this can be adapted for inclusion in social care contracts.</p>

<p>In effect, each provider should have its own unique set of indicators and information schedule requirements to facilitate the robust assurance of performance required for IPC for the specific provider. The information schedule can be used as a ‘softer’ option; if the commissioner chooses to place one of the currently suggested indicators into the information schedule, they could replace the threshold requirement to ‘expectation’; thereby clearly stating that (and agreeing) the standard required. This approach will assist in the event that the information supplied within the schedule does not yield the level of assurance required of good Infection Prevention &amp; Control (IPC) standards.</p>

<title>Example of a local HCAI plan</title>
<p>The (insert name of organisation) Cluster/Clinical Commissioning Group is committed to reducing the risk of HCAI as a key priority. The prevention and control of infection lies at the heart of patient safety, quality patient care, good management, governance and effective clinical practice.</p>
<p>The purpose of this HCAI plan is to outline the (insert organisation name) approach to the prevention and control of HCAI for the period (insert date) and to propose an agreed plan for the future new commissioning structures and arrangements.</p>
<p>The framework is designed to establish ownership of IPC at all levels throughout the organisations served by and accountable to the cluster/commissioning board. It supports a co-ordinated approach to the prevention and control of infection across all areas of responsibility. All providers will be expected to have in place annual programmes of work to ensure that standards and objectives are met according to agreed contractual indicators and national and local objectives for HCAI. This activity will be monitored on a locally agreed basis through formal reporting mechanisms established through the integrated quality teams and contract and performance monitoring systems. As the changing NHS welcomes any competent providers, incorporation of quality standards for infection prevention and HCAI through all levels of the commissioning and contractual process is essential.</p>
<p>The overarching purpose of the IPC commissioning role is to ensure the IPC element of patient safety, quality and experience is embedded within the commissioning process. The four main requirements to effectively commission for IPC include:</p>
