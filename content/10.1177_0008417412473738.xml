<p>This publication has helped me in my desire to assist occupational therapy students to think critically about our chosen profession. Occupational therapists are natural helpers, but our helping can contribute to oppression of people with disabilities rather than enablement of participation by them. I believe that introducing occupational therapy students to disability studies specifically and to critical thinking generally may decrease the frequency with which occupational therapy is oppressive. <italic>Analyze Anything</italic> was written to assist university students to write better essays. However, I believe that it can be a good resource for critical thinking or, as the subtitle says, “critical reading.”</p>
<p>The material is based on the semiotic method—the study of signs—discussed in Chapter 1. Here the authors make the idea of finding and responding to signs and indicators accessible to many readers. However, some of the literary examples may be less accessible. Perhaps most importantly, they assert that all signs exist within “intricate interplays of power.” Signs reflect power dynamics regardless of how subtle those dynamics may be. This is perhaps the most important idea to impress on occupational therapy students.</p>
<p>Disability is a cultural sign. Many scholars will argue that impairments are also cultural signs. While not agreeing completely with this assertion, I do agree that the experience of impairment is strongly influenced by culture. Students need to continually question whether a client’s impairment needs to be addressed at all. The majority culture in North America assumes that impairment is bad and that those with impairments should “work hard” to ameliorate the effects of the impairment or condition. Occupational therapy is embedded in this culture and has its own history of attempting to eliminate and reduce the “problems” of people with disabilities. Encouraging students to look at these and related cultural signs with the awareness of power imbalances has the potential to change how occupational therapy is practiced.</p>
<p>It can take some time for students to become comfortable with the view that there is no absolute truth behind cultural signs. The first chapter contains this second concept important to share with students. Here, examples provide many opportunities to see multiple possible truths underlying cultural signs, and many strategies provide students with ways to view signs from a variety of viewpoints. The remainder of the book is about identifying and writing about the meanings submerged in the cultural signs. A number of example essays written by students and teachers are presented, including two that analyze values and implications underlying disability and how it is represented.</p>
<p>Even without reading all of the sample essays, the reader will finish this book with—to quote from the back cover—a powerful analytic toolkit. Occupational therapy students require such a toolkit.</p>
