<sec id="section1-1740774513479467">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Due to the sparse nature of serious drug-related adverse events (AEs), meta-analyses combining data from several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate drug safety issues are increasingly being conducted and published, influencing clinical and regulatory decision making. Evaluation of meta-analyses involves the assessment of both the individual constituent trials and the approaches used to combine them. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting framework is designed to enhance the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. However, PRISMA may not cover all critical elements useful in the evaluation of meta-analyses with a focus on drug safety particularly in the regulatory-public health setting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1740774513479467">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>This work was conducted to (1) evaluate the adherence of a sample of published drug safety–focused meta-analyses to the PRISMA reporting framework, (2) identify gaps in this framework based on key aspects pertinent to drug safety, and (3) stimulate the development and validation of a more comprehensive reporting tool that incorporates elements unique to drug safety evaluation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1740774513479467">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We selected a sample of meta-analyses of RCTs based on review of abstracts from high-impact journals as well as top medical specialty journals between 2009 and 2011. We developed a preliminary reporting framework based on PRISMA with specific additional reporting elements critical for the evaluation of drug safety meta-analyses of RCTs. The reporting of pertinent elements in each meta-analysis was reviewed independently by two authors; discrepancies in the independent evaluations were resolved through discussions between the two authors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1740774513479467">
<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 27 meta-analyses, 12 from highest impact journals, 13 from specialty medical journals, and 2 from Cochrane reviews, were identified and evaluated. The great majority (&gt;85%) of PRISMA elements were addressed in more than half of the meta-analyses reviewed. However, the majority of meta-analyses (&gt;60%) did not address most (&gt;80%) of the additional reporting elements critical for the evaluation of drug safety. Some of these elements were not addressed in any of the reviewed meta-analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1740774513479467">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This review included a sample of meta-analyses, with a focus on drug safety, recently published in high-impact journals; therefore, we may have underestimated the extent of the reporting problem across all meta-analyses of drug safety. Furthermore, temporal trends in reporting could not be evaluated in this review because of the short time interval selected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1740774513479467">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>While the majority of PRISMA elements were addressed by most studies reviewed, the majority of studies did not address most of the additional safety-related elements. These findings highlight the need for the development and validation of a drug safety reporting framework and the importance of the current initiative by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) to create a guidance document for drug safety information synthesis/meta-analysis, which may improve reporting, conduct, and evaluation of meta-analyses of drug safety and inform clinical and regulatory decision making.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Evidence of potential associations between drugs and adverse events (AEs) emerges from both pre- and postmarket data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774513479467">1</xref>], including data from spontaneous reports, controlled trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, nonclinical studies (e.g., pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and animal studies), and observational pharmacoepidemiologic safety studies and registries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774513479467">2</xref>]. Pharmacoepidemiologic safety studies or randomized controlled trials (RCTs) may be useful to test hypotheses of associations between a drug and safety endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774513479467">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774513479467">4</xref>]. The rarity of some serious harms, the relatively small size of many trials, and restricted patient populations may limit the detection and full evaluation of the safety of drugs in individual trials. Therefore, it is often necessary to combine results from several RCTs using meta-analytic approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774513479467">1</xref>]. Although randomization, the primary strength of RCTs, often leads to positioning RCTs at the top of evidentiary hierarchies, these studies may have many limitations when used in drug safety assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774513479467">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774513479467">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774513479467"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774513479467">7</xref>].</p>
<p>When evaluating post hoc meta-analyses of drug safety issues, it is necessary to examine characteristics of the constituent trials, as well as methods used to combine them, and their impact on the credibility of the findings of the meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774513479467">1</xref>]. Such assessment can be facilitated through the transparency and completeness in reporting on pertinent aspects of the design, conduct, and analysis. The 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774513479467">8</xref>] revised the Quality of Reporting of Meta-Analyses (QUOROM) statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774513479467">9</xref>] and provided updated reporting guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The authors of a recent review article evaluated the reporting and quality assessment aspects of a sample of published meta-analyses that had assessed at least one AE as a primary outcome and found that less than 20% of the meta-analyses used reporting guidelines such as QUOROM and PRISMA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774513479467">10</xref>]. Although the PRISMA reporting framework increases the transparency of meta-analyses by providing key reporting domains and elements, it does not address in detail certain aspects of drug safety assessment already identified. Our previous work shed light on the fact that US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other stakeholders, such as clinicians and clinical guideline developers, often lack important information about drug safety meta-analyses; this missing information may limit timely, robust evaluation and interpretation of these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774513479467">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Variations across controlled trials in the design, collection, and analysis of safety-related information can lead to differences in the safety conclusions from those trials. Understanding safety-related findings from the meta-analysis of RCTs thus requires an in-depth knowledge of how safety-related information was handled in each of the individual trials as well as an understanding of the processes used to select and integrate data from these trials. To examine how such details are reported, we developed a preliminary reporting framework based on PRISMA with specific additional reporting elements that, in our view, are critical for the evaluation of drug safety meta-analyses of RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774513479467">1</xref>]. The additional elements focus to methods of capturing AEs, information on risk factors for specific AEs, information about each recorded AE, and information about population differences across the individual trials. We then evaluated 27 published meta-analyses of RCTs, reporting on one or more safety findings, to describe the extent to which all elements had been reported. Notably, our proposed additional reporting elements were not available to the authors of the published meta-analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1740774513479467" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We used the sampling approach reported in a recent review article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1740774513479467">11</xref>] to identify a sample of recently published meta-analyses with a potential impact on clinical practice. The strategy to identify studies involved three steps. First, we selected a sample of meta-analyses published from 1 January 2009 through 7 October 2011 based on reviewing abstracts from high-impact publications with a 2010 impact factor of at least 10 (<italic>NEJM, Lancet, JAMA, Annals of Internal Medicine, PLoS Medicine, BMJ, Annual Review of Medicine</italic>, and <italic>Archives of Internal Medicine</italic>), with up to three meta-analyses included from each journal. Second, journals representing the top 5 specialty medicine areas based on 2008 global pharmaceutical sales (oncology, cardiology, respiratory medicine, endocrinology, and gastroenterology) were selected, and the three most recently published meta-analyses within each specialty area were identified. If three meta-analyses could not be identified in a given journal, the second highest rated journal was searched; this process of searching journals in declining order of impact factor was repeated until three eligible meta-analyses were obtained. Third, two articles from the most recent Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were selected.</p>
<p>We used the following meta-analysis inclusion criteria: (1) documentation of a systematic review of the literature or a meta-analysis, (2) statistical combination of results from at least two RCTs, (3) focus on drug safety issue(s) as evidenced by presence of at least one primary objective focused on a drug safety issue (AE or/harm), and (4) inclusion of at least one drug in the intervention or comparison study groups that was under patent in the United States at the time of publication based on the FDA Orange Book [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774513479467">12</xref>]. Thus, the following types of meta-analyses were excluded: (1) focus only on efficacy, (2) inclusion of observational studies only, and (3) focus on nondrug products.</p>
<p>The Institute of Medicine’s (IOM) 2012 report on scientific issues in studying drug safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740774513479467">13</xref>], which referenced our 2011 work published by Hammad et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774513479467">1</xref>] on methodological considerations pertaining to meta-analyses of drug safety issues, underscored the problems associated with the reporting of drug harms and the challenges in evaluating drug safety meta-analyses. Our 2011 article was based on a comprehensive literature search and our regulatory experience in evaluating meta-analyses for safety-related regulatory decision making. Based on the challenges outlined in Hammad et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774513479467">1</xref>], we developed a preliminary meta-analysis reporting framework based on PRISMA with specific, additional reporting elements critical for the evaluation of drug safety meta-analyses of RCTs. Although all of the proposed additional elements are critical for the evaluation of drug safety meta-analyses, not all are entirely unique to these types of studies. The reporting of these elements in each published meta-analysis was reviewed independently by two authors, and discrepancies in evaluation were resolved during discussions between the two authors. To provide conservative estimates of reporting, we counted a partial reporting of any element as a positive finding for that element. The final results of all meta-analysis reviews were compiled, and the percentage of studies reporting on each particular element was calculated separately for (1) PRISMA and (2) the proposed additional drug safety–related elements.</p>

<p>The additional 20 drug safety–specific elements we have proposed are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1740774513479467">Table 2</xref>. The majority of these elements (80%) were addressed in less than 40% of all meta-analyses reviewed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1740774513479467">Figure 2</xref>); only a small percentage of the reviewed meta-analyses (20%) addressed more than half of those reporting elements. Notably, three of the additional drug safety meta-analysis reporting elements were not addressed by any of the meta-analyses reviewed: (1) whether some of the individual trials used a study population enrichment approach (element 10), (2) whether the trial protocol directed investigators to document or collect information only on AEs suspected to be drug-related (element 11), and (3) whether a flexible-dosing scheme was used and its impact on trial safety findings (element 13). We also assessed the type of data used in these meta-analyses. The majority of the published meta-analyses, 78% (21/27), employed summary-level data, while 15% (4/27) employed individual-level patient data. Only one employed both summary and individual data, and one did not report the type of data used for the meta-analysis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first review to evaluate the extent of reporting of key elements for the evaluation of meta-analyses of controlled trials reporting on one or more drug harms. Overall, most of the PRISMA reporting framework elements were addressed in more than half of the meta-analyses reviewed. However, two PRISMA concepts critical for the assessment of publications focused on drug safety were reported in less than 50% of the meta-analyses; these included elements referring to the meta-analysis protocol (PRISMA element 5) and the evaluation of risk of bias in individual studies (PRISMA elements 12 and 19). The evaluation of the risk of bias across studies that may affect the cumulative evidence was reported in less than 60% of meta-analyses (PRISMA elements 15 and 22). A detailed prespecified protocol, which is particularly important for post hoc efforts that includes many meta-analyses, helps ensure scientific rigor as it requires investigators to articulate clearly the meta-analytic approach before selecting specific studies to be included, reviewing the data, and summarizing findings. The two other PRISMA concepts that were not addressed in many of the meta-analyses are also critical to drug safety assessment. It is important to consider both the risk of bias in the individual trials as well as across trials to ensure confidence in findings from meta-analytic evaluations of drug safety issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774513479467">1</xref>]. Nonetheless, failure to address these issues may be a function of the focus of most trials on efficacy outcomes. Thus, elements needed for the assessment of the risk of bias in safety findings may not be readily evaluable.</p>
<p>Although the PRISMA reporting framework increases the transparency of meta-analyses, it does not include specific elements that are critical to the assessment of those that focus on drug safety. In fact, the lack of important information from published drug safety meta-analyses limits timely evaluation by regulatory agencies and other stakeholders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774513479467">1</xref>]. Most of our proposed safety-related critical elements were not reported on in most of the meta-analyses reviewed. As drug safety meta-analyses rely on data from individual published trials, which often do not report safety information adequately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1740774513479467">41</xref>], this finding is not unexpected and points out the potential need for the development of a reporting framework for drug safety meta-analyses. Comments on select elements follow.</p>
<p>Consideration of whether constituent trials used enrichment strategies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1740774513479467">Table 2</xref>, element 10) is critical in evaluating drug safety because certain design elements, as well as inclusion/exclusion criteria, ordinarily intended to improve trial efficiency, may result in an inaccurate estimate of AE rates. Assessing whether the study protocol of constituent trials directs reporting of AEs only when these were suspected to be related to the drug (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1740774513479467">Table 2</xref>, element 11) is another critical element to be considered in the evaluation of drug safety studies as this restriction may result in under-ascertainment of certain AEs. None of the meta-analyses we assessed reported on either of these elements.</p>
<p>The investigation of premature trial discontinuation and its potential impact on individual trial findings (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1740774513479467">Table 2</xref>, element 6), which may result in informative censoring or depletion of susceptibles, was reported in only 15% of the meta-analyses. In practice, RCTs of drugs may be subject to high rates of premature trial discontinuation, which may introduce confounding by disrupting the balance across comparison groups, initially established by randomization of pertinent measured and unmeasured risk factors for the AEs of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774513479467">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1740774513479467">42</xref>]. Premature withdrawal of subjects from treatment may mask our ability to detect drug-related AEs if patients who discontinue prematurely are more likely to develop the AE of interest.</p>
<p>Differences in end-of-trial planned discontinuation options among individual trials (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1740774513479467">Table 2</xref>, element 14) were reported by only 4% of the meta-analyses we assessed. AEs recorded at the end of the trial may not reflect events that occurred while on treatment. For example, when exposure time is extended to include the dose titration phase, it is not clear whether AEs identified during this phase are related to drug withdrawal due to downward titration or drug exposure. Other trial designs afford patients different options at the end of trial, for example, to forego treatment, revert to the standard of care, continue on the study drug, or take another preplanned drug. Therefore, caution is warranted to account for the planned discontinuation options when analyzing data from individual RCTs.</p>
<p>The statistical approaches used most often in the literature to integrate data from individual trials, including fixed-effect and random-effects methods, rely on assumptions about the variability of the data and the ‘true’ drug risk that is being estimated. Since the ‘true’ drug risk and its behavior are unknown, results that vary substantially between these two approaches should be examined closely to understand the reasons behind the observed differences. Importantly, less than half of the meta-analyses reported whether they used a fixed-effect or random-effects model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1740774513479467">Table 2</xref>, element 16). Even when the model was reported, less than half of the evaluated meta-analyses documented a rationale for the choice of the fixed-effect versus random-effects approach or discussed whether the model was chosen prior to seeing the data.</p>
<p>Most of the meta-analyses used summary data and not individual patient data. This is important as clinically relevant findings in trials may not be readily assessed when using summary-level data. Lack of availability and access to individual patient data may be the reason that many of the proposed safety-related elements were not addressed in most of the reviewed meta-analyses. When feasible, individual patient data meta-analyses, albeit more expensive and time-consuming, offer several advantages, including the ability to evaluate and adjust for the same variables in the constituent trials, use common definitions, evaluate heterogeneity at the patient level, and examine the potential for nonconstant hazards and perform time-to-event analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1740774513479467">43</xref>].</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, our proposed safety-related elements are not exhaustive; researchers who wish to refine and validate a drug safety meta-analysis framework may wish to consider additional elements, especially in situations where the individual-level data are available. For example, although the exclusion of trials with zero events of interest was included in the proposed elements, the use of correction factors to overcome difficulties with low or zero event counts and their impact on the results was not explicitly included in our elements. A refined safety framework should incorporate the evaluation of the use of such correction factors as they may affect the conclusions from drug safety meta-analyses. An additional element that should be considered is the choice of the statistical analysis on an absolute or relative scale (e.g., risk difference, odds ratio), as this decision also may affect the interpretation of findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774513479467">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1740774513479467">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1740774513479467">45</xref>].</p>
<p>There were some limitations in our review. These findings are based on a small sample of recent meta-analyses published mostly in high-impact peer-reviewed journals; reporting of methods and considerations for drug safety meta-analyses may be even poorer in those published prior to the publication of PRISMA or in lower impact medical journals. In addition, it is not possible to evaluate the trends in reporting over time as we reviewed reporting over only a relatively short interval of time. Furthermore, it is unclear whether these findings apply to meta-analyses in which drug safety evaluation was not listed as one of the objectives since these were not included in our review. However, because our goal was to identify and review a small sample of recently published drug safety meta-analyses that can potentially influence clinical practice, these factors might not be significant limitations. In this review, we did not attempt to ‘weigh’ the specific drug safety reporting elements as we foresee the use of these elements in a reporting framework, not in an assessment tool. Our proposed additional reporting elements were not available to the authors of the published meta-analyses. Thus, it may not be surprising that adherence to these elements was poorer compared to the PRISMA elements. However, our effort intended to evaluate the current reporting of key elements necessary for appropriate evaluation of drug safety studies and to assess the need for a drug safety meta-analysis reporting framework by raising the attention to some of the unique aspects of drug safety not captured in the currently available PRISMA checklist. Finally, we acknowledge that the constraints of publication journal space may not have allowed authors of meta-analyses to report details on all the relevant factors that they considered.</p>
<p>This effort underscores the need to develop and validate a reporting framework that focuses on drug safety. Improving the reporting of individual RCTs and meta-analyses should enhance drug safety assessment. The FDA’s recently published regulation on safety reporting of controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1740774513479467">46</xref>] should enhance safety reporting of serious AEs by clinical trial investigators and the assessment of potential drug-related harms from individual trials. Additionally, the ongoing development of guidance on best practices for the design and conduct of information synthesis/meta-analyses of these individual trials by CIOMS X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1740774513479467">47</xref>] should enhance evaluation of meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774513479467">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1740774513479467">47</xref>]. Improved reporting of drug safety meta-analyses and trials would complement other important initiatives, such as the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) for harms framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1740774513479467">48</xref>], and inform regulatory decision making on drug safety issues with important public health consequences. Many segments of the health-care system, including patients and health-care providers, academic health science researchers, clinical practice guideline developers, and health-care payers, would benefit from the increased understanding of important harms associated with drugs.</p>
