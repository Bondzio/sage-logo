<abstract>
<p>This study reports a case of a 57-year-old woman diabetic patient who presented to the authors’ institution with signs and symptoms typical of plantar fasciitis. Her condition did not resolve with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy, podiatry, and physiotherapy input and she was given a steroid injection for treatment of plantar fasciitis. She was admitted to the hospital 17 days following injection with signs of acute infection. Diagnostic workup revealed an acute calcaneal osteomyelitis. Infection did not respond to conservative treatment and the patient required a partial calcanectomy. This case highlights the significant risk of steroid injection in plantar fasciitis, especially in diabetic patient. The authors urge surgeons to consider this when obtaining consent for injection and they advise very close follow-up of such patients.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Plantar fasciitis is a common condition causing heel pain. It often responds well to conservative treatment such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, podiatry, and physiotherapy. In some cases, when symptoms persist despite the aforementioned treatment, injection of steroid is an accepted and commonly used treatment. We describe and discuss a case of complication of such injection. We describe a patient who developed an acute calcaneal osteomyelitis following steroid injection for plantar fasciitis. The patient eventually required a partial calcanectomy to cure the infection.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 57-year-old woman patient presented to our outpatient department with signs and symptoms typical of plantar fasciitis affecting her left heel. She had no previous problems with her feet; there was no history of trauma. She did not suffer from plantar fasciitis in past. Patient had no previous history of feet infection or pedal ulcerations and had no peripheral vascular disease. Patient was noninsulin-dependent diabetic and had history of well-controlled hypertension. She was initially treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy (Diclofenac), referred to podiatrist and physiotherapist, but recommended treatment did not lead to relief of her symptoms completely. Therefore, 4 months since her symptoms started, she was offered and given injection of 40 mg Kenalog (triamcinolone acetonide) mixed with 1 mL of 1% lignocaine. This was performed under aseptic technique in the outpatient department. The injection was given from medial side of the calcaneus and needle tip was positioned just distal to calcaneal tuberosity at the point of maximum tenderness. Needle tip passed the midline of the foot. Needle did not engage the bone. Skin over the injection site was normal; there were no wounds or skin abrasions. There was no local swelling, no erythema of the skin, and skin temperature was normal. There was no sign of infection in the area of the heel. The patient had no recent history of any systemic infection or fever. There was no immediate complication and the patient reported relief of her symptoms within 1 week. She re-presented to our department 17 days following injection with worsening pain of her left heel. Patient developed temperature of 38.4°C, she was systemically unwell and had tachycardia. There was acute swelling, erythema, and warmth of the entire left heel. There was no collection and no sign of skin injury over the left foot. No other focus of infection was identified. The inflammatory markers were markedly raised; white cell count, 12.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L; C reactive protein, 112 mg/L; and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 54 mm/h. The patient had blood cultures taken and she was started on broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics. She had ultrasound examination of the heel, which did not reveal any collection. Subsequent magnetic resonance scan revealed acute osteomyelitis of left calcaneus involving the entire bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1938640012451313">Figure 1</xref>). Blood cultures were positive for <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, sensitive to flucloxacillin. The patient was treated with long course of antibiotics (flucloxacillin and fusidic acid), but her condition failed to improve and subsequent magnetic resonance scan showed established osteomyelitis with minimal signs of improvement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1938640012451313">Figure 2</xref>). The patient was referred to tertiary foot and ankle center and required partial calcanectomy 6 months after initial diagnosis of infection. Intra-operative bone specimen was cultured, but there was no bacterial growth. Following long period of further antimicrobial treatment, the infection settled completely.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Steroid injection is an accepted and effective treatment in plantar fasciitis.</p>
<p>Many authors recommend injection as superior to conservative, noninvasive treatment. Yucel et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012451313">1</xref></sup> advocate giving injection using palpation or ultrasound as referencing as this is more effective and efficient than physical therapy alone. Lee and Ahmad<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012451313">2</xref></sup> compared autologous blood injection against corticosteroid injection and concluded that steroid is superior in terms of speed and extent of improvement. Tatli and Kapasi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012451313">3</xref></sup> reported that steroid therapy, when coupled with physiotherapy, can provide efficacious pain relief, but they recommended that steroid injections should be combined with ultrasound monitoring to reduce complications. Porter and Shadbolt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012451313">4</xref></sup> suggested that corticosteroid injection is more efficient and more cost-effective than extracorporeal shock wave therapy in the treatment of plantar fasciitis. Keating et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1938640012451313">5</xref></sup> in their recent article stated that steroid injection of the plantar fascia under general anesthesia is a safe and effective method for the relief of conservatively unmanageable heel pain due to plantar fasciitis. Very few complications of steroid injection were reported. Only one publication in the current literature describes calcaneal osteomyelitis as a complication of such injection; Gidumal and Evanski<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1938640012451313">6</xref></sup> reported such a case in 1985. Other complications of plantar fascia injection described in the literature involve sterile abscess formation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1938640012451313">7</xref></sup> lateral plantar nerve injury,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1938640012451313">8</xref></sup> and plantar fascia rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1938640012451313">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our patient developed acute calcaneal osteomyelitis as a result of steroid administration. Despite the fact that the injection was given under aseptic technique by a senior orthopaedic surgeon, this resulted in significant complication. Prompt diagnosis of osteomyelitis and early start of treatment allowed control of the infection and prevented long-term disability.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Complications of steroid injection in the treatment of plantar fasciitis are rare but potentially very serious. As presented in this case report, the injection may cause calcaneal osteomyelitis. The patient we described was diabetic. Authors advocate that diabetes mellitus should be regarded as an independent risk factor for development of acute infection following invasive treatment. We would like to highlight this serious risk and to make orthopaedic surgeons aware of the above complication. We urge surgeons to consider this when obtaining consent for injection in plantar fasciitis.</p>
<p>Authors recommend that patients receiving steroid injections for plantar fasciitis should be very closely monitored to reduce risks and to allow early diagnosis in case any complication occur. This is especially important in patients suffering from diabetes mellitus.</p>
