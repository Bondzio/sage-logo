<p>Concerns about the problem of over-research have been reported in communities around the world, and across a wide range of fields of social science research practice for decades. Yet, despite this, over-research remains under-addressed by social scientists as a significant research concern. In this article, we discuss the problem of over-research as articulated by the residents of the Shatila Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon – a camp which is probably one of the most heavily researched neighbourhoods anywhere, and certainly within the Palestinian diaspora. Concerns voiced by Shatila residents focus on three issues, in particular: the relationship of research to expectations and promises of social change; alienation from researcher practices and questions and misgivings about researcher identities and agendas; and the impact of research on social relationships and identities within the Shatila camp itself.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The problem of over-researched communities, ironically, is itself an under-researched topic in the social sciences. Though parenthetically acknowledged as an issue by researchers across a wide range of geographic areas and fields of social science research practice for decades, it has rarely been written about as a subject in its own right. One of the few studies to focus on over-research explicitly is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038512448567">Clark’s (2008)</xref> article in <italic>Sociology</italic>, which reports the perspectives of 13 experienced qualitative researchers in Britain on the issue of over-research, and raises concerns about the possible impacts that over-research might have on the ability of researchers to sustain their research practices into the future. In this article, we discuss instead the problem of over-research as perceived by the researched, focusing on one particular over-researched neighbourhood, the Shatila Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon. Some of the issues raised by the researchers quoted in Clark’s article are echoed by the researched residents of Shatila: concerns over the relation of research to expectations and promises of social change; and alienation of the researched from researchers’ practices and questions. However, interviews with residents and community leaders of Shatila also raise two further areas of concern: misgivings that the researched have about the social and political identities and agendas of the researchers they encounter in the field; and the impact that over-research has on social relationships and identities within the Shatila neighbourhood itself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0038038512448567" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The starting point for this article was a conversation that one of us, Mayssoun, had with a group of residents and community leaders in Shatila about political organising for Palestinian civil rights in Lebanon. Mayssoun has a long-term relationship with the Shatila camp, having worked in Beirut for the past decade as an informal educator. During this conversation, the issue of over-research was raised by the residents themselves, who argued for the need for someone to write about the issue, in the hope of raising awareness about the damaging effects they believed it was having on their community. As discussed below, residents and community leaders in Shatila and other Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon have previously raised concerns about the problem of over-research orally, but to little avail. This article thus aims to represent some of these concerns in written form, and to link such local concerns with the problem of social scientific over-research more generally, as well as with the concerns of over-researched communities in other locations elsewhere around the world.</p>
<p>The discussion in the following pages is based primarily on 20 semi-structured interviews that were conducted in Arabic during a period of two months in the summer of 2011, with Shatila residents, community leaders and activists, and employees of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) who are working in Shatila (some of whom are also residents of the neighbourhood themselves). Interviewees ranged in age from their early 20s to their late 60s, included both men and women, and came from a broad spectrum of social, economic and educational backgrounds and statuses within the camp; in this article, all personal names of these interviewees have been changed and anonymised. To recruit interviewees, we used both a snowball method that was based on previously established personal relationships, and a targeted set of interviews with people from different organisations and sections of the camp population. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, translated into English and analysed. In addition to these fieldwork interviews, we conducted archival research in the Institute of Palestine Studies in Beirut, collecting and analysing past academic and media reports on the Shatila camp. Finally, we also conducted a broader investigation of how over-research has, and has not been, addressed in the social science research methods literature more generally.</p>
<p>There is a certain irony, of course, in conducting further research in a neighbourhood whose residents complain about being over-researched, precisely in order to study the phenomenon and impact of over-research. We believe that the origins and initial motivations of this project made it one that was legitimate and important to carry out; and almost universally, we found that local residents welcomed what was a rare opportunity to talk reflectively about researchers rather than their own lives, histories and practices. As we note below, one of the dilemmas in addressing the problem of over-research is that sometimes complaints of over-research of some topics and issues carry with them a critique of under-research of other topics and issues. Readers will have to judge for themselves, however, whether or not they feel that our investigation, in this instance, was warranted.</p>

<title>The Problem of Over-research</title>
<p>Complaints of over-research have been regularly recorded all over the world: from the mountains of Appalachia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038038512448567">Caudill, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038038512448567">LeCompte and Goetz, 1982</xref>); to the First Nations communities of Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038038512448567">Schnarch, 2004</xref>); to the townships of South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038038512448567">Nnaemaka, 2005</xref>); to the Maori communities of New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038038512448567">Smith, 1999</xref>); to the cities of Bradford, Glasgow and Liverpool in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038038512448567">Moore, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038038512448567">Roberts et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038038512448567">Sanghera and Thapar-Björkert, 2008</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038512448567">Clark (2008</xref>: 955) notes, complaints of over-research have also appeared across academic fields, in public health, community development, education, disability studies, geriatrics, queer studies and so forth. Back in the 1960s, Vine Deloria Jr. wrote in his book, <italic>Custer Died for Your Sins: An Indian Manifesto</italic>, of how:
<disp-quote>
<p>Every summer when school is out a veritable stream of immigrants heads into Indian country. Indeed the Oregon Trail was never so heavily populated as are Route 66 and Highway 18 in the summer time. From every rock and cranny in the East <italic>they</italic> emerge, as if responding to some primeval fertility rite, and flock to the reservations. ‘They’ are the anthropologists. Social anthropologists, historical anthropologists, political anthropologists, economic anthropologists, all brands of the species, embark on the great summer adventure … They are the most prominent members of the scholarly community that infests the land of the free, and in the summer time, the homes of the braves. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0038038512448567">1969</xref>: 78)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As an old joke tells it, the ‘definition of a Navajo household is one Indian home with eight anthropologists living in it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0038038512448567">Sayigh, 2010</xref>, personal communication). First Nations leaders in Canada commonly complain their communities have ‘been researched to death’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038038512448567">Schnarch, 2004</xref>: 3); while indigenous communities in New Zealand and elsewhere swear they must be ‘the most researched people in the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038038512448567">Smith, 1999</xref>: 3). Though the problem of over-research can arise anywhere, it has been most prevalent in communities characterised by three key features: communities that are poor, low income, indigenous, minority or otherwise marginalised; communities that have experienced some form of crisis (war, genocide, natural disaster, etc.) and/or have engaged in active resistance to the conditions of their poverty and marginalisation; and communities that are accessible to outside researchers, in particular, by being located in close geographical proximity to research centres and universities.</p>
<p>Community complaints of over-research tend to arise from a combination of the sheer repetition, frequency and often redundancy of research presence, as well as a sense that research fails to bring any tangible or substantive change or benefit to the residents living in the communities being studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038512448567">Clark, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038038512448567">Schnarch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038038512448567">Sharp and Murdoch, 2006</xref>). In some cases, research may be seen as constituting part of a system of surveillance and control that leads directly to the disadvantage and disempowerment of local community members. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038038512448567">Smith (1999</xref>: 1), for example, writes that ‘the word itself, “research”, is one of the dirtiest words in the indigenous world’s vocabulary’, and is ‘inextricably linked to European imperialism and colonialism’. In other cases, research may be seen as benefiting the lives and careers of researchers, but leaving the lives of those being researched unimproved in any significant way, regardless of the time, energy and resources they have contributed to the research effort. ‘We’re over-researched and underdeveloped,’ complained one participant in a longitudinal research study in Africa, ‘when researchers come they are thin, and when they return later, they are nice and fat, while we remain the same as always’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0038038512448567">Moser, 2003</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>The issue of over-research has been widely, though parenthetically, acknowledged by researchers over the years, and there are several methodological approaches that have been developed explicitly to deal with some of the problems commonly linked with over-research as a phenomenon. These include forms of participatory, action, community, indigenous and insider research. However, while these methodological approaches are each valuable in their own right, none constitutes a panacea to the problem of over-research; and indeed, all can themselves contribute to the overall experience of over-research by the researched. Participatory research, for example, can be even more intrusive and time-consuming than other research methodologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038038512448567">Titterton and Smart, 2008</xref>: 56); an extensive literature exists on how participatory models of research may serve as tools not of empowerment but of social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0038038512448567">Cooke and Kothari, 2001</xref>); and in the absence of any connection to broader social and political movements, small scale participatory or action research projects are often unlikely to be able to effect significant improvements in local social or economic conditions. Likewise, the promotion of insider, indigenous or community-based forms of research cannot be assumed to automatically constitute solutions to the problems of over-research. As we discuss in the case of Shatila, part of the complexity and ambiguity in dealing with the problem of over-research is that local communities, and even individuals, can be internally divided on the question of research. It is possible for communities to feel over-researched in some regards and under-researched in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038038512448567">Chahal, 2004</xref>); and for community members and leaders to both want and not want research to be done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038038512448567">Sanghera and Thapar-Björkert, 2008</xref>). The practice and experience of research itself, furthermore, can complicate and disrupt distinctions between the identities of being an insider or outsider, indigenous or foreigner, community or non-community member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0038038512448567">Kusow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038038512448567">Naples, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038038512448567">Schnarch, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Shatila as an Over-researched Neighbourhood</title>
<p>The Shatila Palestinian refugee camp, which is built on a one square kilometer patch of land located in the southern part of Beirut, Lebanon, was originally established in 1949 by the International Committee of the Red Cross as one of 11 supposedly temporary camps in Lebanon to accommodate Palestinian refugees after the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038038512448567">Sayigh, 1993</xref>). Since its inception, Shatila has been subject to repeated wars and attacks that have led to its destruction and subsequent reconstruction two times over. In 1976, Shatila became host to the leadership of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), after the PLO moved its headquarters to Lebanon from Jordan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038038512448567">Khalidi, 2001</xref>). In 1982, the Israeli siege of Beirut led to the forced exile of the PLO, the destruction of Shatila and the committing of one of the late 20th century’s most infamous war crimes. In what became known as the ‘Sabra and Shatila massacre’, the Lebanese Phalangist militia, under the watch and protection of the Israeli Defence Force, killed 3000 men, women and children in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps during a 48-hour period between 16 September and 18 September 1982 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0038038512448567">Nuwayhed al-Hout, 2004</xref>). Shatila was destroyed for a second time during Lebanon’s War of the Camps from 1986 to 1990, and subsequently rebuilt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038038512448567">Khalidi, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Shatila today is a densely populated neighbourhood of multi-storey concrete buildings packed tightly together that are home to more than 8500 refugees. Shatila residents, like all Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, are denied basic civil rights and officially barred from working in many occupations outside the camp. Unemployment rates in Shatila are about 60 per cent and poverty rates over 70 per cent (personal communication with UNRWA staff). Those who do work are often employed as labourers, cleaners, street vendors and shopkeepers. In the 1990s, after the end of Lebanon’s 15-year long civil war, international aid funds began to trickle into the local, national and international NGOs that had been established in the camp in the wake of the PLO’s departure. These NGOs provide most of the basic services in the camp, from education to health care, and are one of the few employers available for Palestinian refugees in Shatila with high levels of education. Environmental and health conditions in Shatila are considered to be among the worst in Lebanon, due to a combination of overcrowding and the camp’s inadequate and often broken sewage, water and power infrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038038512448567">Chaaban et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In large part due to its continued experience of destruction and reconstruction, its historical ties with the PLO, the infamy of the Sabra and Shatila massacre, its size and its easily accessible location between downtown Beirut and the Beirut international airport, Shatila has become probably the best-known and most widely researched of any of the refugee camps in the Palestinian diaspora. A simple keyword search of the Institute for Palestine Studies (IPS) library database in Beirut turns up 223 academic articles and 128 books and academic manuscripts written on Shatila; this is in addition to thousands of media articles, and many documentary films and other reportages. Among the widely known of these are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038038512448567">Rosemary Sayigh’s (1993)</xref> <italic>Too Many Enemies: The Palestinian Experience in Lebanon</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0038038512448567">Bayan Nuwayhed al-Hout’s (2004)</xref> <italic>Sabra and Shatila</italic>, and Mai Masri’s documentary films, <italic>Children of Shatila</italic> (1998) and <italic>Frontiers of Dreams and Fears</italic> (2001). Researchers have come from all over the world to study in Shatila, and for years now have constituted a daily presence in the lives of Shatila residents. Many residents say they have lost count of the number of interviews they have done with researchers and journalists, for there have been so many. Other Palestinian refugee camps tend to attract considerably less research attention. For example, there are only 17 academic articles listed in the IPS library database on Burj El Barajneh, the other main Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut. Recently, the destruction of the Nahr El Bared Palestinian refugee camp near Tripoli in the north of Lebanon in 2007 has triggered an increase in research attention there. As one Shatila resident says, ‘researchers like blood, and once there is something in the media, researchers all decide to focus on it’.</p>
<p>For years now, residents and representatives of the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon have called for a halt to research being done in the camps. In 2008, the Issam Fares Institute (IFI) at the American University of Beirut launched a multi-year research program on the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and Palestine. However, at each of the IFI’s major conferences, ‘Palestinian leaders have called for the institute to end its research program because they say the camps are over-researched and residents are tired of research intrusion’ (IFI staff, personal interview). Similar calls have been made by Palestinian refugees at meetings of the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) in 2010, and the International Labour Organization in 2011 in Lebanon. Both organisations are responsible for conducting large-scale quantitative surveys of conditions facing Palestinian refugees in the camps in Lebanon.</p>

<title>The Relationship of Research to Expectations and Promises of Social Change</title>
<p>Umm Ahmed, a single mother of seven children in her fifties who is registered as a hardship case with UNRWA (the United Nations Relief and Work Agency, the UN agency responsible for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria) tells the story of the broken door in her kitchen.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>She [the head of an NGO based in Shatila] has visited me so many times now, and every time she brings in researchers with her to take pictures. The first time she came … I thought it would be a good way to vent, so I received her with the researchers and I was passionate about what I talked about … I allowed them to take pictures of the house, the door of the kitchen was broken. She started to come regularly, comes and goes, takes pictures. One year passed, a second year passed … Till last year, it has been five years of bringing researchers to talk to me and take pictures of my still broken door.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Umm Ahmed’s son, a 25-year old shopkeeper and community leader in Shatila, adds, ‘there are at least one hundred pictures taken of that door … They ask, they leave and nothing changes.’</p>
<p>Residents, camp leaders and NGO employees alike in Shatila raise concern about the contrast between the amount of research conducted in the camp and the lack of positive change in the camp’s social and economic conditions. ‘The researchers are growing in numbers, and the camp’s problems are growing too,’ says Lama, a 24-year-old Shatila resident and university student. Many residents suspect that researchers do not actually want anything to change in the camp. ‘Their main aim is to keep the situation as is,’ says Ahmed, ‘this is a conviction by the people of the camp now. Because if the situation improved, they would not have anything to write about. They would be messed, and their source of living would be destroyed.’ Some residents also say that if the money that has been spent on researching poverty in Shatila over the decades had been spent on developing the camp’s infrastructure instead, the problems that researchers come to investigate would likely have all been resolved by now.</p>
<p>The idea that research should be linked to enabling and promoting social and economic improvement does not stem solely from resident expectations, but comes directly from promises that are made by researchers and the NGOs in Shatila that regularly act as camp gatekeepers and sponsors of researchers. One researcher from a Lebanese thinktank, for example, recounts her experience of an eight-year-old girl from Shatila telling her at a UNICEF workshop that ‘we always get visited and get to be asked questions, and nothing changes, so why do you keep researching the camps?’ The researcher says she told the girl that ‘we are writing to UNICEF, the results of the workshop will be given to UNICEF, and UNICEF will work on solving the problem’. Shatila residents say that researchers regularly invoke ‘serving the Palestinian cause’ as a principal reason why they should participate in these researchers’ studies:
<disp-quote>
<p>The last researcher who came to my shop … said I am doing a film and it is for the Palestinian cause. I told her Palestine taught us that when we plant trees we get fruits, so you help me I help you … They want me to leave my shop and work with them all day long. Why? Because they are helping Palestine … Enough trading with the Palestinian cause. We are Palestine.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The NGOs who act as gatekeepers in the camp also tell residents that research participation is important for ‘giving voice’ and ‘changing perceptions’ about Palestinian refugees, and thereby improving their conditions. Khalil, an unemployed Shatila resident in his mid-twenties, says mockingly, ‘if they [the researchers] come to tell me they are just doing research and do not promise me anything and do not invoke the Palestinian cause, maybe I will help them better’. Marwan, a 25-year-old engineer, notes that ‘by now, at least twenty researchers have given me voice. My voice was given in English, French, Arabic, Dutch, Swedish, and Spanish. But I haven’t heard it back and I will never do.’</p>
<p>After years of failing to see any connection between research and positive social change, residents say that their expectations about the importance of research have diminished. For example, Samir, a 40-year-old Palestinian activist and UNRWA employee, says that ‘before I was naïve, I used to think that … all research is good. I am not romantic and naïve about it as I used to be before’. As a consequence, many residents say that they are less willing to participate in research today. Umm Ahmed, after years of talking about her situation and having researchers take photographs of her broken door, finally decided to stop talking to researchers:
<disp-quote>
<p>Last time [the head of the NGO] came by with a researcher, I told her, ‘No, thank you. You are exposing me [Arabic: <italic>fadahtini</italic>], I am a human being, and I have children and they have their dignity … What did you do to help me out of my situation? I am not going to help your researchers.’ She came to take pictures and help researchers so many times. I did not get anything from them. The door is still broken, come and see it.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Despite their anger at the lack of change resulting from past research in the camp, Shatila residents do not all dismiss the value of all research entirely. Some residents say that there are topics that are important to be studied, but have been neglected by researchers. These most often involve questions of Palestinian civil rights, and entail studying not Palestinian refugees themselves but the national and international institutions that control and govern refugee lives. Randa, a long-time activist and PLO representative, asks, ‘why study the Palestinians to understand their lack of rights? Why not study the international community and the Lebanese government who are responsible for this lack of rights?’ For Shatila residents, though, research is seen to be valuable to the extent that it is connected to tangible social change; and, for social change to occur, residents say that research has to be connected to a broader social movement and political struggle. Ironically, some residents point out that when there was a strong social movement in the camp, there was little research done in Shatila, or any of the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. Over-research emerged as a concern for Shatila residents only after the defeat and exile of the PLO from Lebanon in 1982. ‘Now I believe that the message of the Palestinian people has reached the world because of the intifadas and the ongoing Palestinian struggles,’ says Khalil, ‘not because of the researchers … I do not believe them any more.’</p>

<title>Misgivings about Researcher Practices and Agendas</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038038512448567">Clark (2008)</xref>, in his article on researchers’ perspectives on the problem of over-research, highlights concerns with apathy, indifference and alienation of the researched from researchers’ questions and topics (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038038512448567">Sharp and Murdoch, 2006</xref>). We find similar concerns expressed by the residents of Shatila. Rola, an NGO employee in her forties who also acts as one of the main gatekeepers for research in Shatila, says that researchers’ ‘topics are decided outside of the camps not inside, and residents have no say in what is being studied’. ‘Most of the research is done on topics that are famous in the universities in the west,’ agrees Samir. Ahmed observes that researchers are faddish and all seem to study the same set of topics at the same time: ‘Topics like people get famous sometimes, and then they drop and expire, and new topics become famous and everybody focuses on them.’ Currently, residents say that youth, women and conflict resolution are the hot topics for researchers coming into Shatila – though they do not understand why this should be the case. Camp residents are also aware that institutional funding plays a major role in shaping the kind of research done in their neighbourhood. ‘It is the funds that decide the research,’ says Lama.</p>
<p>Concerns in the camp about research, however, go far deeper than a simple sense of disconnection and lack of relevance. First, many residents express anger and frustration about a perceived lack of preparedness, knowledge and understanding among researchers, that they worry leads to poor research quality. Samir, like other residents, complains that researchers keep coming into the camp and asking the same questions over and over again:

<p>[Many of them] are young students, and they do not read what has been written on the camps before they come. So sometimes I meet people who are doing carbon copies of research that has been done before, but they are not aware of it. I don’t understand the university PhD students any more, they don’t do their job. So they all keep learning the ABCs of the camps again, they do not know the ABCs of the Palestinian cause … It is really scary.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>‘They do the same interviews with the same people all the time,’ says Lama, ‘Why don’t they use the interviews that were done by researchers before?’ Many researchers who come to the camp do not speak Arabic, and are thus dependent on local translators and gatekeepers, some of whom have only limited English themselves. Residents thus question what researchers are actually taking away from the interviews and conversations they have in the camp. ‘They are mostly stupid,’ says Khalil, ‘as they don’t know Arabic.’</p>
<p>Second, many residents also question researcher ethics. Despite resident complaints that they are tired of answering research questions, researchers continue to come to Shatila. Many believe that researchers are self-interested people who are always ‘running after their own name’. ‘Why do they keep on doing interviews?’ asks Khalil. ‘Because the Palestinians sell. We sell. It is a complex and complicated cause and struggle and everybody likes to study it for their own interests most of the time … They study us to succeed in the university.’ Residents complain that researchers manipulate social relationships in the field. While collecting data in the camp, they befriend local residents and promise to stay in touch. However, as soon as they leave, they ‘won’t even answer the emails we send them’. ‘When we send them a “hi”, they say “bye”,’ says Ahmed. Residents complain that researchers neglect to share their research reports with them. ‘I always ask researchers to send me their studies or filmmakers to send their films, and I need to beg them with emails to send them to me,’ complains Samir. Residents also complain that researchers expect them to answer questions that they would never accept to be asked themselves. ‘They want to even know when we make love which side we sleep on, this is how private they get,’ says Umm Ahmed, ‘I swear once one was doing research on marital relations and she asked very embarrassing questions … It is really beyond disgusting, there is nothing left not studied. Enough, really enough.’ ‘People of the camp are so tired,’ says Rola, but researchers continue to treat them as if ‘they are a lab for experiments’.</p>
<p>Third, residents express deep suspicion about the political agendas of researchers, particularly those coming from countries such as the USA and Britain. Researchers from ‘those countries that help Israel like to study us for god’s sake,’ says Ahmed. In the camp, researchers are widely regarded as spies. Some researchers ‘conduct studies in the camp that look humanitarian in nature, but are used for political reasons,’ says Samir, ‘these are studies done by the international organisations, who are studying the Palestinians for the need to know how to control them.’ Randa agrees: ‘Studies help to understand the weaknesses and gaps through which they can penetrate the Palestinian society and make them forget their political rights.’ Shatila residents talk of how researchers constantly ask them about their views of the Right of Return, and appear to be searching for evidence that their commitment to this right is dissipating. Samir worries that researchers’ questions may work to:
<disp-quote>
<p>… direct and form people’s consciousness and blind people on some issues … There is a trend now to focus on Palestinians not as a political subject from Palestine but as a human being. Bullshit. I am not saying we do not need to focus on the personal problems. But there is some sort of directed effort in order to sway attention away from the political problems to the personal and the individual, and this is the danger. These are all funded projects and studies and do not come out of a void. They are not innocent studies.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Randa also raises the concern that researchers can be dishonest about their true aims and intentions:
<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes in the questionnaires they distribute, they include certain questions that can be very harmful and not related to the subject under study. There are questions that get to be asked on the margin of the research. It gets written down and recorded on a different paper. Where does it go? How is this research analysed? No one knows.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Sympathies with such concerns have led some researchers to seek to develop alternative forms of research practice. At the beginning of the 21st century, new types of research began to appear in Shatila that were referred to as participatory, action or community action research, and promised to offer camp residents opportunities for education and empowerment through their participation in the research process. Residents say that, at first, they welcomed these new forms of research. Rania, a young Shatila resident in her twenties who has a university degree but is currently unemployed, and who has long volunteered in a number of Shatila’s NGOs, recalls:
<disp-quote>
<p>At the beginning I thought it is good because at least we get something out of the research. We always help researchers and they go, no one helps us in anything, they do not even remember we helped them. When the head of the NGO came to me, at that time I was not participating in any research because I was fed up with them. But the head of the NGO said this time it is like going to school, you will learn. They do workshops and you participate and then they write about their experience. I was not working, you know how we spend all the time in the alleys, and I like to learn myself, I like education, so I thought I would participate in the workshops.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, over time, many residents have come to see these new types of research as being little better, and in some cases worse, than previous forms of research. Residents have little say in the focus of these projects, feel alienated from the topics that researchers select, and complain of both the ‘ignorance’ and ‘missionary attitudes’ of many of the participatory researchers:
<disp-quote>
<p>They come to teach us how to take action to solve our problems. They are so stupid because they do not know the community and the history of Palestinians in Lebanon. They come to teach us like a recipe they get from the books. They are very naïve. Sometimes the topics are not good for us. Like many of the public health researchers, they come to teach us hygiene, we feel they think we are filthy. Not to boast, but you know in the camps, although we do not have water and all, but our homes are always clean, our parents are obsessed with cleanliness … We are very clean and we don’t need anyone to teach us these issues.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Some Shatila residents also complain of how these new forms of research demand more from them than previous research methodologies. ‘It is more torturous because once you start you are stuck till the research is over,’ says Sami, a young, unemployed Palestinian who remains active with Shatila’s NGOs, ‘because you feel responsible for the researchers who come to teach and you can’t leave them in the middle.’ Rania agrees:
<disp-quote>
<p>Now I think it is worse. Because in normal research, you just meet that person one time, they interview you and they go … In this participatory research we are stuck till the researcher finishes all the workshops. Sometimes there are twenty or more [workshops], and they are long and boring.</p>

<title>Impact of Over-research on Social Relationships and Identities within Shatila</title>
<p>When a neighbourhood has been subject to as much research as Shatila, the research process inevitably comes to affect local social relationships and identities within the camp. Researchers tend to focus on particular groups and individuals in the camp, while ignoring others. For a long time, researchers were interested almost solely with the generation of 1948 and their experience of the Nakba, and neglected the contemporary concerns and struggles of other generations. Subsequently, they have moved on to focus on women, youth and children in Shatila. Researchers, moreover, focus on individuals within these groups who they see as particularly good research subjects. ‘There are five old people in Shatila that everybody interviews,’ says Umm Ahmed:
<disp-quote>
<p>I can see how these older people used to tell the stories before, and how they tell their stories … now. They used to be very passionate … Now I feel they are like a tape recorder, you press a button and they start to talk, repeat the same things over and over again.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In Shatila, residents refer to those individuals who researchers focus on as ‘stars’, and the research star-making process as a ‘cycle’. This is a cycle that can be destructive for both individual stars and the broader community. Ahmed tells the story of Selma, who at the age of 11 was the focus of a documentary film made about the camp. After the film came out:
<disp-quote>
<p>Selma became a star. She was interviewed everywhere, she was taken to theatres and pampered by everyone … This continued until a new film was made on Shatila. Selma was not any more the star … She started to cry all the time and act out all the time … We felt we did not know her any more … People in the camp started to say she is crazy and unstable. But this was due to the research and filming and attention, and to the self-interest and selfishness of the researchers, who do not pay attention to the needs or effects of making stars out of children and then dropping them … So it is a cycle. Researchers exploit you totally till you expire and they drop you.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Ahmed also talks more generally of the effects of research on the children of Shatila who researchers work with:
<disp-quote>
<p>Some children are made to be heroes. They get much attention, researchers make them grow and grow and grow. Children feel they are flying over the clouds, and researchers give them money. But then, like canned food, it comes time when these heroes expire, and they are not any more cute kids. They kill them, and they will be left again to the alleys of the camp. People in the camp pity these children … They develop complexes … It is all exploitation. If this is not exploitation, what is it then?</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Lama, who also became a magnet for researchers’ attention when she was a child, says:
<disp-quote>
<p>… when I was a star, I used to get at least two interviews a day … I used to be happy … because I felt researchers were getting close to me because of who I am as a person, because I am interesting and smart.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>But when researchers left the camp and failed to keep in touch, ‘I used to get angry and sad and upset’. Later she realised that researchers were actually interested in her ‘because of their own research and because I am from the camp’.</p>
<p>Not all residents in Shatila share the same views on research. There are two overlapping groups within the camp who both promote, and benefit from, research done in Shatila, and who act as liaisons and gatekeepers between residents and outside researchers. The first of these are the camp NGOs, who tend to view research as an important opportunity for raising publicity and funds for the work they do in the camp. There is thus what some residents call a ‘circle of interest’ between outside researchers and local NGOs. It is often the NGOs that ask residents to talk to researchers. Since many Shatila residents depend on local NGOs for services and income support, they feel obliged to participate in research, and do not feel theirs is a free choice to make. If they refuse, they know there have been examples in Shatila of NGOs cutting off services and funds to uncooperative residents.</p>
<p>Many residents also feel that local NGOs and outside researchers collude in highlighting the negative aspects of camp life, which they feel is a false representation of Shatila and an affront to their sense of dignity. ‘The NGOs like to show that the camp is bad,’ says Ayman, an accountant and Shatila resident in his early twenties:
<disp-quote>
<p>… because this way they get funds. And the researchers like misery, so it is a common interest, and we are always asked about our problems … I remember when I was a kid … I was bitter about the life of the camps, and the NGOs as well as the researchers liked that. But the funny thing, now I remember, is that they used to tell me what to say. Like the social worker in the NGO would come with the researcher to interview me, and she starts to tell me, ‘Tell her so and so,’ … and it is always about how bad our lives are … Sometimes now I sit and laugh, I am not sure I was telling the truth to the researchers. But they accepted what I said and they pitied me, and I guess I liked that at some point.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>‘These researchers are making us look bad not good,’ complains Ahmed, who, like many other Shatila residents in their twenties today, has been interacting with researchers since he was a young boy:
<disp-quote>
<p>I am sick and tired of them … Whenever they see a destroyed building, they take pictures of it … It is so humiliating, they want to take pictures of Palestinian kids, they go to the Horsh, where the Gypsies are … They find children with no clothes, and they say these are Palestinians. I never see in the camp children with no clothes on … They also go to the Horsh and take pictures of the zinc houses, and they say they are part of the camp. I am not looking down on the people in the zinc houses, but why lie? I am a hardship case, but our home has a roof, and all the houses in the camps have roofs.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>‘Why don’t people write about the talents in the camps?’ asks Khalil: ‘If they keep talking about the problems, the west will say, “They can’t fix the problems of the camps … how will they handle a country if they return?” I think they harm the cause, they do not help us.’</p>
<p>The phenomenon of over-research has also created a second group of residents in the camp who are interested in promoting and benefiting from research. These are individuals, typically well educated and bilingual speakers of Arabic and English, who see research as an opportunity to generate income for themselves. They find work as interpreters, translators, transcribers, gatekeepers and guides for the many researchers who come to Shatila, finding and arranging interviews and other research encounters with Shatila residents. ‘It is a recent phenomenon, mostly in the last decade,’ says Osama, a teacher in his thirties from Shatila:
<disp-quote>
<p>At first, everybody was willing to give time and energy for free, thinking it is good for the camp and the cause. But after a while, there is a general belief in the camp that the researchers are self-centred and going after their own interest. So you start to give yourself the excuse, ‘Why should I help them for free?’</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Though Shatila residents recognise the need for other residents to make a living for themselves, some express concerns over the ways in which research in the camp is becoming increasingly commodified. As Samir explains:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is someone in the camp who works as a gatekeeper and he is not ashamed that he charges for helping researchers. He told me, ‘You need to think of it as a business.’ I don’t know, I don’t want to be a slave for the researchers, but I don’t like to be a businessman and make business out of my people. Some people only care for money. This is another bad effect of the over-research. It creates parasites in the camps … It is like a joke, sometimes they tell the people what to say to the researchers. They act like a fixer: ‘Anyone who pays me money, I give him what he wants to hear.’ … He takes the researchers to the same families all the time and tells them what to say.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Randa, a camp resident who now makes most of her income through arranging, interpreting, transcribing and translating interviews with other residents, says she works with about 10 academic researchers every year, in addition to journalists and researchers from policy institutes and thinktanks. Though she knows that residents in the camp are tired of researchers and think they are spies, she says she still feels that researchers ‘serve us, they give us a voice’. Randa says that she will only work with researchers on topics that she feels are in the interests of the camp’s residents. But she also admits that she rarely sees what researchers and reporters do with the data they gather in the camp. ‘I get scared to see the end result,’ she says, ‘otherwise I might stop working on helping these people. And I need to work.’</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In addressing the phenomenon of over-research in communities such as Shatila, it is important to recognise that camp residents are not just passive subjects (or victims) of the practices and interests of outside researchers. It is not just the camp NGOs and enterprising gatekeepers, but also individual research interviewees who seek to exert their own agendas in shaping the research process, from wherever it originates. As Ahmed says:
<disp-quote>
<p>[Researchers] lie most of the time. Sometimes I lie to them too … because I also have my own interests from research … Sometimes we just create stories for them and protect our camp by saying what we want to be said and written even if it is not reality, and they say, ‘Oh wow, interesting.’ They have an individual aim, we have a community aim … I would not answer anyone who asked about weapons, prostitution, drugs or anything.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>But even though residents exert their own agency in research interactions, they nonetheless continue to express concern over the phenomenon of over-research, and the impact of research and researchers on their own lives and the lives of their families and the neighbourhood as a whole.</p>
<p>Several arguments may be drawn from the preceding discussion of over-research in Shatila for social science research practice more generally. First, the problem of over-research needs to be brought to the forefront of attention in training and discussions about the politics and ethics of social science research, as there is evidence that it is a particularly concerning problem within certain communities around the world. Second, though over-research is particularly problematic within certain communities and locations, the solution to community complaints of over-research should not be seen as being solely about moving on to find other, less-researched communities and locations elsewhere (<italic>pace</italic>, for example, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038038512448567">Institute of Education, 2010</xref>). Traditional, ‘extractive’ models of university-based and driven research, combined with the continued proliferation of academic research generally, serve to make the problem of over-research at least a latent concern everywhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038038512448567">Kindon et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, although alternative research models such as participatory, action, community, insider and indigenous research are all important correctives and additions to traditional social science research practice in their own right, they should not be seen as constituting panaceas to the problem of over-research; nor should research projects, of any kind, be assumed to be avoiding the problem simply because they have been endorsed or driven by local NGOs or community groups. Concerns about over-research should not just be approached as presenting a challenge or obstacle that researchers can attempt to overcome by embracing alternative research practices, questions or methodologies that are ostensibly more engaging, enticing or empowering than what has been done before. It is imperative to recognise that sometimes conducting no new research at all is the most appropriate response to community concerns of over-research. Serious engagement with the issues that afflict marginalised and impoverished communities often requires activities <italic>other than</italic> conducting further research studies on the lives of the marginal and poor.</p>
<p>Fourth and finally, the problem of over-research should not be seen as being simply a problem of research method or research ethics, internal to the field of social science research practice. For, at its heart, the problem of over-research pertains to the question of the relationship of social scientific research and researchers to the wider society and economy as a whole. Only by paying direct and critically reflective attention to the positioning of researchers, research projects, research practices and research institutions within local, regional, national and global structures and processes of power, identity, inequality, interest and control can the problems of over-research and over-researched communities begin to be understood and addressed.</p>
