<p>It’s hard to discuss the safety of a kid’s world without thoughts of the Newtown, Connecticut, tragedy of 2012 entering into my mind. How sad that was! Twenty 6- and 7-year-olds murdered by a mentally ill gunman. The only connection between the kids and the gunman was his mother, who taught at the school. Most folks would like to do something to prevent such tragedies, but answers to the question “how?” aren’t easy. Some say increased gun control, while others want to put police officers in every school. It seems to me that as long as there are severely disturbed individuals walking our streets that aren’t receiving help, there will always be diabolical ways for them to lash out and hurt the innocent.</p>
<p>In years past, even when I was doing my medical training, there were a lot more public hospitals treating individuals with severe mental problems. Eloise was part of the University of Michigan’s residency program at Wayne County General Hospital, which serviced the west side of Detroit. This began as the county “poor house” at the turn of the 19th century. It provided shelter and food to those who were desperate and could not fend for themselves. Some of these people were mentally disturbed and were confined there by the courts. Many of these disturbed individuals had treatable illnesses and were able to leave those confines as drug treatment regimens improved through the 1900s. Still, when I was a resident, I remember getting called from the main hospital to one of the wards at Eloise to see some poor soul that had become acutely ill. It was a harrowing experience to walk the many abandoned hallways of Eloise and see the former means of confinement—even chains on the walls. Most of those institutionalized individuals posed no threat to society and were eventually placed elsewhere and treated on an outpatient basis. Many were simply released, despite their problems, under the guise of civil liberties. Because of these societal trends, many of the mental health institutions slowly disappeared. Unfortunately, if a dangerous person is identified nowadays before they commit some horrific act, the number of options available for treatment is few. This is especially true when inpatient treatment is required. This lack of psychiatric treatment seems to explain why many individuals at loose in society today continue to pose a risk. Many of the recent rampage perpetrators were described as “unstable” and “dangerous” by friends and family prior to committing crimes. Why some of these individuals resort to murder-suicide is hard to know.</p>
<p>I wonder how this most recent tragedy affects young children of today in Newtown, Connecticut, as well as across the country. No doubt those closest to the tragedy will show the greatest effect. How much more fear of the unknown and mistrust of those around them has been introduced into their lives? It’s tough enough dealing with the unavoidable fears of childhood, like the boogeyman under the bed or in the closet that comes out at night; kids don’t need the added fears of these tragedies. Many will probably view school differently now, no longer believing that school is a safe haven. Add another item to the list of places to feel insecure. Additionally, many more parents may turn to homeschooling.</p>
<p>Reflecting on my own childhood, it seems like I did have some of those “bad guys” living under my bed for a while, but I can’t really remember at what age they bothered me most—or when they left. I know that by the time I got to the middle of grade school, the biggest fear that I can remember was the scrougy pitch that Leo M. threw at baseball practice. In retrospect, it probably was a baby curve ball, but it was pretty intimidating back then. I know I lost some sleep and spent a lot of time thinking about what I had to do to hit that pitch. At least now, those days seemed a lot simpler, the world a lot kinder and less troubled.</p>
<p>It is a worthwhile goal to provide kids with a world filled with less fear and anxiety—one in which the people and institutions that they rely on do not fail them, one in which their hopes and dreams are not shattered by tragedies such as Newtown, and one in which sports provides a safe haven from the realities of our world. To put this all in perspective, I know it will be difficult to change the fabric of this society in which we live. The violence of television, movies, music, and many neighborhoods is difficult to escape. These factors appear to desensitize and motivate those with serious mental problems. Those most vulnerable and least able to deal with these factors will always be at risk. It’s not that we shouldn’t try to reverse some troublesome trends, but we need to realize that at least some of these negative factors will not go away easily. Giving kids safe havens in sports is one way to help them through the most difficult adolescent and teenage years. Unfortunately, some of our sports venues have not been safe in the recent past, with bad actors posing as coaches and administrators. Those mistakes are so sad and must be addressed with the most fervent of efforts.</p>
<p>To get children interested and to stay engaged in sports, we need to keep them fun while nurturing them as they grow and gain athletic skills. Too little research has been done on how to accomplish these milestones during development. Too often too much attention is directed only to those that excel, while the lesser skilled are left behind. Especially in the early stages of musculoskeletal growth, athletic programs should be inclusive, realizing the issues of delayed maturation in some. If children are excluded or if we don’t hold their interest by making practice and competition fun, we lose their interest, as they often turn to video games and the like as they drop sports participation.</p>
<p>Another issue to consider is that many school-sponsored programs focus on sports seasons and not on year-round conditioning for a healthy lifestyle. How often do we see young cross country runners and adolescent football players start their preseason preparation just 2 weeks in advance only to fall victim to overuse injuries. Many of these mistakes and inadequacies lead to poor outcomes, injuries, and the inability to continue play besides a lack of enjoyment. The end result often is premature cessation of the athletic activity.</p>
<p>Much can be done today to improve sports programs by keeping children, adolescents, and teenagers active and enjoying those precious years, giving them a haven from the troubled society in which we live. If we can nurture them through those early years, maybe they’ll be better prepared mentally and physically for the challenges ahead. My parents believed that a physically exhausted teenager was the best kind. This left very little time and energy for activities that could get me into trouble. It’s interesting how they got smarter as I got older. Keeping youngsters physically active may be one way to deter their attention from the ever-present temptations and booby traps of today. I am confident that sports participation can be safer, more fun, and protective of many young lives.</p>
