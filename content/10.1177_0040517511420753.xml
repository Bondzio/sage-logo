<p>The objective of this research was to characterize the ballistic performance of <italic>p</italic>-aramid fabrics impregnated with shear thickening fluid (STF) focusing on the laminating sequence of the layers. A panel of all neat Kevlar fabrics and two hybrid panels of neat and STF impregnated Kevlar fabrics were tested against 9 mm bullets at 436 m/s for body armor application. When the STF impregnated fabrics were laminated behind the neat Kevlar layers (N/S-panel), the backface signature decreased compared to the panel of all neat fabrics (N-panel) and the hybrid panel with neat Kevlar layers placed on the backside of the panel (S/N-panel). The enhanced ballistic performance of the N/S-panel was assumed to be due to the synchronized (or coupled) elongation of the facing yarns in the frontal layers and those in the following rear layers during the impact. Analysis was carried out, by adapting the method of accumulating successive line segments, to present the energy dissipation route of each panel during the impact.</p>

<p>Through history, humans have used various types of soft body armor to protect themselves from injury in combat such as animal skin, chain mail, silk and nylon, etc. Nowadays, the required characteristics for fabrics used as soft body armor, such as Kevlar®, Twaron®, Spectra® and Dyneema® are high tenacity, light weight, flexibility, and thinness. Although much progress has been made in improving the functionalities of body armor, they still adversely affect the comfort and mobility of the wearer. Currently used body armors, particularly those for military use, are still too heavy, limiting the agility and mobility of the wearer and eventually leading to increased casualties. Therefore, the demand for substantial improvement in the performance-to-weight ratio of body armor as well as the performance-to-thickness ratio is very high.</p>
<p>To improve the performance of soft body armor, many researchers have been studying the relationship between the material/fabrication properties and the protective properties of the armor. Basic factors that affect the protective performance of multilayer textile packages are now known to be the properties of the constituent fibers (which include: the number of filaments comprising a yarn, linear density, maximum force and elongation, and stiffness modulus),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517511420753">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517511420753">2</xref></sup> the type of weave, fabric areal density, number of fabric plies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0040517511420753">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0040517511420753">4</xref></sup> their interconnection technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517511420753">5</xref></sup> and fabric boundary conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0040517511420753">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517511420753">7</xref></sup> As well as these factors, projectile material properties, projectile shape and mass,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517511420753">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517511420753">10</xref></sup> impact velocity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517511420753">11</xref></sup> and obliquity, and finally the characteristics of interfacial friction within the impact system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517511420753">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0040517511420753">13</xref></sup> are also known to affect the protective performance.</p>
<p>By applying nanotechnology to soldier warfare systems, the performance and well-being of the soldiers, that is, their mobility, survivability, stealth, fighting power, lethality, intelligence and repair ability can be enhanced. Lee et al. from the US Army Research Laboratory and the University of Delaware have developed a soft body armor based on fabrics using nanomaterial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517511420753">14</xref></sup> They used concentrated colloidal suspensions of silica nanoparticles dispersed in a liquid medium, which show shear thickening behavior above the critical shear rate, to treat Kevlar fabric. They reported that Kevlar fabric impregnated with this shear thickening fluid (STF) offers low velocity ballistic performance equivalent to that of neat Kevlar fabric on an areal density basis, and a superior performance to neat Kevlar fabric on a layer quantity basis.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the ballistic performance of Kevlar fabrics impregnated with STF against 9 mm bullets at 436 m/s, as well as the effect of laminating sequence in hybrid multilayer panels. Analysis, adapting the method of accumulating successive line segments, was also introduced to present the energy dissipation during the impact.</p>

<p>The STF was composed of silica particles in polyethylene glycol medium. The silica sol used in this study was composed of 30 wt% SiO<sub>2</sub> and 70 wt% methanol, and the nominal average diameter of the silica particles was 45 nm. Ethylene glycol is known to be an index matching solvent of silica particles. In this study, polyethylene glycol (MW 200) was selected as a dispersant because it is less volatile than ethylene glycol and does not solidify at low temperatures. Methanol, which has a low boiling point, was used as a diluent to drop the viscosity of STF and thereby to facilitate the penetration of STF into the Kevlar fabrics, and at the same time to minimize the evaporation of the dispersant during the drying process which was necessary to eliminate the diluent.</p>
<p>Plain woven Kevlar KM-2 600 denier 1027 style with an areal density of 149 g/m<sup>2</sup> in dried state was used. The producer's specifications of Kevlar KM-2 600 denier yarn and 1027 style fabric are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0040517511420753">Table 1</xref>. The fabric was cut into square specimens of 38 cm × 38 cm using a CO<sub>2</sub> laser cutter.

<sec id="sec4-0040517511420753"><title>STF preparation and impregnation</title>
<p>For rheological analysis of the STFs, the silica sol was mixed with polyethylene glycol to give final compositions of 65, 68 and 70 wt% silica in STF. For the yarn pullout test, STFs with 65, 67.5, 68 and 69 wt% silica were prepared and impregnated into Kevlar fabric. Kevlar fabric impregnated with STF of 68 wt% silica was used for the tensile test of a single yarn in the fabric, as well as the ballistic impact test. The STF add-on on Kevlar fabric was managed by controlling the amount of the diluents; either by condensing or adding methanol. Neat Kevlar fabric was immersed into the diluted STF dispersion, squeezed with a pressure of 10 kg/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0040517511420753">2</xref></sup> for 10 seconds and then dried at 65°C until the weight of the specimen reached a constant value.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0040517511420753"><title>Rheological test</title>
<p>Rheological measurements were carried out in steady-shear rate sweep mode at 25°C using a controlled stress rheometer (AR 2000, TA Instruments). A cone with 1° angle and 20 mm diameter was used. A pre-shear of 0.1 s<sup>−1</sup> for 1 min was applied prior to the actual measurement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0040517511420753"><title>Yarn pullout test and tensile test</title>
<p>The pullout force of a single yarn was measured using a universal testing machine (Instron 5543) at pullout rates of 10–1000 mm/min. Using a CO<sub>2</sub> laser cutter, the specimens were cut into 50 mm × 220 mm rectangles and a 5 mm transverse cut was made 100 mm apart from the upper clamped position as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0040517511420753">Figure 1</xref>. The tensile behavior of a single yarn in the fabric of the same gauge length was also investigated at the rate of 1000 mm/min.

<sec id="sec7-0040517511420753"><title>Ballistic impact test</title>
<p>The target panel (38 cm × 38 cm) was mounted on a backing material fixture (50 cm × 50 cm) that was filled with conditioned oil-based clay (Roma Plastilina #1) of 13 cm thickness and backed with removable plywood. To validate the test results, both pre- and post-drop tests were conducted on the conditioned clay with a 1.043 kg steel sphere at the height of 2 m (NIJ Standard−0101.04). Just after the drop test, each target panel was held to be in full contact with the backing material and secured to the backing material fixture using mounting straps. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0040517511420753">Figure 2</xref> shows the schematic layout of the firing site for the test. A 9 mm bullet (FMJ RN, 8.0 g) described in NIJ Standard-0101.04 (threat level III-A) was used as the impactor and the target measured velocity for backface signature (BFS) measurement was around 436 m/s. Measurement of the ballistic limit (V<sub>50</sub>) was conducted as described in NIJ Standard−0101.06. The shot location for both BFS and V<sub>50</sub> measurements were over 8 cm away from the edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517511420753">Figure 3</xref>).

<p>To investigate the effect of laminating sequence, three types of panels were prepared; an all neat 32 ply panel (N-panel), and two 29 ply hybrid panels of 15 ply STF impregnated Kevlar and 14 ply neat Kevlar, where the neat plies were either placed in the front of the panel (N/S-panel) or the back of the panel (S/N-panel). All three types of panels were either unstitched or stitched together. The stitched panels were cross-diagonally stitched in a specified interval using a high tenacity nylon/cotton spun blend yarn. The stitched N-panel was prepared by stitching 18 plies (frontal) and 14 plies (rear) separately, in 7.62 cm stitch intervals, and then interconnecting the two parts at the four corners. The stitched S/N-panel was prepared by stitching 15 plies of STF impregnated Kevlar (frontal) together and 14 plies of neat Kevlar (rear) together, respectively, in 7.62 cm stitch intervals, and then interconnecting the two parts at the four corners. The stitched N/S-panel was prepared likewise but with 5.08 cm stitch intervals, and the neat Kevlar layer was placed in front of the STF treated layer. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517511420753">Figure 3</xref> shows the shot location within the target, the interconnection of the layers and stitch pattern.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517511420753">Figure 4</xref> shows the change in viscosity and shear stress of the STFs with increasing shear rate. The onset of shear thickening for STFs with 65, 68 and 70 wt% silica was exhibited at the shear rates of around 78.4, 188.7 and 343 s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, which are much lower than the reported shear rate of a bullet (&gt;10<sup>5 </sup>s<sup>−1</sup>). In other words, shear thickening will take place as soon as the bullet comes in contact with a target panel containing STF impregnated fabrics. As the content of silica nanoparticles in polyethylene glycol was increased, typical shear thickening behavior was observed, that is, STF with higher silica content gave lower onset values of shear rate.

</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0040517511420753"><title>Pullout and elongation of a single yarn in the fabric</title>
<p>Single yarn pullout test specimens were prepared with neat Kevlar fabric and STF impregnated Kevlar fabric with 22 and 23% owf (on the weight of fabric) add-on. The silica content of the STFs used was 65, 67.5, 68 and 69 wt%. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0040517511420753">Figure 5</xref>, the maximum pullout force of a single yarn in the STF impregnated fabrics increased as the pullout rate increased. On the other hand, the pullout force of a single yarn in the neat fabric showed no change regardless of the pullout rate. The maximum pullout force of a single yarn in STF treated fabrics exhibited a sudden increase at a critical pullout rate. This critical pullout rate decreased with the increase of silica content in the STF, coinciding with the results from the prior rheological test where the shear thickening onset values decreased with increased silica content. The enhancement of maximum pullout forces of STF treated fabrics compared to neat Kevlar at pullout rates below the critical pullout rate is due to the occupation of free volume within the fabric by STF, not the shear thickening effect. Although the maximum pullout force of STF impregnated specimens at the highest pullout rate, 1000 mm/min, increased with the increase of silica content, STF with 69 wt% silica content showed a lower maximum pullout force than that of STFwith 68 wt% silica content. This result needs to be further examined to clarify the cause for this decrease.
<fig id="fig5-0040517511420753" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Effect of particle content in STF and pullout rate on maximum pullout force (particle fraction 65–69 wt%, pullout rate of 10–1000 mm/min).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517511420753-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517511420753">Figure 6</xref> shows the effect of STF add-on on the maximum pullout force. The shear thickening effect was clearly observed in samples with 10 and 23% owf add-on. On the other hand, the behavior of samples with 5% owf add-on seems to be dominated by the effect of decreased free volume within the fabric by STF rather than the shear thickening effect of STF. Since the silica content within the STF was the same for all the samples, the critical pullout rates of the samples were all identical. Given that the maximum pullout force was the largest with 68 wt% silica content STF with an add-on of approximately 20% owf, all STF treated fabrics used in the following experiments were treated in this condition.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517511420753">Figure 7</xref> shows the single yarn tensile test results of neat and STF impregnated fabrics in both the warp and weft directions. A single yarn in a fabric, having a gauge length of 100 mm, was elongated at the rate of 1000 mm/min with a primary load of 0.5 % (0.75 N/yarn) of its tenacity. As shown in the figure, the warp has a slightly higher crimp ratio than the weft, both in the neat and STF treated fabrics. The existence of crimp delays the linear relationship between load and elongation in the tensile test of a single yarn in a fabric, and the extent of the delay is related to the crimp ratio. Due to the opening motion of warp and the insertion of a straightened weft during the weaving process, the warp generally has a higher crimp ratio. Although the as received 1027 style fabric has very low warp and weft crimp values (1.67 and 1.36 %, respectively), the average of the two corresponds to 40 % of the strain to failure value (3.8 %) of KM-2 Kevlar 600 denier yarn. The crimp effect of a single yarn in the STF impregnated fabric was smaller than that in the neat fabric due to the increased friction at crossover points and occupation of free volume by STF within the fabric.

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0040517511420753">Figure 8</xref>, the N-panel showed the largest BFS value, and the N/S-panel showed the smallest. In case of the N-panel, it is obvious that stitching significantly lowered the BFS, but at the expense of the flexibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0040517511420753">5</xref></sup> Stitching of S/N- and N/S-panels did not show significant decreases in BFS value. From this result, one can conclude that stitching is unnecessary for hybrid panels containing STF impregnated Kevlar fabrics, and as a result, production of a thinner and more flexible panel is possible.

<p>As the average number of perforated layers of stitched N-panel was seven and the total number of laminated plies was 32, the stitched N-panel had the lowest perforation ratio.

<p>The bullet expansion value of each panel is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0040517511420753">Figure 10</xref>. The bullet expansion value is the diameter of the expanded bullet after the impact. Unstitched hybrid panels with STF impregnated fabrics were more effective for bullet expansion than the unstitched N-panel, with the N/S-panel showing higher values than the S/N-panel.

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0040517511420753">Figure 11</xref>, on average, the perforation ratio of the S/N panels were the highest, although S/N-panels showed lower BFS values at a perforation ratio of 27–28%. It is presumed that in the early stages of impact, the S/N-panel dissipates the impact energy mainly through tensile dissipation, and therefore, more layers of the panel have been perforated compared to the other panels.

<p>The relationship between perforation ratio and bullet expansion of each panel is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0040517511420753">Figure 12</xref>. Although much scatter exists in the data, the perforation ratios of S/N-panels were considerably higher than those of the others. On the other hand, N/S-panels were more resistant to perforation and at the same time brought about more bullet expansion than S/N-panels. With increased bullet expansion, a higher fraction of impact energy was presumed to be dissipated through the tensile dissipation route due to the increased number of facing yarns in each layer, thus, decreasing the perforation ratio. The increase in the number of survived layers will again favor the tensile dissipation route rather than the kinetic dissipation route.

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0040517511420753">Table 4</xref>, the hybridization with STF impregnated layers (S/N- and N/S-) resulted in decreases in both bullet expansion and BFS values compared to the N-panel, where the N/S-panel showed a more significant difference.

<sec id="sec14-0040517511420753"><title>Analysis of energy dissipation</title>
<p>From the experimental results given above, the energy dissipated by each panel was analyzed.</p>
<p>It is assumed that the given impact energy is dissipated through two routes: one, the kinetic dissipation (<italic>E<sub>K</sub></italic>) route in which some portion of the impact energy is transferred to the backing material resulting in backface deformation; and two, the tensile dissipation (<italic>E<sub>T</sub></italic>) route in which the impact energy directly elongates and/or breaks the facing yarns. A failure mechanism in a ballistic event includes the combined effect of tension, compression, and shear. The main parameters concerning such failure mechanisms are the microstructure of the ballistic material, the areal density of the ballistic panel (flexural rigidity), the frictional force on crossover points (in-plane stress localization) and the type of bullet (weight, frangibility, nose shape and velocity). In our study, the same type of ballistic material without much variation in areal density, and the same type of frangible bullet at the same velocity were used. And, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0040517511420753">Figure 14</xref>, elongation failure was confirmed to be dominant over shear failure even in the frontal layers. So approximating the tensile dissipation to a simple elongation-breakage is possible.
<fig id="fig14-0040517511420753" position="float"><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><p>A photograph of strained yarns in the 1st layer of an impacted 1027 style fabric panel.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517511420753-fig14.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>First, the possible maximum amount of tensile dissipation of each panel was estimated. For this estimation, we need to know the number of single yarns facing a bullet, and the gauge length and the stress distribution of a single yarn.</p>
<p>The number of yarns facing a bullet is mainly related to the initial diameter and following expansion of the bullet. The gauge length of a single yarn is related to the contact time between the bullet and each layer (i.e.the product of longitudinal wave velocity and contact time equals the gauge length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0040517511420753">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517511420753">16</xref></sup>), and its maximum value will be the distance between the shot location and the edge of the panel (shot-to-edge distance). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0040517511420753">Figure 14</xref> shows pullout marks at the edges of a frontal layer (circled area), which supports the assumption that the 1<sup>st</sup> layer and all the following layers have the same gauge length that is equal to the shot-to-edge distance in this case.</p>
<p>The stress distribution of a single yarn in a fabric was determined as follows. From the single yarn pullout data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0040517511420753">Figure 6</xref>), we obtained the frictional force acting on each crossover point of a single yarn in a fabric, which is the ratio of the maximum pullout force to the number of crossover points. The stress distribution by frictional forces can be determined using the method shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0040517511420753">Figure 15</xref>. The stress distribution will affect the total elongation of a single yarn in fabric whether neat or STF impregnated. The total elongation of a single yarn in a fabric can be calculated as follows (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0040517511420753">equation 4</xref>).
<disp-formula id="disp-formula4-0040517511420753"><label>(4)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517511420753-eq4.tif"/></disp-formula>
where, <italic>Δl<sub>i</sub></italic> is the displacement of the <italic>i</italic>th interval from the impact point; <italic>F<sub>i</sub></italic> is the elongational force acting on the <italic>i</italic>th interval; <italic>l<sub>i</sub></italic> is the length of the <italic>i</italic>th interval, which is thespacing between adjacent parallel yarns and 0.9 mm for the fabric (constant); <italic>E</italic> is Young's modulus of the yarn (constant).

<p>Then, the apparent modulus of a single yarn can be defined as <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-0040517511420753">equation 5</xref>.
<disp-formula id="disp-formula5-0040517511420753"><label>(5)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517511420753-eq5.tif"/></disp-formula>
where, <italic>E<sub>apparent</sub></italic> is the apparent modulus of a single yarn in a fabric, <italic>BS</italic> is the breaking strength of a single yarn (constant), <italic>GL</italic> is the gauge length of the elongational event; <italic>Δl<sub>i</sub></italic> is the displacement of the <italic>i</italic>th interval from the impact point; <italic>∑Δl<sub>i</sub></italic> is the total elongation of a single yarn in a fabric</p>
<p>Since a single yarn in a STF treated fabric will be subjected to less elongation compared to that in a neat fabric, the apparent modulus of a single yarn in a STF treated fabric would be higher than that of a single yarn in a neat fabric. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0040517511420753">Figure 16</xref> shows the relative amount of increase in the apparent modulus of a single yarn within a fabric by STF treatment, which increases with the gauge length. From this figure, we could estimate the relative amount of increase in the apparent modulus of a single yarn to be around 10% when the shot-to-edge distance is 125 mm.

<p>The following describes how we combined the data from this study to calculate the possible maximum tensile dissipation of a multilayer panel. Chocron et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517511420753">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517511420753">18</xref></sup> has experimentally shown that the local strain in the yarn depends on the impact velocity while it is much less dependent on the layer number. They have also shown that the initiation of an elongational event at early time of impact occurs at a regular interval of time, which is the time needed for the compression wave created by the bullet to reach the adjacent layer. Such time is thought to be related to the thickness of a single layer.</p>
<p>Thus, it is possible to combine each layer in a multilayer panel by drawing successive line segments which represent the load-displacement of yarns in each layer at an interval of the thickness of each layer. Since the apparent modulus of the yarn is larger in STF impregnated fabrics, the line segments for single yarns in STF impregnated fabrics should have a steeper slope than those for yarns in a neat fabric. Simplified examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0040517511420753">Figure 17</xref>, where the dashed line segments represent the elongation of all facing yarns in each layer of neat fabric, and the solid line segments represent that in STF impregnated fabric. The nose shape of the bullet was not considered here to avoid the complexity of the calculation, (i.e. the elongations of each facing yarn in a single layer were assumed to occur simultaneously). The interval between each successive line segment is the thickness of a compressed single layer within the panel, which would be slightly thinner than the nominal thickness. The starting position of the first line segment reflects the crimp of the yarn in a fabric, which is up to 40% of the yarn's strain to failure for neat fabric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0040517511420753">Figure 7</xref>). So the starting point of the S/N-panel comes before the N-panel since a single yarn in the STF impregnated fabric has a lower apparent crimp ratio. The width of each sloped line segment equals to the product of the gauge length and the strain to failure, (i.e. elongation). The height of each line segment equals the sum of breaking strength of all facing yarns in a single layer, and the sum of the height of each line segment at a certain point of the <italic>x</italic>-axis is equal to the total tension of yarns facing the bullet at the corresponding point of time under an assumption of no bullet expansion.
<fig id="fig17-0040517511420753" position="float"><label>Figure 17.</label><caption><p>Representation of the load-elongation curves of the facing yarns in multilayered N-, S/N- and N/S-panels excluding the effect of bullet expansion.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517511420753-fig17.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Since a 9 mm FMJ bullet is a frangible one, the tension required to expand the bullet was also considered. The pressure acting on a bullet to expand it can be determined by the tension and the conical angle (or pyramidal angle). Chocron et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0040517511420753">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0040517511420753">18</xref></sup> has reported that the semi-angle of the pyramid at the apex was constant (65°–70°) within a short time (∼100 µs) of impact, so we assumed the conical angle to be 65° in our calculation. The yield stress of bullet compression of the bullet was determined to be 0.36 GPa, which showed good agreement with the bullet expansion data. Since the initial cross-sectional area of the bullet is 6.36×10<sup>−5</sup> m<sup>2</sup> and the pressure necessary to expand the bullet should be 22.9 kN, the minimum tension (2 T in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0040517511420753">Figure 18</xref>) to initiate the expansion of the bullet should be around 27.1 kN. For each step of tension increment, the expanded cross-sectional area of the bullet was calculated under an arbitrary fixed value of yield stress for bullet compression, and the number of facing yarns in the survived layers was accordingly increased to the number corresponding to the expanded diameter of the bullet. The bullet did not expand any further after a certain point, where the pressure acting on the bullet fell below the determined yield stress. Among the arbitrary values of yield stress for bullet compression used in prior calculations, 0.36 GPa was the best match for the experimental results.
<fig id="fig18-0040517511420753" position="float"><label>Figure 18.</label><caption><p>A schematic showing the relationship between the tension and pressure acting on a bullet.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517511420753-fig18.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Thus, the possible maximum tensile dissipation of each multilayer panel was calculated with the following assumptions: 125 mm gauge length, 10% increase in tensile modulus by STF, 0.15 mm compressed thickness (one layer), 1.6% warp and 1.3% weft crimp ratio, 3.8% strain to failure, and 160 N/yarn breaking strength. If the N-panel is represented as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0040517511420753">Figure 17</xref>, there will be 32 dotted lines for the warp and 32 dotted lines for the weft where each line segment denotes the initial 10 yarns (i.e. 10 yarns/9 mm). Due to the difference in crimp ratio, the starting positions of the line willdiffer slightly. Each dotted line will have a maximum<italic>y</italic>-value of 3200 N (i.e. 10 yarns × 160 N/yarn × 2) and a maximum displacement of 4.75 mm (i.e. 125 mm × 0.038). The S/N- and N/S-panels that consist of 29 layers can be represented with 15 solid lines for each warp and weft in the STF treated layers and 14 dotted lines for each warp and weft in the neat layers, and the solid and dotted lines will be in reverse position in the S/N- and N/S-panels. The increase in the apparent modulus of a single yarn by STF treatment (solid line) will lead to a maximum displacement 10% lower than the above value of 4.75 mm. If the bullet hits the center of each yarn, the tension of both sides of the yarn will work as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0040517511420753">Figure 18</xref>. At an increased tension value at which the bullet begins to expand, the number of facing yarns increases with bullet expansion.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0040517511420753">Figure 19</xref> shows the tension-displacement curve of each panel. The down arrows in the figure indicate the boundary between the perforated (failed) layers and layers that survived in each panel, which were obtained from the experimental results. Each local peak in a curve indicates the failure of all facing warp or weft yarns in a single layer. An earlier onset of both bullet expansion and perforation of frontal layers were observed with the S/N-panel, while the N/S-panel showed the highest maximum tension value.

<p>If each curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0040517511420753">Figure 19</xref> is divided into two parts at the down arrow, the area under the left curve is equal to the tensile dissipation (<italic>E<sub>T</sub><sub>,</sub><sub>L</sub></italic>) when the bullet has just stopped perforation; and the area under the right curve is equal to the maximum possible tensile dissipation (<italic>E<sub>T</sub><sub>,</sub><sub>R</sub><sub>,</sub><sub>max</sub></italic>) by the surviving layers from the time that no further perforation occurred.</p>
<p>To calculate the total tensile dissipation of each panel at a given impact energy (<italic>IE</italic>), the kinetic dissipation (<italic>E<sub>K</sub></italic>) of each panel should be considered as well. We have found that the kinetic dissipation for a trauma depth of 32 mm and 44 mm corresponds to 50 J and 90 J, respectively. The details will be described in part II of this manuscript.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-0040517511420753">Figure 20</xref>, which is the integrated area under each curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0040517511420753">Figure 19</xref>, shows the tensile dissipation and kinetic dissipation of each panel. Under the fixed impact energy value of 774.4 J (at 440 m/s), the kinetic dissipation of N-, S/N- and N/S-panel was 81.5, 57.0 and 52.5 J, respectively, with which we can calculate the total tensile dissipation (<italic>E<sub>T</sub></italic>) of each panel as approximately 692.9, 714.7 and 721.9 J, respectively.
<fig id="fig20-0040517511420753" position="float"><label>Figure 20.</label><caption><p>Presumed energy dissipation curves of the panels from the ballistic experiment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0040517511420753-fig20.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>With the results from above, it is possible to calculate the tensile dissipation of the post-failure region (<italic>E<sub>T</sub><sub>,</sub><sub>R</sub> = IE – E<sub>K</sub></italic> <italic>– E<sub>T,</sub> <sub>L</sub></italic>). The tensile dissipation at the post-failure region (<italic>E<sub>T</sub><sub>,</sub><sub>R</sub></italic>) is assumed to be the area of the triangles shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0040517511420753">Figure 19</xref>. The height of the triangle will be just below the tension value at the down arrow, so the length of the base line can be determined. As shown in the figure, the hypotenuse of the triangle does not exceed the possible maximum tension value, thus the survived layers did not fail and the right end of the triangle base line does not exceed the displacement limit.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-0040517511420753">Figure 20</xref>, the energy dissipation through kinetic dissipation (<italic>E<sub>K</sub></italic>) and tensile dissipation (<italic>E<sub>T</sub><sub>,</sub><sub>L</sub></italic> and <italic>E<sub>T</sub><sub>,</sub><sub>R</sub></italic>) by each panel is marked with arrows. The right end of each curve is not the actual tensile dissipation (<italic>E<sub>T</sub></italic>), but a fit to the tensile dissipation (<italic>E<sub>T</sub><sub>,</sub><sub>max</sub></italic>) of each panel at their ballistic limit. The possible maximum tensile dissipation of the S/N-panel was calculated, which value was 40.7 J lower than the impact energy. If the maximum kinetic dissipation (<italic>E<sub>K</sub><sub>,</sub><sub>max</sub></italic>), which is assumed to be around 100 J with a BFS value of 55 mm, is added to the calculation result, the total energy will exceed the impact energy and will equal the energy of a bullet at its ballistic limit.</p>
<p>The N/S-panel gave the best protective performance against a ballistic impact owing to the optimum arrangement of the neat and STF impregnated layers. At a certain point early on in the impact, the ‘highly-elongated/high-tensioned’ facing yarns within the neat frontal layers coupled efficiently with the ‘less-elongated/high-tensioned’ facing yarns within the STF impregnated rear layers, and such synchronization resulted in a superior ballistic protection.</p>
<p>This method of analysis, though it is conceptual, can be partly supported by the fact that unidirectional (UD) fabrics are generally more effective in expanding a frangible bullet than woven fabrics. The ratio of areal density to thickness is related to how closely the fibers or yarns are packed together. The theoretical packing density of yarns in a UD fabric is over 75 vol% (tetragonal packing), while that in a woven fabric is less than 55 vol%. So a UD fabric will have smaller intervals between adjacent line segments if modeled as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0040517511420753">Figure 17</xref>, which will bring about a similar result to our experiment. Our additionalwork with UD/woven hybrid panels against a .44Magnum SJHP gave similar results in terms of laminating sequence.</p>
<p>Note that inserting or eliminating a few layers to or from each panel can bring about very different results, which are occasionally observed in other studies and can be induced from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0040517511420753">Figure 19</xref>, especially when the areal density of a panel is designed to have a ballistic limit very close to the test velocity of BFS.</p>

<p>The impregnation of STF to a fabric increases the frictional force of a single yarn in the fabric which consequently increases the apparent modulus of the yarn. The laminating sequence was found to be a very important factor in improving the protective performance of STF impregnated fabric hybrid multilayer panels, which affected not only the BFS value but also the perforation ratio (or ballistic limit) and bullet expansion. The superior ballistic performance of the N/S-panel was assumed to be caused by the synchronized elongation of the facing yarns in the frontal layers and those in the following rear layers during the impact. Analysis, adapting the method of accumulating successive line segments, successfully presented the energy dissipation route of each panel during the impact of a high speed bullet.</p>
