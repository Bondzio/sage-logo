<p>Cetuximab is a chimeric IgG<sub>1</sub> monoclonal antibody, which competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor by specifically binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212462440">1</xref></sup> EGFR is a transmembrane glycoprotein that regulates cellular growth and survival and is overexpressed or mutated in many tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212462440">2</xref></sup> Cetuximab binds to the extracellular domain of EGFR and prevents natural ligands of EGFR such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) from binding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212462440">3</xref></sup> This action blocks receptor-dependent signal transduction pathways such as anti-apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212462440">3</xref></sup> Cetuximab causes internalization and downregulation of EGFR, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and increased efficacy of radiation and chemotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212462440">3</xref></sup> Presently cetuximab is FDA approved for EGFR-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer, as a single agent after failure of both irinotecan- and oxaliplatin-based regimens or in patients who are intolerant to irinotecan-based regimens; also in combination with irinotecan in metastatic colorectal cancer in patients who are refractory to irinotecan-based chemotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212462440">1</xref></sup> Cetuximab is also FDA approved in head and neck cancer for locally or regionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma in combination with radiation, in recurrent locoregional or metastatic head and neck cancer in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, or as a single agent in recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma after progression after platinum-based chemotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212462440">1</xref></sup> It is administered initially with a loading dose of 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV given over 2 h followed by 250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV given over 1 h weekly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212462440">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The most common adverse reactions to cetuximab are an acne-like rash, diarrhea, and hypomagnesemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212462440">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212462440">4</xref></sup> Rare but serious reactions to cetuximab are hypersensitivity reactions that can result in anaphylaxis. Nationally, the incidence of cetuximab hypersensitivity infusion reactions (HIRs) is 3%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212462440">1</xref></sup> However, there is a reported increased incidence in the middle and southeastern United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212462440">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212462440"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212462440"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212462440">8</xref></sup> O’Neil and colleagues report a 22% rate of grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated in North Carolina and Tennessee, which is similar to other retrospective studies performed in this geographical area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212462440">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212462440"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212462440"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212462440">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>HIRs can have substantial morbidity for patients, resulting in dose delay, permanent discontinuation of cetuximab, the need for emergency services, or hospitalization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212462440">9</xref></sup> The incidence of infusion reactions requiring medical intervention was also found to be higher than rates reported in clinical trials, and the economic cost is substantial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078155212462440">11</xref></sup> Foley and colleagues reported a mean adjusted cost of US$13,863 for cetuximab administrations that caused an HIR requiring an ER visit or hospitalization and US$6280 for an HIR that was managed in the outpatient setting; this is in comparison to $4555 for cetuximab administration without an HIR. Death has also resulted from cetuximab-induced hypersensitivity reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212462440">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155212462440">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Though the exact reason is unknown, an IgE antibody specific for galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose has been identified as a potential cause of hypersensitivity reaction in the middle and southeastern United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212462440">5</xref></sup> Galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose is an oligosaccharide found in both of the Fab portions of the heavy chains of cetuximab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212462440">5</xref></sup> In a retrospective study conducted by Chung et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212462440">5</xref></sup> the presence of the IgE antibody correlated well with patients that had reacted during a cetuximab infusion.</p>
<p>Other possible risk factors identified in retrospective studies include tumor type and prior history of atopic allergy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212462440">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212462440">8</xref></sup> In these studies non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer have trended towards increased hypersensitivity reactions when compared to other tumor types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212462440">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212462440">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the true incidence is unknown, the healthcare staff at the Oklahoma University Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma has observed a higher incidence of HIRs than the national average. This study was undertaken to report the reaction rate at our center and compare it to national trends, as well as identify potential risk factors for developing HIRs.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1078155212462440" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1078155212462440"><title>Study design and patient selection</title>
<p>A retrospective chart review was conducted on all patients that received cetuximab from 1 July 2005 to 1 August 2010 at the oncology or gynecology/oncology outpatient clinics of the Oklahoma University Health Sciences Center. The primary objective of the study was to estimate the incidence of grade 3 or 4 HIRs after the administration of cetuximab. The secondary objective was to determine risk factors for developing HIRs. Inclusion criteria included administration of at least one dose of cetuximab. Exclusion criteria included pediatric patients, pregnant patients, or patients with incomplete records. Patients were identified through billing reports, study protocols, and pharmacy records. Documentation of hypersensitivity reaction, demographic information, tumor type, treatment regimen, premedications received (if any), comorbidities, and smoking status were obtained from the patient charts. Hypersensitivity reactions were graded retrospectively based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155212462440">12</xref></sup> The clinic nurses follow a policy in which they must report every reaction that occurs and document these reactions in the patient's medical record.</p>
<p>Grade 3 and 4 reactions were defined as severe HIRs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078155212462440">12</xref></sup> Premedications were defined as the documentation in the patients’ chart as receiving one of the following before the administration of cetuximab: antihistamine, steroid, H-2 receptor antagonist, or bronchodilator. HIRs were documented in the patients’ charts as well as treatment, and ER or hospital admission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1078155212462440"><title>Statistical methods</title>
<p>Independent associations with severe HIRs and each predictor variable were assessed using the Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. A manual, reverse step-wise Poisson regression analysis was performed on all factors with a bivariate analysis alpha value ≤ 0.2 and any logical two-way interaction. Alpha was set at 0.05 for final model inclusion. Confounding was assessed by observing parameter estimates before and after a factor was removed from the model. A factor was considered confounding if a 15% change was observed in any significant parameter estimate when removed from the model (none were observed in this study). Generalized estimating equations (GEE) estimation was used to adjust for potential overdispersion of the Poisson regression model.</p>
<p>An a priori, two-sided alpha level of 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses. SAS v9.2 was used for all analyses.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1078155212462440" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>One hundred and seventy patients were identified. Seventeen patients were excluded due to incomplete records (i.e. no of documentation of cetuximab administration). A total of 153 patients were included in the analysis, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078155212462440">Table 1</xref> details the demographic information. The majority of patients either had a head and neck tumor (50.3%) or a cervical tumor (37.2%). Other tumor types included colorectal, non-small cell lung, and ovarian cancer. All patients received diphenhydramine as a premedication, the majority of patients received a steroid (87.5%), and fewer patients received an H-2 receptor antagonist (33.3%) or a bronchodilator (15%). Forty-seven patients received a test dose given prior to chemotherapy. The test dose varied and was either 20 mg IV or 100 mg IV prior to receiving cetuximab.

<p>Out of the 47 patients that received a test dose, 10 patients experienced a severe HIR, in which 8 out of 10 patients reacted on the test dose and 2 out of 10 patients reacted with the subsequent full dose.</p>
<p>The multivariate analysis identified risk factors with cetuximab HIRs to be male gender RR = 3.87, 95% CI (1.35–11.07), <italic>p</italic> = 0.0117, and current smokers RR = 3.93, 95% CI (1.45–10.08), <italic>p</italic> = 0.0066.</p>

<p>The overall incidence of 12.4%, found in this study, is higher than the national average of 3%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212462440">1</xref></sup> The incidence of HIRs in cervical cancer was lower than head and neck cancer and other malignancies; however, when comparing HIRs of patients with cervical to only other female patients, regardless of disease, this incidence is not significant. The incidence of HIRs with cetuximab in patients with a gynecologic malignancy has not previously been reported. Statistical analysis has identified female gender as a potential important protective risk factor, rather than cervical cancer. For females, the incidence proportion of HIRs is 5% when compared to males it is 20.55%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0036 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078155212462440">Table 2</xref>). Reasons for this decreased rate in females require further investigation.</p>
<p>Premedications did not seem to play a protective role against severe HIRs. This is difficult to assess in our study because all patients received diphenhydramine, and the majority of patients received a steroid. The addition of an H2-receptor antagonist or bronchodilator did not seem to change the incidence of severe HIRs significantly; however, these numbers are small, and other retrospective studies report no difference in the incidence of severe HIRs with different premedication regimens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212462440">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212462440">8</xref></sup> To date there has been no prospective study comparing different premedication regimens. The package insert only recommends diphenhydramine;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212462440">1</xref></sup> however, it is common to add a steroid to the regimen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212462440">8</xref></sup> A post hoc analysis from the Mabel study has reported benefit of reduced infusion reactions with a combination of diphenhydramine and a corticosteroid.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078155212462440">13</xref></sup> Other commonly used premedications include a bronchodialtor and an H2 receptor antagonist, although the benefit has not been proven to our knowledge.</p>
<p>Current smokers had a significantly higher rate of HIRs versus nonsmokers or former smokers. O’Neil and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212462440">8</xref></sup> in their retrospective chart review of cetuximab-induced HIRs found a trend in increased incidence of HIRs in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. It was suggested that this could possibly be due to an exposure to tobacco byproducts leading to presensitization to cetuximab. However, in our study we found that former smokers had a non-significant decrease in the incidence of severe HIRs.</p>
<p>The majority of patients that received a test dose that experienced a severe HIR, did react on the test dose (8 out of 10 patients). In a previous retrospective study, a test dose did result in 87% cost savings, by discontinuing the full dose of cetuximab before it was prepared, although our study did not analyze the cost-effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212462440">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Male gender and being a current smoker increases the risk of severe HIRs by nearly 4 fold. Further investigation is needed to further elucidate why male gender and current smokers have an increased risk for severe HIRs. Smoking could elicit a more severe HIR due to decreased lung function.</p>
<p>Currently it is unknown if the increase in HIRs in Oklahoma is due to an IgE antibody specific for galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, which has previously been reported by Chung et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212462440">5</xref></sup> An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed to detect the IgE antibodies directed at cetuximab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078155212462440">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study is consistent with an increased incidence of HIRs in the middle and southern United States. It appears from our study male gender and current smokers are important potential risk factors for severe HIRs. This study is limited by its retrospective design and small sample of patients, therefore prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.</p>
