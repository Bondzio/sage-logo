<title>Patient Report</title>
<p>A previously healthy 13-year-old boy was transferred from an outside hospital with 2 weeks of abdominal pain and 4 days of fever to 103°F. His pain, localized to the right upper quadrant, was associated with nausea and vomiting. Review of systems revealed anorexia that had resolved prior to presentation and jaundice. Initially, he was seen and diagnosed at an urgent care center with viral gastroenteritis and encouraged to drink extra clear fluids. Because symptoms persisted, he was seen at his primary care physician’s office where he was noted to be mildly dehydrated. His initial lab evaluation demonstrated mildly elevated liver enzymes, direct hyperbilirubinemia, and leukocytosis. He was admitted to an outside hospital where symptoms continued for 48 hours at which time an abdominal ultrasound revealed a mass on his liver. He was transferred to our facility for infectious disease consultation and further management.</p>
<p>The patient’s past medical and surgical history was unremarkable. He was very active in the 4-H organization both locally and nationally and had almost daily contact with farm animals. He had 30 rabbits at home, one of which bit him a week before the onset of this illness. He was responsible for the care of pigs and cows at his local 4-H farm but also had contact with sheep and goats.</p>
<p>At transfer his temperature was 99.1°F, pulse was 106 beats/min, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, and blood pressure 121/62 mm Hg. He was in no distress. Mild scleral and sublingual icterus were noted. Examination revealed mild right upper quadrant tenderness without distension or guarding and a negative Murphy’s sign. The edge of the liver was 1 to 2 cm below the costal margin, with no splenomegaly. The remainder of his examination was normal.</p>
<p>Initial laboratory studies included a white blood cell count of 23 400/µL (normal 7800-13 500/µL), platelet count of 695 000/µL (150-350 000/µL), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 102 mm/h (0-10 mm/h). Other levels were as follows: alanine aminotransferase, 117 U/L (10-55 U/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 92 U/L (15-40 U/L); lactate dehydrogenase, 282 U/L (100-190 U/L); total bilirubin, 1.7 mg/dL (&lt;1.5 mg/dL), with direct bilirubin of 1.0 mg/dL (&lt;0.2 mg/dL); and Albumin, 2.8 gm/dL (3.6-7.5 g/dL). Urinalysis was normal. Epstein-Barr virus panel was consistent with past exposure. His monospot test and acute hepatitis panel were negative.</p>
<p>An abdominal CT with contrast showed a 9.2 × 8.2 × 8.1 cm<sup>3</sup> complex multiseptated solid and cystic lesion in the right hepatic lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812465978">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The differential diagnoses at this time included a pyogenic liver abscess, amoebic liver abscess, and echinococcal cyst.</p>

<title>Hospital Course</title>
<p>Vancomycin, metronidazole, and meropenem were begun, and blood was sent for <italic>Entamoeba histolytica</italic> and <italic>Echinococcus</italic> serological studies. Shortly after admission, the patient underwent CT-guided aspiration and percutaneous drainage catheter placement for the cyst, resulting in 45 mL of purulent fluid. Gram, acid-fast bacilli, and fungal stains were negative, and material was sent for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture as well as for acid-fast bacilli and fungal cultures.</p>
<p>After 7 days of incubation, anaerobic cultures of the aspirated fluid were reported to contain filamentous Gram-negative bacteria, which the next day was identified as <italic>Fusobacterium necroforum</italic>. Amoebiasis and echinococcal serological studies were negative. Vancomycin was discontinued, and intravenous metronidazole and meropenem were continued. Although the patient improved rapidly, intermittent fever continued. On hospital day 7, a repeat abdominal CT showed a reduction in the size of the abscess to 7.1 × 4.6 × 5.2 cm<sup>3</sup>. He then underwent CT-guided aspiration of the abscess for repeat culture and to reposition the drainage catheter. The drainage fluid was serous rather than purulent, and the yield was only 0.5 to 1.0 cc/h. The catheter was removed on day 12. By day 14 of hospitalization, the patient was without fever for 48 hours. The white blood cell count had decreased to 11 400/µL. The second aspirate culture was negative after 7 days of incubation, and the patient was discharged to complete 4 additional weeks of oral metronidazole. He remained asymptomatic after discharge, and a repeat abdominal CT after 6 weeks of antimicrobial therapy showed a small residual organized tissue scar that was about 25% of the original size of the abscess.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Pyogenic liver abscesses are reported to occur in 3.6 per 100 000 adults within the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812465978">1</xref></sup> and represent 80% of liver abscesses in children worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812465978">2</xref></sup> Common presenting symptoms are abdominal pain, high fever, and hepatomegaly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812465978">3</xref></sup> Most abscesses occur as solitary lesions within the right lobe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812465978">2</xref></sup> The causative microorganism thought to be most common varies among studies. One retrospective study in Australia reported, in order of recovery incidence, <italic>Streptococcus milleri, Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and <italic>Escherichia coli.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812465978">4</xref></sup> Other studies have identified <italic>Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter</italic>, and polymicrobial microorganisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812465978">5</xref></sup> Meddings et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812465978">1</xref></sup> found that anaerobes were cultured in 8.6% of 8286 positive cultures. It is unclear how many are formed from <italic>F necrophorum</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>F necrophorum</italic> is a Gram-negative obligate anaerobe found in the oropharynx, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812465978">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812465978">7</xref></sup> First described as an infection in animals, this non-spore-forming bacterium is not commonly associated with human infection and accounts for less than 1% of bacteremias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812465978">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Lemierre’s disease, also known as necrobacillosis or postanginal sepsis, is the most common clinical entity associated with <italic>F necrophorum</italic>. This potentially life-threatening disseminated illness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812465978">8</xref></sup> begins as an oropharyngeal infection that leads to internal or external jugular venous thrombophlebitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812465978">9</xref></sup> and progresses to sepsis with embolic metastasis to the lungs and other organs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812465978">6</xref></sup> It is interesting to note that Lemierre’s has been referred to as the “forgotten disease” because it disappeared from the literature after the wide use of antibiotics; however, within the past 20 years, cases have reemerged.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812465978">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812465978">10</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Fusobacterium</italic> as a solitary infection within the liver is quite rare. More frequent reports have described <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> as a cause of sepsis, bacteremia, abscesses, and, puerperal infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812465978">6</xref></sup> None of these patients were diagnosed with liver abscesses. Another 4-year prospective Danish study found localized <italic>F necrophorum</italic> in 291 patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812465978">8</xref></sup> but none had liver abscesses. In fact, there are only 2 previous reports in the literature describing a liver abscess in previously healthy children caused by <italic>F necrophorum</italic> without the associated Lemierre’s oropharyngeal infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812465978">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812465978">11</xref></sup> The present report emphasizes the importance of recognizing this organism as a potential pathogen, appreciating its slow growth in culture (7 days for this case), and offers guidance for the management of similar infections.</p>
<p>Open surgical drainage was the standard of care for pyogenic liver abscesses until the 1980s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812465978">12</xref></sup> With improved antibiotics and image-guided catheter technique, most pyogenic abscesses are now successfully managed with intravenous antibiotics, percutaneous drainage, and close monitoring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922812465978">13</xref></sup> Many sources advocate for open surgical drainage in the setting of large, complex pyogenic abscesses, failed percutaneous drainage, and/or perforation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812465978">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812465978">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812465978">14</xref></sup> The present case demonstrates that a large, complex pyogenic liver abscess can be successfully treated nonsurgically.</p>
<p>There is no standard duration of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of <italic>F necrophorum</italic> liver abscesses. The current literature suggests anywhere between 4 and 6 weeks, with 2 to 6 weeks of parenteral therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922812465978">15</xref></sup> <italic>Fusobacterium</italic> is highly sensitive to antibiotics, suggesting that a shorter course of parenteral antibiotics would suffice. We treated our patient with 2 weeks of intravenous metronidazole and meropenem, followed by 4 weeks of oral metronidazole. Our strategy was contingent on the presence of stable clinical signs, downtrending inflammatory markers, a negative follow-up culture, and image documentation of the decreased size of the abscess.</p>
<p>Johannsen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812465978">12</xref></sup> refer to liver abscesses not as a disease entity in their own right but rather “a final common pathway of many pathologic processes.” Pyogenic abscesses typically originate from the biliary tract, portal vein, direct extension, hepatic artery, or from penetrating trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812465978">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922812465978">16</xref></sup> In this case, there was no definitive predisposing pathology. There was livestock exposure, a risk factor for <italic>Echinococcal</italic> infection; however, it is unclear if this has any causal relationship with pyogenic abscesses. There was also a history of a rabbit bite. Although <italic>Fusobacterium spp</italic> were identified through studies with rabbits in the late 1800s,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922812465978">17</xref></sup> it is unknown if rabbit bites or exposure represent a risk factor for abscess formation by <italic>Fusobacterium spp.</italic></p>
<p>Liver abscesses without an identified cause, termed <italic>cryptogenic abscesses</italic>, make up a substantial proportion of cases. A 20-patient case series from Louisiana found cryptogenic abscesses in 30% of patients admitted for management of this infection, consistent with other reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812465978">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922812465978">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922812465978">18</xref></sup> Experience with adult patients suggests that the presence of a pyogenic liver abscess warrants consideration for colorectal neoplasia evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922812465978">19</xref></sup> Further research is needed to determine if extensive investigation for a predisposing condition is necessary in healthy pediatric patients with cryptogenic abscesses.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the history of animal exposure was a point of interest because it increased the risk of an echinococcal infection in our patient, particularly when the MRI indicated that the abscess was multiloculated, which is highly suggestive of <italic>Echinococcus multilocularis. E multilocularis</italic> and <italic>E granulosus</italic> may cause hydatid cysts in the liver or lungs of intermediate hosts such as humans, sheep, pigs, cattle, and horses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922812465978">20</xref></sup> Those working on farms and animal herders are at an increased risk of acquiring this disease. The larva proliferates in the liver, eventually invading surrounding tissues. Although up to 60% of cases are asymptomatic, these cysts may become symptomatic if they rupture, impede on surrounding structures, or become secondarily infected. Most symptomatic patients are between 4 and 15 years of age. Definitive diagnosis is made through imaging. There are also serological studies that can be done and were performed in this case. Therapy includes surgery and percutaneous drainage as well as medical therapy with albendazole or mebendazole.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922812465978">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, this case of a cryptogenic liver abscess in a healthy adolescent demonstrates successful management with antibiotics and percutaneous drainage for a large complex hepatic abscess caused by a rare anaerobe, <italic>F necrophorum.</italic> Anaerobes should be suspected in all pyogenic liver abscesses, and empirical antibiotics should include anaerobic coverage regardless of risk factors. A thorough history as to the source of infection should include any head and neck infections and surgeries, exposure to animals, and travel. Our regimen of percutaneous drainage and 6 weeks of antibiotics was satisfactory for our patient; however, clinical trials are needed to determine the appropriate duration of therapy and use of percutaneous drainage. Finally, the source of infection was indeterminate in this case. Further research is needed to better understand the pathogenesis of cryptogenic liver abscesses, risk factors within the pediatric population, and virulence factors of <italic>F necrophorum</italic>.</p>
