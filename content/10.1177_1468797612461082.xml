<p>This article seeks to advance the understanding of the role of alcohol, drinking and drunkenness as an important, if under-researched, element of tourism. In so doing, we work at the intersection of three bodies of writing focused on mundane mobilities; performativities of tourism and geographies of alcohol, drinking and drunkenness. Drawing on empirical research undertaken in Australia, we highlight how alcohol, drinking and drunkenness are key to backpacking holidays: first, to help soften a number of (un)comfortable embodied and emotional materialities associated with budget travel; second, as an aid to spatial and temporal imperatives of ‘passing the time’ and ‘being able to do nothing’ and finally, to heighten senses of belonging with fellow travellers and ‘locals’. Crucial is participation in specific experiential practices and performativities that are fundamental to practices of ‘doing place’. Alcohol, drinking and drunkenness are key to unpacking backpacking and offer potentially fruitful research avenues for broader theoretical and empirical debates in tourist studies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Drinking alcohol and ‘getting drunk’ are, for many, quintessential holiday experiences. Yet alcohol, drinking and drunkenness are undertheorized topics for tourist studies. Focusing on backpacking holidays, we consider how alcohol, drinking and drunkenness are key to understanding practices, experiences and performativities of tourism. More than mere escapism or hedonism, drinking is bound up with (un)comfortable embodied and emotional materialities associated with budget travel. Drinking enables spatial and temporal imperatives of ‘passing the time’ and ‘being able to do nothing’ and helps heighten senses of belonging and engagement with fellow travellers and ‘locals’ that are fundamental to experiential practices of ‘doing place’. We suggest that there is much to be gained from a dialogue between advances made by writing on geographies of alcohol, drinking and drunkenness and theoretical work relating to mundane mobilities, performativity and emotions and embodiment, which have been instrumental in enlivening tourist research over the past few years.</p>
<p>The findings presented in this article come from qualitative research undertaken in Australia. In-depth interviews were undertaken with 15 backpackers from the United Kingdom and 5 from Germany, France, New Zealand, Canada and United States. Backpackers are diverse and heterogeneous, and we agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468797612461082">Hannam and Diekmann (2010)</xref> that there is much work to be done to fully understand the mobilities bound up with backpacking tourism – including the diversity and complexity of alcohol consumption as a key part (or not) of the holiday experience. Towards such a project, we focus on backpackers aged between 18 and 25 years with equal gender representation, and the majority (all but two) were students from families with professional/managerial backgrounds. All but two of the respondents described themselves as regularly consuming alcohol. Interviews and participant observation were undertaken in hostels, cafes, pubs, bars, parks and beaches in iconic tourist locations that attract large numbers of backpackers: central Sydney, Bondi Beach, Manly Beach and Cairns. Respondents were recruited, and case study locations were chosen in order to advance understanding of the specificities of the mobilities and experiences of young backpackers relating to alcohol consumption, drinking practices and performativities of drunkenness, topics previously highlighted as being important to understanding backpacking but not investigated in a detailed, sustained and sophisticated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468797612461082">Allon and Anderson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468797612461082">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468797612461082">McNulty et al., 2010</xref>). Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and along with the participant, observation materials were analysed using qualitative techniques. The quotes have been anonymized and are reproduced here verbatim; editing is highlighted.</p>
<p>Our article begins with a brief review of relevant theoretical debates, and in so doing, we point to a number of potentially productive avenues for research at the intersection of mundane mobilities, performativity and emotional and embodied tourism and to recent work on geographies of alcohol, drinking and drunkenness. Drawing on this theoretical work, subsequent sections then unpack the interpenetration of alcohol consumption and mundane and adventurous activities, spatial and temporal practices and experiences of ‘doing place’ that constitute backpacker holidays. We conclude by highlighting how the ways in which a focus on alcohol, drinking and drunkenness has much to offer broader debates within tourist studies.</p>

<title>Setting the scene: theorizing backpacker tourism and geographies of alcohol drinking and drunkenness</title>
<p>Over the past 15 years, there has been a burgeoning body of literature on backpacking holidays. Writing has focused on capturing the heterogeneity of tourists who can be categorized as backpackers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468797612461082">Hannam and Diekmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468797612461082">Maoz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468797612461082">Mohsin and Ryan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1468797612461082">Teo and Leong, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1468797612461082">Torun, 2004</xref>), defining ‘backpacking’ with regard to the use of budget accommodation, an emphasis on meeting ‘other travellers’ and ‘locals’; the informality and flexibility of travel plans and the motivations of backpackers to experience more ‘authentic adventures’ than offered by other holiday experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468797612461082">Hillman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468797612461082">Loker-Murphy and Pearce, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468797612461082">Muzaini, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1468797612461082">O’Regan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1468797612461082">Voase, 2006</xref>). Others have focused on the importance of travel in relation to national (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468797612461082">Andrews, 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468797612461082">Huxley, 2004</xref>), gendered and personal identity formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468797612461082">Andrews, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468797612461082">Falcolner, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468797612461082">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1468797612461082">Meethan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468797612461082">Noy, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468797612461082">2006</xref>; Obenour, 2005a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1468797612461082">Wilson and Ateljevic, 2008</xref>); measured the number of sexual encounters and levels of use of alcohol and drugs by backpackers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468797612461082">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>; McNulty et al., 2009); considered the associated conflicts of behaviour with local residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468797612461082">Allon and Anderson, 2010</xref>) and pointed to the importance of social interactions facilitated through the access to notice boards, Internet social networking and in spaces such as hostels, bars, buses, beaches, trains and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468797612461082">Adkins, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468797612461082">Murphy, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>At its best, writing about backpacking has drawn on theoretical debates in the social sciences and humanities that have significantly advanced our understanding of tourism. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468797612461082">John Urry (2000)</xref> theorized the ways in which social relations are constituted by human–non-human relations that produce mobilities across borders. Tourism is in turn a field of symbolic and performative struggle – a theme applied to backpacker tourism (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468797612461082">Hannam and Diekmann, 2010</xref>). Others have followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468797612461082">Edensor (2007)</xref> who critiques the notion of tourism as an ‘exception or special time’ in order to describe backpackers’ experiences based on habitual routine that are often ‘designed to maximise comfort … not characterized by the suspension of norm but … [are] culturally informed by particular notions about what to do, and how and where to do it’ (pp. 200–201). In this sense, writing about backpackers has focused on a shared set of conventions and shared assumptions about what constitutes appropriate behaviour in particular contexts. In both implicit and explicit ways then, much of the writing on backpacking has thus sought to understand
<disp-quote>
<p>the repetition of daily, weekly, and annual routines: how and when to eat, wash, move, work and play, accumulates over time to consolidate a ‘common sense’, which is usually shared by those around you so that these habits become further ingrained through interaction with others. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468797612461082">Edensor, 2007</xref>: 211)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such work also addresses the ‘banal or mundane dimensions of mobility in order to understand variegated relationships between people and places that critique static, bounded conceptions of place, space and belonging’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468797612461082">Binnie et al., 2007</xref>: 166). These arguments have been vital in pointing to
<disp-quote>
<p>repetitive encounters with familiar features are apt to consolidate a sense of spatial belonging that may extend across space … [and which] provokes a recognition of the unacknowledged comfort of familiar mobility through a lack of competence and comfort in the moving through and negotiating space. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468797612461082">Binnie et al., 2007</xref>: 167)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468797612461082">Conradson and Latham (2005)</xref> argue that it is important that
<disp-quote>
<p>accounts of transnational mobility that are attentive to everyday practices and geographical emplacement … [consider] mundane and situated efforts by which people make their lives across international borders … [and that attention is paid] to the complex interweaving of individual and social networks within and through place. (p. 228)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468797612461082">Conradson and Latham (2005)</xref> point to the importance of theorizing both ‘<italic>mobility</italic> and <italic>emplacement</italic>’ and hence to the ‘everyday texture of the globalizing spaces we inhabit … [and the ways in which] inevitably emplaced forms of sociality are being re-worked and re-imagined through such movement and mobility’ (p. 228). Both fluidity and fixity shape the moments and spaces of tourist encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468797612461082">Allon and Anderson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468797612461082">Gibson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In previous research on backpacking and tourism, there have been tantalizing insights into the role of alcohol, drinking and drunkenness as a feature of touristic mobilities and performativities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468797612461082">Allon and Anderson, 2010</xref>) – but sustained theorization remains scant. Geographers writing about the spatialities of alcohol, drinking and drunkenness offer another viewpoint, from which a more detailed theoretical and empirical agenda might unfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468797612461082">DeVerteuil and Wilton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468797612461082">Hubbard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468797612461082">Jayne et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468797612461082">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468797612461082">Kneale, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468797612461082">Leyshon, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468797612461082">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1468797612461082">Waitt et al., 2011</xref>). Space and place are not ‘passive backdrops’ to drinking but are active constituents in the practices and experiences bound up with alcohol consumption. Moreover,
<disp-quote>
<p>unpacking connections, similarities, differences and mobilities between supranational, national, regional, and local spatial scales human geographers are offering new insights into complex interpenetrations of political, economic, social, cultural, spatial and embodied and emotional geographies bound up with drinking practices and related issues. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468797612461082">Jayne et al., 2008a</xref>: 247)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a review of writing on ‘alcotourism’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468797612461082">David Bell (2008)</xref> has gone furthest in outlining an agenda for considering the mobilities relating to tourism and alcohol consumption. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468797612461082">Bell (2008)</xref> suggests that ‘alcotourism refers to the practices of travelling to drink, drinking on holiday, drinking to travel and drinking when travelling … [and] should be understood as a set of context-specific practices often integral to the experiences of holidays’ (p. 291). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468797612461082">Bell (2008</xref>: 291) also highlights how the ‘“the hospitality offer” of a particular location is often a central part of place branding, with both spaces of hospitality and broader, less tangible ‘cultures’ of hospitality (how ‘welcoming’ or ‘friendly’ a place feels are being converted into tradable assets to mark a competitive advantage). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468797612461082">Bell (2008)</xref> also points to the ways in which
<disp-quote>
<p>drinking is a way of consuming place … by experiencing local drinking cultures and local beverages, or back home through variants of what we might call ‘armchair alcotourism’ and ‘bar room tourism’ (the consumption of holiday drinks back home as a way of reconnecting to holiday destinations past’). (p. 294; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468797612461082">Cuthill, 2007</xref>: 64; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1468797612461082">Tutenges, 2012</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In parallel with writing about backpacking by tourist theorists, geographers have thus provided some important exploratory insights into the coupling of tourism and alcohol consumption. Such efforts have begun to unpack how consumption of local drinks and drinking cultures relate to touristic experiences. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468797612461082">Bell (2008)</xref> illustrates how a range of drinking geographies have become key components of travel guides and literature – from the consumption of ‘particular beverages to the performance of indigenous drinking practices is a kind of alcoholic anthropology … [including a] fascination with different serving hours, different attitudes to drinking, different modes of drunkenness, and so on’ (p. 296). Such insights can be added to broader understanding of ‘the importance of drink in lubricating social interaction with the cultures visited … [related to a] desire to understand and participate on local drinking cultures, and broader fascination with locally embedded meanings and uses of alcohol’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468797612461082">Bell, 2008</xref>: 296). Indeed, as others have argued with regard to a diversity of young people’s drinking (in its various discursively constructed forms), theorizing mobilities is vital to understanding conflicts around tourists’ drinking and local values and cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468797612461082">Allon and Anderson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468797612461082">Jayne et al., 2008b</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468797612461082">Allon and Anderson (2010)</xref> describe, backpacker mobilities
<disp-quote>
<p>involve new and novel relations of social and physical community formation, sexual practices, patterns of drug and alcohol consumption, as well as instances of danger, discomfort, and violence. The range and intensity of these kinds of encounters, as well as the problems frequently associated with them, appear to be increasing primarily because backpackers not only <italic>travel through</italic> but also <italic>dwell in</italic> place. (p. 11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From this perspective, it is essential to recognize that drinking is one of the many normal constitutive embodied and emotional acts of dwelling carried out while travelling that help forge the subject of the backpacker. Drinking and drunkenness can be understood as patterns of activities that take on different meanings within a constellation of interlocking practices performed by people who simultaneously shape places and are shaped by places.</p>
<p>What becomes clear then is that there are overlapping theoretical directions and research agendas at the intersection of tourist studies writing on mundane mobilities, performativities and emotions and embodiment and recent writing by geographers on the spatialities of alcohol, drinking and drunkenness. This article seeks to push this nexus further. We do so through a detailed consideration of one ‘tourist group’ and associated mobilities – backpacking – a holiday experience where respondents who took part in our research suggest that alcohol consumption and drunkenness is a near-ubiquitous presence. In the remainder of this article, we turn to three overlapping themes: mundane and adventurous drinking, space and time and ‘doing place’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1468797612461082">
<title>Backpackers as alco-tourists: mundane and adventurous drinking</title>
<p>In this section, we pull together empirical threads that emerge from our ethnographic research in order to develop theoretical insights into the materialities of mundane mobilities and both everyday and ‘exotic’ performativities with regard to alcohol consumption. Some of the examples highlight parallel perspectives from writing on backpacking tourists; others point to new directions for research. For example, writers who have focused on the (dis)comfort of backpacking practices will recognize a relationality that exists between hardship and pleasure – of the opportunities and tensions of being ‘away from home’ that are central to the experiences and practices of backpacker tourists (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468797612461082">Falconer, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468797612461082">2009b</xref>). Here, we highlight a number of ways in which alcohol consumption is a key feature of such recurring notions. Indeed, at times, respondents found it difficult to distinguish between, or balance, the labelling of alcohol-related experience as being either a pleasure and/or a danger. For example, reading across all the interviews, and for all but two of our respondents, alcohol was defined as an important element of their extended holidays. While all of those who drank thought that they were making the most of their ‘freedom’ by drinking ‘more’ than they usually did at home, they admitted to not ‘keeping tabs’ on their actual levels of drinking during the weeks/months of their holiday. However, while regularly ‘drinking heavily’, on ‘big nights’, was described as a ‘badge of honour’, all the backpackers who drank pointed to the heterogeneity of drinking during their travels, including descriptions that ranged from ‘a few beers at lunch’ or a ‘few glasses of wine at dinner’ to the pleasure of ‘a cold beer on the beach at sunset’. In doing so, the respondents described diverse and sophisticated drinking practices/amounts in a range of different spaces/places when alcohol was a key component of the materialities and performativities of their backpacking tourism.</p>
<p>First, and related to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468797612461082">Loker-Murphy and Pearce’s (1995)</xref> defining characteristics of backpacker tourism, our research found that alcohol, drinking and drunkenness were key elements in the experience of budget accommodation. The following quote is representative of the ways in which the backpackers interviewed talked about how alcohol helped to make staying in budget accommodation more materially ‘comfortable’:
<disp-quote>
<p>Oh my god, well on that question, I just don’t know where to begin … the first thing that springs to mind is that being a bit pissed allows you to ignore the sheets on the bed, or if your clever enough to have your own that you haven’t got around to washing them in the past month … its all about the that feeling of being itchy … a lumpy and uncomfortable bed, of heat and insects … or the way you have to share your room, sometimes with to ten, maybe more people and it as hot and sweaty and of course smelly, and even then you can get cold and you feel miserable if you cant get enough sleep. So if you’re a bit squeamish or a light sleeper then being drunk is the best way to go … also firstly to let you agree to stay there in the first place and then to try and get a decent night sleep … people coming and going, slamming doors, snoring, pissing, farting .. there is no escape … using the shower or even more difficult is using the often disgusting toilets, then drink really helps … and another thing you don’t know who is in the next bed or room and whether you can trust them … so drinking takes away some of the fears, just allows you the courage to just get on with it. … but I guess they are just some of the more negative things … (Kevin, aged 21 years, Reading, UK)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such findings add to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468797612461082">Falconer’s (2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468797612461082">2009b</xref>) theorization of the emotional and embodied experiences of female backpackers. For example, Falconer showed that for women, having to deal with illness, thrush and cystitis are just some of the ways in which backpacking allowed individuals to ‘develop’ a strength of character – to overcome fear and anxieties and to address and experience material and performative challenges bound up with having to navigate menstruation, diarrhoea, vomiting and sexual encounters in new and often challenging ways. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468797612461082">Adkins et al. (2007)</xref> suggest such material ‘adventures’ were seen as key to ‘formative notions of the self and identity’ and of coping, negotiating and transcending strategies for feelings of unease or ‘feeling out of place’ and trying to ‘make sense of places and people’. Both male and female respondents also talked about what they acknowledged to be potentially problematic embodied and emotional impacts of alcohol – around drunkenness, sickness, sadness and loneliness. However, in response, three of the female respondents highlighted that they often chose to stay in ‘women-only’ hostels and in hostels where alcohol consumption was prohibited. They did so in order to both amplify their own individual/collective experience of backpacking with other young women and seek to minimize what they considered to be problematic behaviours associated with their own and other people’s alcohol-related behaviour (this will be returned to later).</p>
<p>Second, and alluded to in the comments made by Kevin above, was a consensus that collective and individual discursive constructions, relating to opportunities/problematic elements of meeting fellow travellers and ‘locals’ offered by backpacking and facilitated through alcohol consumption, were considered as being less accessible in more organized forms of tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468797612461082">Loker-Murphy and Pearce, 1995</xref>). For example, although not wishing to overstate that such sociabilities only unfolded for our respondents when alcohol consumption was a factor, drunken materialities and performativities of interactions with other travellers and ‘locals’ were seen as positively facilitated through drunkenness. Respondents described (affectionately or in terms of embarrassment) about having ‘beer goggles’ – of finding others interesting to talk to, or attractive and sexy – of being less judgemental of strangers and of being able to overcome social boundaries. Many described this as ‘emotionally liberating’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468797612461082">Jayne et al., 2010</xref>), as the following quotes suggest:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think it’s also about being a long way from home … no one knows you here and that is both great but also scary … I think it’s also about being away from home for such a long time and its not easy to always be up for it and being brave and sociable … sometimes drinking can help with that. (Matt, aged 18 years, Lincolnshire, UK)</p>
<p>when I’ve had a few alcoholic drinks I find it easier to want to talk, maybe do things, go places and end up in situations I might think twice about if I wasn’t a little … or sometimes, very drunk … I guess that I take more risks, some only small about talking to other people, trying to maybe make friends with people … or being better at haggling or questioning the price of a room for the night or a taxi for example … But other times I do find myself thinking fuck what am I doing here with these people, or the next day I think, just how on earth did I end up doing that … it was both a result of the alcohol, but I also know that if I am honest that I do drink just to make those things happen … (Jessica, aged 18 years, Bournemouth, UK)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Alcohol consumption, therefore, matters to the analysis of the complexities of encounters, including sex, in tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468797612461082">Malam, 2006</xref>), a corrective to a cerebral or ‘rational’ view of the world as ‘asexual terrain, a world seemingly devoid of lust, passion and sex’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1468797612461082">Waitt et al., 2008</xref>: 782). Within regulated tourist spaces and routines unpredictable, emotional and embodied encounters are still possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468797612461082">Gibson, 2010</xref>) – and alcohol plays a role in enabling them.</p>
<p>At the same time, as acknowledged by Jessica above, alcohol consumption had led to ‘bad’ behaviour. Reflecting on their drunken behaviour for some becomes a source of embarrassment. Yet, a heightened awareness that their behaviour transcends the socially accepted norms of belonging in that place did not always result in moderation of alcohol consumption. Instead, the risks associated with drunkenness and becoming a backpacker are integral to the pleasures of travelling. Examples given by respondents included the ways that alcohol allowed them to generate memorable moments of backpacking travel through behaving badly with local residents, taxi drivers, hostel workers, bar staff or ‘anyone who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time’ or when ‘things got too much’ (Jennifer 22 years, Greater Manchester, UK). Others talked in both positive and negative ways about the role of alcohol in wiping away tensions with fellow travellers – ones with whom journeys began and also with new companions made along the way. Travel plans were facilitated, changed or jettisoned following drunken conversations (this will discussed in more detail in the following section).</p>
<p>A fourth theme from our empirical research links to geographical writing around the materialities of alcohol, drinking and drunkenness, especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468797612461082">Bell’s (2008)</xref> notions of consuming place through drunkenness and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468797612461082">Latham and McCormack’s (2004)</xref> argument that bodily, affectual and non-human assemblages combine to produce ‘psychoactive socialities’. Such notions most often referred to materialities of drinking specific drinks, in certain spaces/places, alongside an acknowledgement that ‘levels of “drunkenness” was determined by issues including who the respondents were drinking with, their mood, food intake, tiredness, and their (often changing) tolerances to alcohol’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468797612461082">Jayne et al., 2011</xref>: 830). Several respondents from the United Kingdom talked about how in their travels in Australia, not being able to drink from ‘pint glasses’ but from smaller ‘middies’ and ‘schooner-sized glasses’ disrupted their experiences of the materialities of drinking and drunkenness. While acknowledging that the heat often made it reasonable to drink from smaller glasses to make sure ‘the cold beer doesn’t get warm’, Martin (aged 25 years, Newquay, UK) went on to say that ‘it just feels wrong in your hand, and the sips … or gulps … (laughs) are just different to how I normally drink, and its less easy to remember how many you have had’. Richard (aged 19 years, Ipswich, UK) also highlighted the importance of materialities to alcohol consumption by suggesting
<disp-quote>
<p>that’s all part of the experiences of drinking, even the Aussies realize that. I asked a bar man once why Guinness wasn’t served in schooners and the reply I got was that it just wouldn’t feel or taste the same if Guinness wasn’t drunk from a pint-glass.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Other respondents also talked about their pleasure/concern about unknown levels of alcohol in drinks – whether because of the alcohol percentage content or whether ‘measured’ amount of alcohol was more that they were used to in each drink – as well as the impact of certain types of drinks in spaces/places:
<disp-quote>
<p>Well for us, its about trying all the local beers and brews … for example, in Indonesia I read before I went about local palm or rice wine mixtures known as Arak, and I knew people had died from drinking it … or it can make you go ‘crazy drunk’ … but I just had to try it to see how it made me feel … also in Malaysia I had to try many different types of Samsu, there are so many types of brands of that drink … you can buy from shops and street vendors, but also homebrew … I try … but not always manage to … but try to be more cautious about the home brew stuff … but I think part of the challenge is to meeting people and try to judge the effects of the drink and the intentions of the people giving it to you … and the heat, and if you are in a bar or a noisy night club, or on the beach with some friends, or even what food you are eating with when drinking it all change its effects … or if you have gone into someone’s home, or place of work to drink, or even just say in a group on the street drinking … its all a different experience and the effects sometimes really can be so different … and then sometimes staying somewhere nice and wearing clean clothes and drinking a good cocktails and everything for me is all about how drinking makes the experience … (Philip, aged 21 years, London, UK)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such material responses echo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468797612461082">Binnie et al.’s (2007)</xref> description of the ways in which ‘repetitive encounters with familiar features are apt to consolidate a sense of spatial belonging that may extend across space’ (p. 167). Seeking out and experiencing different social/cultural and embodied and emotional feelings of drunkenness allowed backpackers whom we interviewed a material connection or opened up ‘new kinds of feelings’, which ‘provokes a recognition of the unacknowledged comfort of familiar mobility through a lack of competence and comfort in the moving through and negotiating space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468797612461082">Binnie et al., 2007</xref>: 167). For example, as Rose (aged 23 years, Durham, UK), suggests, alcohol was a familiar way to make ‘the ordinary feel more extraordinary’:
<disp-quote>
<p>It’s not like I’ve not travelled places before, or not been drunk on a beach before, or that the bars and clubs here are really so different from ones I’ve been to before … I’ve been loads of other places with my family and also a few times with my just my friends on holiday … but being a bit, or sometimes really drunk just helps you to see and feel things differently … I’m not saying we don’t enjoy those places as much when were not drunk, or don’t do cool things without alcohol, because that’s not true … but drinking makes it different from those times … a whole different set of feelings and experiences …</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, what emerges from such findings is the need to understand ‘the fluidity of boundaries between emotions, embodiment and interconnectedness of processes of individuation, relationality and affect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468797612461082">Jayne et al., 2010</xref>: 244; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468797612461082">Edensor, in press</xref>) bound up with backpacker tourism and alcohol consumption. Indeed, recent writing by geographers on alcohol, drinking and drunkenness (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468797612461082">Jayne et al., 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468797612461082">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468797612461082">2011</xref>) highlights the importance of ‘how emotions are embodied and located’, meriting ‘further elaboration in the context of typical and less typical everyday lives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468797612461082">Davidson et al., 2005</xref>: 5), in parallel with studies that investigate affect as ‘a sense of push in the world … a notion of broad tendencies and lines of force’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1468797612461082">Thrift, 2004</xref>: 60). Such work has advanced understanding of how embodied emotions and affect are intricately connected to specific sites, contexts and practices.</p>
<p>Indeed, respondents in our research described the emotional and embodied materialities of drinking familiar and new kinds of drinks, in similar and often ‘exotic’ commercial and non-commercial venues. In these terms, the material relationship between spaces/places and the consumption of specific alcoholic was used by backpackers to influence
<disp-quote>
<p>conditional possibilities for certainty and security, [allowing them] to order … everyday life worlds with a necessary degree of predictability and comfort. Yet in constant and productive tension with the routine is potentiality and possibility: mundanity is always otherwise, slipping out of kilter, disrupted and rent asunder through unforeseen occurrences and unfamiliar conjunctures. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468797612461082">Binnie et al., 2007</xref>: 167)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In these terms, the materialities of alcohol-related mobilities, and spatial and temporal connections and disconnections in terms of the taste and texture of drinks, heat and cold, venues, toilets and so on relate and are part of the negotiation of backpacking with regard to ‘mundane achievements of everyday mobility … dependent upon, and working with, multiple non-human forces and artefacts that tend to become back grounded into routines and skill sets of everyday life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468797612461082">Binnie et al., 2007</xref>: 168). However, what was foregrounded in our research findings was the way that alcohol consumption allowed backpackers to ‘find fun’ in both ‘the ordinary and the exotic’, as Rose (aged 23 years, Durham, UK) went on to say:
<disp-quote>
<p>When you are away for a long time, the touristy things start to become a bit boring, and the usual routines of going out on a Wednesday or a Friday and a Saturday night start to drag also, even if you are in different parts of the world … it’s like a strange mix of just like being caught up with what you usually do at home and then you also get to see and experience some amazing things … that’s also quickly become ordinary somehow … in both cases drinking alcohol can just make it all a bit more fun, add a bit of spice into making it more exciting …</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In these terms, alcohol is a key way in which mobile materialities of backpacking allow ‘the perforation of the ordinary by the extraordinary [which] can bring forth transformative or even enchanting movements or situations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468797612461082">Binnie et al., 2007</xref>: 168). The sustained investigation of alcohol consumption then is just one way in which a study of tourism can ‘examine the technologies and materialities of travel that are central to the production of mundane mobilities and remain attuned to the ways in which they offer different affordances and capacities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468797612461082">Binnie et al., 2007</xref>: 169). Towards such a project, we now turn to a more detailed consideration of the spatialities and temporalities of backpacker mobilities and how they are undone and redone through the materialities of alcohol, drinking and drunkenness.</p>

<title>Space and time</title>
<p>The second theme to emerge from our findings relates to the ways in which alcohol, drinking and drunkenness are active constituents of the ways in which backpackers actively discursively construct and experience tensions between temporalities and spatialities of their holidays. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468797612461082">Edensor’s (2007)</xref> argument that tourism is not an
<disp-quote>
<p>exceptional or special time … but is instead culturally informed by particular notions about what to do, and how and where to do it … [and] familiar experiential rhythms … [so that] tourism should not be conceived as that which is antithetical to the everyday. (pp. 200–201)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>clearly emerged in the narratives offered by our research participants. For example, all of our respondents talked about the ways in which they reconciled the benefits and problems of being ‘away from home’ and ‘on holiday’ for prolonged period of time – anywhere between 3 months to over a year. At different times, they were travelling both very large and then very small distances – which they noted as being problematic in reconciling their practical, ideological and romantic notions of ‘being on holiday’. With reference to such spatial and temporal experiences, all of the respondents acknowledged that alcohol, drinking and drunkenness often enhanced and often facilitated ‘adventures’ as well as pointed to the role of alcohol consumption in allowing one to ‘do nothing’ and ‘use up time’.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468797612461082">Loker-Murphy and Pearce’s (1995)</xref> argument that independently organized and flexible travel schedule is a key element of backpacking, we argue that alcohol consumption was as important to the majority of respondents in constituting and enabling such ‘freedom’ and ‘flexibility’. Respondents talked about the ways in which choices, and discussion over travel planning and itineraries, were often made because of, during and after drinking alcohol. Following on from insights into the role of alcohol consumption in both ‘mundane’ and ‘exotic’ holiday moments noted above, drunken decision-making was considered to be part of the ‘adventure’ of travelling, often discarding long-standing agreements at a whim, on the basis of a few drinks, of noting the name of an interesting place on a map or through the advice of other travellers and ‘locals’. In contrast, the majority of respondents also noted that itineraries and travel plans had changed due to excessive drinking, but that ‘hangover’ or ‘drinking weeks or weekends’ were factored into their plans to ensure that at times ‘doing nothing’ could be more easily justified:
<disp-quote>
<p>… really a lot of the time we have used drinking as a way of taking a day off from doing all the tourist stuff, having to move, go and look at stuff, to make the effort. You can’t just to that for six months, being so motivated and organized … otherwise you might as well go on a package holiday. It just gets boring you know … there is only so much you can see and experience in one go … so just chilling our and drinking … or being hung over just lets you stop for a while … its like almost the same as drinking to de-stress from work, but its de-stressing from being a tourist in lots of ways. (Helen, aged 19 years, Sheffield, UK)</p>
<p>Fucking stupid, I know it was … I’d planed it before I’d even left home. To meet up with a friend … we set a date and location to meet somewhere remote in the western territories … you know like a challenge for us both to get there and meet up, coming from different places on the map … but of course the night before I went out and I didn’t mean too, but just got so hammered … I felt really sick for the next couple of days … my friend just arrived there and I didn’t … and I messed up the whole of the plan … and didn’t get to see him … there was no way I was travelling when I felt like that … I would like to say that was the only time that I couldn’t get out of bed and get on a plane or old bus on a bumpy road but I’d be lying of course … (Alistair, aged 21 years, Glasgow, UK)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such findings relate to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468797612461082">Johnson’s (2010)</xref> argument that
<disp-quote>
<p>movements and actions that start as reflexive become assimilated into habitual performances … [and] that bodily movements used to achieve comfort are constantly re-worked and movements of being excited, scared, being comfortable and uncomfortable overlap, and change from one movement to the next. (pp. 112–113)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>More specifically, such quotes highlight the spatial and temporal factors bound up with ways by which
<disp-quote>
<p>the backpackers body is not merely textual, overwritten by codes of practice, but also a vessel through which experience is felt and created. In other instances such practice and performance connect with what may be described as the rhythmic elements. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468797612461082">Johnson, 2010</xref>: 113)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, it is the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468797612461082">Bissell (2007)</xref> who looks the corporal experience of ‘waiting’ during the process of journeying ‘through a focus on the body relationality between activity and inactivity’ that offers much to theorizing the evidence presented in the quotes above. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468797612461082">Bissell (2007)</xref> argues that
<disp-quote>
<p>the event of waiting should no longer conceptualized as a dead period of stasis or stilling, or even a slower urban rhythm … but as a variegated affective complex where experience folds through and emerges from a multitude of different places. (p. 277)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Instead, he describes ‘waiting’:
<disp-quote>
<p>through spaces of mobility is an often-inevitable and frequent experience woven through the fabric of the mobile everyday … [and that how by theorizing] waiting-as-event as a specific kind of relation-to-the-world that transcends and folds through this relational dialectic of (im)obility … a more productivist notion of waiting and subjectivity, as examples of slowed and even deadened rhythms moving alongside faster events and practices … bodies have the potential to transcend this schema … tracing a path through the activities of the active and engaged body-in-waiting and the various bodily demands and corporal attentativeness that waiting entails. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468797612461082">Bissell, 2007</xref>: 277)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, respondents described the productive role of alcohol, drinking and drunkenness with regard to ‘the feeling of abandonment and being able to “lose” yourself … related to the suspension of “real time” into “pub time” – of whiling away the hours’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468797612461082">Jayne et al., 2010</xref>: 540). Such descriptions highlight this important experience of alcohol consumption as a vital part of the potentialities and tensions around the temporalities and spatialities of backpacking, in allowing ‘waiting-as-acquiescence, or passive assent, as a particular relationship without context that eludes the traditional definition of the “social” … can be expanded and consequentially become enlivened’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468797612461082">Bissell, 2007</xref>: 278–279).</p>
<p>In these terms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468797612461082">Bissell’s (2007)</xref> work highlights that we can theorize the ways in which alcohol and drunkenness allow backpackers the productive opportunity to not only to ‘pass the time’ and ‘be able to do nothing’ but also to enact ‘a <italic>variegated affective complex</italic>: a mixture of activity and agitation of the world, and conversely a deadedness-to-the world’ (p. 279). Such notions offer important new insights into the formation of backpacking subjectivities through periods of drinking, drunkenness and hangovers as facilitating the materialities and performativities of ‘waiting’, ‘not as slowed rhythms that are somehow opposed to speed, but instead are themselves examples of rich durations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468797612461082">Bissell, 2007</xref>: 279). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468797612461082">Bissell (2007)</xref> further argues that such mobilities/mooring must be considered as
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>rich duration</italic> … [and that] contrary to thinking … does take <italic>effort</italic> and therefore some form of intentional action to wait. In other words, for the body to be immobile, it is still primarily pursuing an active purposive role of making-of-the-world and maintenance of meaning … an active <italic>doing</italic> of waiting and how a subject comes to wait could be seen as an achievement of a specific set of ongoing embodied tasks. (p. 280)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Indeed, as the following quotes suggest, alcohol, drunkenness and hangovers are constitutive of the very notions of freedom and flexibility of individual and collective notions of backpacking, which are constituted through the emotional and embodied experience of time/space slowed down and stopped through, the immediate and less-immediate effects of alcohol:
<disp-quote>
<p>drinking is all about helping make you more adventurous but it’s also sometimes about just letting yourself stop somewhere and feel an extra feeling of stopping, a relief from not travelling, of not having to move … it’s a break from travelling … its stopping about being in that spot … maybe feeling like you are there for longer than you are, but drinking helps you to make that time stretch out for ages … but it’s a real relief, and drinking just helps that time go on and on … you lose track of where you are and that’s great in contrast to having to think about timetables and travel plans. (Debs, aged 21 years, Lincoln, UK)</p>
<p>Oh my god … I just couldn’t move … I felt like I was going to die … the only thing that helped was I could hear Julie [longstanding travel companion] puking next to me … I thought poor thing, at least I hadn’t yet puked … we both just stayed in bed for a whole day … but as the saying go we did laugh about it the very next day … but we both just stayed in that hotel room for like a whole day until we felt like moving again … sleeping and that feeling of a bit-by-bit getting over the terrible feeling of being sick … and waiting all that time until we felt better … well enough … to go back to thinking about what we were going to do next. (Paul, aged 19 years, Nottingham, UK)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such individual and collective experiences are emblematic of the material, performative and embodied and emotional discursive construction of the diverse ‘rhythms’ of backpacking tourism. Backpackers were acutely aware of the rhythms of intensity of movement and stasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468797612461082">Edensor, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468797612461082">Gallan and Gibson, 2011</xref>) – and alcohol was one important factor mediating their time and spatialities.</p>
<p>More specifically, however, such evidence highlights how alcohol, drinking, drunkenness and hangovers in particular relate to backpackers as ‘subjects [who] are not engaged in specific extra-corporeal activities, [but that] perhaps the very act of stasis, of stillness actually entails and brings to bear considerable physical demands on the body: of waiting as a wholly performative <italic>social</italic> event’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468797612461082">Bissell, 2007</xref>: 285). There is clearly a sociability associated with dealing with drunkenness and hangovers during the extended periods of backpacking holidays, which represents a ‘corporeal attentiveness to the immediate environment … the act of bodily stillness through waiting is instrumental in heightening an auto-reflexive <italic>self</italic>-awareness of attention to the physicality of perception of the body itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468797612461082">Bissell, 2007</xref>: 286). Indeed, as the above quotes show alcohol, drinking and drunkenness facilitates an ‘event of bodily stasis and waiting in this sense that forms of a very different kind of relationality, form relation-<italic>in</italic>-the world towards a relation-<italic>to</italic>-the world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468797612461082">Bissell, 2007</xref>: 287) that allows the majority of backpackers who took part in our research to experience the pleasures/tensions of spatial and temporal experiences of travelling for extended periods of time over varying distances.</p>

<sec id="section5-1468797612461082">
<title>‘Doing place’</title>
<p>The final key theme that emerges from our research relates to perhaps the most often used phrases that was discussed throughout the interviews, where respondents expressed one of the most important elements of their holidays: ‘doing’ certain spaces/places, having ‘done’ cities, countries, regions, landmarks and buildings, natural landscapes and features. ‘Doing place’ was used as short hand to express a range of imaginative geographies and practices relating to ‘crossing off the list’ specific ‘authentic’ knowledge and experiences – all of which represented all that the respondents thought that there was to know about the spaces/places they were interested in knowing about, including the consumption of spaces/places themselves and through sight, smell, touch, sounds and atmospheres (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468797612461082">Connell and Gibson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468797612461082">Gibson and Connell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468797612461082">Jayne, 2005</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468797612461082">Huxley (2004</xref>: 40) argues, ‘the ways in which young travellers actually engage and “construct” the cultures of the places they are visiting and how they integrate themselves with other cultures’ is bound up with national and gendered identities. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1468797612461082">Torun (2004)</xref> suggests that
<disp-quote>
<p>the individual retains control over time and space thought to be lost in places travellers call home [and in doing so] backpackers reproduce structures of power, through (re)constructing the image of a ‘primitive other’ upon with much of successful ‘western identity’ exists’. (p. 1102; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1468797612461082">Saldanha, 2005</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For the majority of our respondents, such interactions were often pursued and heightened by alcohol consumption and as we saw in the previous section through what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468797612461082">Edensor (2007)</xref> describes as ‘extreme relaxation, intoxication, discomfort and sensual experience’ (p. 212).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468797612461082">Clarke (2005</xref>: 320) suggests, backpackers’ identities are constructed through everyday intricacies of travelling and the ways in which ‘corporeal, virtual and imaginative mobility’ are underpinned by resources: objects and technologies (from tattoos to football shirts), sites (from public bars to designer hotel spaces) and events and rhythms (from weekly themed backpacker nights to live and televized sporting events). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1468797612461082">Urry (2000</xref> ) also argues that ‘tourism is often about the body-as-seen, displaying performing and seducing visitors with skill, charm, strength, sexuality and so on’ (p. 156), which for the respondents involved in our study included ‘a strong drinking culture and close–knit drinking community [which] were very important for the sociability of many …[and for one or two] travelling presented opportunities to actually change established, monotonous drinking patterns’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468797612461082">Allon and Anderson, 2010</xref>: 20).</p>
<p>However, as much as backpackers seek out ‘adventure and otherness’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468797612461082">Murphy (2001)</xref> argues that the social interactions of backpackers are just as much about seeking out ‘touches of home’. Maoz (2008), for example, highlights gatherings around national themed bars and pubs, and even particular beaches in Thailand that have become know as ‘little Sweden’, ‘Little Germany’ and so on. This tension of being ‘both home and away’ can be understood through <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468797612461082">Hillman’s (2001)</xref> suggestion that backpackers are aware of exaggerations surrounding authenticity, and that ‘they actively construct their own positive experiences despite the routines of travelling they experience … [as well as] trying to establish a connection between experience and authenticity to form an encounter that is both worthwhile and memorable’ (p. 1).</p>
<p>Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468797612461082">Muzaini (2006)</xref> identifies a set of ‘strategies to “looking local” through clothes, food, and language as ways to encounter “the other”’. Indeed, our research found that alcohol was an easy way that backpackers found to make experiences ‘more authentic’ by enabling interactions around alcohol and through intoxication easier to navigate:
<disp-quote>
<p>I know it sounds crazy but when you drink it makes you feel part of a place more easily … you can imagine really knowing the place and the people and what it must be like to live there all the time … it makes communicating less annoying sometimes where you can’t understand someone and they can understand you … it helps you connect with the place … and this helps at other times because even when you aren’t drinking you feel more at home and things and people are more familiar because you have been there done that when you were drunk … (Ben, aged 18 years, London, UK)</p>
<p>When you’re travelling with other people, or sometimes on your own and just end up talking to others, I’ve lost count of the number of times you end up talking about drunken nights or the things you did … or even sharing your own, or others hangovers, or embarrassing stories … it brings you closer together .. either through doing it together or reliving those moments. (Rachel, aged 21 years, Washington, USA)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Alcohol, drinking and drunkenness thus enhances what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1468797612461082">Obenour (2005)</xref> describes as ‘self-making in journeying’ and more specifically what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468797612461082">Noy (2004)</xref> considers as ‘self change and a collective notion of identity through that change … [where] normative encounter with authenticity and “otherness” is accomplished through neo-colonialism and consumerist discourses’ (p. 98). Part of ‘doing place’ then includes finding ways to seek out <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468797612461082">Bell’s (2008)</xref> notions of hospitable ‘locales’ and ‘locals’ as well as those with different attitudes to drinking. As such, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468797612461082">Allon and Anderson (2010)</xref> importantly point to tensions between local government authorities, residents and backpackers and other tourists, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468797612461082">Andrews (2005b)</xref> suggests that the ‘drama and fun’ or indeed of ‘feeling out of place’ because of alcohol consumption and drunkenness ‘give the traveller (even if it is illusionary) the notion of serendipity, where a local place provides a convincing backdrop to identity creation’ (p. 233). To put it another way, consuming alcohol represents a specific ‘technology of the self’ that
<disp-quote>
<p>permit individuals to effect by their own means, or with the help of others, a certain number of operations on their bodies and souls, thoughts, conduct and ways of being so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state … (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468797612461082">Foucault, 1988</xref>: 18)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>and for backpackers that includes the positive and problematic elements of ‘doing’ place. Indeed, the role of alcohol in imbuing ‘adventure’ into mundane activities and interactions with other backpackers and ‘locals’, as well as amplifying ‘exotic’ experiences and moments, can be seen as a ‘technology of the self’ that also allows tales of backpacking to be an embodied and emotional remembrance, represented in photos, blogs and diaries and told and re-told long after the holiday has ended (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468797612461082">Noy, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1468797612461082">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468797612461082">Andrews (2005)</xref> is also particularly important to our research findings in comparing the mobilities of ideas and practices relating to ‘national drinking cultures’ and specifically notions of ‘Britishness’. This emerged through the embodied and emotional nature of tourist experience and the ways in which bodies represent wider social systems, and hence the ways in which tourists use their bodies in ‘doing place’. The following quotes point to specific relational notions of national identity that are articulated and (re)articulated through alcohol, drinking and drunkenness:
<disp-quote>
<p>Of course, I know the British people like to drink and that they like to show off. I think that they don’t really necessarily drink more that others it is just they are louder and like to show off more … there is more rowdiness and there is nakedness and more foolishness. I know not all British people are like that when they drink but there is that behaviour that we all see. (Rob, aged 19 years, Auckland, New Zealand)</p>
<p>Well you know it’s the girls from Wales on tour … we are from Wales and we don’t want everyone to think the English can drink more than us … (Charlotte, aged 23 years, Cardiff, Wales)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While several of the UK respondents expressed embarrassment at ideas about ‘Britishness’ and drinking, and indeed practices of some young people, there was a broad agreement that through drinking not only ‘Britishness’ but also strategic alignments with other Europeans and ‘southern hemisphere’ travellers were ‘firmly grounded in the choices of everyday practices of consumption that are further intertwined with construction of gender that serve to characterize the available national identity as exclusive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468797612461082">Andrews, 2005</xref>: 230) but at the same time open to personal and collective alliances through alcohol, drinking and drunkenness. Indeed, the female respondents who chose to stay at hostels where alcohol was banned and who characterized themselves as non-drinkers or limited drinkers described how their occasional use of bars and clubs was important to both the breadth of own backpacking holiday experience and as often re-asserting the efficacy of their choice of accommodation and travelling companions. However, these young female backpackers also suggested that visiting such spaces was nonetheless an ‘experience’ where they could test their skills at navigating uneven gendered social relations, facilitating social and sexual interactions, and warding off similar unwanted advances of others with differing levels of drunkenness (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468797612461082">Leyshon, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468797612461082">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1468797612461082">Waitt et al., 2008</xref>). Such evidence shows how for some young women who are not ‘big drinkers’ engagement with other travellers and locals with differing perfomativities of drunkenness were (if only occasionally) valued as a part of their own experiences of ‘doing place’.</p>
<p>What became evident from our research then is that while respondents from different nationalities acknowledged their participation in specific drinking practices and often behaviours around the discursive construction of ‘national’ and ‘gendered’ drinking cultures at certain times and in specific spaces/places that they also pointed to the heterogeneity of their own and others’ drinking practices. In these terms, while alcohol, drinking and drunkenness is a key element in ‘doing place’ and a key part of backpacking holiday experiences, respondents themselves were critical of overly simplistic notions of the role of individual and collective ‘national and gendered stereotypes’. The relationship between backpackers, alcohol, drinking and drunkenness and ‘doing’ place that pervades popular (and at times academic) understanding of backpacking is thus deserving of further critical academic attention (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468797612461082">Jayne et al., 2008b</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In concluding this article, we wish to point to the ways in which investigation of the spatialities of alcohol, drinking and drunkenness offers rich and vivid insights into the emotional and embodied materialities and performativities of backpacking. Of particular importance in our research has been to show the ways in which drinking and drunkenness allows ‘heightened’ and ‘stilled’ experiences bound up with mobilities and emplacements relating to the (dis)location of extended periods of travelling, feelings and practices of belonging and connection with strangers and the (dis)comfort of backpacking. However, while looking at drunken mobilities and backpacking offers important insights into personal experiences/collective drinking practices and experiences, which in part critiques overly simplistic debates around anti-social behaviour and ‘culture clashes’, it is clear that more work need to be done to understand the complex spatialities and temporalities of the diverse and heterogeneous ways that alcohol consumption is central to ‘having fun’ and the experience of both the ‘mundane’ and the ‘exotic’ for backpackers. More broadly, we have also shown how a theoretical and empirical focus on alcohol, drinking and drunkenness offers fruitful avenues of research to contribute to broader agendas geared towards moving beyond ‘rationalist’ explanations for tourist preferences and desires (that so often characterize tourism management and market segmentation research). Towards such an agenda, we are aware that academic attention is only beginning to ‘scratch the surface’ of the relationship between alcohol and drunkenness and holiday experiences. However, our analysis of drinking cultures among backpackers nonetheless offers some important insights into the passionate, emotional, visceral and sensual elements of travelling that are deserving of sustained academic attention.</p>
