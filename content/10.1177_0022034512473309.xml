<abstract>
<p>The objective of this study was to examine whether native low-density lipoprotein (LDL) induces foam cell formation by macrophages and to examine the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on native LDL-induced foam cell formation by macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic>. RAW 264.7 cells were cultured with LDL or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the presence of LPS derived from <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic>. Foam cell formation was determined by staining with Oil-red-O to visualize cytoplasmic lipid droplet accumulation. The expression of LDL-receptor and the degree of internalization of FITC-conjugated LDL in RAW 264.7 cells were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. The images were digitally recorded and analyzed with Image J software. Statistical analysis was performed by JMP software. Foam cell formation was induced by the addition of native LDL in dose- and time-dependent manners, whereas HDL showed no effect. LPS enhanced the foam cell formation induced by native LDL. In addition, LPS stimulated the expression of LDL-receptor protein on RAW 264.7 cells and enhanced the internalization of LDL. The enhancement of foam cell formation induced by LPS and LDL was inhibited by the depolymerizing agent nocodazole and amiloride analog 5-(N-ethyl-N-isoprophyl) amiloride (EIPA). Our findings indicate that LPS plays an important role in foam cell formation by LDL-stimulated macrophages.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Atherosclerosis shows a chronic inflammatory process initiated by the recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages into the subendothelial arterial space and their transformation into lipid-laden foam cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512473309">Ross, 1993</xref>). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is an abundant atherogenic lipoprotein in plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512473309">Pyörälä <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>) and the main component of plasma cholesterol, which enters vessel walls and then, by some mechanism, enters macrophages. Previously, macrophage foam cell formation was reported to occur only through the uptake of modified forms of LDL such as oxidized or aggregated LDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512473309">Kruth, 2001</xref>). However, a previous study demonstrated that macrophage foam cell formation can occur <italic>via</italic> the uptake of native LDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512473309">Kruth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Chronic bacterial infections, including periodontitis, are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512473309">Pussinen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512473309">Spahr <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512473309">Sakurai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which chronic infections increase the likelihood of atherosclerosis are poorly defined.</p>
<p>Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the destruction of tooth-supporting structures. <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, a Gram-negative periodontopathic bacterium, plays a crucial role in the development of periodontal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512473309">Nishihara and Koseki, 2004</xref>). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in periodontal pockets promotes atherogenesis as an inflammatory agent by activating leukocytes. The atherogenic properties of LPS derived from <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic> and their effects on macrophage-like cells, namely, RAW 264.7 cells, have been examined in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512473309">Pussinen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512473309">Lakio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In addition, previous experimental and clinical investigations have indicated that adhesion of monocytes to vascular endothelial cells is an important step in atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512473309">Libby <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Macrophages play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and are one of the major cell types involved in foam cell formation. In contrast, scant attention has been paid to the effects of periodontopathic bacterial LPS on foam cell formation induced by LDL. In the present study, we examined the synergistic effect of LPS on LDL-stimulated macrophages.</p>

<title>Materials &amp; Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0022034512473309">
<title>Cell Culture</title>
<p>The murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and maintained at 37°C in α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM; GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin G (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 µg/mL) in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in air.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022034512473309">
<title>LPS Preparation</title>
<p>LPS was extracted from lyophilized cells of <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic> Y4 by a hot phenol-water method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512473309">Nishihara <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>). The extract was treated with nuclease and washed extensively with pyrogen-free water by ultracentrifugation. The major chemical components of the extract were 41% neutral sugar, 8% hexosamine, and 31% fatty acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034512473309">Tsutsumi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022034512473309">
<title>Cell Viability Assays</title>
<p>Cell viability was determined with the tetrazolium salt WST-1 (4-[3-(4- iodophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1-3-benzene disulfonate) (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan). RAW 264.7 cells were plated in 96-well culture plates at a concentration of 2 x 10<sup>4</sup>/mL and treated with LDL (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (Sigma-Aldrich) solution for 44 hrs. These lipoproteins were derived from human plasma, dissolved in 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.01% EDTA and stored at 4°C. Endotoxin in these lipoproteins was below the detection level as determined by Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (data not shown). WST-1 solution (10 µL) was added to each well, followed by incubation for 4 hrs. Absorbance at 450 nm and 630 nm was measured by means of a Multiskan JX microplate reader (Thermo ELECTRON CO., Yokohama, Japan).</p>

<title>Macrophage Foam Cell Formation and Lipid Staining</title>
<p>We examined the foam cell formation by macrophages using staining with Oil-red-O to visualize cytoplasmic lipid droplet accumulation. RAW 264.7 cells were plated in 96-well culture plates at a concentration of 2 x 10<sup>4</sup>/mL at 1 day before stimulation, then stimulated with LDL or HDL in the presence or absence of nocodazole (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) or 5-(N-ethyl-N-isoprophyl) amiloride (EIPA, Sigma-Aldrich) for various time periods. In some experiments, the cells were pre-cultured with LPS for 24 hrs prior to stimulation with LDL, nocodazole, and EIPA. The cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2), and dehydrated with 60% isopropanol for 1 min, followed by staining with a working solution of Oil-red-O (Primary Cell Co., Ltd., Sapporo, Japan) for 20 min. After cells were washed in 60% isopropanol in PBS, foam cell formation by macrophages was observed under an optical microscope (IX71; Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan), and images were captured digitally in real time by means of a CCD camera.</p>

<sec id="section7-0022034512473309">
<title>Immunofluorescent Staining</title>
<p>The expression of LDL-receptor (LDL-R) in RAW 264.7 cells was examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. RAW 264.7 cells were plated in 8-well chamber plates (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY, USA) at a concentration of 5 x 10<sup>4</sup>/mL, then stimulated with LDL or HDL (100 µg/mL) for various time periods. Next, the cells were rinsed with PBS and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After being washed in PBS, the cells were blocked with blocking buffer (PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin), followed by incubation with anti-LDL-R polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) overnight at 4°C. Bound antibodies were detected with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-goat IgG antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 2 hrs at room temperature. The cells were visualized by means of a Fluorescence Microscope BZ-9000 (KEYENCE Corp., Osaka, Japan). Images were captured digitally in real time and processed with BZ-II imaging software (KEYENCE Corp.; magnification, x 40; exposure time, 2.0 sec). The images were digitally recorded and stored as ‘tagged image file format’ (TIFF) files. Semi-quantitative analysis of the detected proteins was performed by histogram analysis with Image J software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Briefly, each image was first color-split into a single green channel image, followed by thresholding at a value of 0 to 255. The volume of the LDL-R-positive area was then measured as the sum of the pixel number multiplied by the brightness for each level. The average volume of control samples was assigned the value 1.0. At least 30 cells in 5 to 10 fields <italic>per</italic> dish were recorded, and values obtained from 3 dishes on different days were averaged for each time-point.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022034512473309">
<title>LDL Labeling</title>
<p>LDL (1 mg/mL) in 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (pH 9.0) was gently mixed with 10 µL/mL of FITC (2 mg/mL in dimethyl sulfide), then unbound dye was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.4) and 0.01% EDTA buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512473309">Brinkley, 1992</xref>). RAW 264.7 cells (2.5 x 10<sup>3</sup>/mL) were incubated with LPS for 24 hrs and added to FITC-conjugated LDL. After being cultured for an additional 12 hrs, the cells were visualized by means of a Fluorescence Microscope BZ-9000 (KEYENCE Corp.). Images were captured digitally in real time and processed with BZ-II imaging software (KEYENCE Corp.). Semi-quantitative analysis of the internalization was performed by histogram analysis with Image J software. The stained area was measured for 30 cells in 10 fields <italic>per</italic> dish and averaged for each time-point. The percentage of positive cells was calculated as internalized cell number/total cell number × 100.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022034512473309">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis of foam cell formation by macrophages was conducted with JMP software, version 8.0.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). One-way analysis of variance was used to analyze the manner in which the distribution of each continuous variable differed among the groups. A Tukey-Kramer HSD (honestly significant difference) test was utilized to examine differences in regard to group means. In immunofluorescence staining analysis, statistical significance was determined by the Dunnett test.</p>

<title>Foam Cell Formation by Macrophages</title>
<p>We examined the effect of LDL on foam cell formation by macrophages. Treatment with LDL visually increased foam cell formation dose- and time-dependently, whereas HDL had almost no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512473309">Figs. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512473309">1C</xref>). To elucidate the effect of LPS on the foam cell formation induced by LDL, we treated RAW 264.7 cells with LPS (1 µg/mL) for 24 hrs, and then cultured them with LDL for 48 hrs. Treatment with LPS enhanced the foam cell formation by RAW 264.7 cells induced by LDL in a time-dependent manner up to 48 hrs, compared with the formation by RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LDL in the absence of LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512473309">Figs. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512473309">1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Periodontitis is a bacterial infection with tooth-supporting tissue destruction, eventually leading to tooth loss. Gram-negative <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic> is involved in the pathology of several kinds of periodontitis. <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic> activates leukocytes because of expressing 2 exotoxins, a cytolethal distending toxin and a leukotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512473309">Johansson, 2011</xref>). There is increasing evidence that foam cells present in atheromatous lesions are macrophages derived from circulating monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512473309">Schaffner <italic>et al.</italic>, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512473309">Gerrity, 1981</xref>). Several micro-organisms have been implicated in the infectious etiology of atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512473309">Haraszthy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), and several investigations have attempted to relate periodontitis to cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512473309">Mattila, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512473309">Cairo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In the present study, we used a homogeneous clonal population of murine RAW 264.7 cells to elucidate the role of LPS derived from <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic> in the formation of foam cells by macrophages. This cell line is known to exhibit lipid accumulation and foam cell formation <italic>via</italic> scavenger receptor-mediated endocytosis and constitutive macropinocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034512473309">Yao <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although macrophage foam cell formation was reported to occur only through the uptake of modified forms of LDL, such as oxidized or aggregated LDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512473309">Kruth, 2001</xref>), our results revealed that foam cell formation occurred through the uptake of native LDL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512473309">Fig. 1</xref>). A previous study reported that oxidized LDL induced apoptosis, reduced the viability of RAW 264.7 cells, and enhanced cell aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512473309">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Neither LDL nor HDL used in this study had an effect on the cell viability of RAW 264.7 cells. These results may exclude the possible involvement of the phenomenon that the oxidation of native LDL enhanced foam cell formation through cell aggregation. In addition, LPS was shown to induce further foam cell formation by macrophages in the presence of exogenous LDL, suggesting that periodontopathic bacteria are associated with increased risk of cardiac damage. <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic> is an important etiological agent of several kinds of periodontitis as well as endocarditis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034512473309">Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Chronic periodontitis is characterized by multiple episodes of bacteremia, which is an event that allows this pathogenic organism to migrate to areas of atherosclerotic plaque.</p>
<p>LDL-R functions as a primary receptor for binding and internalization of plasma-derived LDL cholesterol and regulates plasma LDL concentrations. The expressions of LDL receptors are subject to feedback control by intracellular cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022034512473309">Ye <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). In the present study, we demonstrated that LPS significantly increased LDL-R protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512473309">Fig. 2</xref>). Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain-reaction analysis also revealed that LPS stimulation increased in LDL-R mRNA copies as compared with untreated control RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown). This is consistent with a previous study which demonstrated that LPS significantly increased native LDL accumulation in THP-1 macrophages, specifically <italic>via</italic> the LDL-R pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022034512473309">Ye <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that chronic inflammation may fundamentally modify cholesterol homeostasis by disrupting LDL receptor feedback regulation.</p>
<p>In addition to receptor-mediated endocytosis, macrophages possess high-level macropinocytosis activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512473309">Steinman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1983</xref>). Foam cell formation by macrophages was previously thought to occur only by receptor-mediated uptake of LDL. However, recent studies have revealed that macropinocytosis is one of the important mechanisms for native LDL uptake and foam cell formation by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512473309">Kruth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512473309">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512473309">Anzinger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>), as well as an actin-dependent process, including membrane ruffling and formation of membrane vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512473309">Lee and Knecht, 2002</xref>). Nocodazole has been shown to partially inhibit macropinocytosis in mouse-derived macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512473309">Racoosin and Swanson, 1992</xref>). It is well-known that nocodazole disrupts associations between microtubules and the plasma membrane, which normally permit macropinocytosis to occur. Moreover, the addition of EIPA, a specific inhibitor of macropinocytosis, Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange blocker, also attenuated foam cell formation induced by LDL and LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512473309">Feng <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). We found that not only nocodazole, but also EIPA, remarkably inhibited the effect of LPS on LDL-induced foam cell formation by RAW 264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512473309">Fig. 4</xref>). On the basis of these findings, we speculate that enhancement of LDL-induced foam cell formation by LPS is partially dependent on macropinocytosis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results show that LPS enhances the foam cell formation induced by LDL by activating LDL-R expression and macropinocytosis in RAW 264.7 cells. Although additional studies are needed to examine the correlation of native LDL and LPS with regard to etiology of atherosclerosis, by <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, we propose that LPS derived from periodontopathic bacteria is involved in the induction of atherogenesis mediated by LDL.</p>
