<abstract>
<p>Models of patient–physician decision making are typically framed on a continuum of discourses and practices ranging from patient autonomy to physician paternalism, with the middle ground being occupied by terms such as <italic>shared decision making</italic>. Critiques of these models center on the gulf between these idealized models and actual practice and on how context influences decision-making practices. In this article I focus on how 11 Canadian family physicians talked about patient–physician decision making in interviews about their diagnostic and treatment practices for depression. I adopt a discursive approach to analyzing extracts from these interviews, and show how these physicians constructed themselves as engaging in acts of professional judgment and persuasion, and patients as having the final say in decision making about treatment for depression. I argue that whether the intertwining of discourses of physician influence and patient autonomy is understood as a balance of power between physicians and patients is an open question.</p>

<body>
<p>Over the past three decades, much attention has been directed to questions about whether and how patients and physicians work together to make treatment decisions (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311420738">Charles, Gafni, &amp; Whelan, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311420738">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311420738">Edwards &amp; Elwyn, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311420738">Elwyn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311420738">Makoul &amp; Clayman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311420738">Wirtz, Cribb, &amp; Barber, 2006</xref>). Conceptual developments with respect to these questions have typically been focused on the construction of models of patient– physician relationships that appear as ideal types or categories arranged on a continuum from physician paternalism to patient autonomy. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311420738">Emanuel and Emanuel (2000)</xref> defined the paternalistic model as being characterized by patient assent to the physician’s decision about what is best for the patient, and the patient autonomy or informative (or informed) model as being characterized by patient choice of and control over medical care, coupled with physician responsibility for the provision of information and implementation of the patient’s choice.</p>
<p>The so-called “middle ground” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311420738">Makoul &amp; Clayman, 2006</xref>, p. 301) between paternalism and informed choice has been occupied by several terms and models, the most common of which is shared decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311420738">Charles et al., 1997</xref>). This model has been defined in various ways (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311420738">Charles et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311420738">Moumjid, Gafni, Brémond, &amp; Carrère, 2007</xref>), but generally requires that patients and physicians explain and define the problem; present options; discuss the pros and cons of the options; explicate patient values and preferences, as well as physician knowledge and recommendations; periodically check and clarify understandings; and make or explicitly defer a decision (Makoul &amp; Clayman). As the continuum between patient autonomy and physician paternalism has been increasingly specified, gaps between these models and actual practice have become more evident. For example, researchers widely acknowledge that an actual decision-making process rarely fits any of these idealized models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311420738">Charles et al., 1999</xref>). That is, it is possible to combine elements of one model with those of another in a single decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311420738">Wirtz et al., 2006</xref>). What model is most appropriate can also depend on the circumstances in which a decision is being made, the preferences of those involved, and the knowledge that is available. So, one model does not fit all. In addition, empirical studies indicate that shared decision making does not often occur in practice. For example, in an update on shared decision making in Canada, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311420738">Légaré, Stacey, and Forest (2007)</xref> reported that although respondents to consumer health surveys overwhelmingly endorsed the notion that responsibility for making decisions about medical care should not be borne solely by health providers, general practitioners perceived their role as relieving patient anxiety and complying with their expectations rather than engaging them in shared decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732311420738">Tudiver et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, there is evidence that primary care providers have difficulty envisioning the process of clarifying and incorporating patients’ values in shared decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311420738">Légaré et al., 2006</xref>) and that, even with training, they had difficulty integrating the competencies of shared decision making into their practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311420738">Towle, Godolphin, Grams, &amp; Lamarre, 2006</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732311420738">
<title>Shared Decision Making in the Context of Depression</title>
<p>Much of the literature on shared decision making is based in the context of acute-care decisions, such as would be required, for example, in newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311420738">Charles et al., 1997</xref>). How decisions are made in the context of chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes) or in the context of mental health care, such as for depression, remains unclear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311420738">Montori, Gafni, and Charles (2006)</xref> argued that decision making with respect to chronic conditions might require a more active role on the part of the patient, because the time available for making a decision can be longer than in acute conditions and there is more opportunity to revisit and reverse decisions. Although depression is often compared to diabetes, particularly in the marketing of antidepressants by pharmaceutical companies, it is clear that it can be both chronic and acute.</p>
<p>Variability in the course of depression is not the only element that makes this state of being rather complex and sometimes contested terrain. Differing understandings of what constitutes and causes depression, and how to diagnose and treat it, also exist. For instance, despite the availability of a set of diagnostic criteria in the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311420738">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>), there is evidence that general practitioners, who treat most patients diagnosed as depressed in many Westernized countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311420738">Callahan &amp; Berrios, 2005</xref>), differ widely in their conceptions of depression and report uncertainty about the correct criteria for diagnosing and treating depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311420738">Andersson, Troein, &amp; Lindberg, 2001</xref>). In addition, accompanying the absence of a “blood test” for confirming a diagnosis of depression are the many explanatory models, including biological (e.g., genetics, sex hormones), psychological (e.g., personality traits or cognitive and interpersonal styles), social (e.g., adverse life circumstances), and multifactorial (e.g., diathesis stress), that often make clear-cut judgments about etiology very difficult. Similarly, treatment options are, in theory, plentiful, including, for example, watchful waiting, antidepressant medication, psychotherapy, exercise, meditation, relaxation, yoga, acupuncture, herbal remedies, and self-help groups (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311420738">Mazure, Keita, &amp; Blehar, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>To complicate matters, choice of treatment sometimes does not map neatly on to presumed etiology because of availability and affordability of services and patient or physician preferences. For example, in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311420738">Rogers, May, and Oliver (2001)</xref>, general practitioners reported being constrained in their treating of depression by the lack of availability of specialist care. Evidence from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311420738">Hyde et al. (2005)</xref> indicated that general practitioners in their study valued antidepressants, but also experienced discomfort with prescribing them for what could be self-limiting conditions of distress. All of this variation in how a label of depression is applied, how causes are understood, and how treatments are determined make depression an interesting space for the study of how decision making with regard to care is constructed and performed.</p>
<p>Research on decision making with respect to care for depression is presently limited to a few studies, most of which were focused on patients and were based in an objectivist epistemology. For example, studies in which scales and questionnaires were used to assess patient satisfaction with care in the context of shared decision making provide evidence that shared decision making was positively associated with satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311420738">Loh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311420738">Swanson, Bastani, Rubenstein, Meredith, &amp; Ford, 2007</xref>), but not with a reduction in the severity of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311420738">Loh et al., 2007</xref>). In a study designed to investigate depressed patients’ perceptions of the treatment decision-making process with general practitioners, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311420738">Simon, Loh, Wills, and Härter (2006)</xref> analyzed interviews with patients using a binary content coding system focused on global content themes. They reported that patients described engaging in shared decision making about treatment while also saying they lacked information about depression and treatment options. Studies in which physicians were included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311420738">Loh et al., 2006</xref>) or were the focus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311420738">Young, Bell, Epstein, Feldman, &amp; Kravitz, 2008</xref>) involved the analysis of audio-recorded consultations with patients (actual or simulated) through the use of a standardized coding system. In both of these studies, observed engagement of patients and/or physicians in shared decision making was low. As a collective, the existing research leaves unanswered questions about how the encounters between patients and physicians proceed and are made meaningful.</p>
<p>To date, researchers have not focused on how physicians construct treatment decision making for depression. Such research can provide evidence as to how physicians take up existing discourses that define models of patient–physician decision making. The present study was part of a larger program of research on both physicians’ and lay persons’ accounts of diagnostic and treatment practices for depression, and the implications of these accounts for patient–physician relationships. I focus here solely on physicians’ accounts of treatment practices.</p>

<sec id="section2-1049732311420738">
<title>Epistemology and Methodology</title>
<p>I grounded this research in a constructionist epistemology. Specifically, I assumed that (a) the ways in which we understand the world are historically and culturally specific; (b) knowledge is based not on objective observation of the world, but is constructed in the interactions of people; (c) language is central to the construction of knowledge; and (d) different constructions bring with them different kinds of actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311420738">Burr, 1995</xref>). Consistent with this epistemological stance, I adopted the methodology of discourse analysis and used an approach that combines an analysis of what people say, how they say it, and what they accomplish by it, with an investigation of the possible consequences of such actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732311420738">Wetherell, 1998</xref>) and of how this talk is part of broader cultural discourses. I paid particular attention to the physicians’ use of category systems, metaphors, stylistic and grammatical features, and rhetorical strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311420738">Potter &amp; Wetherell, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311420738">Wood &amp; Kroger, 2000</xref>) in the context of research interviews.</p>

<sec id="section4-1049732311420738">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>All family physicians listed in the telephone directory of a midsized Canadian prairie city (<italic>n</italic> = 165) received a letter inviting them to participate in “a program of research investigating how physicians make decisions to diagnose and treat patients for depression, and how patients who are diagnosed as depressed understand the diagnostic and treatment practices of their physicians.” An honorarium of $150 CDN was offered. Eleven physicians (5 women) agreed to participate in in-depth individual interviews held in the spring of 2009. The participants ranged in age from 33 to 71 years (average age = 51 years) and had been in practice between 3 and 41 years (average = 21 years). At the time of the interview, 9 were in full-time practice; 6 were salaried and worked in publicly funded settings, and 5 worked in private practice on a fee-for-service basis.</p>

<sec id="section5-1049732311420738">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Behavioral Research Ethics Board of the University of Saskatchewan. Each physician was informed of the procedures of the study and of his or her rights both verbally and through a written, signed consent form. The interviews were conducted by me and one of my graduate students and consisted of two parts: the first part, conducted by me, focused on questions pertaining to how the physicians went about diagnosing and treating depression; the second part was conducted either by me or by my graduate student and focused on whether and how patients made requests for antidepressants and how such requests influenced the physicians’ diagnostic and treatment practices.</p>
<p>Very few questions directly asked the physicians about decision-making processes. For example, we asked them to describe how they went about determining if one of their patients was depressed; how they determined whether, and how, to treat a patient for depression; whether the nature of their diagnostic and treatment practices for depression had changed over the time they had been in practice; how satisfied they were with the quality of care they could provide to patients who were diagnosed and treated as depressed; and how they approached the situation when one of their patients was making a request for an antidepressant or when a patient who had been prescribed antidepressants stopped taking them before recommended. We also asked questions specific to their use of prescriptions for antidepressants (e.g., For what reasons, or under what circumstances, do you prescribe antidepressants? Are there circumstances that lead you to prescribe antidepressants [or not to prescribe] which you later questioned?) and to their use of other treatments (e.g., Do you recommend treatments other than antidepressants for depression? If so, what do you recommend and under what circumstances?). We used this approach to elicit talk about decision-making processes in the context of physicians talking about their practices. Each interview was audio-recorded, lasted between 1 and 2 hours, and was transcribed verbatim with all identifying information excluded (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311420738">Jefferson, 1985</xref> for transcription notation). Each physician was given the opportunity to view and release all or part of his or her transcript and to make alterations as desired. The full transcript was released by each physician; requested alterations were limited to the removal of “mmhm’s” and “uhs,” and the correction of technical terms.</p>
<p>Analysis involved multiple readings of the transcripts, sometimes while listening to the whole or parts of the audio recordings of the interviews. During these readings, I noted extracts that I deemed relevant to my research question, copied these extracts into a separate file, and immersed myself in reading and rereading these extracts while returning to the full transcripts in an iterative process. For the purpose of this article, I then selected a small number of extracts that illustrate the variation in how the physicians talked about the ways in which treatment decisions for depression were made. As a means of addressing the need for quality control, I present these extracts in their entirety to provide the evidence for my claims (“I” indicates interviewer and “P” indicates physician).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732311420738">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>In this analysis, I focus on variations in the physicians’ use of two dominant discourses: physician influence and patient autonomy. One variation was constituted by the intertwining of a discourse of physician influence as professional judgment with a discourse of patient autonomy as freedom to choose.</p>
<sec id="section7-1049732311420738">
<title>Physician Influence as Professional Judgment; Patient Autonomy as Freedom to Choose</title>
<graphic id="img1-1049732311420738" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1049732311420738-img1.tif"/>
<p>In response to my question that framed treatment decision making in terms of what the physician did, this participant began with a short, unqualified declarative statement (ll. 13-16) that constructed the decision-making process as a simple offering of all treatment options about which the patient alone made a decision. However, in mapping out the options that were matched to the presumed cause of depression, there was a clear shift to a more qualified account of how the presentation of options proceeded. For example, the depth of explanation provided about the presumed and complex neurochemical basis of depression was “all dependent on the person’s knowledge (.) . . . a:nd in:tellect ” (ll. 34-37); even if a person with a major depressive disorder did not want counseling, he was required to talk to someone at some point (ll. 45-47); with seasonal affective disorder no option was provided other than that which was presumed to be the treatment of choice (ll. 51-52). In the final statement of this extract, the physician constructed her presentation of treatment options as much more nuanced and situation-specific, and perhaps limited, than she did in the opening sentence; i.e., it was subject to a considerable degree of professional judgment on her part (ll. 54-57). I read this extract as an illustration of how taking up the discourse of the idealized model of patient autonomy in decision making was quickly transformed into a discourse of professional judgment in talk about actual practices. Patient–physician decision making, then, might require a different construction than “physician provides all options: patient decides,” as is characteristic of the informed model.</p>
<p>The juxtaposition of talk about providing treatment options from which patients chose and talk about professional knowledge, judgment, and experience was also evident in the interview with another physician. My question at the beginning of the following extract follows this physician’s provision of an example of a 50-year-old patient who became depressed following a heart attack.</p>
<graphic id="img2-1049732311420738" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1049732311420738-img2.tif"/>
<p>This physician’s statement that he would offer medication “obviously” (l. 3) even though he did not find it very useful indicates the normative status of medication as a treatment for depression: it was offered even if the physician did not think it was the treatment of choice. As in the previous extract, this physician constructed his practices as involving influence via the provision of clinical judgment, e.g., “&gt;I’ll tell you&lt; if I think it’ll work or not” (ll. 10-12) and education about the “biopsychosocial model” and its accompanying treatments (ll. 25-30). However, woven throughout this extract is the obligation to present patients with options, as is evident in the statement “you have to throw all the options on the table” (ll. 21-23) and in the use of “but” (l. 32) after the explication of the matching of treatments to components of the model.</p>
<p>The use of “McDonald’s” (l. 37) as a metaphor for patient choice implied not only that the choice of options ultimately rested with the patient, but that such choice was relatively plentiful and straightforward: like choosing between French fries, a Big Mac, and a cheeseburger, making a decision about treatment for depression was a matter of selecting what the consumer desired from among many options. Again, the offering of options by the physician was constructed as a nuanced process of influence involving professional judgment and academic/scientific knowledge, with patient decision making being a simple matter of picking an option.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732311420738">
<title>Physician Persuasion as Managed; Patient Autonomy as Given</title>
<p>A second variation in the intertwining of discourses of physician influence and patient autonomy was constituted through talk of physician persuasion in the context of patient autonomy as normative. Such instances of physician talk about treatment decision making focused less on the provision of options and more on the practices used to influence patient decision making, particularly with regard to one option: the use of antidepressants. In the next extract, the physician was responding to a question about whether he found any dilemmas in his practice in which there might have been a disconnect between himself and the patient.</p>
<graphic id="img3-1049732311420738" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1049732311420738-img3.tif"/>
<p>In line 3, this physician referenced a metaphor he had used previously in the interview: that he did a “sell job,” usually with respect to antidepressant medication, to get the patient to “buy in.” Convincing patients was constructed as a matter of educating them with empirical data and “facts” (l. 8)—a practice against which it could be seen as difficult to argue. However, his statement “&gt;and all I’m doing&lt; is sharing my best experience . . .” (ll. 15-16) suggests otherwise, as it simultaneously worked to guard against any claim that his convincing and educating was unwarranted, and raises the possibility that his actions might have been taken as more than just “sharing [his] best experience.” That is, they might be construed as exerting too much influence. Constructing his job as a matter of providing “information” (l. 22) and “best opinion” (l. 24) again implied that there should be little for patients to argue against. In the end, however, patients were characterized as having the final say. This physician’s use of “oh no” before his repeating of my phrase “it rests with them” (l. 30) suggests that control of decision making by patients could not be, and was not, otherwise; that is, it was normative. However, use of this “soft sell” (l. 35) did have its limits, which, as in previous extracts, were constructed in terms of professional judgment about the necessity for more forceful persuasion and intervention in some instances (ll. 37-42).</p>
<p>The metaphors of the “sell job” and the “buy in” suggest a root metaphor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311420738">Lakoff &amp; Johnson, 1980</xref>) of patient–physician decision making as a business transaction. As in all business transactions, the seller (the physician) was constructed as having something that the buyer (the patient) might or might not choose to purchase; and although the seller could engage in acts of varying degrees of persuasion, the buyer was constructed as having the final say. So, not only did the patient have the freedom to choose among the options presented by the physician, as indicated in the first two extracts, he or she had the power to take up or ignore the expertise of the physician. Like the seller, then, all that the physician had in the end was the power of persuasion.</p>
<p>Framing one’s practices in terms of discourses of professional judgment and persuasion was also evident in the physicians’ talk about not prescribing antidepressant medication in response to some patients’ requests. In the next extract, the need for what might be characterized as less direct persuasion was emphasized.</p>
<graphic id="img4-1049732311420738" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1049732311420738-img4.tif"/>
<p>After establishing the professional limits that she would set in deciding whether to comply with a patient’s request for medication (ll. 1-6), this physician qualified her declaration (“but”; l. 8) with a statement about how she would do so. Her laughter during this statement (“but uh (.) I us(h)ually ((laughter)) try and (1) do it in a way that they’re the ones that (.) decide that ((loud laughter)) (1.5)” (ll. 8-12) might be read as her acknowledging that she was admitting to engaging in subtle persuasive maneuvers. In response to a possible charge that such maneuvers were indeed manipulative or perhaps even unprofessional, she emphasized repeatedly and underscored that they were “certainly not manipulative” (ll. 14-16), and then reestablished her professional responsibility to engage in a risk–benefit analysis and to act in ways that minimize harm (ll. 18-21).</p>
<p>As in the previous extract, I read lines 14-32 in this extract as the physician’s guarding against counterarguments or accusations that she was trying to influence patients’ decision making, and that to do so in instances that were not considered extreme was inappropriate. However, again, as in the previous extract, this physician did not shy away from using the word “convince” (l. 27) to construct the intent and goal of her actions, even though she acknowledged that, in the end, the patient could and will do what he or she wanted (ll. 38-41). In this narrative, if the physician could not convince the patient of her treatment choice, the patient would simply take advantage of other available options, i.e., the medi-clinic (a walk-in clinic that enables patients to be seen by the next available physician without an appointment) to get what he or she wanted. The use of “just go down the street” in lines 38-39 constructs such an action as both highly likely and easy, and raises the prospect that securing a prescription for antidepressants was not difficult.</p>
<p>As in extracts 1 and 2, discourses of physician influence and patient autonomy intertwine in extracts 3 and 4. In these latter two extracts, talk of influence was carefully managed by the physicians and qualified by references to professional responsibilities and the realities of patient autonomy.</p>

<sec id="section9-1049732311420738">
<title>Physician Compliance as Justified; Patient Autonomy as Control</title>
<p>The physicians in our study also talked about and justified instances in which they constructed themselves as not exerting influence and as complying with patients’ requests, again in the context of the reality of patients directing and controlling treatment. One physician structured his response to my question about how he would go about treating depression by framing his “standard approach” as telling patients that depression was “multifactorial” and “different for every patient,” and as offering “supportive counseling” to every patient who was given a diagnosis of depression, and/or “pharmacotherapy” to those whose severity of depression warranted it. Then the following exchange ensued:</p>
<graphic id="img5-1049732311420738" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1049732311420738-img5.tif"/>
<p>Although this physician constructed his “standard approach” in terms that could be considered the received view of treatment for depression, he qualified all of what he just said with the phrase “but and usually to be honest” (l. 1). This phrase marked the importance of what he was about to say, i.e., that “patients: have their own ideas and it’s (.) they actually usually drive treatment more than I do” (ll. 2-5). It is as if a standard (perhaps stereotyped) version of physician-determined treatment for depression was not what actually occurred in practice, and that perhaps my framing the question in terms of how physicians go about determining if and how to treat a patient for depression was inappropriate. The notion of patients having “their own ideas” also suggested that the treatment of depression was something about which it was possible for a lay person to have knowledge, perhaps unlike some other problems that confront family physicians.</p>
<p>Despite my orienting the conversation to our interest in joint decision making (ll. 6-16), this physician continued with his account of patient-driven treatment decision making (ll. 28-47). His specific reference to depression in lines 28-33 might be read as an oblique invocation of the power of the placebo effect in the treatment of depression. Constructing at least part of a treatment’s effectiveness in terms of the patient’s belief in it set up the conditions for the physician to justify his decision not to “resist” (l. 43) what the patient wanted, particularly if what the patient wanted was “fairly: (.) ben↑i::gn↑” (l. 47). So, patient influence in treatment decision making was warranted on the basis of it being what “actually” occurred, its contribution to treatment effectiveness, and, in the case of desire for antidepressants, its relative lack of harm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732311420738">
<title>Physician Influence as Limited; Patient Autonomy as Given</title>
<p>Another physician constructed his influence as being limited by what were considered the social determinants of depression. In response to the question about how he went about determining whether and how to treat depression, this physician constructed his approach as being based on the biopsychosocial model in which the first tier of intervention involved determining if there was anything correctable in the person’s life. Extract 6 occurred after some talk about this tier.</p>
<graphic id="img6-1049732311420738" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1049732311420738-img6.tif"/>
<p>Lines 1-5 of this extract can be read in at least two ways. First, the phrase “I’d like to say I have more power to do that” (ll. 3-4) and the word “surprisingly” (l. 5) could invoke both the notion that having more power was good and desirable, and that physician power was normative and expected. Second, this part of the extract functioned as an admission of what the physician constructed as actually the case: that he had little power to influence the social circumstances of his patients’ lives. He further extended this argument in lines 6-21 by taking the position that being able to influence these circumstances might have been unrealistic for both physicians and patients.</p>
<p>The metaphor of feeling “like a person looking (.5) through a glass ↑window?↑” (ll. 31-32), and its subsequent elaboration (ll. 34-40), could also be read in a variety of ways: that there was a barrier between this physician and his patient; that he could see the patient but was not heard by him or her; that the patient was in the role of the consumer; that his effort at trying to get the attention of the consumer was forceful and loud, but to no avail. As in the previous extracts, this physician took up discourses of patient autonomy and physician influence and wove them together in nuanced ways. His use of the qualifiers “external” (l. 39) and “onc:e people leave my office” (ll. 42-43) suggest the possibility of his having some influence while he had the patient in front of him. However, attempts at influence, i.e., “mak[ing] recommendations” (ll. 47-48), could be realized or not, depending on the actions of the patient. Similarly, although the phrase “they ↓do what they’re going to do↓” (ll. 43-44) could be read as an instantiation of a discourse of patient autonomy, it could also connote a predetermined, and perhaps even destined quality to these actions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present analysis of physician interview talk about treatment practices for depression provides one example of how hybridity in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311420738">Charles et al. (1999)</xref> framework for decision making is constituted. In the physicians’ accounts of treatment decision making, they repeatedly employed and intertwined two discourses. They employed a discourse of physician influence that was constituted by talk of professional knowledge and judgment in the service of persuading patients on a course(s) of actions. In the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311420738">Charles et al. (1999)</xref> framework, the amount of information exchanged is constructed as ranging from the minimum legally required in the paternalistic model to all relevant for decision making in the informed and shared decision-making models. In the present study, the physicians typically listed what might be considered empirically supported treatments over which they had some control, i.e., counseling in their office or via a referral or pharmacotherapy via the prescription pad. In addition, they qualified their accounts of the provision of treatment options by invoking their knowledge and judgment of what might work in a particular situation with a particular patient, and their professional responsibility to maximize treatment effectiveness and minimize harm. In doing so they gave shape to what was constructed as “all relevant medical information needed for decision making” in both the shared and informed models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311420738">Charles et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311420738">Murray, Charles, &amp; Gafni, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although “throw[ing] all the options on the table” and “offer[ing] them all to the patient” could be understood as instantiations of a rhetoric of choice that worked to construct the presentation of options as neutral and complete, this rhetoric was qualified by the physicians’ listing of only particular options in their accounts of their practices. By not listing all possible therapeutic interventions, the physicians went beyond the role of technical expert that defined the informed model of patient–physician decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311420738">Emanuel &amp; Emanuel, 2000</xref>, pp. 39-40).</p>
<p>Although the use of persuasion would be considered incompatible with the model of informed decision making, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311420738">Charles et al. (1999)</xref> were clear that it could be a legitimate part of shared decision making. In response to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311420738">Karnieli-Miller and Eisikovits (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311420738">Eggly (2009)</xref> similarly argued that the dichotomy between persuasive communication by physicians and patient–physician partnerships is false, and that use of such communication does not preclude shared decision making. However, far from being constructed as a straightforward process of physicians persuading patients to accept their recommendation, the physicians in the present study carefully managed talk of persuasion by denying that they typically engaged in a “hard sell” or were “manipulative,” by turning the tables and constructing themselves as persuadable, and by acknowledging the limits of their powers to persuade (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311420738">Dew, Dowell, McLeod, Collings, &amp; Bushnell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311420738">Rogers et al., 2001</xref>, p. 327). Such variability suggests that persuasion can be a socially sensitive topic in interviews with physicians, and that they construct it in much more nuanced ways than is typical of the descriptions in idealized models. How patients respond to such accounts of persuasion is worth exploring. Do they embrace or resist the metaphor of the “soft sell?” Do they accept physicians’ constructions of the limits of their own power and, if so, what consequences accompany such acceptance? Is physicians’ sensitivity to the use of persuasion a recognizable discursive move in the clinical encounter?</p>
<p>In the present study, then, how the physicians constructed what they did up to the point where a treatment decision was made, i.e., in what has been termed the information exchange and deliberation stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311420738">Charles et al., 1999</xref>), was not inconsistent with certain components of a model of shared decision making. However, the presence of a second discourse of patient autonomy in decision making was clearly inconsistent with this model; rather, it was characteristic of the informed model. The notion of patients having the final say was presented straightforwardly, as a given, as “the way it is,” with the only contestation occurring in the context of talk of more serious cases of depression. This notion of patient autonomy in decision making has been metaphorized as consumer sovereignty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311420738">Charles et al., 1999</xref>, p. 658), and conceptualized as a central component in what is dubbed “the era of the consumer,” where patients are seen as “the new locus of decision making in the health care system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311420738">Robinson, 2001</xref>)” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311420738">Flynn, Smith, &amp; Davis, 2002</xref>, p. 456).</p>
<p>In mapping the present analysis on to idealized conceptualizations of patient–physician decision making, I am arguing, then, that the physicians used discourses consistent with components of shared decision making in talking about the processes leading up to a decision about treatment, and then engaged in a discourse consistent with a model of informed decision making when talking about who actually made the decision. This marrying of discourses of physician influence and patient autonomy is similar to the model of enhanced autonomy outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311420738">Quill and Brody (1996)</xref>, which is oriented to finding a balance between the power of physician recommendations and the power of patient choice.</p>
<sec id="section12-1049732311420738">
<title>The Discourse of Patient Autonomy</title>
<p>Although the discourse of patient autonomy and choice in treatment decision making for depression was naturalized and justified by the physicians in the present study, it is important to recognize that this discourse can also obscure some problematic possibilities. First, as has been noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311420738">Bryant, Bown, Bekker, and House (2007)</xref>, the freedom to choose among a list of options is often not as unproblematic as the rhetoric of patient choice implies. Access to specialized services, such as psychiatry and counseling, is often difficult; antidepressant medication can be costly and produce significant side effects; and the choice of a so-called alternative treatment, e.g., herbal remedies, is sometimes viewed with suspicion by physicians. Second, sorting through many treatment options and fear of implementing a depression treatment decision because of inadequate information about the pros and cons of options (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311420738">Simon et al., 2006</xref>) could make autonomous decision making difficult. Third, choosing to forgo a course of treatment or to select a treatment not recommended by one’s physician can sometimes be a difficult decision for patients if they sense, rightly or wrongly, that doing so might negatively affect their relationship with their physician. Fourth, with autonomy can come responsibility and the possibility of blame. Although invoking patient accountability for outcomes was not a dominant discursive move in the talk of the physicians who participated in the present study (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311420738">Thille &amp; Russell, 2010</xref>, for an example of such a move), it is possible for a discourse of patient autonomy to be interpreted in this way. In particular, not benefiting from or not following through with a course of antidepressants or counseling after one has opted for it has the potential for attributions of failure and self-blame which can be particularly problematic for persons diagnosed as depressed.</p>
<p>An important line of future research will be to engage patients who have received a diagnosis of depression in a dialogue with this discourse of patient autonomy, i.e., what do they have to say in response to physicians’ use of this discourse? Do they construct the process of selecting from among a set of options as simple and straightforward? How do they embrace or resist the notion that they have the power to make treatment decisions?</p>

<title>Limitations and Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>The physicians who participated in this study constituted a small proportion of all family physicians in our city. As persons willing to participate in a research study on treatment decision making for depression, they might have had something different to say than their nonparticipating colleagues. In addition, what our participants had to say and the way in which they said it was likely influenced by the use of individual interviews as a method of data generation. Considering the recent critiques of overreliance on the interview in qualitative research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311420738">Potter &amp; Hepburn, 2005</xref>), future research could benefit from accessing data in other contexts, e.g., formal and informal talk in professional forums such as conventions or in-service presentations and discussions, curricular materials for medical students, mental health policy papers, online depression blogs or chat forums, media (newspapers, health shows on radio and television), and texts (professional newsletters, popular magazines).</p>
<p>The notion that physicians can go only so far in their influence, and that patients have the final say in decision making, might not set depression apart from many other conditions treated by family physicians. However, at a time when depression has supposedly become a quite differentiated diagnostic category with defined treatments, the necessity for, and taken-for-granted nature of, patient choice in treatment decision making can be seen as paradoxical: a state of being that has become increasingly medicalized and, by definition, under the authority of the physician is, from the viewpoint of the family physicians in the present study, ultimately under the authority of the patient. Whether this construction of treatment decision making is understood as a balance of power between the physician and the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311420738">Quill &amp; Brody, 1996</xref>) is a question for future research.</p>
