<abstract>
<p>Attention to cultural competence has significantly increased in the human services over the last two decades. Evaluators have long had similar concerns and have made a more concentrated effort in recent years to adapt evaluation methodology to varying cultural contexts. Little of this literature, however, has focused on the extent to which local cultures themselves already contain habits and patterns of evaluative thought that may serve as a basis for such work and for fuller stakeholder participation. This article explores the evaluative instincts expressed in West African proverbs against a background of related research. Consideration of the explicit message and latent meanings of a set of chosen proverbs suggests that the cultures in question are rich in evaluative perspectives. Directions for further research are proposed.</p>

<p>Notions of cultural competence—and prescriptions for attaining it—have become something of a growth industry in the human services over the last two decades. For example, in the H. W. Wilson Omnifile Database the number of refereed articles citing the term in their abstracts grew from 18 in the first-half of the 1990s to 129 in the period from 2006 to 2010. Many of these citations are from the health sciences and social work as well as education, but fields as diverse as legal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098214012447581">Holdman &amp; Seeds, 2008</xref>), counterinsurgency operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098214012447581">Connable, 2009</xref>), and drug-abuse prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1098214012447581">Orlandi, Weston, &amp; Epstein, 1998</xref>) are also represented. </p>
<p>The evaluation profession is a relative latecomer to this domain. In 2004, SenGupta, Hopson, and Thompson-Robinson remarked that “[t]he field of evaluation has a long [way] to go in incorporating cultural context in its everyday practice” (p. 11). However, the American Evaluation Association (AEA) undertook a careful “cultural reading” of the Program Evaluation Standards in 2003, and the following year issued the results of that effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098214012447581">AEA, 2004a</xref>), along with a modification of the Guiding Principles for Evaluators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098214012447581">AEA, 2004b</xref>). That same year it named a task force charged with drafting a “Statement on Cultural Competence in Evaluation.” The document was reviewed by the Association’s Board of Directors and approved by its membership in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1098214012447581">AEA, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The association’s statement recognizes explicitly that evaluators typically work in contexts where multiple cultures interact; that no evaluation can be “culture-free”; and that the profession suffers from a history of inappropriate use of evaluation methods in such environments. It also considers the implications of cultural variation for all phases of evaluation, notably for the values and perspectives inevitably involved in constructing models of how the evaluand works. In addition, it defines cultural competence as a “process” to be carried out more than as a “state” to be attained and suggests that the undertaking may best be compared to an activity of continual learning.</p>
<p>Areas of uncertainty and confusion persist, as is only natural in a domain that has remained underrecognized for so long and that is as politically sensitive as cultural relations. For example, to what degree is acquiring cultural competence a process of becoming increasingly proficient in the patterns and perspectives of Culture X, as opposed to developing facility for recognizing and dealing with cultural difference <italic>per se</italic>? In a similar vein, although the Cultural Competence Statement acknowledges the “complexity of cultural identity” (p. 7), problems of exercising competence in situations where multiple cultures overlap are not directly addressed. There is likewise scant reference to complications introduced by the stratification of cultures and discrepancies in their respective political power. Finally, of course, the possibility that different cultures may contain their own evaluative instincts and routines—a topic to be explored in this article—receives little attention.</p>
<p>The importance of cultural competence for the practice of evaluation derives from at least two overlapping considerations. First, evaluators who are sensitive to and knowledgeable about the cultural values of stakeholder groups can do a much better job of adapting evaluation procedures and instruments to that environment, improving stakeholders’ understanding of the “evaluand” and upgrading the validity of the data collected, than colleagues less attuned to the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098214012447581">Crocker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098214012447581">Merryfield, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1098214012447581">Symonette, 2004</xref>). Second, an evaluation framed in terms familiar to stakeholder groups is more likely than one in an unfamiliar idiom to facilitate buy-in and use of results in the longer term, as well as strengthen the more immediate learning value of the experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098214012447581">Butterfoss &amp; Franciso, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098214012447581">Cousins &amp; Earl, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1098214012447581">Robinson &amp; Cousins, 2004</xref>). These issues are particularly salient in the international arena, where both the frameworks used and the personnel responsible typically span cultural boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098214012447581">Bradley, Mayfield, Mehta, &amp; Rukonge, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098214012447581">Merryfield, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Of course, both the notion of cultural competence and the strategies for participatory or stakeholder-based evaluation that may enhance it are themselves open to question; and these critiques will be addressed in the following section. However, even if one assumes that cultural competence in evaluation is a valid concern, it remains less than clear how to operationalize and achieve it, despite some signal contributions to the debate (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098214012447581">Botcheva, Smith, &amp; Huffman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098214012447581">Hanberger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1098214012447581">Russon, 2008</xref>). Most prescriptions for improved cultural relevance in evaluation emphasize issues of theory adjustment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1098214012447581">Kirkhart, 2010</xref>), instrument adaptation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1098214012447581">Weeks, Swerissen, &amp; Belfrage, 2007</xref>), training for evaluators (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1098214012447581">Thomas &amp; Madison, 2010</xref>), or—occasionally—capacity building among representatives of stakeholder groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098214012447581">Bryson, Patton, &amp; Bowman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1098214012447581">Mathie &amp; Greene, 1997</xref>). There has been little focus on the degree to which the local cultures where evaluators work <italic>already contain</italic> evaluative instincts and insights that may provide one foundation for improved practice and enhanced stakeholder involvement, and on how to mobilize and express such latent resources.</p>
<p>This last issue raises two key questions: How does one identify the evaluative instincts that may be latent in local culture? And how can such insights be utilized in designing and implementing an evaluation? This article explores the first question, and at least broaches the second, through examination of traditional proverbs of the West African Sahel—and the Hausa culture of northern Nigeria and neighboring countries in particular—and by consideration of the evaluative attitudes and insights they express.</p>
<p>The remainder of this article is divided into five sections. The first offers a review of the literature framing the topic: works on cultural competence, participatory and stakeholder-based evaluation, and the nature and dynamics of proverbs. It concludes with a portrait of the physical, historical, and cultural context of the West African Sahel and the Hausa-speaking regions of Nigeria that are the source of most of the data. The second section is devoted to the methods used in the collection, selection, and analysis of relevant proverbs; and the third presents and analyzes an illustrative set of Hausa and broader West African proverbs with particular relevance for evaluation. The fourth section focuses on the practical application of proverbs and proverbial wisdom in the design and conduct of evaluations in the field. Finally, the article considers what one can learn from this exercise about evaluative impulses embedded in aspects of local culture and suggests directions for future research.</p>
<p>My interest in West African proverbs and my experience with their use in human service delivery stem from 10 years’ residence in the region, largely in Niger and Mali, working on the design, administration, and evaluation of adult literacy programs. In the course of that period, I learned the Hausa and Bambara languages and, over ensuing years of short-term consulting work, acquired basic familiarity with a few others as well. </p>

<title>The Quandary of Cultural Competence</title>
<p>The simplest question about cultural competence is the hardest one to answer: what exactly <italic>is</italic> it? There is no lack of discussion or even of scales to measure the attribute (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1098214012447581">Gamst, Dana, &amp; Der-Karbetian, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098214012447581">McAllister &amp; Irvine, 2000</xref>), but each stirs controversy and, collectively, these contributions pose as many questions as they answer.</p>
<p>The AEA Task Force offers no precise definition, preferring to treat cultural competence as a process rather than a “thing,” though it does suggest a set of “essential practices” as “a starting point for developing and implementing a culturally competent evaluation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1098214012447581">AEA, 2011</xref>, p. 7). Other professional fields have been less hesitant. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1098214012447581">Sue (1998</xref>, p. 441), a psychologist, the term simply signifies “an awareness and appreciation of differences in cultural groups, and an ability to effectively communicate across cultural groups.” The National Association of Social Workers defines the concept somewhat more expansively as<disp-quote>
<p>the process by which individuals and systems respond respectfully and effectively to people of all cultures, languages, classes, races, ethnic backgrounds, religions, and other diversity factors in a manner that recognizes, affirms, and values the worth of individuals, families, and communities and protects and preserves the dignity of each. (National Association of Social Workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1098214012447581">NASW], 2001</xref>, p. 11).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1098214012447581">SenGupta et al. (2004</xref>, p. 12) note that “cultural competence in evaluation rests on. . . appreciation for the context at hand and . . . uses responsive and inclusive means to conduct [related inquiry].” They then (p. 13) present their own definition of its application to evaluation:<disp-quote>
<p>Cultural competence in evaluation can be broadly defined as a systematic, responsive inquiry that is actively cognizant, understanding and appreciative of the cultural context in which the evaluation takes place; that frames and articulates the epistemology of the evaluative endeavor; that employs culturally and contextually appropriate methodology; and that uses stakeholder-generated, interpretive means to arrive at . . . results and further use of the findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As noted, evaluators have neither been the first body of professionals to concern themselves with issues of cultural competence nor the ones to deal most extensively with it. The medical and social work professions have accounted for nearly half the refereed articles on the topic published over the last decade across refereed journals tracked by the H. W. Wilson Omnifile Database; and the American Psychological Association (2003) issued its own policy on the topic nearly two decades ago. Sen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1098214012447581">Gupta et al. (2004)</xref> cite precedents for this theme in the development of the evaluation profession, starting with the debate over responsive evaluation in the 1970s and extending through discussions of cross-cultural evaluation, inclusive evaluation, empowerment methods, and participatory evaluation.</p>
<p>The roots of the concept of cultural competence arguably lie in applied anthropology and, deeper still, in the development of ethnography as a methodology of immersion in another culture and a means of grasping that culture from an “emic” (as opposed to a purely <italic>etic</italic>) point of view—that is, as understood and expressed by a person native to that tradition rather than as analyzed by someone external to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098214012447581">Barnard &amp; Spencer, 1996</xref>, pp. 181–182). The contrast between the two viewpoints derives, of course, from the linguistic distinction between phon<italic>etic</italic> and phon<italic>emic</italic> analysis, the latter concerning the speech units recognized by native speakers and the former flowing from a universal (if generally Western-devised) system for identification and categorization of all the discrete sounds made by the human vocal apparatus. In fact, the field of linguistics, which inexorably involves exposure to and immersion in the patterns of different cultures, has given birth to many of the concepts used in analyzing cultural competence, at least since Benjamin Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1098214012447581">Whorf (1956</xref>) maintained, on the basis of his studies of Eskimo speech, that language does not just <italic>express</italic> thought but in fact <italic>shapes</italic> it.</p>
<p>The analysis inherited from linguistics is at the same time where controversy and debate begin. Critics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098214012447581">Harris, 1976</xref>) have attacked the facile extension of the phonemic–phonetic distinction to the realm of culture, which, they point out, is much more complex and variable than language itself. They consequently contest whether culture can be understood simply as a set of rules and whether anyone (insider or outsider) can be said to master it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098214012447581">Carpenter-Song, Schwallie &amp; Longhofer, 2007</xref>). Others see the notion of cultural competence as potentially essentialist if not borderline racist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1098214012447581">Lee &amp; Farrell, 2006</xref>) or critique, from a human service delivery perspective, the “collective identities” and “pathologizing ethnicity” implied by the concept, where therapeutic interaction is based on a presumed prior knowledge of someone’s culture, rather than on the interaction itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1098214012447581">Johnson &amp; Munch, 2009</xref>). As if in response, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098214012447581">Botcheva et al. (2009</xref>, p. 176) propose a “process-oriented approach” to culturally competent evaluation, one that entails ongoing “correction, reflection and adaptation” of design and procedures rather than <italic>a priori </italic>knowledge of the cultural adjustments required.</p>
<p>In a more applied vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098214012447581">Hanberger (2010</xref>) has pointed out that <italic>multicultural </italic>competence is usually of greater importance in evaluation than singular cultural competence, as well as rather different from it, since program evaluations are typically carried out in environments where various cultures interact and evaluators must not so much have deep expertise in any one of them (presuming that is possible) as they must know how to respect and arbitrate among them. For her, the key question is rather “How can an evaluation be designed to be accepted by different groups in a multicultural society?” (p. 182)</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1098214012447581">
<title>Participatory and Stakeholder-Based Evaluation</title>
<p>As noted, methods for promoting stakeholder participation in evaluation have a particular relevance to cultural competence and appropriateness, because they offer one promising avenue for ensuring that viewpoints from the relevant cultures are included in decisions about design, the conduct of inquiry, and strategies of analysis. The issue is particularly germane in international evaluations, given the obvious cultural differences involved, and it was first noted in that realm (e.g., Easton, 1983; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098214012447581">Merryfield, 1985</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098214012447581">Conlin and Stirrat (2008</xref>) have suggested that evaluation in developing countries is impelled to move away from purely positivistic procedures and toward more qualitative and participatory methods by the increased focus of funding agencies on outcomes. Given that program outcomes typically spring from complex cultural roots and reflect multiple forms of causation, they claim that only the broadened lens, inductive reasoning and endogenous viewpoint that these approaches afford are adequate to the task.</p>
<p>There are, of course, multiple levels and types of participation, as the planning literature has pointed out (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098214012447581">Arnstein, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098214012447581">Green, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1098214012447581">Wondolleck, Manring, &amp; Crowfoot, 1996</xref>) and recent work on stakeholder involvement in evaluation has increasingly recognized (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098214012447581">Cornachione, Trombetta, &amp; Cas Nova, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1098214012447581">Plottu &amp; Plottu, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098214012447581">Arnstein’s (1969)</xref> classic article on the ladder of citizen participation distinguishes eight levels ranging from a disguised form of manipulation by elites at the bottom to full-scale citizen control at the top. The higher one goes up the ladder, the stiffer the political opposition from entrenched interests, including, at times, human service professionals committed to defending their territory and expertise. This phenomenon can be the source of a potent contradiction. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1098214012447581">Wadsworth (2001</xref>) has pointed out, full-scale stakeholder participation in evaluation—and, one might note, the type most likely to imbue it with multicultural perspectives—means involvement in design<italic> decisions</italic>, not just in their execution. This requires careful attention to the technical challenges and political conditions of genuine local capacity building, themes first developed in the planning literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098214012447581">Gran, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098214012447581">Honadle, 1981</xref>) and increasingly discussed among evaluators  (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098214012447581">Boyle &amp; Lemaire, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1098214012447581">Stevenson, Florin, Mills, &amp; Andrade,, 2002</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1098214012447581">
<title>Proverbs: Their Nature and Use</title>
<p>Arguably, capacity is most successfully built when one connects with existing competencies and reservoirs of meaning in the client population. Proverbs are a cultural artifact that carries a particular load of related meaning and may embody an indigenous critical perspective. Wolfgang Mieder, perhaps the best known 20th-century student of the subject, offers the following definition (1993, p. 5): <disp-quote>
<p>The proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed and memorable form and which is handed down from generation to generation.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Proverbs are often highly poetic and condensed, like a haiku (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098214012447581">Barber, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1098214012447581">Jang, 2002</xref>). They may be quite elliptical, and appreciating their meaning generally entails “unpacking” the gnomic phrasing. Significantly, the Hausa word for proverb is <italic>karin magana</italic>—literally “folded speech,” a term that evokes its linguistic density and subtlety. An example in the Hausa language might be <italic>girman kai, rawanin tsiya</italic>, which translates as “big head, indigent turban” and conveys in just four words the idea that an inflated self-image and boastful behavior lead to beggarly status in the community. Though universal, proverbs are products of oral culture and so are best developed and preserved in oral and highly communal societies. Mieder notes that West Africa is a region especially rich in proverbs but that they are little used in the mainstream culture of North America, even if present in a variety or subcultures and hybrid traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1098214012447581">Mieder, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Proverbs have great importance in West Africa and in Hausa society in particular, though there is a clear danger of overessentializing these cultural expressions. As a form of popular poetry, they are legion and more are continually being forged or modified. An early collection by a British colonial administrator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1098214012447581">Merrick, 1905</xref>) attempts to explicate approximately 350 of them. A more recent compilation of Hausa sayings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1098214012447581">Yunusu (1989</xref>), a Nigerian scholar, includes over 1,500. In fact, Global Mapping International, a Christian mission organization, catalogued no less than 27,000 African proverbs from all major languages of the continent in the late 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1098214012447581">Nussbaum, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098214012447581">Contran (2007</xref>) refers to the “precious oil of words” in African tradition and claims that proverbs embody the “essence of culture.” As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098214012447581">Barber (2005</xref>) points out, African proverbs are by nature a blend of “text” (or quasi-standardized formulation) and oral performance (which is temporary and malleable), and oral performances are prime markers of life stages in many West African cultures. Amadou Hampâté <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098214012447581">Bâ (1996</xref>), the Malian ethologist, who said “I graduated from the great university of the Spoken Word taught in the shade of baobab trees,” divides adult male life in the Fulani culture into three periods: young adulthood, when the man may attend village council meetings but not speak up without being asked; middle adulthood, when he may take the floor himself and is ready and fit for social management responsibilities; and old age, when, once again, the individual recedes from direct public interchange in public fora but offers wise counsel.</p>
<p>Proverbs may embody discriminatory attitudes, ethnocentric prejudice, and other forms of bias common in the culture. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1098214012447581">Yitah (2009</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1098214012447581">Hussein (2009</xref>) have described the sexist weight of proverbs in northern Ghana and East Africa, respectively. Yitah (pp. 74–75) relates a coordinated attempt by women in the Kasena ethnic group of northern Ghana to invent countersayings and “fight with proverbs” —<italic>ka jang de memanga</italic>, as it is termed in the Kasena language—“in order to deconstruct the conservative, sexualized local ideology of power . . .and to establish their own signifying terms.” For example, a traditional Kasena proverb promoting discipline among wives in the polygamous household—“the whip that lashes the senior wife lashes the junior wife, too”—is transformed into its effective opposite: “The whip that lashes the first wife must never be allowed to see the light of day” (p. 82).</p>
<p>These more perverse or contradictory uses of proverbs highlight the danger of essentializing such maxims, or of considering them an infallible reservoir of African wisdom, rather than one significant and occasionally eloquent form of cultural expression. They also put in question Mieder’s characterization of proverbs as simply a “well known sentence of the folk. . . handed down from generation to generation” in fixed form. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1098214012447581">Tóthné, Mieder, and Földes (2006)</xref> observe, proverbs frequently generate their opposites. In any case, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1098214012447581">Ngugi (2009</xref>, p. 48) insists, “Africa is not a proverb” and we should not engage in “infantilizing African thought systems” by reifying such forms of expression.</p>

<title>The Context: Sahelian West Africa</title>
<p>The place name “Sahel” derives from an Arabic word meaning “edge” or “beach” and here refers to the (southern) edge of the Sahara Desert: particularly, the countries of Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad, as well as northern portions of Nigeria, Benin, Ghana, and Ivory Coast. The Sahelian region is intermediary between the desert and the more fertile “sudan” to the south (a word meaning <italic>land of the Blacks</italic> in Arabic and a broader geographical reference than the country of that name), which receives greater rainfall and supports a denser cover of vegetation. Further south and wetter still are the West and Central African rainforests.</p>
<p>The Sahel is cultivable, thanks to seasonal rains, and has historically drawn one major advantage from its flat and sparsely wooded terrain: ease of intercommunication. Horses were imported from the Arab world in the 14th century and provided a means of relatively rapid transport across the open plains, something that was impossible further south, where dense forests and a web of rivers were more difficult to traverse and animals were subject to the trypanosome parasite, a vector or equine encephalitis carried by the tsetse fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1098214012447581">Law, 1980</xref>). As a consequence, the Sahel and adjacent areas of the Sudanese climatic zone gave rise to extensive commercial networks, major kingdoms that extended over hundreds if not thousands of miles and widespread vehicular languages like Wolof, Bambara, Hausa, Fulani, and Moré.</p>

<sec id="section6-1098214012447581" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The underlying procedures of this research lie in examining proverbs currently used in Sahelian cultures as data indicative of popular approaches to the evaluation of social practice or widespread habits of collective assessment and analysis. Other avenues of investigation and analysis might of course be adopted, including ethnographic study of family decision-making patterns or community governance and discourse analysis of local meetings. Proverbs have the advantage of constituting a distillate of social judgment that is widely recognized and frequently borrowed across African cultural boundaries.</p>
<p>Though there are a number of published compilations of African proverbs, I learned and witnessed usage of the bulk of the expressions adopted as data—and all of the Hausa sayings in question—through first-hand experience and familiarity with the languages in question over the course of 40 years of short-term work and extended residence in West Africa.</p>
<p>Given the large number and varied uses of such sayings, how does one identify and analyze a set likely to help substantiate, qualify, or invalidate the assertion that West African proverbs speak to “evaluative instincts” embedded in local culture? Relevant sayings can be roughly classified into categories related to at least five broad topics germane to evaluation: (a) assessment, measurement, and performance; (b) inquiry, causal analysis, and discernment; (c) transparency, responsibility, and governance; (d) stakeholder involvement, collective effort, and political discretion; and (e) planning, foresight, and capacity building. In the next section, two illustrative sayings are presented, followed by three proverbs reflecting each one of the five types of evaluation-relevant expressions.<sup>

<title>Illustrative Expressions</title>
<p>Two sayings were among the first to strike me when working on the design, planning, and evaluation of adult literacy programs in central Niger. They have manifest relevance to the problems of program implementation and concerns for regular monitoring.</p>
<p>The gap between program models and their concrete implementation in the field is addressed in the Hausa saying—<italic>Da an ce da kare,“Tuwo ya yi yawa a gidan biki,” ya ce, Maà gani a k’as”:</italic> “When the dog was told that there was all kinds of food at the wedding feast, he said ‘We’ll check that out at ground level’.” There can, in effect, be plenty of food heaped on the tables, but if it doesn’t get down to the ground, the dog has no claim on it. How many well-publicized programs have the same limitations when seen from the local level and must be evaluated in those terms?</p>
<p>The concerns of monitoring are well expressed in an agricultural saying: “The field likes to be visited.” (<italic>Gona jewaya ta ke so.</italic>) Even if there are no special tasks to be performed, no extra weeds to pull, the enterprise benefits from those responsible simply dropping by to take a look and register the state of things. The proverb gives the activity a relational twist typical of West African cultures: the field is like a family member—it not only needs regular care, it <italic>wants </italic>the visit.</p>

<title>Assessment, Measurement, and Performance</title>
<p>There are a number of expressions in Hausa and neighboring languages that address issues of measurement and comparative assessment—scarcely a surprise in cultures that have historically been shaped by widespread commerce as well as by frequent group interaction. To evaluate by measuring and comparing is a natural reflex, and the proverbs presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1098214012447581">Table 1</xref> are pertinent examples.</p>
<p>The first saying inveighs against debating the merits of a farmer without empirical proof—particularly when there is an opportunity to gauge performance. The <italic>damana</italic> is the yearly rainy season from May to September when crops should be sown and yields assessed. Expressing similar sentiments about the importance of competence, the Malinké of upper Guinea and Ivory Coast say <italic>I tåxa’oxo lå hèelu</italic>—<italic>o sùu’aa mån köle kà à hée di?</italic>—“It’s not hard to steal a friend’s flute, but how then do you play it?” </p>
<p>In fact, in these proverbs it is typically not just a question of <italic>measuring</italic> work, but of doing so at the moment or in the circumstance of performance (e.g., Proverbs 2 and 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1098214012447581">Table 1</xref>)—and ideally in situations where one solution can be tested against another. Proverb 2 (<italic>A single horse running on the town square is very fast</italic>), for example, makes direct use of the horse race metaphor to say that worth cannot be validly assessed without comparison.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1098214012447581">
<title>Inquiry, Causal Analysis, and Discernment</title>
<p>The assessment theme also runs through the proverbs in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1098214012447581">Table 2</xref>, though here with an emphasis on the importance of inquiry, careful analysis, and discernment of true, as opposed to apparent, causes. The first saying (<italic>Whatever caused the mouse to run into the fire</italic> <italic>must be hotter than the fire itself</italic>) stresses the importance of understanding the roots of behavior and distinguishing appearances from true causes. The image suggests a generosity of spirit: do not judge until you appreciate where the other is truly “coming from.” The strangest behavior can probably be explained in human terms. Proverb 5 (<italic>One way is no way at all</italic>) has obvious applications to fallback planning, and also implies, and is frequently used to mean, that any social reality can be seen from varying viewpoints.</p>

<p>Evaluation is, among other things, a means of promoting transparency, accountability, and good governance in social and organizational life. Cultures imbued with a history of commerce and characterized by strong social networks are likely to be rich in expressions of mutual obligations and their violation. <italic>Mògòya ye jùru ye</italic>, they say in Bambara; humanity itself is a debt.

</table-wrap>
<p>Proverb 7, on the other hand, suggests an alternate twist to transparency: “On the day of the bath, there’s no hiding the belly button.” Public life requires a periodic cleansing and—when it does—hiding the less appealing portions of the record will not “wash.” Interestingly, the same proverb appears in Haitian Creole, a language created from the linguistic memories of African slaves mixed with overheard French and Spanish: Jounen bèn, pa kache lombrit.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1098214012447581">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Even minor infractions like stealing leftovers, as in Proverb 9, may be an object of derision and sanction. Yet, this maxim about the dog and the cooking pot also offers an opportunity to illustrate another fundamental characteristic of the corpus of proverbs: mutually contradictory viewpoints. For every one that advises A, there may be another that advises B, or at least non-A. To balance the story of the dog and the cooking pot, there is a Hausa expression with a different weight and freight—Kowa ya ba ka fawa, ya so ka yi fince: Whoever gives you the task of cutting up meat [implicitly] wants you to slice off [your own small share].</p>
<p>Proverbs, as a consequence, do not so much settle arguments as they offer a means of expressing viewpoints by linking them to other key elements of the culture. Thus, the Kaseni women discussed previously were not only expressing justified and tactically well-targeted opposition to sexist attitudes in their cultures but also exercising a type of proverb creativity typical of the genre. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1098214012447581">
<title>Stakeholder Involvement, Collective Effort, and Political Discretion</title>
<p>The importance of constituency and shared responsibility brings up issues of stakeholder involvement in evaluation, collective effort to bring it to fruition, and the precautions necessary to avoid political shipwreck in the process. Proverb 10—<italic>shawara d’aukar d’aki</italic>, another model of poetic concision—draws a parallel between decision making and the task of roofing a village hut. The thatch work and wood frame are typically very heavy and the structure can only be put in place without tilting or falling off the circular mud-brick wall of the hut if everyone takes their place around the perimeter of the roofing, bends down, and lifts together.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1098214012447581">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Proverb 11 makes the case for teaming up with local “experts,” a theme recurrently heard in expressions across West African languages: in any environment, there are actors and groups that have been doing at least roughly similar work for a long time and whose assistance should be sought. In a similar spirit, the Wolof say Goloo la gëna xam kër gu barey xaj: the monkey knows the house where there are plenty of dogs better than you do.</p>
<p>Evaluations often impinge on touchy terrain. Dealing with power is an ingrained routine in Sahelian countries and cultures, which have historically been home to major African kingdoms. Proverb 12 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1098214012447581">Table 4</xref> offers wry commentary on the circumspection required. An exposed snake is not long for this world. In short, certain ventures must be kept under wraps if they are to survive. Hausa has another saying that summarizes the caution required in dealing with arbitrary authority: Zuwa gidan damisa, sai nuna da kara: [Taking someone] to visit the leopard’s house [is] limited to showing [the way] with a millet stalk. The background here is that Hausa—and most West African—custom normally dictates that guests not simply be given directions to get where they want to go, but should be taken at least half way there, if not right to their host’s door. When you ask directions to the house of as dangerous a customer as the leopard, however, the most your host can prudently do is point in the correct direction with a long millet stalk and whisper “It’s over there.”</p>

<title>Planning, Foresight, and Capacity Building</title>
<p>In a healthy cycle of program improvement, evaluation leads to new planning efforts and improved results as well as increased capacity for subsequent rounds of assessment. Proverb 13 (<italic>The person with deep eyes begins crying early</italic>) speaks to the importance of foresight. Others emphasize preparation: the Malinke of Guinea and Ivory Coast say <italic>“Bàda mà ké” là àxa mèe dìya: </italic>The feast of “never done that [before]” is not a very pleasant affair, a good rationale for training and practice. On the other hand, the Swahili expression in Proverb 14 adds a key qualification: too much forethought and deliberation can compromise chances of accomplishing the goal. Some things have to be decided and acted upon quickly, though they require no less preparation: the spear must be sharp and the hunter well placed.</p>
<p>Proverb 15 from Senegal puts additional stress on the importance of capacity building and is echoed by a haunting Mossi expression from Burkina Faso: “The one who sleeps on a borrowed mat should realize that he is sleeping on the cold hard ground.” Skill in realms of planning and evaluation is needed for effective self-protection.</p>

<sec id="section13-1098214012447581">
<title>Using Proverbs in Evaluation</title>
<p>As intriguing as these proverbs may be and as strongly as they suggest evaluative “impulses” embedded in those cultures, questions about their use naturally arise. How exactly does one evoke this sort of wisdom in evaluation work and what difference does that initiative make to the actual design and implementation of inquiry?</p>
<sec id="section14-1098214012447581">
<title>Cautions and Caveats</title>
<p>Evaluators need to be wary of at least three sources of potential over-simplification when using African proverbs to understand evaluative impulses:</p>
<sec id="section15-1098214012447581">
<title>Meanings ad hominem</title>
<p>The meaning of proverbs for—and their use by—native speakers or members of a culture may be different from what they represent for outsiders. As one would expect, native speakers typically both know and understand them far better than outsiders, though there may be much variation in this regard within the community itself. <italic>Idon bak’o kuru-kuru ne, amma ba na ganin gari ba, </italic>they say in Hausa : The outsider’s eyes may be as wide open as dinner plates—he still does not see the real town.</p>
<p>In addition, whereas proverbs have a freshness and exotic appeal to the outsider from a different culture—and perhaps from one where such expressions are no longer much used or appear to be less inventive—such maxims and cultural artifacts can seem distinctly “old hat” to those who have been more exposed to them. In the eyes of the younger generation, for example, proverbs may have geriatric associations. Then, too, there are often norms about <italic>when</italic> and <italic>by whom</italic> proverbs are used that are not well known even to a linguistically fluent outsider. Just as Dan Akroyd and Steve Martin reminded us in their <italic>Saturday Night Live</italic> portrayal of “wild and crazy” immigrants, much of the meaning and communicativeness of colloquial or traditional expressions lie in how and when language is used (and in its intonation patterns) rather than simply in its content. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1098214012447581">
<title>Manipulative potentials</title>
<p>A second set of cautions hinges on the superficial and even manipulative uses to which these products of local culture may be put. The less one’s understanding of factors such as those previously mentioned, the greater the likelihood that proverbs will show up in an evaluation mostly as window dressing or with some definite <italic>parti pris</italic>. As they say in Senegal, <italic>Nda Moor xal mboda, nga dek wolof: </italic>“When the Moor has a problem, he speaks Wolof.” If outsiders show up spouting folksy sayings, one may suspect that they have an agenda to push.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1098214012447581">
<title>Multicultural complications</title>
<p>Finally, issues of proverb use obviously change complexion to the degree that one is operating in <italic>multi</italic>cultural and <italic>multi</italic>linguistic environments (which evaluation settings increasingly are) rather than in those that are more monocultural. When that is the case, <italic>whose</italic> proverbs does one invoke and how are those from different and often neighboring, if not competing, traditions blended or balanced?</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1098214012447581">
<title>Potentials and Procedures</title>
<p>My experience suggests three principal domains for using African proverbs in evaluation. The first is, quite simply, as a reminder of the cultural context of action and the meanings it purveys—a major benefit in international work and, more broadly, in any exercise where there are important cultural differences among beneficiaries or between them and program staff, funders, and decision makers. </p>
<p>A second but more particular domain concerns the interpretation of causal relationships. Why things happen as they do is one of the fundamental questions in any evaluation and there are so many degrees of micromediation between a network of potential causes and a roster of apparent effects that any source of testable insight into the social process involved has high practical value. African proverbs typically illustrate and spell out the conviction that human relations are the essential middle term, and thus can provide critical guidance and stimulus for probing the motives behind behaviors as strange on the surface as mice running headfirst into the fire.</p>
<p>A third realm of potential relevance lies in more effectively <italic>mobilizing</italic> local stakeholder energies for playing an active role in the evaluation and then actually using the data and conclusions generated. Moreover, beyond the general benefits of participation and endorsement, evaluations almost by definition deal with controversial matters and delicate judgments—easiest to negotiate with strength of numbers and if those concerned or implicated are party to the deliberation. As they say in Wolof, <italic>Làmb aw taat, boroom a ca gën</italic>: When it comes to touching the buttocks, better to be the owner!</p>
<sec id="section19-1098214012447581">
<title>Helping the tortoise to dance</title>
<p>These notions, though intriguing, are still abstract. Although space does not allow protracted discussion, a concrete example should prove useful. I was responsible for coordinating the evaluation of a World-Bank-funded functional literacy program in the Republic of Mali (Easton, 1978). The work was carried out over different periods during a 2-year span with the collaboration of a team of five young Malian researchers from the national Ministry of Education. They were both well versed in Bambara culture (and proverbs) and well disposed to participatory methods. Our discussion, planning, and design efforts thus ended up being imbued with proverbial references—and quite often with jocular comparisons of relevant insights from Bambara maxims with those that I knew better from Hausa culture. As one consequence, the evaluation strategy that we developed progressed from initial planning stages to a design that involved enabling program participants in each community to assess their own literacy levels, draw up a balance sheet of collective results, debate explanatory factors, and make program reform recommendations. At the same time, the strategy entailed evaluation training for a variety of personnel at intermediate levels.</p>
<p>Insights from proverbs became an integral part of the deliberative stage in the process. A particular Bambara maxim, for example, served as a keynote for reflection on the pattern of meager results that became evident in evaluation data: <italic>Kolongosi be dlòn fe, sen t’a la, </italic>or “The tortoise loves to dance but just doesn’t have the legs.” In short, if you do not see this terrapin cutting the rug on the village square when the drums start to play, it is from no lack of emotion or love for the music—but with that heavy shell and those little stubs for appendages, what would <italic>you</italic> do? The evaluation revealed that there were far fewer literates than had been targeted for the end of the program, but in almost every case at least a handful per village. They were generally young men who had been tacitly tasked by the community with carrying out the one function in that threadbare environment that required and rewarded literacy, and in effect gave the tortoise some legs: accompanying local products to crop markets in order to make sure that merchants and their weighers did not defraud farmers on the scales. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1098214012447581">
<title>Bolstering buy-in</title>
<p>As a consequence of this locally driven process, village leaders assumed an unaccustomed active role in moving from evaluation results to prioritization of changes to be made in literacy instruction and agricultural market organization. It was a region—like many then throughout the interior of West Africa—where traditional authorities seldom met directly with government representatives but habitually named a fictional chief and village council for the task, a strategy adopted during the colonial years because they felt these outsiders had nothing of worth or local value to communicate. During the evaluation process just described, however, instances were frequently reported where the designated stand-ins, having perceived that the enterprise used a local idiom and might in fact offer a medium for recognizing and accomplishing a local agenda, interrupted the process. Evaluation teams then saw the stage revolve and an entirely different set of people—the actual village council members—come forward to ask that they run through the story one more time.</p>
<p>Insight from proverbs and their patterns of usage helped to embody a mind-set and establish a climate for an unprecedented level of “stockholder” buy-in. Moreover, the turnaround of local authorities manifested another lesson about evaluation and subsequent planning expressed by a number of African proverbs: if you do not do some of the heavy lifting involved, you will have little say in the result. The Wolof of Senegal and the Gambia put the idea memorably: <italic>Ku la abal ì tank, nga dem fa ko neex</italic>—Borrow someone’s legs and you end up going where they want you to go. And the Igbo of southern Nigeria observe: <italic>Tupu agu enwe onye na ako ifo ya. . . . . .</italic>,<italic> akuko nta ka na eto ndi na achu nta. </italic>In short, the tales of the hunt will be tales of glory until the day when the animals have their own historians.</p>
<p>The common denominator of these examples of practical usages for proverbs lies more in a mind-set than in a recipe and in acting on the understanding that local culture may retain and reflect a long history of evaluative judgment that it is important to elicit and call upon in some form. <italic>Kome ya ke cikin aikin d’an tsako, </italic>the Hausa say, <italic>shaho ya dad’e da saninshi</italic>: Whatever concerns the habit of baby chickens, [you can be sure that] the hawk learned it long ago.</p>

<title>Reflection and Analysis</title>
<p>The preceding sections offer a sample of West African proverbs that are potentially relevant to evaluation, while conveying some of the parameters governing their use in communal decision making. What do they say, however, about the existence and nature of “evaluative instincts” embedded within the cultures in question, and the Hausa one in particular? Answering that question requires explicating what we mean by the “evaluative instincts” or “impulses” that are “embedded” in local culture. The terms are highly evocative but fairly imprecise, and they harbor hidden assumptions. The first is that we are talking not so much about <italic>individual</italic> instincts—in the sense that might be conveyed by saying that a friend or colleague is “judgmental”—as we are about collectively shared ones, variable but with a definite central tendency, that are to a large extent common to members of a particular culture and are transmitted by it, though often modified in the process. A second is that one can “tap into” or evoke this reservoir of insight and energy. And a third might be that the more these cultural elements differ in orientation and epistemology from the dominant culture of evaluation, the more difficult it may be to recognize and access them.</p>
<p>If we accept these starting points, it should be clear that West African proverbs can be rich in evaluation-relevant sentiments and insights. And given that proverb use and knowledge are widespread in the region, such sentiments and insights are also likely to be broadly disseminated. These maxims do not furnish, however, conclusive arguments for assessment of social practice. Any one of them may have its contrary and even invites composition of an antithesis. They are more a means of expressing differing judgments and perspectives—even of carrying on debate and “fighting with proverbs”—than they are formulas for settling disputes. But the very plasticity of this form of popular poetry can make it a potent facilitator of public discourse.</p>
<p>Proverbs reflect an inclination for scrutinizing the gap between claims and accomplishments plus a genuine aptitude for seeking causal factors beneath appearances. In addition, like other dimensions of Hausa and West African culture, they betray a deeply relational understanding of what drives programs and determines decisions, echoing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098214012447581">Abma and Windershoven’s (2008)</xref> claims about the fundamentally social character of evaluation practice. That web of relationship makes clear the importance of involving stakeholders and community members in the work of evaluation and of respecting the expertise that those with longstanding knowledge of an environment and its trades may bring to the assessment of social endeavors within it. </p>
<p>Hanberger’s (2008) observation of the necessarily and increasingly <italic>multicultural </italic>nature of evaluations certainly applies to West Africa, which has always harbored a diversity of ethnic and linguistic groups. Nigeria—home to the largest number of Hausa speakers—is a country where over 300 different African languages are spoken, though there are a distinctly smaller number of vehicular ones used for intercommunication among ethnic groups. As we have seen, however, one can find parallels among proverbial expressions from different African cultures, including some that are nearly carbon copies of each other. The widespread respect for and use of this form of inherited and continually redefined insight makes it more a unifying than a divisive factor in a multicultural environment.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>There is, in sum, evidence to suggest both that West African proverbs contain social and human insights of interest to evaluators and that they reveal a reservoir of related impulses and modes of thinking upon which new and culturally appropriate methods might be fashioned. They display an aptitude for looking beyond appearances, analyzing human relations, putting political power into perspective, and probing causal relations, all frames of mind that are of central relevance to evaluation.</p>
<p>Future research could profitably examine in greater detail just <italic>how </italic>proverbs and related speech patterns get used in discussion and decision making in cultures, where they are a fixture, the particular services they can render to evaluation, and methods for invoking and benefiting from the insight they offer. These issues have only been briefly explored in this article. However, suggestive the analysis may be, demonstrating that West African proverbs express evaluation-relevant perspectives is not the same as dissecting the role they play in communal decisions and assessment, or conceiving how best to design new evaluation approaches using them. Attention should be directed both to methods for employing this resource more effectively in official evaluation practice and to strategies for introducing parallel considerations into the training of evaluators—a task in which those from the cultures concerned should clearly play a major role.</p>
<p>A poem by American poet Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098214012447581">Frost (1923</xref>, p. 87) has humankind helping the wind to understand that its ageless whistling around eaves and through pine needles could in fact make lovely music, if simply redirected with care through a hollow reed or wooden flute. “The wind could see,” Frost’s poem concludes—“the aim was song.” One hopes evaluators from the many cultures of West Africa can increasingly play this troubadour’s role in midwifing new assessment practices from the potentials long embedded in that environment.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the proverbs in question are transcribed in the nearest Western alphabet equivalent of their official transcriptions, which include letters—like those for the imploded “b” and “d” sounds in Hausa (here represented with the letter followed by an apostrophe)—that require characters not easily reproducible in journal print.</p>

<p>Because slaves imported to Haiti were sold and farmed out in such fashion that no two speaking the same language ended up on the same plantation, Haitian Creole had to be created from whole cloth, producing a musical language that might be best characterized as overheard French, Spanish, and English grafted onto a common African grammatical and syntactical base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1098214012447581">Lefebvre, 1998</xref>).</p>

<p>This proverb also bears out the rule of contraries just mentioned. An alternate version—<italic>shawara ba ta d’aukar d’aki</italic>—asserts that: “discussion [by itself] is not enough to get the roof up on the walls!”</p>
