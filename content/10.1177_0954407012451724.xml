<abstract>
<p>Traffic accidents are still increasing even though vehicles are becoming more intelligent to enhance driver convenience and safety. Single car-on-car rear impacts in urban areas have increased rapidly due to driver inattention. According to a Road Traffic Authority (ROTA) report in Korea in 2006, 85.2% of single car-on-car rear impact accidents occurred at less than 60 km/h, and 25.3% of the total occurred at between 30 km/h and 50 km/h. To prevent rear vehicle crashes in urban areas, automobile manufacturers have developed various low-speed, close-range collision-warning systems. This paper presents a low-speed, close-range collision-warning algorithm for urban areas using fuzzy inference. Experiments using an embedded microprocessor in the driving track demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed collision-warning system. The results indicate that the fuzzy inference-based, low-speed, close-range collision-warning system could reduce traffic accidents by alerting the driver to potential collisions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recently, research on vehicle intelligence has increased to enhance driver and passenger safety and convenience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954407012451724">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954407012451724">2</xref></sup> One example of intelligent vehicle systems is the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS), which assists with safe driving.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954407012451724">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954407012451724">4</xref></sup> It includes adaptive cruise control (ACC), which can reduce speed and warn the driver of potential crashes, and the lane-departure warning system (LDWS), which prevents the car from drifting across lanes by warning the driver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954407012451724">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954407012451724">6</xref></sup> In addition, blind spot detection (BSD) and the rear detection system (RDS) provide information on activity in blind spots and to the rear of the vehicle, respectively. The ADAS detects conditions around the vehicle in real-time using visual and distance sensors such as vision and radar sensors, and helps to prevent traffic accidents by alerting the driver and controlling some vehicle functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954407012451724">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to a report published by the Road Traffic Authority (ROTA) of Korea in 2006, 63.1% of single car-on-car rear-impact traffic accidents, which account for 8.2% of all traffic accidents, occur in urban areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954407012451724">8</xref></sup> Furthermore, 85.2% of colliding cars are travelling at less than 60 km/h in single car-on-car rear impact accidents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954407012451724">Figure 1</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407012451724">9</xref></sup> and 25.3% of these accidents occur between 30 km/h and 50 km/h.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954407012451724">9</xref></sup> According to an analysis published by Eis et al. in 2005,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954407012451724">10</xref></sup> more than 70% of single car-on-car rear-impact traffic accidents in Germany, which account for 10% of all traffic accidents, occur in urban areas, and 90% of the colliding and collided with vehicles are travelling at less than 55 km/h and 20 km/h, respectively. This is similar to the situation in Korea, where 70% of these accidents happen at less than 30 km/h and 15 km/h for the colliding and collided with vehicles, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954407012451724">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954407012451724">11</xref></sup></p>

<p>To reduce low-speed, close-range traffic accidents in urban environments, commercial automotive companies have begun to develop low-speed, close-range collision-warning or avoidance systems. For example, the City Safety system, developed by Volvo, uses a laser sensor to alert the driver, at a measured distance, when the possibility of collision increases in front of the vehicle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954407012451724">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954407012451724">13</xref></sup> In addition, if the driver does not react to avoid the collision, the City Safety system operates an automatic brake control system to avoid or reduce the severity of the collision. Other research has presented a low-speed collision-avoidance system using a laser scanner to prevent traffic accidents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954407012451724">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>While a laser sensor can detect distances in front of the vehicle precisely, low-speed, close-range collision-avoidance systems that use only a laser sensor, including the City Safety system, cannot detect lateral distances, such as between lane-changing vehicles, because of the narrow angle of the laser sensor. Laser scanners can detect changes beside the vehicle during lane changing due to their wide detection angles, but are relatively expensive. In addition, developing a mathematical model to determine the collision and warning states precisely is difficult, as the vehicle information used to judge these states can differ greatly depending on driver behaviour.</p>
<p>Therefore, this study created a fuzzy-inference-based, low-speed, close-range collision-warning system that addresses the issues of the previous collision-warning system. In addition, the paper includes a collision-warning algorithm that categorizes the potential for collision and driver alarm using vehicle information and fuzzy inference at speeds of less than 30 km/h. Finally, to verify the feasibility of the proposed collision-warning system, its performance was evaluated using an experimental vehicle and embedded microprocessor in the driving track.</p>
<p>First of all the fuzzy-inference-based, low-speed, close-range collision-warning system is described, followed by a description of the structure of the collision-warning algorithm. Implementation of the proposed collision-warning system is then discussed, including an evaluation of its performance, followed by a section on the conclusions of the research and future research directions.</p>

<title>Structure of the low-speed, close-range collision-warning system</title>
<p>A fuzzy-inference-based, low-speed, close-range collision-warning system, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954407012451724">Figure 2</xref>, was proposed to reduce accidents with vehicles in front of or beside the test vehicle while changing lanes in urban environments. The proposed system consists of four modules: a calculator, a corrector, a collision potential identifier and an alarm. First, the calculator determines the potential for collision using vehicle and sensor information. Second, the corrector filters fluctuating distance information from the laser sensor caused by transient disturbances using a Kalman filter. Third, the collision potential identifier determines the vehicle potential for collision according to fuzzy inference rules using the fuzzy input membership function from the calculator. Finally, the alarm visually alerts the driver of the potential for collision.</p>

<p>The calculator computes the fuzzy input membership functions to determine the potential for collision using vehicle and sensor information. The front vehicle distance, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>(<italic>k</italic>), driving speed, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>(<italic>k</italic>) and the side vehicle state, <italic>u</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub>(<italic>k</italic>), are input into the calculator. The front vehicle distance is received from the laser sensor via the corrector, and is important in determining the potential for collision. The vehicle on-board diagnosis (OBD) inputs the driving speed to the calculator; this can be transmitted via Bluetooth and universal serial bus (USB) interfaces. The side vehicle state is input from an ultrasonic sensor located on the front bumper. The calculator computes five fuzzy input membership functions: front vehicle distance, change in front vehicle distance, Δ<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>(<italic>k</italic>), vehicle speed, change in vehicle speed, Δ<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>(<italic>k</italic>), and side vehicle state. The calculator computes the change in speed and distance, since these values are important as absolute information in determining the potential for collision.</p>
<p>The corrector filters the distance information from the laser sensor caused by transient disturbances. The distance information can fluctuate because the laser sensor measures the distance using the straight features of the laser signal as the vehicle moves on a rough road. The Kalman filter was used for the correction, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954407012451724">Figure 3</xref>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954407012451724">15</xref></sup> as it is an efficient recursive filter that estimates the state of a dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements while minimizing the mean of the squared error.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954407012451724">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954407012451724">17</xref></sup> The corrector removes the initial fluctuating distance, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub>(<italic>k</italic>), from the laser sensor using the Kalman filter, and transmits the corrected vehicle distance, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>(<italic>k</italic>), to both the calculator and the alarm. The corrected vehicle distance information is used to compute the fuzzy input membership functions in the calculator and input the front vehicle distance information to the alarm.</p>

<p>The collision potential identifier determines the potential for collision following the fuzzy rules using the vehicle information. The basic fuzzy logic principles lie in the definition of the set, where any element can belong to a set with a certain degree of membership. Based on this, expert knowledge can be expressed relatively simply, and the inference for the given inputs can be implemented efficiently. The fuzzy logic used to compute the appropriate potential for collision consists of three parts: the fuzzifier, the inference engine, and the defuzzifier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954407012451724">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954407012451724">19</xref></sup> First, the fuzzifier converts the vehicle speed, <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>(<italic>k</italic>), change in vehicle speed, Δ<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>(<italic>k</italic>), vehicle distance, <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>(<italic>k</italic>), change in vehicle distance, Δ<italic>d</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>(<italic>k</italic>), and ultrasonic sensor states, <italic>u</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub>(<italic>k</italic>). Second, the inference engine creates the collision state, <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>(<italic>k</italic>), using the fuzzy rules generated from expert experience. Finally, the defuzzifier calculates the appropriate potential for collision from the inferred results.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954407012451724">Figure 4</xref> shows the membership functions of the input and output linguistic variables. Triangular fuzzy numbers were selected as membership functions to increase the fuzzy predictive redundancy system computation speed. Under these assumptions, seventeen fuzzy linguistic variables were defined: none, side, front, near, medium, far, decrease, maintain, increase, slow, fast, decelerate, accelerate, safe, warning, danger and collision. The fuzzy inputs of the membership were vehicle speed, vehicle speed change, vehicle distance, vehicle distance change and ultrasonic sensor state. The membership function for the inputs was expressed as the speed and distance limitations of the proposed collision-warning system; the collision-warning system speed and distance were bounded as under 30 km/h and 6 m, respectively. The output membership function was expressed as a step function that was a finite linear combination of indicator functions of intervals, shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0954407012451724">equation (1)</xref>. For example, if the output value is 0.333, the potential for collision is determined as warning (1 + 0.333 × 4 = 2.332 = 2)</p>

<title>Fuzzy-inference-based, low-speed, close-range collision-warning algorithm</title>
<p>The fuzzy-inference-based, low-speed, close-range collision-warning algorithm shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954407012451724">Figure 6</xref> was proposed to operate the collision-warning system effectively. After initiating the collision-warning system, it measures the driving speed using the OBD in the calculator. If the driving speed is &gt;30 km/h, the calculator measures the driving speed continuously. Conversely, if the driving speed is &lt;30 km/h, it confirms that the laser sensor has measured the distance in front of the vehicle normally. Two situations prevent the laser sensor from measuring the front vehicle distance: when a transient error in the laser sensor does not transit distance information, and when the vehicle in front is not within 6 m. If the error time, the time between distance information measurements, is within the maximum error time, the first situation is the cause. Conversely, if the error time exceeds the maximum error time, this indicates that the second situation has prevented measurements.</p>

If the front vehicle distance exceeds the maximum inter-vehicle distance, the algorithm notes the error of the distance and returns to the first step. Conversely, if the front vehicle distance is less than the maximum inter-vehicle distance, the potential for collision is determined using the fuzzy inference in the collision potential identifier. The potential for collision is graded on a four-state scale: safe, warning, danger and collision, where safe indicates the state with no risk of collision, warning means that the driver must pay attention to an expected collision, danger means that the speed must be reduced to prevent collision and collision requires stopping the vehicle to protect the driver from a crash. Finally, a visual display is used to alert the driver to the potential for collision.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407012451724">Figure 7</xref> shows the experimental vehicle used to evaluate the performance of the proposed collision-warning system. The structure of the experimental GM’s L vehicle is indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407012451724">Figure 7(a)</xref>. A laser sensor (S80-YL0 data sensors) that detect up to 6 m (the maximum detection distance, <italic>l</italic><sub>1</sub>) was used to measure the front vehicle distance, and four ultrasonic sensors (STMA506, SensorTec) that detect up to 3 m (the maximum detection distance, <italic>l</italic><sub>2</sub>) at 25° (the maximum detection angle, <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>u</italic></sub>) were used to measure beside the vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954407012451724">Figure 7(b)</xref>).

Finally, the maximum inter-vehicle distance was set to the maximum laser sensor measurement distance of 6 m.</p>

<p>The laser sensor was connected to the collision-warning engine control unit (ECU) using universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART) communication, and the ultrasonic sensors were connected to the ECU with interrupting and general purpose input/output (I/O) pins. To calculate the change in vehicle speed, the processing period was set to 100 ms to consider the close-range environment. The OBD (free-OBD plus mini free global positioning system (free-GPS)) was used to measure the vehicle speed. This OBD could transmit vehicle speed information using Bluetooth wireless communication. A Freescale MC9S12XF512 microcontroller-embedded FlexRay and controller area network (CAN) was used to operate the ECU. An NXP PCA82C250 CAN transceiver was used to transmit the CAN messages and a Fimtech FB755AX Bluetooth receiving module was used to receive the vehicle speed from the OBD. Finally, Vector CANoe.FlexRay 7.2 software was used to monitor the vehicle information.</p>
<p>Three tests were performed to evaluate the proposed collision-warning system. First, for a vehicle driving in front of the experimental vehicle at&lt;30 km/h, a test was conducted to ensure that the alarm alerted the driver successfully. Second, the collision warning alarm was tested in the presence of a vehicle changing lanes suddenly. The changes in the laser and ultrasonic sensors when the side vehicle changed lanes into that of the experimental vehicle were monitored. Finally, the front collision warning alarm was examined while driving near a stationary object, which represented a collision with a vehicle in front due to driver distraction.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407012451724">Figure 8</xref> shows the experimental results of the ultrasonic sensor state, front vehicle distance, change in distance, vehicle speed, change in speed and change in potential for collision at a speed of &lt;30 km/h. The potential for collision increased from safe to collision when the front vehicle distance decreased and the vehicle speed increased. Conversely, the potential for collision decreased from collision to safe or warning when the front vehicle distance increased and the vehicle speed decreased. The potential for collision increased to collision in around 3.4 s as the front vehicle distance change increased relatively quickly while the front vehicle distance was great. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954407012451724">Figure 9</xref> shows the results of the collision warning alarm while travelling at &lt;30 km/h.

The danger and potential for collision were such that they caused the vehicle to break immediately.</p>

The ultrasonic sensor detected the lane-changing vehicle after about 1 s, and the front ultrasonic sensor detected it at around 1.7 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954407012451724">Figure 8(a)</xref>). The laser sensor did not detect the lane-changing vehicle initially, and then detected it suddenly at 2.2 s when it was 2.445 m from the experimental vehicle. This was because the ultrasonic sensor was located closer to the lane-changing vehicle than the laser sensor. When the lane-changing vehicle cut into the driving lane, the potential for collision increased to collision rapidly. In addition, the potential for collision decreased to safe when the speed and distance of the lane-changing vehicle increased sufficiently. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954407012451724">Figure 11</xref> shows the results of the collision warning alarm during the test with the lane-changing vehicle.

<title>Summary and conclusions</title>
<p>This paper presented a fuzzy-inference-based, low-speed, close-range collision-warning system that resolved the issues of previous collision-warning systems. It also outlined an algorithm that determined the potential for collision and alerted the driver using vehicle information and fuzzy inference at speeds of less than 30 km/h. The performance of the collision-warming system was evaluated using an experimental vehicle and an embedded ECU to verify the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.</p>
<p>The laser sensor-based front vehicle distance information could fluctuate due to road curvatures or vehicle vibrations. The proposed Kalman filtering method removed these abrupt fluctuations. The proposed fuzzy-inference-based, low-speed, close-range collision-warning system provided an appropriate alarm based on the surrounding driving environment at low speeds, including lane-changing vehicles and stationary objects.</p>
<p>This paper was limited to testing the feasibility of the fuzzy-inference-based, low-speed, close-range collision-warning system in a simplified experimental vehicle under limited potential accident conditions. To apply the proposed collision-warning system fully, it is necessary to study optimal installation position of a laser sensor, manufacturing of low-cost laser sensor for automotive use, development of advanced collision-warning algorithm such as a tracking method for the front vehicle or a robust sensing algorithm for disturbance such as rain or fog. In addition, driver inattention has to be better understood to determine if the collision-avoidance system should control the vehicle.</p>
