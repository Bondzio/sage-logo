<abstract>
<p>This article investigates the contribution of maternal mediation in storybook reading, socioeconomic status (SES), and home literacy environment (HLE) to children’s literacy level in kindergarten and first grade in Israeli Arabic-speaking families. A total of 109 kindergarten children and their mothers participated. Children’s literacy level was assessed in kindergarten. Mothers and children were videotaped at home in a book reading activity, and HLE data were gathered from the mothers. One year later, the children’s literacy level was assessed in first grade. Results show that mothers often used paraphrasing in the reading activities and dealt less with the written language. Correlations were found between SES and children’s literacy measures in oral and written language in kindergarten and in first grade. Significant positive relationships were found between HLE and children’s literacy level in kindergarten and first grade. No relationship was found between maternal mediation and children’s spoken and written language skills in either age group. Regression analysis showed that HLE was the best contributor variable to children’s literacy level, followed by family SES level, with no contribution of maternal mediation. Implications of the relationships between children’s literacy development, SES, HLE, and parental mediation in Arabic-speaking families for researchers and educational practitioners are discussed.</p>

<p>The relationship between storybook reading to young children and socioeconomic status (SES), home literacy environment (HLE), and children’s literacy level has been researched extensively in different languages, including English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142723712455283">Beckwith, Rodning, &amp; Cohen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0142723712455283">Sigel, Stinson, &amp; Flaugher, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0142723712455283">Teale &amp; Sulzby, 2003</xref>), Dutch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0142723712455283">Leseman &amp; de Jong, 1998</xref>), and Hebrew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0142723712455283">Aram &amp; Biron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723712455283">Korat, Klein, &amp; Segal-Drori, 2007</xref>). This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to shed light on the relationship between these variables in the Arabic language.</p>
<p>Acquisition of the Arabic language by young children appears to be a special and interesting process due to the uniqueness and complexity of this language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0142723712455283">Holes, 1995</xref>). A large gap exists in Arabic between the spoken and written language in grammar, phonetics, vocabulary, and orthography, which is identified as diglossia. This results in difficulties in the acquisition of this language, especially at the beginning of this process in kindergarten and first grade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0142723712455283">Saiegh-Haddad, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0142723712455283">2007</xref>). Arabic diglossia is expressed in large differences between the written language (called ‘Fousha’) and the spoken language (called ‘Amia’), which is composed of different dialects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0142723712455283">Ferguson &amp; Charles, 1959</xref>). Unlike the spoken language used for daily communication, literary Arabic is reserved for formal written communication and is studied mainly in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0142723712455283">Meesls, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0142723712455283">Somah, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>There are three differences between the ‘Fousha’ and the ‘Amia’ languages. The first difference is related to prestige. Spoken Arabic is usually regarded as having lower prestige and written language as having a higher prestige, since it is related to the rich literary tradition, including the Quran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0142723712455283">Ferguson &amp; Charles, 1959</xref>). The second difference relates to the language acquisition process. Children acquire the spoken language naturally and grow up in an environment that speaks this language. In contradistinction, the written language is acquired upon entry to school as an integral part of the formal teaching and learning program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0142723712455283">Ayari, 1996</xref>). The grammatical structure of the spoken language is learned without explicit instruction, whereas the grammatical rules of the written language are taught carefully. The third difference is functional. Each form of the language has a different function. The spoken language is used in everyday communication, whereas the written language is used in formal situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0142723712455283">Ferguson &amp; Charles, 1959</xref>).</p>
<p>The situation in many Arabic-speaking classes is that communication between children and their teacher is in the spoken language, while the reading and writing tasks required of the students are in the written language. The gap between these two languages makes the acquisition process difficult for children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0142723712455283">Ayari, 1996</xref>) and has been described by some researchers almost as learning a second language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0142723712455283">Ibrahim &amp; Aharon-Peretz, 2005</xref>). This is reflected in the low academic achievements of Arabic-speaking children throughout the school years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142723712455283">Almusa, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The experience of living in two different language systems begins quite early for the young Arabic-speaking child – in kindergarten. For example, when learning letter names in their kindergarten class, Arabic-speaking children might encounter the standard letter names which are different from the spoken latter names (for instance, the letter name “B “ب” in standard language is ba: / ءاب and in the spoken language it is eb.(بأ Learning letters in Arabic is especially difficult for young children since each letter has 3 to 4 multiple forms: beginning of word (بـ), middle of word (بـ), end of word (ب), end of word connected with another letter (ـب). Furthermore, there are subtle graphic form differences (/ta:?/ ت, ba:?/ ب, nu:n/ ن, /a:?/ ث). Moreover, in the process of playing with words and their sounds (important phonological awareness skills), young children find it more difficult to isolate the written phoneme than the spoken phoneme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0142723712455283">Saiegh-Haddad, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In many cultures, parents serve as important facilitators who build a bridge to the child between the oral and the written language and start this process before entering school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142723712455283">Aram &amp; Levin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0142723712455283">Laakso, Poikkeus, Eklund, &amp; Lyytinen, 2004</xref>). It has been suggested that members of the Arab Israeli community seldom expose their young children to literary Arabic and fail to see its importance for reading and writing acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0142723712455283">Saiegh-Haddad, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, parents tend to believe that early exposure to literary Arabic is a burden for young children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142723712455283">Abu Rabia, 2000</xref>). This limited exposure to written texts makes it difficult for the Arabic-speaking child to acquire listening comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0142723712455283">Ministry of Education, 2001</xref>), acquisition of reading and writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142723712455283">Abu-Rabia, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0142723712455283">Saiegh-Haddad, 2007</xref>) and later to acquire reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142723712455283">Abu-Rabia, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Western culture emphasizes reading books to young children and it has been shown that parental book reading predicts children’s success in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142723712455283">Cunningham, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0142723712455283">Sénéchal &amp; Lefevre, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0142723712455283">Wells, 1985</xref>). There is evidence that this activity contributes to children’s spoken language in kindergarten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142723712455283">Bus, Van Ijzendoorn, &amp; Pellegrini, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142723712455283">Cunningham, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0142723712455283">Justice &amp; Ezell, 2000</xref>), to early literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0142723712455283">Aram &amp; Biron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142723712455283">Cunningham, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0142723712455283">De Temple &amp; Snow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723712455283">Korat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0142723712455283">Sénéchal &amp; Lefevre, 2002</xref>), and to the acquisition of reading in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142723712455283">Baker, Mackler, Sonnenschein, &amp; Serpell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0142723712455283">Mol, Bus, De Jong, &amp; Smeets, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>During a reading activity, parents mediate the written language to their children by using the oral language to which the child is usually accustomed. They use explanations and examples that meet the child’s contemporary ability and build a bridge to her/his future ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0142723712455283">Tzuriel, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0142723712455283">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>). Mothers’ mediation is an important vehicle for the child’s cognitive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0142723712455283">Feuerstein, Klein, &amp; Tennenbaum, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0142723712455283">Klein &amp; Alony, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0142723712455283">Klein, Weider, &amp; Greenspan, 1987</xref>), including literacy.</p>
<p>In this study, the mediated learning experience (MLE) theory was used to identify and explain basic characteristics of the adult–child interaction as expressed during a book reading activity (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723712455283">Korat et al., 2007</xref>). The mother’s mediation analysis was based on the indices of the Literacy Observing Meditational Interaction (L-OMI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0142723712455283">Korat &amp; Klein, 2004</xref>), which are based on a scale of OMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0142723712455283">Klein et al., 1987</xref>) and on a scale of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142723712455283">Bus et al. (1995)</xref>. The tool for the current study was adapted to the Arabic language and examined the effect of mediation while reading a storybook in the spoken and the written language.</p>
<p>Research conducted in Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0142723712455283">Aram &amp; Levin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723712455283">Korat et al., 2007</xref>) and in other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0142723712455283">Walker, Greenwood, Hart, &amp; Carta, 1994</xref>) indicates a connection between family SES and children’s achievements in spoken and written language. This gap favors middle SES children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0142723712455283">Bowey, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0142723712455283">Lonigan &amp; Whitehurst, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0142723712455283">Ninio, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0142723712455283">Raz &amp; Bryant, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0142723712455283">Wallach, Wallach, Dozier, &amp; Kaplan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0142723712455283">Wells, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, researchers have reported differences in the maternal quality of mediation in book reading between low SES (LSES) and middle SES (MSES) families, favoring the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142723712455283">Baker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0142723712455283">Heath, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723712455283">Korat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0142723712455283">Leseman &amp; de Jong, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0142723712455283">Ninio, 1980</xref>). LSES mothers ask fewer questions and rarely encourage their children to participate in the reading event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0142723712455283">Ninio, 1980</xref>). Moreover, LSES mothers tend to relate more to illustrations in the book and to paraphrase the text to their children (low level of cognitive mediation), whereas MSES mothers discuss the story content with their children, use a rich vocabulary, complex language, and relate to the written text (high level of cognitive mediation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723712455283">Korat et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>There are also reports on the connection between the home literacy environment (HLE) and children’s literacy achievements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0142723712455283">Evans, Shaw, &amp; Bell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0142723712455283">Hecht, Burgess, Torgesen, Wagner, &amp; Rashotte, 2000</xref>). Home literacy environment (HLE) was measured by the amount of written materials (books, journals for adults and children, writing materials, etc.) and by the frequency of literacy activities at home (prevalence of reading books to children, visits to the library, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0142723712455283">Heath, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0142723712455283">Wells, 1985</xref>). A literacy environment that includes many tools predicts children’s literacy abilities in kindergarten (reading, writing, phonological and orthographic awareness) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0142723712455283">Aram, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0142723712455283">Purcell-Gates, 1996</xref>). Other studies have reported that a literacy environment rich in tools contributes to later achievement in reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142723712455283">Carretti, Borella, Cornoldi, &amp; De Beni, 2009</xref>; Catte, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0142723712455283">Cunningham, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0142723712455283">Hirsch, 2003</xref>). Children who are regularly in the vicinity of books, with the possibility of experimenting with them, profit in terms of phonological awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0142723712455283">Raz &amp; Bryant, 1990</xref>). The home literacy level of the Arab society in Israel, and especially of those with young children in kindergarten, has not been investigated to date.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the literature review we conducted did not reveal any evidence on the process of Arab parental book reading to young children or on the home literacy environment and the relation between book reading, SES, HLE, and young Arab children’s literacy. In the present study, we examined these variables and the relations between them. We aimed to learn how family SES, HLE, and maternal mediation in a book reading event contribute to the literacy level of the young child in the Arabic-speaking family. Following previous research on these relationship among Hebrew-speaking children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723712455283">Korat et al., 2007</xref>), we assumed that children’s background variables, such as SES and HLE, would make a greater contribution to the children’s literacy level than maternal mediation.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 109 5- to 6-year-old children, 61 girls and 48 boys, and their mothers took part in this study. The families were from four communities located in the center or the north of Israel. Participants were recruited from different settlements, from both rural and urban environments. Two kindergartens were chosen from each settlement. Participants were solicited by letters sent to parents. Mothers who gave their consent participated in the study with their children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0142723712455283">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Data were collected in two phases: when children were in kindergarten and one year later when the children were in first grade. In kindergarten, data were collected in three sessions. In the first session, the children’s emergent literacy (EL) was assessed individually within their kindergarten setting. Two meetings took place with every child individually, where each session lasted 20–30 minutes. Meetings were held in a quiet corner in their classroom. In the second session, mother–child dyads were involved in a joint storybook reading activity in their homes and they were observed reading (via videotape). Each mother was given a non-familiar book and was asked to read it to her child as she deemed fit. When the mother finished reading the storybook, the researcher asked the child eight questions about the story. In the third session, demographic and home literacy environment (HLE) information was gathered from the mothers at their homes.</p>
<p>Mothers were given a non-familiar book for two reasons: (1) to avoid the possibility of different levels of previous exposure to the book, and (2) the expectation that a new book might present more of a challenge to the mother to elaborate on its content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0142723712455283">De Temple &amp; Snow, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0142723712455283">Haden et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0142723712455283">Van Kleeck, Gillam, Hamilton, &amp; McGrath, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In the second phase, we tested the children when they were in the first grade. Two individual meetings took place with every child to test his/her literacy level. Each session lasted 20–30 minutes.</p>
<p>Background variables were collected, including the child’s age, the parents’ age, number of children in the family, number of rooms in the house, number of people in the apartment and in each room. A seven-factor index was used to calculate the families’ SES levels, taking the educational, professional, and occupational levels of fathers and mothers, including family income level, into account. The mean of the SES variable was 2.80 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.17) (range 1–5; α = 0.92). The families’ demographic characteristics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0142723712455283">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Maternal mediation in book reading</title>
<p>We used the children’s book <italic>Arrogant Little Rabbit</italic> by Abdo Muhmad, which is written in standard Arabic language (no year of publication is provided) in order to test maternal mediation in a book reading activity. A pre-test conducted with parents and teachers in the Arab community showed that the book was not familiar to them. The book contains 10 pages; each of which includes one to two lines and a colorful matching drawing of the scene. The narrative includes elements of exposition, problem, and solution and tells about an arrogant little rabbit that refused to play with the turtle, the lamb, and she-rabbit. One day, a fox wanted to attack the rabbit and swallow it. All the animals that the rabbit refused to play with hurried to help it. The rabbit apologized to all the animals, thanked them for their kindness, and offered them friendship.</p>
<p>The mother–child book reading interaction took place in the participants’ chosen place at home (in the living room, the child’s room, or the kitchen). Videotapes of the dyadic interactions were transcribed verbatim and the transcripts were used to code the interactions. Transcriptions were segmented into verbal units (see examples in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0142723712455283">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Verbal units constitute the smallest unit of meaning. They are usually comprised of sentences. Single or multiple verbal units may be found within a speaking turn. This method was used previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142723712455283">Bus et al. (2000)</xref>. Inter-judge reliabilities for segmenting the interaction into units were computed based on a random selection of 10% of the dyads. Reliability measured by Cohen’s kappa = 0.80, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.</p>
<p>Each unit was coded in three ways: (1) who is speaking (the mother or the child); (2) the function of the unit (a new unit or a continuation); and (3) the subject or topic of the unit (e.g., naming details in illustrations or discussing the written system). Content was coded only when a new subject was added to the previous discourse. A repetition of content or comments was not coded as a new content. Topic units were classified into five levels of content categories, from low (1) to high (5), as follows: (1) relating to illustrations in the book (e.g., naming characters and objects in the illustrations, referring to the relationship between the text and the illustrations, or naming details in the illustrations that were not mentioned in the story); (2) relating the story in spoken language (mother read the story silently, then told the story in spoken language); (3) reading and paraphrasing (mother read the story aloud, then paraphrased the text – this included word explanations and sentence completion); (4) promoting text comprehension via ‘distancing’ (e.g., relating the child’s own relevant experiences to further text comprehension or making connections beyond the text and, finally, instructions, recollection, reconstruction); (5) relating to the written text, the orthography, and the reading process.</p>
<p>Examples of each of the five content categories, as transcribed from the videotaped mother–child reading interactions, are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0142723712455283">Table 2</xref>. Each unit was coded into only one of the five categories. In a few cases (about four out of all units), when a unit referred to more than one category, an arbitrary decision was made about which category it appeared to fit into better. This coding system was based on work performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0142723712455283">Bus et al. (2000)</xref> and was modified for the purposes of the current study from eight content categories or levels to only five levels. The hierarchy of the levels was determined by ‘moving from concrete immediately available information’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0142723712455283">De Temple &amp; Snow, 1996</xref>, p. 54) to higher cognitive or abstraction processes, termed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0142723712455283">Sigel (1982)</xref> as ‘distancing.’ Level 1, merely relating to the drawings of the book alone, seemed to us to indicate a lower level than Level 2, telling the story in spoken language. We indicated this level as lower than Level 3, because the mother did not read the story. Level 3 dealt with text comprehension by discussing the written text, by simply paraphrasing it, or by giving explanations for a word, or completed sentences in spoken language. Level 4, dealing with text comprehension by enriching it with the child’s own experiences or by relating it to a more general concept, seemed to us to indicate an even higher level. Level 5, relating to the written text, the orthography, and the reading process seemed to us to constitute the most demanding cognitive activity for kindergarten children, compared with the four lower levels described above. Each verbal unit that could be classified into the five content categories was given a score ranging from 1 = low (naming of characters and objects) to 5 = high (relating to the written system in the book). Inter-rater reliabilities for sorting content units were computed based on a random selection of 10% of the dyads. Reliabilities for maternal mediation levels were strong, K = 0.79.</p>

<title>Demographic and HLE information</title>
<p>Mothers were asked for information about the present SES of the family, including their own and the father’s education level (number of school years), profession, occupation, and the family’s income level. The data provided by the mothers were transformed to a five-point scale (from 1 = low to 5 = high). The parental education scale ranged from 1 (six years of schooling or less) to 5 (20 years of schooling or more). The professional qualification and current occupation scale ranged from 1 (unskilled worker and menial industrial laborer) to 5 (higher executives and major professionals). These measures were adapted from the US population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0142723712455283">Row, 1956</xref>) to the Israeli society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0142723712455283">Meir, 1978</xref>). The family’s income level was based on the mother’s ranking of the family income compared to the established average in Israel during the research period (this information was given to the mothers); the mothers’ rankings ranged from 1 (much below the national average) to 5 (much above the national average).</p>
<p>The HLE questionnaire included aspects such as the number of adult and children’s books in the home, frequency of parental reading of books to the child, newspaper subscription (children and adults), mother’s reading pleasure, and the number of videos, DVDs, and children’s educational games in the home. The scales for frequency of reading to the child and for visits to the library ranged from 1 to 5, where 1 = not at all; 2 = once a month; 3 = once a week; 4 = twice a week; 5 = every day. The scales for frequency of mother’s reading pleasure ranged from 1 to 5, where 1 = not at all; 2 = not true; 3 = quite true; 4 = true; 5 = very true.</p>

<title>Written word recognition</title>
<p>This test is aimed at checking the child’s ability to recognize written words accompanied by their matched drawings. We used three pairs of words, which were familiar to the child (turtle–elephant), (butterfly–bear), (ox–giraffe). Each word was written on a separate card and their matching drawings appeared on two other cards. The researcher put the cards with the two words and the two with the drawing in front the child and said, for example: ‘Here are two pictures for butterfly and bear, and also two cards for the two words of butterfly and bear. Please put the word butterfly under the picture of the butterfly and the word bear under the picture of the bear.’ Items for this task were scored incorrect (= 0) or correct (= 1), α = 0.62. After the child gave her/his answer, he/she was asked to explain his/her judgments. Children’s reasoning was classified into five levels, from high (5) to low (1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0142723712455283">Levin &amp; Korat, 1993</xref>), as follows: 1 = egocentric argument, 2 = semantic argument, 3 = phonological argument, 4 = argument based on letters, 5 = argument based on reading (the child read the word), α = 0.91.</p>

<sec id="section11-0142723712455283">
<title>Phonological awareness</title>
<p>Two phonological tests were developed and used in two separate days in this study; initial and final phonemes. Seventeen words were used for each task. The words presenting single nouns employ a large number of letters. The researcher read the word, then asked the child to say the initial or final phonemes of each word. Items for phonological awareness were scored correct (= 1) or incorrect (= 0). The child said the initial phonemes or the final phonemes with CV, 2 = correct phonemes.

<title>Letter naming</title>
<p>Children were presented with 29 letters (including final letters) of the Arabic script. Each letter was written on a card, with the card facing down. The children were asked to randomly pick a letter and say its name. This was repeated 14 times, such that 14 letters were picked. Items were scored 0 = incorrect, 1 = saying the letter name in spoken language, 2 = correct. The reliability of this tool was α = 0.90.</p>

<sec id="section14-0142723712455283">
<title>Orthographic awareness</title>
<p>The Arabic script contains 29 regular letters, where there are 3-4 forms for each letter: beginning of the word (ب ـb), middle of the word (ب - b), at the end of the word is connected, and (ب - b) at the end of the word - not connected (ب - b). Written letters in Arabic are usually connected (e.g., sun – سمش) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0142723712455283">Abu-Rabia &amp; Taha, 2006</xref>). Children were presented with 16 pairs of written stimuli we developed for this study. Each pair was comprised of one Arabic word written on a card and another string of signs that do not represent the Arabic script which was written on another card. The signs were letters and numerals in Arabic, Hebrew, and English, which were repeated several times; a certain letter, long words, letters connected versus not connected letters, etc. The researcher presented the two cards to the child and asked her or him to choose the card that represents an Arabic word. Cronbach’s alpha for this test was 0.82.</p>

We can generate standard scores with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15 for each scale. Eighteen words from the Kaufman Battery for Children were translated into Arabic to test opposite meanings of words in spoken and literary Arabic. The test was administered on two days: on the first day the researcher read a word in the spoken language and asked the child to say the opposite of this word; on the second day she read the word in the written language and asked the child to say the opposite of this word.

<p>The Arab families in our sample have, on average, one computer, about 30 children’s books, and 29 adult books at home. The families have few educational games for reading and arithmetic, including computer games, video cassettes, and DVDs. About one-third of the families reported having a subscription to an adult newspaper. Mothers reported reading to their child every three days (about 11 days a month), while fathers’ reading to the child was reported as once a month. Age of beginning reading was reported as one year and six months. Most variables, including existence of literacy tools (computers, computer games, videos, DVDs, educational games in arithmetic and reading), were correlated positively and significantly with the family’s SES. Reading frequency to the child reported by the mother regarding her and the father was not correlated with the family’s SES.</p>

<p>According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0142723712455283">Table 4</xref>, the most prevalent maternal mediation behavior was reading and paraphrasing, followed by story discussion. All other mediation behaviors relating to illustration, telling the story in spoken language and relating to the written system appeared to a much lower extent. Interestingly, small but significant correlations were found between maternal mediation relating to the written system and SES level.</p>

<p>According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0142723712455283">Table 5</xref>, children’s knowledge of print concept and orthographic knowledge was the highest among the other skills, while letter knowledge and letter–sound connection were the lowest. Children’s verbal knowledge in opposite words was lowest in the oral language. Most measures of children’s knowledge were positively and significantly correlated with SES, and all children’s knowledge was positively and significantly correlated with HLE. No correlation was found between children’s level and maternal mediation. In first grade (presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0142723712455283">Table 6</xref>), children’s knowledge of phonological awareness was the highest among the tested skills. Children’s verbal knowledge in opposite words was as low as in kindergarten. A similar picture of the correlations appears in first grade.</p>
<p>We executed a step-wise regression analysis for each SES group separately, entering SES as the first predictor and HLE as the second, testing their possible contribution to the variance in the children’s general EL score as well as in the individual EL areas. Since maternal mediation was not correlated with children’s literacy level, it was not entered into this regression. The results of this analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0142723712455283">Table 7</xref> for kindergarten children and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0142723712455283">Table 8</xref> for first graders.</p>

Regarding written language, SES contributed 27% to this score and HLE contributed another 8% beyond this contribution in the second step.

<p>A similar picture was found for the first graders. Regarding the general literacy score, the data show that SES entered in the first step accounted significantly for 23% of the variance, while HLE entered in the second step accounted for 37% of the contribution to this level, adding 9% of variance above SES. Regarding written language, SES contributed 21% to this score, and HLE contributed another 9% beyond this contribution in the second step. Regarding oral language, SES contributed 15% to children’s level in the first step, and HLE contributed another 4% beyond this contribution in the second step.</p>
<p>The model shows higher explanatory power and larger effect sizes in first grade (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0142723712455283">Table 8</xref>) compared to kindergarten age (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0142723712455283">Table 7</xref>). We can see that variances explained at the older age are 4–10% greater in both the first and the second steps. However, the additional variance explained in step two in both age levels is significant. Differences become clearer over time.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This research on mothers reading books to Arabic-speaking preschoolers yielded several important results. The first is that the most prevalent maternal mediation behavior in this activity was paraphrasing the text. Second, children’s literacy level was contributed the most by the home literacy environment in the families followed by the SES. Third, the only behavior that correlated significantly with SES was discussing the written system.</p>
<p>Although we tested different kinds of populations who live in different types of settlements, the participants are low income families and their level (<italic>M</italic> = 2.58, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.27) is similar to the low SES of the Hebrew-speaking population (<italic>M</italic> = 2.76, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.92). While the families we studied represent LSES communities, the children in our sample live in a literate environment, although not rich in tools and activities. Their homes include one computer, few educational games for reading and arithmetic, some computer games, video cassettes, and DVDs. We counted 30 children’s books at home and 29 for adults. A study performed on low SES Israeli Hebrew-speaking families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723712455283">Korat et al., 2007</xref>) performed with the same procedure and equivalent tools, indicated that the number of children’s books in the Hebrew-speaking homes (<italic>N</italic> = 49) was much higher than in the Arabic-speaking homes, with the same differences found for adult books (<italic>N</italic> = 72).</p>
<p>As reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723712455283">Korat et al., 2007</xref>), the existence of literacy tools at home, including the age of starting to read to the child, was correlated positively and significantly with the SES of the families. The only parameter which was not correlated with SES was parental report on the frequency of reading books to their children. The lack of correlation between frequency of reading and SES has been reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142723712455283">Bus et al., 1995</xref>) and it was suggested that contemporary parents, including those from low SES, understand the importance that ‘society’ (teachers, schools, and media) attributes to book reading to young children. This might encourage social desirability to report on reading frequently to the child across all social groups. A few previous studies used the parental Title Recognition Test (TRT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0142723712455283">Stanovich &amp; West, 1989</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0142723712455283">Korat &amp; Levin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0142723712455283">Sénéchal &amp; Lefevre, 2002</xref>) in order to determine parental reading habits for the young child using an indirect measure. Further studies on parental habits of reading in the Arabic-speaking community are recommended in order to develop and use this tool for more reliable results.</p>
<p>One of the most important results in our study is that the prevalent maternal mediation behavior in book reading is paraphrasing (65%), followed by story discussion (22%). Other mediation behaviors, such as relating to illustration, telling the story in spoken language and relating to the written system, appeared to a much lower extent. Furthermore, the only behavior that correlated significantly with SES was maternal discussing of the written system. Why do Arabic-speaking mothers tend to read the text and paraphrase during most of their reading event time and discuss the story to a much smaller extent? For example, low SES Israeli Hebrew-speaking mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723712455283">Korat et al., 2007</xref>) exhibit paraphrasing in only 32% of their behavior while middle SES show 22%.</p>
<p>The explanation for this behavior seems to be related to the diglossic phenomenon of the Arabic language. Since young Arabic-speaking children are not familiar with the literate language and almost do not understand it (it is almost a second language for them), mothers try to close the gap and tell the story to their children in the oral language. Children might not understand the written language lexicon, the different grammar and syntax, and this might prevent the opportunity to develop a deep meaning of the story. Maternal effort is directed mainly to the ‘translation’ of the book, and leaves much less time for higher discussion which goes beyond the text. For example, 41% of the behavior of low SES Israeli Hebrew-speaking mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723712455283">Korat et al., 2007</xref>) in the reading event with their young child is a discussion beyond the text, while among middle SES it is 50%. We believe that paraphrasing is very important for Arabic-speaking children, although it could be better for them if educators, including parents, would enrich their strategies while reading to the children and expand story discussion beyond the text including talk on the written language and print. This notion might be strengthened by the very interesting and important finding in our study, which is that the only behavior that correlated significantly with SES was maternal discussion of the written system. This means that more educated and relatively higher income mothers understand the importance of this behavior (e.g., “let’s spell out the word arrogant ربآتملا”) and tend (although not extensively) to behave in this way when reading to their child.</p>
<p>Children’s knowledge of the oral and the written language shows different levels along kindergarten age and first grade. Their verbal skills in opposite word meanings were the lowest among all variables, especially regarding the written language. As expected, most children’s knowledge measures positively and significantly correlated with SES, while correlation with HLE was more stable and was obtained for all of the children’s measures.</p>
<p>Although the present study was not designed to determine causality, some indication can be drawn from the regression analysis we conducted. Our results show that HLE made the highest contribution to explaining differences between children’s general literacy knowledge in kindergarten beyond SES level, which also made a contribution to the children’s level. Interestingly, the home literacy environment contribution effect appeared more clearly in first grade than in kindergarten age. This could be explained by the formal literacy teaching in first grade, which could show differences in literacy levels of children more visibly than in kindergarten age.</p>
<p>The results are similar to previous studies regarding the contribution of SES and HLE to children’s early literacy in low SES communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0142723712455283">Evans, Shaw, &amp; Bell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723712455283">Korat et al., 2007</xref>). The contribution of the HLE seems more prevalent than SES and goes beyond the family SES. These relationships between HLE and children’s EL levels support previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0142723712455283">Burgess, Hecht, &amp; Lonigan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723712455283">Korat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0142723712455283">Sonnenschein &amp; Munsterman, 2002</xref>). Our study expands on the existing database by showing that the same relations exist within the Israeli Arab community. Importantly, although most Arab families live in low SES communities, the variability in HLE, namely literacy tools and activities within this society, makes a significant contribution to the children’s level beyond parental education, profession, and income. Thus, literacy material and activities with young children in the Arab community impact the children’s oral and written knowledge before school age as well as at school beginning in first grade.</p>
<p>Maternal mediation, which was mostly paraphrasing, was not related to children’s language and literacy in kindergarten or in first grade. These results were surprising to some extent. Previous research showed about an 8% contribution to oral language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142723712455283">Bus et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142723712455283">Korat et al., 2007</xref>). Had mothers used more discussion beyond the text, including print concept and written language discussion, a greater contribution to the children’s level might have been found. Parental mediation contribution to children’s literacy following a book reading activity was usually found for the MSES group and not for LSES. These results could be explained by the fact that most Arabic-speaking families are part of LSES communities, in which mediation behavior is less supportive for child language and literacy.</p>
<p>Some limitations of this study should be taken into account. First, using non-narrative genres (e.g., alphabet, rhyming, or expository books), rather than the storybook genre we used, might have an effect on parental mediation level as well as on children’s literacy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0142723712455283">Ezell &amp; Justice, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0142723712455283">Stahl, 2003</xref>). Second, including maternal reports on the extent to which they engage their children in print activities, such as teaching their children to print letters or words, could give us a better idea on the home literacy activities and might better explain the children’s measured literacy levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0142723712455283">Sénéchal, LeFerve, Thomas, &amp; Daley, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, this research offered a first glimpse into a book reading activity in Arabic-speaking families with young children. It shows the importance of literacy tools and activities at home for the children’s literacy level with no effect of maternal mediation behavior. Further studies are needed in order to deepen our understanding of literacy events in the Arabic-speaking communities and their possible effects on young children’s language and literacy acquisition.</p>
