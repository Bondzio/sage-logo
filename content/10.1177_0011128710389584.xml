<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study is to document the relationship between physical abuse during childhood and family violence among a group of police officers from the Baltimore Police Department in the United States. Analyzing data from the Police and Domestic Violence in Police Families in Baltimore, Maryland, 1997-1999, this study found a positive relationship between physical abuse and family violence toward spouses and children. Specifically, this study found that police officers who indicated that their parents where physical with them were more likely to report being physical with their spouse and children. They were also more likely to report yelling or shouting toward family members. This study shows a positive relationship between physical abuse and involvement in family violence, and increases our knowledge regarding the cycle of violence in police families. This study points to the need for better recognition of physical abuse and the negative consequences children are likely to endure.</p>

<p>The negative consequences of harsh or physical abuse are well documented in the child abuse literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128710389584">Brezina, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128710389584">Haynie, Petts, Maimon, &amp; Piquero, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011128710389584">Thornberry, Ireland, &amp; Smith, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011128710389584">Widom &amp; Maxfield, 2001</xref>). An area particularly interesting to criminologists and other social scientists is the association between physical abuse and criminal offending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128710389584">Haynie et al., 2009</xref>). Recent research has supported the link between the two. For example, analyzing data from the National Youth Survey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128710389584">Fagan (2005)</xref> stated that children who reported “being beaten by a parent” were more likely than nonabused children to report involvement in serious and nonserious delinquency, which included violent and nonviolent crimes, drug use, and domestic violence (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011128710389584">Widom, 1989</xref>). In what has been termed <italic>the cycle of violence theory</italic>, research has generally found that victims of harsh or physical discipline are at a greater odds for committing criminal acts and other deviant behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128710389584">Brezina, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128710389584">Haynie et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128710389584">Kakar, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128710389584">Smith &amp; Thornberry, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011128710389584">Thornberry et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011128710389584">Widom, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011128710389584">Widom &amp; Maxfield, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011128710389584">Zingraff, Leiter, Myers, &amp; Johnsen, 1993</xref>). In addition, other studies have documented that those who have suffered from physical abuse are also more likely to perpetrate violence toward spouses and other family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128710389584">Cox, Kotch, &amp; Everson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128710389584">Edleson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011128710389584">Fang &amp; Corso, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011128710389584">Ireland &amp; Smith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011128710389584">Murrell, Christoff, &amp; Henning, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011128710389584">Romano &amp; De Luca, 1997</xref>). However, we should remember that not all victims of physical abuse become criminal offenders or commit physical abuse toward others.</p>
<p>Although these and other studies are important and necessary for our comprehension of physical abuse and its consequences, this link between child physical abuse and family violence has yet to be fully examined on a sample of police officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128710389584">Gibson, Swatt, &amp; Jolicoeur, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128710389584">Piquero, 2005</xref>). Research on police officers as offenders of domestic violence continues to grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128710389584">Erwin, Gershon, Tiburzi, &amp; Li, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128710389584">Gerson, Barocas, Canton, Li, &amp; Vlahov, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128710389584">Johnson, Todd, &amp; Subramanian, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128710389584">Lonsway, 2006</xref>). Lacking in these studies is the examination of past child physical abuse and how that contributes to family violence in police families. Empirically examining this link among police officers is important as it has been increasingly common to see news reports of police departments investigating their own officers accused of perpetrating violence against their spouses (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128710389584">Erwin et al., 2005</xref>). Although researchers have examined the link between physical abuse and various criminal or deviant behavior among various populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128710389584">Mullings, Hartley, &amp; Marquart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128710389584">Mullings, Marquart, &amp; Brewer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128710389584">Mullings, Marquart, &amp; Hartley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011128710389584">Mullings, Pollock, &amp; Crouch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128710389584">Pollock, Mullings, &amp; Crouch, 2006</xref>), it is necessary to determine whether the relationship between the two can be found in police families.</p>
<p>The current study analyzes data from Police Stress and Domestic Violence in Police Families in Baltimore, Maryland, to shed light on the negative consequences of physical abuse among police officers. The importance of studying this population is not only highlighted by the small, but growing, research on police officers as perpetrators of family violence but also by the fact that police officers are responsible for intervening in family violence cases. It becomes important to document the amount of family violence in police families, including whether physical abuse contributes to the perpetration of violence toward spouses and children as documented in the general population. The data contained information about police officers on a range of offenses including family violence toward their spouses and children as well as information on the officers’ sex, education, and race/ethnicity. This study adds to the literature by examining the connection between child physical abuse and family violence to a population not previously studied (police officers).</p>
<sec id="section1-0011128710389584">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The cycle of violence theory states that harsh or physical discipline increases the likelihood of abused children engaging in a variety of deviant and criminal behaviors. Grounded on social learning theory, those who experienced harsh maltreatment are taught that physical retributions are appropriate when dealing with some form of uncomfortable hostility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128710389584">Foshee, Bauman, &amp; Linder, 1999</xref>). Early studies that utilized court records provided support that children who were victims of physical abuse were more likely to become criminal offenders than children with no maltreatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128710389584">Brezina, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128710389584">Kakar, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128710389584">Smith &amp; Thornberry, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011128710389584">Thornberry et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011128710389584">Widom, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011128710389584">Widom &amp; Maxfield, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011128710389584">Zingraff et al., 1993</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128710389584">Smith and Thornberry (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011128710389584">Widom and Maxfield (2001)</xref> found evidence that victims of child abuse were inclined to be frequent offenders, more likely to have been arrested during their adolescent years, and more likely to be persistent offenders throughout their adult lives. In addition to criminal offending, other studies reported that physical abuse was associated with drug and alcohol abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128710389584">Ireland &amp; Widom, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128710389584">Smith &amp; Thornberry, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011128710389584">Thornberry et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011128710389584">Widom &amp; Maxfield, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, evidence exists that physical abuse may be more problematic toward certain groups of children, including children from low-income families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128710389584">Kotch, Muller, &amp; Blakely, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011128710389584">Wauchope &amp; Straus, 1990</xref>), from single- or step-parent families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128710389584">Smith &amp; Thornberry, 1995</xref>), children living in disorganized neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128710389584">Kotch et al., 1999</xref>), and children belonging to racial minority groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128710389584">Kotch et al., 1999</xref>). Sex also played an important role. Girls are more likely than boys to be victims of sexual abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128710389584">Kotch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128710389584">Romano &amp; De Luca, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011128710389584">Trickett &amp; Putnam, 1998</xref>), despite the fact that boys and girls experience the same levels of physical abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128710389584">Kotch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128710389584">McClellan, Farabee, &amp; Crouch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011128710389584">Whitcomb, 1999</xref>). Other research found that abused girls are more likely than abused boys to have an alcohol-related arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128710389584">Ireland &amp; Widom, 1994</xref>) and to have alcohol-related problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011128710389584">Widom, Ireland, &amp; Glynn, 1995</xref>). Racial differences are also evident in the research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011128710389584">Widom and Maxfield (2001)</xref> reported that despite finding that White and non-White victims are likely than nonabused victims to report committing a criminal act, the relationship was stronger for Blacks than for Whites. This study demonstrated the importance of examining race/ethnicity and physical abuse.</p>
<p>Domestic violence scholars have also documented the negative consequences of harsh or physical discipline. Several studies have linked physical abuse to the perpetration of violence toward family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128710389584">Ehrensaft et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011128710389584">Stith et al., 2000</xref>). However, why physical abuse may lead to the perpetration of family violence is still disputed among scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011128710389584">Fang &amp; Corso, 2008</xref>). The dominate explanation for the connection is the social learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128710389584">Bandura, 1977</xref>). Family violence scholars argue that physical abuse teaches abused children that violence toward others is legitimate and that violence could be used as an effective method for resolving personal conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128710389584">Simons, Wu, Johnson, &amp; Conger, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128710389584">Simons et al. (1995)</xref> argued that an antisocial behavior trait is developed by maltreated children that increase the risk for family violence through promoting violent behavior during teenage years. Aggressive behavior during adolescence is carried into adulthood and used against spouses and children whenever serious conflicts arise. However, research testing these propositions has yielded mixed results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011128710389584">Capaldi &amp; Clark, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011128710389584">Herrenkohl et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128710389584">Simons et al., 1995</xref>). Nevertheless, learning to be violent (either through violent parents or association with violent peers) has found support in the criminological literature (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128710389584">Heimer, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on police officers as offenders of domestic violence is increasingly growing, although scholars have been calling for such research for years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128710389584">Lonsway, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128710389584">Lonsway (2006)</xref> noted that early studies documented the amount of family violence perpetrated by officers by asking chiefs of police about such behavior among their officers or looking at the answers to questions concerning acts of family violence perpetration during the hiring process of new applicants (also see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011128710389584">Campion, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011128710389584">Inwald, Traynor, &amp; Favuzza, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011128710389584">Ryan, 2000</xref>). In one of the first studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011128710389584">Neidig, Russell, and Seng (1992)</xref> surveyed 385 police officers attending a law enforcement conference. Using a modified version of the Conflict Tactics Scale, the authors found that 28% of the officers surveyed indicated that at least one act of physical violence was perpetrated against their partners in the past year. In a different study, these same authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128710389584">Neidig, Seng, &amp; Russell, 1992</xref>) conducted another survey consisting of 891 male officers and 119 wives who attended the biennial conference of the Fraternal Order of Police. This survey found that 24% of those surveyed indicated at least one act of violent toward their spouse, while their wives reported 28%. However, currently it is impossible to know exactly the amount of intimate partner violence perpetrated by police officers, but these studies indicate that the amount could possibly be the same as the general population.</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>The child abuse literature suggested a link between physical abuse and criminal offending, but no study has examined the affects of physical abuse among police officers. This study adds to the literature by examining the following research questions:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-0011128710389584">
<title>Police Stress and Domestic Violence in Police Families in Baltimore, Maryland</title>
<p>Data for this research are obtained from The Police and Domestic Violence in Police Families in Baltimore, Maryland, 1997-1999. This study consisted of a five-page questionnaire that was administrated to police officers of the Baltimore Police Department in all of Baltimore’s precincts. The purpose of the survey was to document the amount of family violence in police families. The questionnaire specifically measured police-duty induced stressors, negative contact with criminals, the officers’ current stress level, and the officers’ perceived level of support from their police department and family members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011128710389584">1</xref></sup> In addition, the questionnaire specifically asked officers about their use of violence toward their intimate partners and children. Finally, the survey asked participating officers about their parents’ maltreatment toward them when they were a child. Out of the 1,200 surveys handed out, 1,104 police officers (92%) completed the survey.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0011128710389584">
<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>This study contained three dependent variables that will test the relationship between child maltreatment and various types of family violence among police officers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011128710389584">2</xref></sup> To capture physical violence in their current relationship, participating police officers were asked the following: “Ever got physical with your spouse?” Respondents were allowed to answer either 1 = <italic>yes</italic> or 0 = <italic>no</italic>. To capture violence toward their children, participating police officers were asked, “Ever got physical with your children?” Respondents were allowed to answer either 1 = <italic>yes</italic> or 0 = <italic>no</italic>. To capture nonphysical abuse, participating police officers were asked, “Yell or shout at your spouse or family?” Respondents were allowed to answer either by indicating (a) never, (b) sometimes, (c) frequently, and (d) always. To make the analysis easier to interpret, the decision was made to combine those who answered never/sometimes and who answered frequently/always together into two separate responses. Therefore, never/sometimes is coded 0 = <italic>no</italic> and frequently/always is coded 1 = <italic>yes</italic>.</p>
<p>At this point, it is important to note that some readers may question whether asking police officers if they ever “got physical” with a spouse or family member is actually measuring family violence at home. It is possible that getting physical with a spouse or child could be interpreted to include horseplay, sexual intimacy for adults, or overall roughhousing. However, this concern is offset by the fact that police officers were told that this survey was about family violence at their home. Questions concerning the perpetration of physical action toward their partners or children could have only meant family violence toward them. In addition, several studies have used these measures to indicate the amount of violence in these families (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128710389584">Gibson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128710389584">Piquero, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0011128710389584">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>The primary independent variable is physical abuse by parents toward the respondents. Physical abuse was captured by asking participating police officers the following question: “Parents got physical with you as a child?” Respondents were allowed to answer either 1 = <italic>yes</italic> or 0 = <italic>no</italic>. Again, at this point, it is important to note that some readers may question whether asking participating police officers if a parent ever “got physical” with them is actually measuring child maltreatment when these police officers were growing up. This concern is again offset by the fact that police officers were told to recall their parents’ treatment of them and whether physical action was frequent. Due to the content of the survey, the parents’ physical perpetration toward them could have only meant physical abuse. In addition to the primary independent variable, several variables will be controlled. Sex was coded as 1 = <italic>male</italic> and 0 = <italic>female</italic>. Race and ethnicity was coded 1 if the respondents were White and 0 if they were non-White (i.e., Black, Hispanic, or other).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0011128710389584">3</xref></sup> Education was coded 1 for respondents with a college degree and 0 otherwise. Marital status was coded 1 for respondents who are married and 0 otherwise.</p>

Looking at intimate partner violence toward the respondent’s spouse (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011128710389584">Table 2</xref>), we can see a positive relationship between child maltreatment and physical abuse. Police officers who reported that their parents got physical with them were almost 3 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.993; <italic>p</italic> ≤ .000) times more likely to physically abuse their spouses than respondents who did not report child maltreatment. In this sample, child maltreatment is positively associated with physical abuse toward spouses among police officers. Other significant variables include sex. Male officers were less likely to report physical abuse toward spouses than female officers (b = −.751, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05). No other demographic variable were found to be statistically significant in this model.</p>

<p>Turning attention to physical abuse toward children, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0011128710389584">Table 3</xref> reports a positive relationship between child maltreatment and child abuse. Officers who reported that their parents got physical with them were 4 times (OR = 4.149, <italic>p</italic> ≤ 000) more likely to report being physical with their children than officers who reported no child maltreatment. Again, no other demographic variable was found to be statistically significant in this model.</p>
<p>The last model sought to understand the link between child maltreatment among police officers and nonphysical abuse—yelling or shouting toward family members. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0011128710389584">Table 4</xref> reports a statistically significant relationship between child maltreatment and nonphysical abuse. Specifically, police officers who had experienced physical maltreatment as a child were almost twice as likely (OR = 1.786, <italic>p</italic> ≤ .05) to yell or shout toward family members than officers who reported no child maltreatment. Similar to the models above, no other demographic variable was found to be statistically significant. Overall, these analyses support the assertion that child maltreatment is linked to violence toward other family members.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study is to document the relationship between child maltreatment and family violence among a group of police officers. Analyzing data from The Police and Domestic Violence in Police Families in Baltimore, Maryland, 1997-1999, this study found a positive relationship between child maltreatment and family violence toward spouses and children. This study specifically found that police officers who indicated that their parents got physical with them were more likely to report being physical with their spouse and children. They were also likely to report yelling or shouting toward family members. In sum, this study shows a relationship between child maltreatment and involvement in family violence and increases the knowledge regarding the cycle of violence in police families.</p>
<p>This study, as well as other studies that document the negative consequences of child maltreatment, indicates the need for better recognition of child maltreatment and the negative consequences children are likely to endure. It is well documented that child abuse victims are reluctant to report their abuse to authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128710389584">Finkelhor, 1994</xref>), and studies relying on criminal and court records may fail to record abuse that is not brought to the attention of the criminal justice system. One advantage of this study is that it relies on self-reports and captured child maltreatment that may have gone unreported. Furthermore, this study is one of a few examples to utilize a data sample not entirely consisting of adolescent or respondents from the general population but on a population that traditionally has been hard to collect data from. Because prior research has used representative samples of children who report maltreatment (i.e., National Survey of Adolescents, National Youth Survey, and Rochester Youth Development Study), our knowledge of the link between child maltreatment and criminal offending is limited to the crimes committed during adolescence. Historically, studies have only examined the short-term effects of child maltreatment and criminal behavior, and most respondents in nationally representative surveys are no older than 18 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011128710389584">Brezina, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128710389584">Fagan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011128710389584">Thornberry et al., 2001</xref>). Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128710389584">Fagan (2005)</xref> reported that the relationship between child maltreatment and criminal behavior weakens as the child grows older, this study shows that the negative effect of child maltreatment continues for some well into adulthood and into their careers as law enforcement officers. More studies are clearly needed to examine this relationship further. Future studies should also include other measures of violence toward family members such as emotional and financial abuse, neglect, and controlling behaviors.</p>
<p>Like many others studies, the results generated in the current analyses should be viewed with caution. First, the dependent variables were captured by using very broad measures. The question “Ever got physical with your spouse” and “Ever got physical with your children” can encompass activities that some respondents may view as being physical but not necessarily harmful. Regardless, other studies utilizing this data set have been successful in documenting the amount of violence in police families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128710389584">Gibson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128710389584">Piquero, 2005</xref>). Second, child maltreatment was captured by asking if the respondents’ parents ever got physical with them. By using a narrow definition, other forms of child maltreatment (i.e., emotional neglect and malnourishment) were not captured in the survey. It is possible that a wide variety of child maltreatment could have greatly supported the analyses above. Third, we must assume that police officers who took this survey were also telling the truth about these criminal behaviors (family violence). It is possible that some officers who do abuse their spouse and children could have given a “no” response to these questions. With full knowledge of mandatory arrest laws for offenders of domestic violence, the true number of family violence cases may not have been captured by the survey. Finally, it should be pointed out that other factors not captured by the analysis could potentially explain the link between the child maltreatment and family violence among police officers. Other variables, particularly police stressors such as frequent contact with criminals, exposure to criminal scenes, and other stress induced by police duties could have also explained family violence among police officers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0011128710389584">4</xref></sup> When studies take these factors into consideration, child maltreatment may simply dissipate. Future research should be conducted to determine whether child maltreatment is the primary factor or whether police stressors better explain family violence among police officers. Much more studies are needed. Nevertheless, this study highlights the importance of documenting the link between child maltreatment and family violence in adult samples, particularly in law enforcement. Identifying this social problem could help shape prevention/intervention programs within police departments and provide help for those police officers who are already in one of the most stressful (and important) occupations in the United States.</p>

<p>In an occupation as stressful as law enforcement, work-induced stressors have a theoretical importance in explaining family violence in police families (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128710389584">Gibson, Swatt, &amp; Jolicoeur, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128710389584">Piquero, 2005</xref>).

<p>The survey also captured other criminal and deviant acts (gambling, excessive smoking, alcohol consumption, and marijuana use). However, as only a small number of police officers admitted committing these acts, these variables are not analyzed with the primary independent variable.</p>

<p>Social scientists have a long history of “racial lumping,” creating variables in which White respondents are compared with all other ethnicities at once. When these accounts occur, it is unknown whether Hispanics, Blacks, Asians, or any other ethnic groups are better or worse compared to other minorities. However, given the low variation in the distribution of race and ethnicity in the current study (only 12 and 23 police officers identified themselves as Hispanic and “Other,” respectively), the decision was made to create the current variable.</p>
