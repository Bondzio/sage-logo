<p>You wait years for a book on film festivals and then seven come along at the same time. Well, perhaps not simultaneously, but seven books in four years is indicative of a recent and developing academic interest in film festivals. Cindy Hing-Yuk Wong’s monograph, <italic>Film Festivals: Culture, People, and Power on the Global Screen</italic>, is the latest addition to a developing body of critical literature in an area that some academics have termed ‘Film Festival Studies’. It stacks up beside Marijke de Valck’s, <italic>Film Festivals: From European Geopolitics to Global Cinephilia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0163443712473416">2008</xref>), Richard Porton’s edited collection, <italic>Dekalog 03: On Film Festivals</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0163443712473416">2009</xref>) and four volumes of <italic>The Film Festivals Yearbook</italic> (2008–12), the latter emanating from the Department of Film Studies at the University of St Andrews. In addition, the leading film journal, <italic>Screen</italic> (summer 2011) recently published a dossier on film festivals edited by Mitch Miller and I.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0163443712473416">1</xref></sup> This interest in film festivals reflects, in part, a move in film studies away from text-based analysis towards a focus on exhibition, distribution and reception. The study of film festivals, however, has moved beyond film studies to involve participants from numerous disciplines in the arts and social sciences.</p>
<p>Hing-Yuk Wong’s book provides an excellent overview of film festivals themselves. In building on the existing literature, she charts the emergence of the film festival as a specific event, placing it within contemporary geo-political concerns. This moves from the earlier days of festivals, for example, the establishment of the Venice festival under Mussolini and the Berlin festival’s Cold War propaganda value, to the more recent development of issue-based festivals, with a focus here on human rights and lesbian and gay film festivals.</p>
<p>She also finds room for a discussion of the nature of what might be termed the ‘festival film’, that is, films whose formal and thematic qualities might find a favourable response on the festival circuit, but not with broader audiences, and the festival circuit’s role in circulating and sustaining this type of cinema.</p>
<p>The book draws on a variety of theoretical frameworks to support what is extensive participation in, and research into, film festivals carried out over an extensive period. Jürgen Habermas’s notion of the public sphere is the most notable example here; perhaps, however, the theory is not always as integrated into the author’s argument as it might have been. That said, this is a welcome addition to the literature in the field, including both comprehensive overview and specific case studies. In particular, the book’s closing chapter, a rich and detailed examination of the Hong Kong International Film Festival, moves the study of film festivals further away from the study of the established and long-standing ‘A’ list festivals.</p>
