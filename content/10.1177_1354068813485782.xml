<p>This is an excellent volume on an important topic: the influence of political context on electoral participation and choice. Dalton and Anderson assembled an impressive set of authors to train their focus – and, in most cases, multi-level modeling techniques – on data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES). The result is cutting-edge research that contributes in meaningful ways to our understanding of the effects of political context across a wide range of countries. Not surprisingly, we learn that context matters. What is surprising are the specifics. While context does matter, it is not as powerful a force on electoral behaviour as many scholars have presumed. To the extent it does matter, context mostly has indirect effects through other, individual-level variables. Finally, the aspect of political context that matters most (party polarization) is not the one heralded most in the existing literature. The results are persuasive and their net effect quite powerful. To a large extent, this reflects the strong conceptual development and organization the editors provide in the book-end chapters and how this presumably guided the contributors’ research.</p>
<p>The introductory chapter does what it is supposed to do: provide a strong motivation for the research, a review of what has come before, and an overview of the book. It does more, however. Dalton and Anderson conceptualize contextual effects and then spell out guideposts regarding the number and clarity of electoral options. They also offer glimmers of empirical evidence, which nicely whets the appetite for what follows and serves as an important foundation. Although it is critically linked to the rest of the book, the chapter works well as a stand-alone reading. It also connects neatly with the editors’ concluding chapter, which interprets what the intervening chapters have shown using their conceptual framework. In between, there are nine chapters organized into three sections: participation, electoral choice, and voting and representation.</p>
<p>Two chapters address electoral participation. Miki Caul Kittilson and co-editor Christopher Anderson examine voter turnout. They begin by showing that individual-level variance in turnout is five times the country-level variance, which is an important structuring fact. Not surprisingly, individual-level variables are the primary determinants of turnout and contextual variables play a comparatively small role, and their effects are indirect. Of special importance is the polarization of the party system – the greater the polarization, the less likely certain, electorally detached, voters are to go to the polls. This is an interesting result with broader implications that the authors spell out clearly. Jeffrey Karp and Susan Banducci offer a different perspective, focusing on participation during the election campaign instead of election day turnout. The general pattern of results is much the same, however. Individual-level variables mostly determine campaign activity but contextual factors also have important indirect effects. Specifically, party polarization increases the strength of party preferences and decreases party contact, both of which, in turn, influence campaign activity.</p>
<p>The heart of the book is electoral choice, and here there are five contributions. Robin Best and Michael MacDonald begin with the role of party policy positions in vote choice. Based on a general analysis of voters’ policy preferences and parties’ positions, they conclude that vote choice is motivated by policy considerations but that other things clearly matter. In the next chapter, Dalton hones in on ideological voting. He shows that the tendency for people to vote ideologically varies considerably across contexts and individuals. As party polarization increases, the correlation between left–right self-placement and vote choice increases. The effect is especially pronounced for low information voters and those with weak party identification. Yuliya Tverdova addresses other determinants of voting, particularly party leaders. She reveals that both party and leader evaluations structure vote choice and the effects differ only slightly across contexts. Parties are less influential in presidential systems and more influential in proportional systems.</p>
<p>Performance voting has received increasing scholarly attention, and Tim Hellwig’s chapter examines how it varies across contexts. He demonstrates that performance is most influential when administrative responsibility is concentrated and especially when the party system offers a wide range of choice. These features of context also influence the vote indirectly, through the levels and types of political information citizens acquire. The patterns are subtle and provocative, and an important basis for future research. In the final chapter on electoral choice, Andre Blais and Thomas Gschwend consider strategic voting. The authors explore how the characteristics of voters, parties and elections all condition the tendency for voters to strategically defect from their preferred party. Importantly, they show that contextual features have limited effects on defection rates – voters almost only desert weak political parties in extremely disproportional systems.</p>
<p>Two chapters focus on voting and representation. In what may be the most surprising chapter of the book, G. Bingham Powell’s challenges his own classic work on the effects of electoral systems on the congruence between citizens and governments. He shows that party system polarization, not the disproportionality of the electoral system, is the primary driving contextual determinant of incongruent positions – the greater the polarization, the greater the ideological distance between the median citizen and the government. There is some hint that the effect of electoral rules depends on the level of polarization, and this may help explain Powell’s earlier results during a period of larger party spread. In the other chapter in the section, co-editor Christopher Anderson examines public attitudes toward representation by the political parties, leaders and elections in general. The research effectively builds on his work on consensus systems and satisfaction with democracy, and assesses how electoral rules and party polarization influence perceptions of representation. He finds that individual-level variables do most of the work of explaining variation in representation perceptions, and that the location in the political spectrum is particularly important. The tendency for the median voter to feel un-represented is dependent on the context: it is stronger in polarized party systems and weaker in proportional electoral systems. This is of potential consequence for the functioning of representative democracies.</p>
<p>
<italic>Citizens, Context, and Choice</italic> is an important work that I think belongs on the shelves of all scholars of political behaviour. It covers a lot of ground and does so in a focused and rigorous way, building on what we already know about political behaviour and yet challenging our understanding. We see that political context does matter, just not as much or in the ways we may have thought. Most importantly, the clarity of choice as reflected in the party system is a more pervasive and powerful factor than the amount of choice structured by the electoral system. This is an important finding. It also begs the question: what causes party polarization? The subject is already receiving a good amount of attention; with the arrival of this book it is bound to receive more.</p>
