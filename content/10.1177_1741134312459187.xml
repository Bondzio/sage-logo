<abstract>
<p>BRIC basically include the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China. The growth of pharmaceutical market in these countries has been very eye-popping during the last two decades. The growth of pharmaceutical market depends upon the drug regulatory system and drug regulatory laws. The drug regulatory system in these countries is on the way of continuous improvement e.g. introduction of product patent in India, provisions for drug approval in China, bioequivalence testing requirement in Brazil, Russian new law on circulation of medicines 2010. In this article the drug regulatory system of BRIC countries has been analyzed. These drug regulatory trends include following: drug regulatory framework, drug regulatory laws, clinical trials, drug registration procedures, drug pricing mechanism, GMP practices, pharmacovigilance, patents system on pharmaceuticals, patent linkage and data protection, etc. Drug regulatory framework has been analyzed by studying the composition of various central and state drug regulatory authorities and drug testing institutions regulating the pharmaceutical industry. The basic drug regulatory laws regulating approval, manufacturing, packing, labeling, selling, advertising, use of drugs, cosmetics and medical devices has been reported. The drug pricing mechanism over the essential and nonessential drugs and drug price calculation formula has been reported. The drug manufacturing law, manufacturing approval and inspection system has also been analyzed. The pharmacovigilance system for the reporting of Adverse Drug Reactions in these countries has been studied. Finally an analysis of the intellectual property rights related to pharmaceuticals has been made in BRIC countries.</p>

<p>The drug regulatory system is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy and quality of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, diagnostics and cosmetics. The drug regulatory system is also responsible for advancing the public health by keeping its systems contemporary and by helping to speed innovations that make pharmacotherapy safer and more effective. The regulatory system also helps in the consumers getting accurate and adequate information concerning the appropriate use of medicines and related products. The vision of a model drug regulatory system would be to protect public health by ensuring provision of safe, effective and quality drugs and pharmaceuticals based on scientific excellence and best possible regulatory practices. Development and deployment of qualified and trained professionals can alone provide nationwide enforcement, which is uniform, consistent and of a high quality. In this article, various features of drug regulatory system of BRIC countries has been studied and compared and finally recommendations has been given at the end to improve the regulatory system.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1741134312459187"><title>Regulatory trends of India pharmaceutical market</title>
<sec id="sec3-1741134312459187"><title>Drug regulatory framework</title>
<p>The drug regulatory framework in India is spread out over various layers of the Indian central government and state governments. At the central level, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) examines pharmaceutical issues within the larger context of public health while the focus of the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers is on industrial policy. The Central Drugs Standards Control Organization (CDSCO) is the main drug regulatory authority under the Ministry of Health charged with laying down standards of drugs and approving new drugs, clinical trials, manufacturing license approving authority, testing of drugs, monitoring ADRs. The state FDAs has the responsibility of licensing drug formulations, drug testing labs, manufacturing sites, sale premises, inspection of manufacturing sites and sale premises. The licensing procedure in India follows dual mechanism i.e. CDSCO is the license approving authority whereas the state drug regulatory authority is the license approving authority. So, it is clear that there is divisibility of power to regulate the quality and safety of drugs between central and state governments. This divisibility of power between central and state government on quality, safety and efficacy of drugs has a very adverse effect on Indian medicines and public health. Poor conditions for manufacturing of drugs has lead to emergence of substandard and impure drugs. Moreover difference in drug inspection system of different states is also a question of nonuniformity in drug regulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741134312459187">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741134312459187">2</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741134312459187"><title>Drug regulatory laws</title>
<p>The Drugs and Cosmetic Act, 1940, and Rules, 1945 regulates the import, approval, manufacture, distribution and sale of drugs, cosmetics and medical devices in India. The Schedules C and C<sub>1</sub>, Schedule X regulates the import of drugs, Schedules G and H regulates labeling and Schedule Y regulates clinical trials in India. The Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954 regulates the advertisement related to drugs. The Drugs Price Control Order, 1995 regulates the equitable distribution of essential drugs and fixes the maximum sale prices of essential drugs and drug formulations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741134312459187">2</xref></sup> The Patents Act, 1970 and Patent Amendment Act, 2005 are responsible for protecting the intellectual property rights related to drugs. India does not have a comprehensive system of regulations or a centralized form of authority and enforcement. Pharmaceutical and regulatory powers are divided between a variety of sectors within central and state governments. There is overlap between different enforcement and regulatory functions. This lack of clarity hinders the effective running of the regulatory system. Inadequate regulatory expertise and testing facilities have failed to implement uniform standards. Comprehensive safety and quality regulations are not in place nor it is clear which line of government is charged with enforcement and implementing the existing regulations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741134312459187">2</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741134312459187"><title>Clinical trials</title>
<p>The CDSCO under Ministry of Health is responsible for regulation of clinical trials in India. The laws regulating clinical trials are Schedule Y (equivalent to IND/BLA/NDA), 2005, ICMR Guidelines, 2006, and CDSCO, GCP Guidelines. ICMR Guidelines regulates the conduct of clinical trials. Now it is essential to carry out Phase I clinical trials for the drugs discovered in India but Phase I trials are not allowed for the drugs discovered outside India. Similarly, for registration and approval of new drugs, which have already been registered and used in the country of origin, Phase III trials in about 100 patients is usually insisted upon by DCGI before allowing such products to be marketed in India. From 2007, it is essential to register clinical trials with ICMR in India.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741134312459187">3</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741134312459187"><title>Good manufacturing practices</title>
<p>The objective of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) is to minimize risks with reference to the manufacturing, packaging, testing, labeling, distributing and importing of drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, blood and blood products. The requirements for GMP have been specified under the upgraded Schedule âMâ for pharmaceutical units in India.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741134312459187">4</xref></sup> These revised protocols include detailed specifications on infrastructure and premises, environmental safety and health measures, production and operation controls, quality control, quality assurance, stability and validation studies. Although implementation of such higher standards of GMP by domestic Indian pharma industry is still a way off.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312459187">5</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741134312459187"><title>Pharmacovigilance</title>
<p>In India, a pharmaceutical company holding the marketing license should ensure that they have adequate pharmacovigilance system in place to ensure the responsibility and liability of their marketed products, as specified in Schedule Y. In the amended Schedule Y, an attempt has been made to better define the responsibilities of pharmaceutical companies for their marketed products as well as relating to the reporting of adverse events from clinical trials. The section entitled post-marketing surveillance includes the requirement for submission of Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs), PSUR cycle, template for PSUR, and the timelines and conditions for expedited reporting. Indian system of post marketing studies and pharmacovigilance is still under development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741134312459187">6</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741134312459187"><title>Biological products</title>
<p>The Ministry of Environment and Forests under the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986 have notified the rules for the manufacture, use, import, export and storage of hazardous microorganisms or genetically engineered organisms or cells. The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBSC) functions as the nodal point for interaction within the institution for the implementation of the rDNA Biosafety guidelines. The Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM) essentially monitors the safety related aspects of activities involving genetically engineering organisms or hazardous microorganisms. The Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) undertakes the responsibility of approval of activities involving large-scale use of genetically modified/hazardous microorganisms and products thereof in research and industrial production and their safety in terms of environmental protection. In addition, the Drug Controller General, India (DCGI) and State Drug Controllers as per the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules, 1945 and its subsequent amendments regulate the biological products.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312459187">5</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1741134312459187"><title>Drug price control</title>
<p>The prices of pharmaceuticals are highly regulated by the government through the Drug Price Control Order (DPCO), 1995. The provisions of the DPCO are implemented by a constituted body called National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA). Drugs that are under price control are also referred to as Scheduled Drugs. According to the NPPA, margins are fixed only for scheduled medicines; the wholesale margin is 8% and the retail margin is 16%. For drugs not under price control, firms are free to set the maximum retail price (MRP). The NPPA will intervene if drugs have significant sales and where the annual price increases by more than 10%. This level was changed in April 1, 2007. In the past, the NPPA would intervene if the annual price increases were more than 20%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741134312459187">7</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1741134312459187"><title>Medical devices</title>
<p>The authority regulating the medical devices in India is CDSCO under the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare. Guidelines for Import and Manufacture of Medical Devices were laid down by CDSCO in 2005 to regulate the medical devices in India. The Medical Devices Division under the CDSCO drafted a guidance document on Common Submission Format for Registration of Medical Devices in India and Requirements for conducting Clinical Trial(s) in India on August 4, 2010. Medical devices currently are not organized into different classes in India as they are in other major markets. Registration typically takes from 6 to 9 months to complete, and is valid for 3 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741134312459187">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741134312459187">9</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1741134312459187"><title>New drug</title>
<p>Indiaâs new drug definition is almost same as in other developed countries, but there is a 4 years stipulation period over the new drugs according to which a new drug would be considered as new for a period of 4 years from the date of its first approval or its inclusion in the Indian Pharmacopoeia. After 4 years that drug can be manufactured after obtaining necessary license from state drug regulators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741134312459187">10</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1741134312459187"><title>Drug registration laws</title>
<p>Schedule Y of the Drugs and Cosmetic Act governs the registration of new drug in India. The rules regulating the registration of drugs includes following; 122A (Application to import a new drug), 122B (Application to manufacture a new drug), 122D (Import and manufacture FDCs), 122DA (Application to conduct clinical trials).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741134312459187">3</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1741134312459187"><title>Drug approval process</title>
<p>Application for the importation and manufacture of new drugs or to undertake clinical trial is made on Form 44 to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) together with â¹50,000. Data to be submitted has been specified in Schedule Y. Local clinical trial may be waived by the licensing authority in the interest of the public good, in which case data from preclinical studies are to be evaluated. The approval for import permission is given on Form 45 or 45A, clinical trial on Form 46 and/or 46A, and new bulk drug substance on Form 54a. CDSCO has recently published guidelines on Organization of the Common Technical Document (CTD) for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use in November 2010 to reduce the regulatory hurdles in the drug registration process in India. Drug approval process has become less bureaucratic in India after the Investigational New Drug (IND) Application classification in 2006.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741134312459187">11</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1741134312459187"><title>Patent on pharmaceuticals</title>
<p>The Indian Patent Act, 1970 provided only process patent to the pharmaceuticals. It was the effect of this patent act which allowed the Indian generic industry to flourish. But when India signed the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement in 1994 it became mandatory for India to provide product patents for pharmaceuticals. In 2005 the Patents Act, 1970 was amended which provided patent protection for pharmaceutical products or drugs. India provides product patent for the pharmaceuticals for a period of 20 years. So, patent law has considerably improved in India.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741134312459187">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Controller General of India passed an order of compulsory license (CL) against Bayerâs patent on drug Nexavar on March 9, 2012, which is Indiaâs first compulsory license and is resulting from Indiaâs first CL application filed by Natco Pharma. The CL was granted in accordance with the grounds described under section 84 of the Indian Patent Act. The grant permits Nacto Pharma to manufacture and market a generic version of Nexavar for â¹8800 for 120 tablets per month treatment (against â¹284,428 per month by Bayer) in return for paying 6% royalty on sales to Bayer. The order also makes it obligatory for Natco to supply the drug free of cost to at least 600 needy patients per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741134312459187">13</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1741134312459187"><title>Data protection on pharmaceuticals</title>
<p>Data protection is the protection of clinical and nonclinical data so that the generic applicants cannot use it for the marketing authorization. The United States and European Union grants data exclusivity for 5 years (for NCE) and 11 years (8â+â2â+â1 rule), respectively. Until now, there is no data exclusivity provision in Indiaâs drug laws.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741134312459187">14</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1741134312459187"><title>Patent linkage</title>
<p>Patent linkage is the practice of linking drug marketing approval to the patent status of the originatorâs product and not allowing the grant of marketing approval to any third party prior to the expiration of the patent term, unless consent is given by the patent owner. Although some countries, such as China and the US, make specific legislative provision for patent linkage no such specific provisions exist in Indian legislation as established by the Supreme Court (SC) judgment in the case of Bayer Corporation and Others v Cipla, Union of India (UOI) and others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741134312459187">15</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec17-1741134312459187"><title>Regulatory trends of Chinese pharmaceutical market</title>
<sec id="sec18-1741134312459187"><title>Drug regulatory framework</title>
<p>The State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) is the centralized drug regulatory authority in China just same as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in USA. It directly works under the Ministry of Health of State Council of People Republic of China. SFDA is responsible for supervising regulations related to food, drugs, medical devices and cosmetics in the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. SFDA is almost centralized authority in its functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741134312459187">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741134312459187">17</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-1741134312459187"><title>Drug regulatory laws</title>
<p>The Drug Administration Law of China was first approved in 1984 and subsequently amended in 2001. This law is mainly responsible for regulating manufacturing, quality control, advertising, packaging, labeling, price control, distribution of pharmaceuticals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741134312459187">15</xref></sup> The central government further released detailed Regulations for Implementation of the Drug Administration Law in August 2002 to enforce the Law. The 2002 drug regulations and legislation are detailed and prescribe comprehensive guidelines and statutes for the production, sale and dispensation of pharmaceutical drugs. In 2007 the measures were promulgated to regulate the drug registration procedure known as Provisions on Administration of Drug Registration. These regulations changed the scope of new drugs, created the regulatory approval procedure of generic drugs, enhanced the transparency, and decreased timelines for drug approval. All these changes are responsible for tremendous growth of China pharmaceutical market.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741134312459187">18</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1741134312459187"><title>Clinical trials</title>
<p>According to Drug Administration Law, 2001 of China and its Implementation Regulations, 2002, clinical trials must be carried out as a precondition to obtaining registration for new medicinal products. All clinical trials must be approved by the SFDA before commencement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741134312459187">19</xref></sup> GCP Guidelines were first time introduced in 1998 and amended in 2003 to regulate clinical research. According to Provisions for Drug Registration made in 2007, any drug clinical trial, including bioequivalence study, should be approved by SFDA and shall be in compliance with the GCP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741134312459187">20</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-1741134312459187"><title>Pharmacovigilance</title>
<p>Chinaâs National Center for Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Monitoring was established in 1989. In 1998, China officially joined the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring. In November 1999, SFDA issued âRegulations on Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting and Monitoringâ, which was revised and finalized in March 2004. China has a three-level adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting and monitoring network. A nationwide electronic and on-line instant ADR reporting information network has also been constructed for the effective implementation of pharmacovigilance rules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741134312459187">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741134312459187">22</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-1741134312459187"><title>GMP</title>
<p>The GMP standards currently applicable in China are the 2010 revised version promulgated by the SDA in January 2011. This version of the GMP has been in effect since March 1, 2011. For GMP certification process, the Administrative Measures for Certification of the GMP issued by the SFDA in September 7, 2005 is applicable. The certificate is valid for 5 years and upon successful review upon expiry, the GMP certificate becomes valid for a term of another 5 years. Six months prior to the expiry dates of GMP certificates, manufacturers are required to apply for renewal of GMP certificates and become subject to the reassessment process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741134312459187">23</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-1741134312459187"><title>Drug price control</title>
<p>In China before 2000, drug prices were set by local pricing authorities. Afterward, the power of price setting was moved upward to the national planning committee, now called the State Development and Reform Commission (SDRC). In recent years, the Chinese government implemented a series of regulations and legislations to control drug prices, such as pharmaceutical law, decree of drug price administration, government pricing methods for drugs, etc. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) implements âMeasures on Government Pricing of Pharmaceuticalsâ whereas the SDRC works under the Regulations for the Implementation of Drug Administration Law of PRC. For pharmaceuticals protected by patents, prices are controlled by the SDRC. For pharmaceuticals covered by administrative protection during the period of data exclusivity, prices are controlled by the SFDA. The prices of drugs in China are thus regulated by a string of regulations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741134312459187">18</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec24-1741134312459187"><title>Medical devices</title>
<p>The Department of Medical Devices, under SFDA, is responsible for product registration, standardization, safety management and supervision of medical devices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741134312459187">24</xref></sup> The medical device regulatory system in China includes regulations (issued by the State Council), SFDA Orders, and SFDA Documents. Similar to the United States, SFDA classifies medical devices into three categories based on different risk levels. China promulgated the Regulations for the Supervision and Administration of Medical Devices in 2000, and primarily established an administrative system focusing on pre-marketing product examination and approval, and post-marketing surveillance and vigilance, as well as the supervision of manufacturers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741134312459187">9</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec25-1741134312459187"><title>New drug</title>
<p>There are five categories of new drugs in China. Drug never marketed anywhere; with changed dosage form never marketed anywhere, drug marketed ex-China with changed dosage form, changed route, combinations would be considered as new drug in China.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741134312459187">25</xref></sup></p>

<p>The Drug Administration Law, 2001 aims to strengthen drug regulation, to ensure drug quality and safety for human beings, and to protect the health of people and their legitimate rights and interests in the use of drugs. Under the 2001 Drug Administration Law and its Implementation Regulations, 2002, licensing authority is vested in the State Food and Drug Administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741134312459187">1</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec27-1741134312459187"><title>Drug approval process</title>
<p>Two regulatory processes exist: one for imported products and the other for locally manufactured products. For imported drugs, the registration package includes the following: Application form, technical data, CMC, nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology, PK/PE, local clinical data, labeling, samples from three different batches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741134312459187">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The registration of Western drugs follows these steps: An application on the prescribed form is submitted to the Department of Drug Registration (DDR) of the SFDA; The DDR evaluates the completeness of the document and then forwards it to the Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) for technical review; External experts may be consulted, and the CDE compiles a technical report for the DDR; The National Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical &amp; Biological Products (NICPBP) performs tests on the drug samples submitted. Based on the test results and the report from the CDE, the DDR approves the conduct of clinical trials at designated hospitals in China; At the conclusion of clinical trials, the results are evaluated by the CDE, which submits a report to the DDR; Based on the report, the DDR makes a final recommendation to the Director of the SFDA for approval to import the drug into China.

<p>Chinaâs Patent Law was first established in 1985, since then China has modified the patent law four times. The first Amendment was enacted in 1992, which recognized the pharmaceutical compositions as the patentable subject matter. The Second Amendment, enacted in 2000, reconciled the modified patent law with the TRIPS Agreement, which paved the way for entering into the World Trade Organization (WTO). The Third Amendment, which came into effect on October 1, 2009, aims to bring many aspects of Chinaâs patent law into further compliance with international standards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741134312459187">26</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec59-1741134312459187"><title>India</title>
<p>
<list id="list6-1741134312459187" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>India does not have a comprehensive system of regulations or a centralized form of authority and enforcement. Pharmaceutical and regulatory powers are divided between a variety of actors within central and state government. There is overlap between different enforcement and regulatory functions. Indian drug regulatory system lacks independence, being under-staffed and insufficiently rigorous. This lack of clarity hinders the effective running of the regulatory system.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Comprehensive safety and quality regulations are not in place nor it is clear which line of government is charged with enforcement and implementing the existing regulations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Dual licensing mechanism acts as a barrier in uniform implementation of regulatory procedures.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Lack of transparency in the licensing procedures.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Inadequate regulatory expertise and testing facilities to implement uniform standards.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The drug approval times have considerably shortened, with some innovative products being introduced in a relatively short period after mature market launch.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>As regulation of manufacture and sale of medicines is divided between central and state governments so GMP standards vary both in quality and enforcement from state to state. The high rate of substandard medicines suggests high GMP standards are not followed in all parts of India.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Indian system of post marketing studies and pharmacovigilance is still under development.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Indiaâs IP laws leave a lot to be desired, but have improved dramatically since the country signed the WTOâs Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. But the patenting of pharmaceuticals and the conditions under which firms can apply for compulsory licenses to prevent legal battles between local firms and MNCs is still not clear.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Inadequate intellectual property protection in terms of lack of data protection, lack of patent linkage, narrow patentability standards and poor enforcement of patents by courts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Over the Counter Drug (OTC) legislation has not been described in Drugs &amp; Cosmetic Act, 1940 and Rules, 1945. The separation of the prescription and OTC medicines remains problematic, given the large volume of prescription drugs available over the counter as well as the presence of counterfeit drugs. The development of the healthcare system should improve the situation with the respective sectors gradually becoming more clearly defined.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Generic drugs will continue to account for the vast majority of drug consumption in India (at around 75% of total spending), largely owing to the low cost and limited purchasing power of most of the population. In recent years, India has begun to export large amounts of generic drugs to the international market, which has proved highly lucrative.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is no legal definition of generic drugs and no separate ANDA (Abbreviated New Drug Application) for approval of generic drugs in India like US FDA.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>However, there is a clause regarding serious disease in Schedule-Y, but there is no fool proof description like US FDA having Orphan Drug Legislation for serious diseases.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The terms accelerated approval; fast track; priority review are not described in the Drugs and Cosmetic Act, 1940 and Rules, 1945.</p></list-item>

<p>
<list id="list7-1741134312459187" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>In China there is a comprehensive regulatory system in place in form of SFDA and various local FDAs. Chinese institutions in charge of regulating the pharmaceutical industry are numerous, but their respective spheres of influence are not always well defined.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>According to the Drug Administration Law of the Peoplesâ Republic of China, a new drug to be sold in to market must be approved for clinical trials (Phases I, II and III) and must receive a New Drug Certificate, a New Drug Registration Certificate, as well as a Drug Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Certificate. Expert panels review each stage; make recommendations to the SFDA, which then grant approvals. However, in practice, many stages are not respected, are sometimes quickly gone over, or worse, are just ignored.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The Chinese pharmaceutical industry has grown too fast. The institutional capacity of the SFDA and its subsidiaries remains limited and the legal system is too weak and insufficiently legitimated to define jurisdictional boundaries in any coherent and consistent fashion.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There are sheer number of small manufacturing companies in China which complicates the monitoring process. There are simply not enough SFDA personnel to ensure proper monitoring of every production facility. Thus China has a widespread problem of counterfeited and substandard drugs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The complexity of drug supply chains undercuts the transparency and traceability of pharmaceutical products. Since the late 1980s, significant efforts were made to streamline drug supply chains, but the overall process remains complex. The longer supply chain makes it difficult for regulatory agencies to ensure the final quality of the pharmaceutical products involved.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Corruption is wide spread. National standards are high, but enforcement is left to local officials. These officials often have to operate under financial constraints. Therefore, local regulatory agencies are more focused on revenue-generation than drug safety.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>System of pharmacovigilance is in place (major changes in 2002 and 2004), although reporting is still believed to be lacking and there is some doubt over the accuracy over official figures on the number of ADRs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Although China has officially adopted an âindependent regulatory commissionâ system, the SFDAâs independence from the central government is not well established. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether Chinese courts can play an independent adjudicatory role.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Chinaâs drug approval process has considerably simplified after the amendments made in 2007 known as Provisions on Drug Registration. These regulations have considerably shortened the drug approval timelines.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Chinaâs drug registration requirements are still not clear for the investigational new drug application (IND dossier) and new drug application (NDA dossier).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Drug pricing mechanism in China is still an issue.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Intellectual property rights are considerably strong in case of China. China has been granting product patent on pharmaceuticals since 1992 for 20 years. Data exclusivity period is 6 years. There is a system of patent linkage in Chinese drug laws.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>China implemented new Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) in 2010 which will considerably improve the quality of drugs produced in China.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>China has a well-defined accelerated drug approval procedure for the drugs used in treatment of serious diseases.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>China has a well-classified system of prescription and OTC drugs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>China has a well-defined procedure for the approval of generic drugs.</p></list-item>

<p>
<list id="list8-1741134312459187" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Roszdravnadzor is the main drug regulatory authority in Russia. This authority is not fully independent in its functions and regulatory powers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The new regulatory system has significant improvements over the old registration system in which registration procedures took years and regulators had no liability for delays due to their own fault. The draft law introduces timeframes within which each and every regulatory step is to be completed. Overall, the registration process for new drugs is supposed to take no more than 210 days.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Foreign manufacturers are to be required to conduct clinical trials of new drugs in Russia prior to their registration. A clinical trial conducted on an international basis shall be acceptable, if it was conducted with the participation of Russian patients. It is too early to conclude that these changes will benefit foreign manufacturers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The cost of drug approval in Russia is costly and time consuming.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Russia has a well-established regulatory classification system of drug products in to OTC and prescription drugs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Another gaping hole in the new legislation concerns orphan drugs, pharmaceutical products used in the treatment of rare diseases. These drugs are extremely expensive in Russia, and since the new law makes no mention of orphan drugs, the close to 5 million Russians afflicted with a rare disease are unlikely to be able to receive treatment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Under the new legislation, clinical trials conducted in Russia will now be obligated to use principal investigators with a medical specialization related to the clinical area of the trial, and at least 5 years of clinical trial experience, which is a good move to regulate the quality of clinical trials conducted in Russia.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The new law takes into account measures regulating the registration of generic drugs in Russia, for instance by permitting their registration based upon bioequivalence studies, which will considerably regulate the entry of counterfeited and substandard drugs in Russian pharmaceutical market.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>While the Certificate of Registration for newly registered pharmaceuticals will continue to be of indefinite duration, the new law now requires that state registration be confirmed 5 years after the initial date of registration.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Other new provisions under new law are rules governing pharmaceutical sales by wholesalers directly to healthcare institutions, new pharmacovigilance rules, labeling rules, rules regulating the state pharmacopoeia, and other timely and important matters related to the pharmaceutical industry in Russia.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Another measure in the new law addresses Phase I clinical trials: such trials, which test the safety of the drug in healthy volunteers, cannot be conducted in Russia if the pharmaceutical was manufactured abroad. This remains a cause of concern for the foreign drug manufacturers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>This new law also proposes new safety measures with the implementation of multiple standards to identify sub-quality and imitation pharmaceuticals. With the goal of making production of high-quality pharmaceuticals possible, mandatory GMP standards will be established in Russian factories. These new GMP standards will take some years to be effective in actual practice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>On January 1, 2010, the Roszdravnadzor started to register the maximum ex-factory price for EDL-listed drugs. So new drug pricing mechanism can cut down the cost of drugs in Russia.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Russia has a well-established pharmacovigilance procedure in place with regional monitoring centers that highlight adverse drug reactions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Russia recently enacted a data exclusivity period of 6 years for which will surely be attractive for MNCs to establish R&amp;D centers in Russia.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>IP regime of Russia is good amongst the developing markets.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>So, from the above points it is clear that significant inefficiencies could be addressed by new legislation, although level of implementation is as yet uncertain.</p>

<p>
<list id="list9-1741134312459187" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Regulatory system is moving towards high international standards with closer regulation of similar medicines and the use of bioequivalence testing for all nonreferenced drugs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Overall safety and quality standards are good, although there are still concerns over the lack of bioequivalence testing for âsimilarâ drugs registered prior to 2003.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is a separate generic drug approval process according to which bioequivalence and bioavailability testing requirements are mandatory.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Regulations and technical standards enforced by the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) keep the industry under pressure to adjust their plants in Brazil to the state of the art and thus to improve its competitiveness.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Drug regulatory laws are strong and well defined in Brazil.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Growing demand for generics offered another growth opportunity for domestic laboratories over the past decade. They came to dominate this market segment and are expanding and modernizing production capacities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is well-defined fast track and orphan drug approval process in Brazil (RDC 16/2008).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The drug approval process in Brazil is costly and time consuming.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Government of Brazil has a strict control over the drug prices.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Patent regime related to pharmaceuticals is satisfactory (Provides product patent for 20 years).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Data protection period is not specified.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There are also real concerns over ANVISAâs pharmacovigilance program and its capacity to effectively monitor a pharmaceutical market with the size and growing demand of Brazil.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In Brazil, there are GMP codes in place but there is concern over implementation and resources allocated for inspection and enforcement. Brazilian follow-through and inspection rates when it comes to GMP and compliance issues are lacking.</p></list-item>

<sec id="sec63-1741134312459187"><title>Recommendations of the study</title>
<sec id="sec64-1741134312459187"><title>India</title>
<p>Drug regulations should be streamlined and a clear regulatory framework and source of authority should be established. Regulations related to GMP should be well enforced. There should be well-implemented system of pharmacovigilance to assess the adverse effects of drugs. Issues related to patenting of pharmaceuticals, data protection, and compulsory licensing should be made clear. Licensing of pharmaceuticals should be in hand of one central authority. The use of Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) for new drug approval should be started so as to combat with the changing world.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec65-1741134312459187"><title>China</title>
<p>In short, China now has a well-implemented system of drug regulations and a centralized drug regulatory system in form of SFDA. China IP regime is also the best amongst the emerging markets. But, the large number of manufacturing companies, the complexity of supply chains, corruption and lack of transparency all weakens Chinaâs drug regulatory system.</p>
<p>Thus, China must do better at implementing its existing regulatory framework. While resources for the SFDA have been increased and there is improvement in national and international coordination, Chinese regulators and policymakers must make enforcement a greater priority. The dossier requirements for IND/NDA applications should be made clear. The problems related to counterfeited and substandard medicines should be minimized using well-enforced GMP system of regulations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec66-1741134312459187"><title>Russia</title>
<p>Russia should look to introduce greater transparency in pharmaceutical decision-making and tougher penalties for manufacturer and producers of substandard and counterfeited drugs. New legislation that imposes GMP standards on domestic companies should implement rigorously with tough penalties for those who do not comply. The law on drugs for serious diseases should be addressed and much strict rules must be applied to cut down the cost of these drugs. Russian drug approval process has considerably simplified according to new law on medicines but its effects are yet to be seen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec67-1741134312459187"><title>Brazil</title>
<p>Like China, Brazilâs enforcement mechanisms and authorities need to be strengthened. The substandard drugs may be in circulation because the pharmaceutical companies were not required to give the proof of bioequivalence for the registration of similar drugs prior to 2003. The extent to which such similar drugs that are exempt from bioequivalence tests are a major source of substandard drugs is difficult to quantify, but it is noteworthy that both the producers of generic drugs and research-based pharmaceutical companies agree that these similar drugs need to be tightly regulated. Legislation introduced in 2003 to effectively outlaw similars by 2015 is a step in the right direction, but the long time frame leaves many potentially dangerous drugs in circulation.</p>
<p>The drug approval process should be simplified and timelines should be shortened. The eCTD should be followed for the drug approval process. So it can be said that Brazil has established drug regulatory system over two decades, but the regulations should be well enforced.</p>
