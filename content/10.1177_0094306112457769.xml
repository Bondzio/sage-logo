<p><italic>The Spectacular State</italic> explores the production of national identity in post-Soviet Uzbekistan. The main protagonists are the cultural elites involved in the elaboration of new state-sponsored mass-spectacle national holidays: Navro’z (Zoroastrian New Year) and Independence Day. The overall argument is that despite their aspirations to reinvigorate national identity, mass spectacle creators in Uzbekistan have reproduced much of the Soviet cultural production.</p>
<p>National identity has been one of the most fraught questions in Central Asia, where nationality was a contradictory and complicated product of the Soviet rule. Although the category of nationality was initiated, produced, and imposed by the Soviet state in the 1920s, it eventually became a source of power and authority for local elites, including cultural producers. The collapse of the Soviet Union opened up possibilities for revising and reversing many understandings manufactured by the socialist regime. Yet, upon her arrival in Tashkent to conduct her research on the renegotiation of national identity in 1995, Laura Adams discovered that instead of embracing newly-found freedom to recover a more authentic history, most Uzbek intellectuals, especially cultural producers working with the state, avoided probing too far in this direction. Rather than entirely discarding the Soviet colonial legacies, they revised their history selectively. Whereas the ideological content of their cultural production shifted from socialism to nationalism, many of the previous cultural “forms” have remained. Similarly, the Uzbek government continued to employ cultural elites to implement the task of reinforcing its nation-building program, thus following the Soviet model of cultural production.</p>
<p>The book consists of four chapters. The first chapter delineates the broad themes of national identity building, and the remaining chapters explore mass spectacle creation by distinguishing between three elements: form (Chapter Two), content (Chapter Three), and the mode of production (Chapter Four). The study is based on content analysis of two Olympic Games-style national holidays, interviews with cultural producers, and participation observation of festivals and behind-the-scenes preparation meetings. Although Adams provides a few references to viewers and their attitude toward the public holiday performances, her book does not offer an extended engagement with reception and consumption of these holidays.</p>
<p>The comprehensive and multi-layered overview of the process of revising national identity in Uzbekistan is one of the book’s major accomplishments. For Adams, the production of national identity is not a self-evident and seamless production forced by the state but instead a dynamic, complex, and dialogical process of negotiation between various parties (intellectual factions, state officials, mass spectacle producers, etc.). Her account reveals the messy and often contradictory nature of national identity production and thus moves away from the tendency to reify the state and its policies.</p>
<p>The book makes a significant contribution to studies of nationalism by suggesting that the production of national identity in Uzbekistan was centrally constituted by the consideration of the “international audience.” Although public holidays, studied by Adams, aimed at fostering national identification, the forms in which these celebrations are performed (including national dances and music) indicate the aspiration of cultural producers to be part of the international community. This kind of national production self-consciously oriented toward the international viewer has been the legacy of the Soviet nationalities policy where all cultural producers had to produce art “socialist in content, national in form.” Notwithstanding the difference in generations or genres, cultural producers from national republics invariably regarded their art-making in terms of <italic>representing</italic> national identity to outsiders, and thus simultaneously created national subjects for international audiences. The book is thus a nuanced and detailed discussion of the continuing Soviet legacies in contemporary Uzbekistan. These strengths make this book to be a useful resource for scholars interested in studies of social reproduction.</p>
<p>The only limitation of the book is the analytical lens offered on cultural production. Adams sees these Olympic style mass spectacles as “kitsch,” and she is confounded by the continuing participation of cultural producers in the state’s nation-building project where there is hardly any creative freedom. The reason, Adams suggests, is the “seduction” by power. Yet, even though cultural producers may derive benefits from their engagement with the state, to see their involvement solely in terms of misrecognized self-interest runs the danger of being reductive and condescending. Tellingly, Adams herself acknowledges the challenge of pronouncing such a heavy verdict, as evidenced by a paragraph-long justification of her interpretation (p.183). Self-reflexively, she ponders her own Western liberal-democratic bias in affiliating cultural production with authenticity and truth. However, this self-awareness does not translate into the terms of her analysis on cultural producers. This shortcoming notwithstanding, Adams’ study is an important contribution to the field of Central Asian studies, nation-building, and cultural production.</p>
