<p>Those who know how to listen know that the audience in the upper tiers does not attend the opera to be seen. The intense engagement in the cheap seats is heard in the wild bravos, sustained applause, and angry boos that pour down from the top of the house. These fans not only conduct themselves differently from those in the orchestra or parterre boxes, they are also there far more often, attending multiple performances of the same opera each season and many performances during the season, season after season. Where I sit, near the top of the Metropolitan Opera, I often find myself in lively intermission conversations with people I do not know though, I confess, I am too intimidated to venture into the heated arguments, for example, about which long-dead diva truly owns the role (because the evening’s soprano almost certainly does not). Until I read Claudio Benzecry’s book, I considered myself something of a passionate fan. Now I realize I neither know enough nor give enough to make it in the top tiers of Buenos Aires’ Teatro Cólon among the truly devoted who are the subject of this compelling ethnography.</p>
<p>Benzecry is from a prominent Argentinean musical family, which afforded him access to members of the classical music elite (including Cólon administrators), though his last name initially made for some awkward moments in his research on the passionate fans. He conducted extended interviews and participant observation in the various informal institutions that are the settings in which fans engage in the affective and embodied practices of passionate attachment: in the standing room, in line waiting for the doors to open, on long bus trips to performances outside the city, and in the spaces and places that make up this particular world of opera, hearing the endless tirades and tributes to singers then and now.</p>
<p>The affective attachment that defines this particular kind of fan has not been considered by sociologists who focus largely on the structural aspects of cultural production and consumption. Academic assumptions about “high” and “low” culture reflect conventional ones. Apparently people go to the opera not because they love it but to enhance their status beyond the house. Sociologists do not regard attending the European classical arts as a matter of anything more than class and they study fandom, vulgar <italic>per se</italic>, as unique to low culture. Benzecry undermines these assumptions by drawing widely across fields and, in his empirical work, opening up a world of opera fans from a range of backgrounds who organize their lives through sustained personal investment and sacrifice that yields no conventional social payoff. It is a world in which the intensity of individual passion warrants—even demands—expression in the company of strangers.</p>
<p>The most engaging aspect of this study is the phenomenological approach to music not as “socially shaped” but as “music in action.” That is, opera is shaped “socially” but not simply by larger “forces.” It takes shape for these fans in the local orderliness of passionate practice that is inseparable from the time and money spent learning about and listening to opera outside of performances, frequent attendance (often at the expense of other activities and relationships), and long waits in all kinds of weather. Becoming a fan involves learning a situated repertoire of affective and embodied practices. A novice learns how to talk about what one hears while waiting for the doors to open, at intermission, on long bus rides. In the top sections of the house, one learns when and how to applaud or boo or shout; how to conduct oneself in the crowded standing room; how music is experienced in bodily gestures (sitting down in place, for example, to give oneself over). Passionate attachment presumes a Romantic idea of listening, Benzecry argues, in which performance is a sacred opportunity to achieve oneness with the music, the voice above all. He might well have remarked that Wagner’s ideal of “<italic>Gesamtkunstwerk</italic>” is akin to Durkheim’s Comtean vision of sociology as the science of all sciences, the highest form of art.</p>
<p>It is a “love-for” narrative that the fans use in their interviews and that Benzecry adopts to frame his observations and arguments about the relationship between being a passionate fan and experiences of self. While studies of fandom point to cultural identity, Benzecry shows that <italic>love-for</italic> something involves personal aspirations of self and transcendence. This is precisely what sociologists have ignored but what captures passionate attachment in practices of “freedom, regulation, and self-realization” and, in the promise of live performance, as with any love, the “paradoxical” achievement of autonomy through the “dissolution of self.”</p>
<p>One accomplishment of the book is that it is a phenomenological study that manages to incorporate the economic and political circumstances of Argentina and the Cólon. While the balance does tip occasionally and the background sections are unnecessarily detailed, they are a crucial dimension of the research as well as of the fans’ passionate attachment. Such fans can be found in opera houses around the world but being one at the Cólon involves not only the specific spatial arrangements of the house but also its history and place in Argentinean society. As with many houses from the nineteenth century and before, the Cólon (built in its current location in 1908) has entrances to the upper tiers and standing room that are separate from the public lobby, doors off the street that open onto a staircase. Different sections of the house have no direct contact with each other and this “architecture of fandom” reinforces the way passionate fans regard themselves as superior to the wealthy subscribers below, who attend not for love of opera but as a social obligation (the fans agree with the sociologists). There is an atavistic disdain for audiences at the top of the house even in presumably “democratic” houses like the new Metropolitan which opened without separate entrances in 1966. Though everyone enters through the lobby, standing room tickets still go on sale only the morning of a performance and, as at the Cólon, the people who line up and wait for the box office to open are tourists, students, and opera lovers.</p>
<p>As for all fans, passionate attachment is expressed in part through nostalgia, and Buenos Aires provides a unique setting for this study. Argentina long encouraged the European classical arts and, through the early twentieth century, Italian, German, and Jewish immigrants energized the country’s cultural life. The Cólon became a municipal enterprise as early as the 1930s. Now, the nostalgic character of fandom extends from the reverence for the truly great singers and productions of yesteryear to a longing for the Cólon’s golden age, after the Second World War or, depending on who is talking, the 1970s and 80s. One consequence of Argentina’s economic and political turmoil since the late 1990s is that one of the greatest houses on the international opera circuit can rarely afford to bring stars from abroad or maintain historically high production values. Benzecry shows how the fans’ nostalgia is not only about the Cólon but also about the country’s European orientation and “civilizing project” that the house has symbolized since the late nineteenth century. Nostalgia about the Cólon’s better days—when artistic vision was not compromised by fiscal constraint and political wrangling, and there was no need to rely on a roster of local singers—is inseparable from nostalgia about Argentina’s better days.</p>
<p>The opera fans’ penchant for the obsessive collecting of facts, memorabilia, and memories is a matter of love. Benzecry’s tendency to collect is less sensible. The book is burdened by footnotes and the modest number that serve the study could just as well be in the text. As for the rest, one large chunk offers excurses into definitional, theoretical, and textual matters. Another offers facts about singers, productions, and performance dates. The details about opera happen to interest this reader but are essentially irrelevant. Most serve only to correct the memories of his fan-subjects. Benzecry provides the basic knowledge of the form that readers require and, despite the voluminous notes, convinces us that the function of the past in opera-love does not depend on whether a performance remembered was actually a particular season one way or the other.</p>
<p>Benzecry’s collecting and cataloging do not detract from the book’s contribution and reveals a rare, encompassing intellectual sensibility. Other readers will appreciate what can be taken as a more European style of scholarship; social scientists and their students who study culture will find this particularly useful. The study’s success is twofold: it offers a textured phenomenological ethnography of opera-love that is informed by recent social and economic conditions in Buenos Aires and, as a study of cultural consumption <italic>as</italic> love—as a sociology of passionate attachment—<italic>The Opera Fanatic</italic> is a thoroughgoing and convincing critique of the limits of sociological approaches to culture.</p>
