<body>
<p>The prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) that may include agitation, psychosis, mood disorders, psychomotor agitation, and apathy among persons with dementia (PWD) have been found to increase demands of caregivers, increase stress, lead to burnout, and caregiver turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898010112461977">Zuidema, de Jonghe, Verhey, &amp; Koopmans, 2007</xref>). Traditionally, treatment of these behavioral and psychological symptoms included the use of pharmacological agents and physical restraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898010112461977">Robinson et al., 2007</xref>). These interventions, however, have been found to produce harmful side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898010112461977">Sink, Holden, &amp; Yaffe, 2005</xref>) and raise ethical concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898010112461977">Hughes, 2002</xref>). As aging populations continue to increase globally, the need for evidenced-based nonpharmacological approaches to treat NPS in PWD is warranted, as dementia commonly, but not always, occurs in late life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898010112461977">Goodal &amp; Etters, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Among PWD, the use of musical interventions has been studied to determine the effects it has on (a) agitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010112461977">Brotons &amp; Pickett-Cooper, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010112461977">Denney, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010112461977">Gerdner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112461977">Gerdner &amp; Swanson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898010112461977">Ragneskog, Asplund, Kihlgren, &amp; Norberg, 2001</xref>), (b) improving cooperation during bathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898010112461977">Thomas, Heitman, &amp; Alexander, 1997</xref>), (c) increasing interactions with family caregivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898010112461977">Riley-Doucet, 2009</xref>), and (d) improving appetites during mealtime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898010112461977">Ho et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898010112461977">Ragneskog, Kihlgren, Karlsson, &amp; Norberg, 1996</xref>). According to a recent review of the literature, positive outcomes have been reported when musical interventions are implemented for PWD; however, methodological issues regarding research designs, statistical analyses, and outcome measures were not clearly defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898010112461977">Tang &amp; Vezeau, 2010</xref>). The <italic>Cochrane Review</italic> of musical interventions for PWD also concluded that there was no substantial evidence either supporting or discouraging listening to music as an intervention within this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898010112461977">Vink, Birks, Bruinsma, &amp; Scholten, 2006</xref>). Therefore, further investigations into the use of musical interventions to decrease NPS in PWD are warranted.</p>
<p>This study specifically focused on the type of musical genre that would decrease NPS within a convenient sample of PWD attending an adult day care center. Selection of what type of musical style is essential, however, because it has been found to influence outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898010112461977">Gerdner, 2010</xref>). According to Gerdner, the selection of music should be based on personal preference to stimulate remote memories (2010). These remote memories then override the focus of stimuli in the environment that may be confusing to the PWD by eliciting memories associated with positive feelings, resulting in calming affects that may prevent or alleviate agitation. PWD may be unable to verbalize personal preferences and have no family members or close friends who can provide this information. Therefore, having knowledge of the most popular types of music specific to generational eras is vital.</p>
<p>In this study, music performed by Dean Martin, a very popular actor and artist whose career began in the 1950s, was chosen because his music was, and continues to be, frequently played on the radio, and he had a TV show that ran from 1964 to 1974 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898010112461977">Wikipedia, 2011</xref>). Hence, one assumption in this study was that older adults (65 years and older) living today were approximately 14 years old or older during that time period and grew up listening to Dean Martin’s music. The other type of musical genre that was chosen for this study was religious music. Religious music was operationalized to reflect Judeo-Christian hymns. Some examples of the songs included (a) <italic>Amazing Grace</italic>, (b) <italic>How Great Thou Art</italic>, (c) <italic>The Old Rugged Cross</italic>, and (d) <italic>When the Roll Is Called Up Yonder</italic>. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898010112461977">Newport (2007)</xref>, gallop polls conducted in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s found that more than 70% of adults reported that they frequently attended religious services. Therefore, a second assumption in this study was that if a Judeo-Christian religion was documented in the medical record, the PWD also grew up listening to religious music played during religious services. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare Dean Martin’s popular nonreligious music with religious music to determine if there were any differences in the behavioral responses of PWD while listening to these types of music within a multisensory environment (MSE).</p>
<sec id="section1-0898010112461977">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>Although musical interventions have been found to decrease NPS in PWD, the mechanisms as to why it produces positive outcomes is still essentially unknown. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010112461977">Cuddy and Duffin (2005)</xref> theoretically hypothesized that musical memory may be a cognitive skill that is spared from Alzheimer’s disease. These authors reported that musical memory is a complex skill that integrates pitch, rhythm, timbre, dynamic, linguistic, visual, kinesthetic, and emotional components that activate the cortex through many brain substrates creating numerous neuronal networks. As a result, these subcortical structures may be spared unlike cortical tissue, and/or weakened components may be supported or reinforced through a coactivation process. Using concepts and relational statements from these theorists, assumptions were made regarding the music the researchers thought would activate a musical memory in the participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0898010112461977">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>A recent review of the literature was done to capture the most current evidence regarding musical interventions used to reduce NPS in PWD. A quasi-experimental study was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898010112461977">Sung, Chang, and Lee (2010)</xref> using a pretest/posttest design in a long-term care facility in Taiwan. The study included 29 participants in the experimental group and 23 in the experimental group. Participants in the control group listened to their preferred music via CD players for 30 minutes in midafternoon twice a week for a total of 12 sessions over 6 weeks. The researchers found a statistically significant decrease in anxiety scores posttest among participants who listened to preferred music for 6 weeks than those who received the usual standard of care without the musical intervention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010112461977">Park and Pringle-Specht (2009)</xref> examined the effects of individualized music on agitation among 15 community-dwelling PWD prior to peak agitation times identified by caregivers. Participants listened to preferred music for 30 minutes two times per week on a CD player, followed by no music for 2 weeks. Mean agitation levels were found to be significantly lower while participants listened to the music and after intervention; however, no significant differences were found in agitation levels postintervention.</p>
<p>An experimental study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898010112461977">Lin et al. (2011)</xref> was done to determine if a group musical intervention would decrease agitated behaviors among a sample of older adults with dementia. A total of 100 participants were recruited: 49 in the experimental group and 51 in the control group. The experimental group received twelve 30-minute group music intervention sessions twice a week for 6 consecutive weeks, whereas the control group participated in everyday activities. The researchers found reductions in agitated behaviors beginning as early as the 6th session, at the end of the 12th session, and 1 month postintervention. Contrary to these findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898010112461977">Nair et al. (2010)</xref> found an increase in behavioral disturbances among a sample of 75 older adults residing in a dementia-specific, aged care facility when baroque music was played on a CD player in the common area. In addition, nursing staff reported that a few residents had asked them to turn the music off. The authors noted that these findings may have been related to the volume and speed of the baroque music and the fact that it was recorded music (not live), not individualized, and not tailored to target the desired behavioral outcome.</p>
<p>Randomized control trials were also conducted to assess the efficacy of musical interventions in PWD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898010112461977">Raglio et al. (2010)</xref> studied 60 PWD: 30 in the experimental group and 30 in the control group. All participants received standard care while the experimental group received 1 month of music therapy, followed by 1 month of no treatment for three consecutive cycles. Each treatment session had a group of three participants and lasted 30 minutes. These authors reported that delusions, agitation, and apathy significantly decreased in the experimental group, whereas depression, anxiety, and irritability decreased significantly in both groups. Post hoc testing revealed that the main improvements in behavior among the experimental group were at the end of the month of each treatment cycle. Conversely, a randomized control trial that investigated the effect of a live music program using 30-minute musician-led familiar song-singing sessions and 10 minute sessions of prerecorded instrumental music for active listening failed to find a significant reduction in agitation and anxiety when compared with reading sessions chosen as the control activity. In addition, these authors further reported finding a significant increase in verbal aggression over time, regardless of group. The major predictor of higher levels of agitation in this sample was found to be significantly related to higher levels of cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898010112461977">Cooke, Moyle, Shum, Harrison, &amp; Murfield, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Current systematic reviews of the research literature were also done. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898010112461977">Hulme, Wright, Crocker, Oluboyede, and House (2010)</xref> reviewed 10 articles exploring the possible beneficial effects of music and music therapy on symptoms of dementia. Evidence in this review indicated that music and music therapy was found to reduce behavioral and psychological symptoms, including agitation, aggression, wandering, restlessness, irritability, and social and emotional difficulties, and also improved nutritional intake. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898010112461977">Tang and Vezeau (2010)</xref> reviewed 33 studies and found that the most common population that used music as an intervention was the PWD population. The most common type of music intervention used was passive/receptive (participants are in a resting position listening to music). These authors concluded, however, that although positive outcomes were reported using musical interventions with PWD, serious problems with intervention designs, lack of clear reporting, and reliability of outcome measures decreased their ability to accurately assess the effectiveness of musical interventions with PWD.</p>
<p>A very limited number of published research studies on the use of religious music as an intervention to decrease agitation among PWD was found. Most of the current articles were theoretical in nature, emphasizing the use of religious music as a form of art therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898010112461977">Béphage, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898010112461977">MacKinlay &amp; Trevitt, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898010112461977">Bursell and Mayers (2010)</xref> interviewed 11 health professionals to identify how patients’ spiritual needs can be met within dementia care. Six health professionals reported providing multisensory activities, including listening to spiritual music as an intervention. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898010112461977">Aswad (2011)</xref> published a case study highlighting how spiritual music was used to decrease aggressive and agitated behaviors in a patient with dementia. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898010112461977">Jennings and Vance (2002)</xref> explored the use of a variety of music, including religious, in a sample of 16 older adults diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Participants were given a 30-minute music class once a week for 4 weeks. These authors found a significant reduction in agitated behaviors for a brief time (45 minutes to 1 hour) postintervention.</p>
<p>Musical interventions, as a complement to traditional interventions, have been used in a wide array of symptoms and illnesses, including schizophrenia, pain, depression, and dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898010112461977">Tang &amp; Vezeau, 2010</xref>). Problems with small sample sizes, research designs, and incomplete reporting of measurement tools, however, have decreased the reliability and generalizability of these findings. Thus, there is a need for more empirical evidence to determine if the use of musical interventions to decrease NPS in PWD is warranted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0898010112461977" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to compare nonreligious music with religious music to determine if there were any differences in the behavioral responses of PWD during and after listening to these types of music within an MSE. This study was part of a larger research project examining the use of MSE within an adult day care center. A within-subjects, repeated-measures design was used since all participants were exposed to both musical genres during multiple MSE sessions over a 4-week period.</p>
<p>A convenience sample of older adults attending an adult day care center in the Midwest was recruited for this study. Inclusion criteria were that the participants had to be 65 years of age or older, had grown up within the Western culture, spoke English, had a documented religion in the medical record, had a physician-made <italic>DSM-IV</italic> (<italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, fourth edition) diagnosis of dementia, and had a history of NPS while attending the adult day care center. A Short Portable Mini Mental Status Exam was done on each participant to validate the level of dementia. Participants were excluded if they did not attend the day care center for at least 2 days a week.</p>
<sec id="section4-0898010112461977">
<title>Instrumentation</title>
<p>A demographic data collection tool was developed for this study that included the age, gender, marital status, race/ethnicity, education level, religion, and medical diagnosis. Demographic information was obtained from the medical records of the participants. The Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) was used to assess the level of intellectual function of the participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010112461977">Pfeiffer, 1975</xref>). The SPMSQ consists of 10 questions that must be answered correctly by the participant. The following are some examples of questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0898010112461977" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What is the date today?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Who is the president of the United States?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Subtract 3 from 20 and keep subtracting 3 from each new number, all the way down.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The level of intellectual function is assessed by totaling up the number of errors or incorrect responses (0-2 errors = intact intellectual function, 3-4 errors = mild intellectual dysfunction, 5-7 errors = moderate intellectual dysfunction, and 8-10 errors = severe intellectual dysfunction). The SPMSQ scores were found to have between 82% and 92% agreement when compared with diagnoses of cognitive impairment or organic brain syndrome in two validity studies. The SPMSQ was also found to be a reliable instrument yielding test–retest correlations of .82 and .83, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898010112461977">Pfeiffer, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>The Agitated Behavior Scale (ABS) was chosen to assess the NPS exhibited by the participants before and after the musical intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010112461977">Corrigan, 1989</xref>). The ABS has 14 observable NPS behaviors that are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale from 1 = <italic>absent</italic> to 4 = <italic>present to an extreme degree</italic>. Some examples of the NBS included short attention span, impulsivity, violent behavior, explosive anger, moaning, wandering, and excessive talking. The ratings are summed to compute a total score that can range from 14 to 56; higher numbers reflecting higher degrees of agitation. Cronbach alphas of the ABS were found to be greater than .80 in a sample of 35 patients with head injuries. Raters in the study included two registered nurses, an occupational therapist, and a physical therapist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898010112461977">Corrigan, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>An observation record was also developed by these authors. The length of time the participants spent listening to music and 10 observable behaviors while the participant listened to music were included on this form. The 10 observable behaviors were singing, humming, foot tapping, rhythmic movements, listening, shutting eyes, dancing, clapping, hand tapping and finger snapping.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0898010112461977">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Institutional review board and site approval from the manager of one Midwest adult day care center was obtained prior to the implementation of this study. Researchers met with the manager to provide information regarding the purpose and implementation of the study and to view the multisensory equipment that would be set up in a private room. Recruitment of participants was through referrals made by the adult day care manager. An information sheet explaining the study was given to eligible participant family members by the manager, and informed consent/assent was obtained from the responsible parties of the PWD unable to give legal consent. Demographic data were then obtained from the participant’s medical record, and the SPMSQ was carried out by the researchers on the participants to ensure eligibility.</p>
<p>Caregivers aged 18 years or older who were working in the adult day care center were then asked to attend an information session that was conducted by the principal investigators to explain the study and how MSEs work. At the information session, those caregivers indicating a willingness to participate in the study were asked to sign an informed consent. A date and time was then set for caregivers to attend a training session on how to fill out the ABS and record their observations on the observation record. At this session, caregivers were also instructed on how to use the MSE equipment and manage the two different musical genres that PWD listened to while in the MSE.</p>
<p>Once all the participating caregivers were trained, the MSE equipment was set up in a private corner and left in the adult day care center for 4 weeks. A comfortable chair for the participants to sit on was placed within the MSE. Music was played via a CD player. During the 4 weeks, caregivers were asked to accompany only the participants with written consent/assent into the MSE room when they began to exhibit NPS. For the first 2 weeks, the caregivers played the nonreligious Dean Martin music followed by 2 weeks of the religious music. Formal caregivers filled out the ABS before and after these sessions and filled out the observation record. At the end of the fourth week, the principal investigators collected the observation records and took down the MSE equipment.</p>
<p>To ensure consistency across sessions, and to be available for the caregivers to ask questions regarding equipment and the observation forms, these researchers and two trained nursing graduate research assistants attended the adult day care center for at least 2 days per week. On those days, agreement between two raters regarding exhibited behaviors by the participants prior to, during, and after the sessions was obtained to ensure reliability of data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0898010112461977">
<title>Data Analyses</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics including frequencies and means were computed on the demographic data, the ABS, and observational record. An independent <italic>t</italic> test was used to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between the total mean scores on the ABS before and after listening to nonreligious and religious music. An index of the number of responses each participant performed while listening to nonreligious music and while listening to the religious music was computed by summing up the 10 possible observable behaviors (singing, humming, foot tapping, rhythmic movements, listening, shutting eyes, dancing, clapping, hand tapping, and finger snapping). An independent <italic>t</italic> test was used to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between the mean score of the nonreligious response index and the mean score of the religious music response index. Data were analyzed using SPSS Base 11 software, and the level of significance was preset at .05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section8-0898010112461977">
<title>Sample Characteristics</title>
<p>Written consent/assent was obtained from eight family members. Only five out of the eight, however, met the inclusion criteria for this study because either no religion was documented in the medical record or “nondenominational” was recorded. On average, the participants were approximately 83 years of age (range = 77-88). Two were male and three were female. Three were married and two were widowed. Four were Caucasian and one was African American. Four participants had less than a high school education and one had graduated high school. Three were Catholic and two were Protestant. On average, the participants had approximately 10 errors on the SPMSQ (range = 9-11), indicating severe intellectual dysfunction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0898010112461977">
<title>Agitated Behaviors Observed Before Intervention</title>
<p>Participants entered the MSE 16 times during the first 2 weeks that the nonreligious music was played and 18 times during the last 2 weeks when the religious music was played. Mean scores for each of the items on the ABS were computed to determine the most common types of agitated behaviors observed prior to entering MSE (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898010112461977">Table 1</xref>). Behaviors observed the most were presently rated as slight to moderate. The most common agitated behaviors were (a) short attention span, easy distractibility, and inability to concentrate (<italic>M</italic> = 2.79, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.70); (b) restlessness, pacing, and excessive movements (<italic>M</italic> = 2.52, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.09); (c) wandering (<italic>M</italic> = 2.52, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.12); and (d) impulsiveness, impatience, and low tolerance for pain or frustration (<italic>M</italic> = 2.33, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.05). No violent or self-abusive behavior was noted.</p>

<title>Observed Responses to Music</title>
<p>If the participants responded to the music by performing any one of nine behaviors (singing, humming, foot tapping, rhythmic movements, shutting eyes, dancing, clapping, hand tapping and finger snapping), it was assumed by the raters that they were listening to the music. Participants appeared to be listening to the music 15 out of the 16 times during the nonreligious music (Dean Martin) and 15 out of the 18 times during the religious music. Most of the participants were observed singing (43.8%), humming (37.5%), and performing rhythmic movements (37.5%) while listening to the nonreligious music. Similarly, while listening to religious music, most of the participants were observed humming (61.1%), singing (55.6 %), and performing rhythmic movement (44.4%); however, many also tapped their feet (38.9%; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898010112461977">Table 2</xref>). In spite of this difference, however, no statistically significant difference, <italic>t</italic>(32) = −0.809, <italic>p</italic> = .425, was found between the nonreligious response index mean score (<italic>M</italic> = 2.75, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.98) and religious music response index mean score (<italic>M</italic> = 3.33, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.20).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Having knowledge of the most popular types of music specific to this generational era was crucial in this study. Specifically, this study compared Dean Martin’s popular nonreligious music with religious music to determine if there were any differences in the behavioral responses of PWD while listening to these types of music within an MSE. There were no statistically significant differences in how the participants responded to both types of music after intervention. Participants responded similarly to the nonreligious music and religious music, both in significantly decreasing the agitation and in the observed responses during intervention. Although the majority of participants presented with severe intellectual dysfunction as assessed using the SPMSQ, regardless of what type of music was playing, the participants were observed singing, humming, and rhythmically moving to the music. This finding may provide support for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0898010112461977">Cuddy and Duffin’s (2005)</xref> theory that musical memory may be a cognitive skill that is spared from Alzheimer’s disease. Participants were able to remember the words and the rhythm to many of the nonreligious and religious songs. These memories may have assisted in decreasing the agitated behaviors that were observed before intervention. In this study, musical memories were able to significantly increase attention span and decrease restlessness, pacing, wandering, and impulsive behaviors observed most often before intervention among the participants. The significant reduction in agitated behaviors in this study provides support for the use of musical interventions to reduce agitation in PWD as reported in numerous research studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898010112461977">Brotons &amp; Pickett-Cooper, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0898010112461977">Denney, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898010112461977">Gerdner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898010112461977">Gerdner, &amp; Swanson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898010112461977">Park &amp; Pringle-Specht, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898010112461977">Raglio et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898010112461977">Ragneskog et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898010112461977">Sung et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Limitations of this study included the small sample size from one adult day care center. Although the within-subjects design improved the power of this study to detect a difference, larger samples from numerous research sites are needed to increase the generalizability of the study. In addition, because this study was part of a larger study investigating the feasibility and efficacy of using an MSE within an adult day care center, it is not known if the reduction of agitation was the result of the musical intervention exclusively or in combination with the MSE equipment (fan, plasma ball, solar effects projector, vibrating tube, aroma air spray, light rope, and fiber optics). What was known, however, were the observed behaviors that were recorded within the MSE while listening to the musical interventions.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The use of musical interventions to reduce agitation in PWD was supported in this study. If the PWD is unable to report their favorite type of music, knowing what the most popular music of a generation was and/or if a specific religion was noted in the medical record may give positive insight into what the PWD preferences may be. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898010112461977">Morris (2009)</xref>, music is a vital part of all societies and cultures and has been linked to medicine and healing rituals since ancient times. Musical interventions complement traditional therapy by integrating mind–body experiences through relaxation responses by evoking emotions, feelings, and sensations through the limbic system and releasing endorphins. Thus, music can be a useful intervention to reduce agitation in PWD.</p>
