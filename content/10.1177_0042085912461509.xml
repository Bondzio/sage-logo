<p>Understanding teaching as a political act is often assumed to be a strength for teachers; however, this assumption conceals important aspects of their processes of becoming politicized. I argue that seeing teaching as a political act can be a liability for prospective teachers of color who engaged with college student activism if these assumed qualities are not productively addressed in teacher education programs. I examine trajectories of change in a prospective teacher’s sense-making about activism over the course of her first year in a master’s and credential program and explore the implications of these findings for programs of teacher education.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the last decade and a half, an influential body of scholarship in teacher education has increasingly argued that teaching and teacher education are fundamentally political and value-laded activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042085912461509">Cochran-Smith, 2001</xref>). Education, they argue, “is already politicized” and its “political side” needs to be taken into account more explicitly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085912461509">Bruner, 1996</xref>, p. 29). Highlighting the significant disparities in the educational opportunities, resources, and outcomes between racialized and classed groups, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085912461509">Cochran-Smith et al. (2009)</xref> argue that “teachers can and should be both educators and advocates who are committed [. . .] to diminishing existing inequities in school and society by helping to redistribute educational opportunities” (p. 350). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085912461509">McDonald and Zeichner (2009)</xref> further argue that the role of teachers must also entail engaging in individual and collective action that mitigates oppression and addresses societal structures that perpetuate injustice. Teacher education, from this perspective, should support prospective teachers in claiming their role as an educator as well as an activist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085912461509">Cochran-Smith, 2005</xref>). In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042085912461509">Ladson-Billings (1998)</xref> urges educators to move beyond conventional notions of what it means to be a teacher. She argues that if educators are truly intent on exposing racism in education, they must adopt a “position of consistently swimming against the current” and engage in a “radical approach to democracy that seriously undermines the privilege of those who have so skillfully carved that privilege into the foundation of the nation” (p. 22). These perspectives have powerfully shaped teacher education and forced the field to confront questions about the role of educators in working toward a more equitable and just society. There is, however, a cautionary note concerning the uptake of these positions and the associated assumptions about the desirability of an activist stance in teachers. I argue that without a critical examination of how a prospective teacher’s activist stance intersects with his or her racialization and own process of becoming politicized, presumed strengths, such as experience as an activist, have the potential to turn into severe liabilities within the context of the classroom.</p>
<p>Scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912461509">Achinstein and Aguirre (2008)</xref> have argued that teacher educators are prone to overlook the needs of prospective teachers of color as they assume that these teachers’ strengths, such as their shared cultural experiences with students of color, commitments to equity and justice, and the potential to bridge differences between communities and institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042085912461509">Gomez, Rodriguez, &amp; Agosto, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042085912461509">Parker &amp; Hood, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042085912461509">Rios &amp; Montecinos, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042085912461509">Weisman &amp; Hansen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042085912461509">Villegas &amp; Davis, 2008</xref>) will fluidly translate into classroom practice. These well-intentioned assumptions about teachers of color often leave them ill prepared to negotiate their multiple identities in their classrooms, particularly as students of color challenge their presumed racial and cultural match (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085912461509">Achinstein &amp; Aguirre, 2008</xref>). In this article, I argue that the classroom transition for prospective teachers of color with activist backgrounds is exacerbated because of the notable absence of attention in teacher education practice and research to the advantages and challenges afforded by their varied experiences as activists and by the particularities of how they became politicized. Drawing on in-depth interviews and a focus group with prospective teachers of color, I attempt to show that the set of skills and perspectives that college student activists bring to teacher education programs can become liabilities if these programs do not support them in recognizing the strengths and shortcomings of those competencies in the classroom. Based on these findings, I conclude the article by discussing how programs of teacher education might support trajectories of change in these prospective teachers’ conceptualization of activism in ways that allow them to productively leverage their experiences and become effective teacher-activists.</p>

<title>Transitioning From College Activism to Classroom Teaching</title>
<p>College student activists have historically played a central role in social movements, most notably in the 1960s and 1970s, but more recently in movements such as divestment and living wage campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085912461509">Altbach &amp; Cohen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085912461509">Biddix &amp; Park, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042085912461509">Soule, 1997</xref>). While college student activism might share qualities with other forms of organizing, it is also uniquely defined by the university context. Scholarship in sociology that has studied student movements, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085912461509">Munson (2010)</xref> and Hirsh (1990), is helpful in understanding its particularities. Munson argues that college offers a “transition point,” where students experience a change in their everyday routines and social networks. As he argues, this period is often marked by more malleability and flexibility than the structures and relationships allowed for in high school. Such changes make it easier for college students to “incorporate new habits and activities that make them part of a movement” and for them to be “open to new ideas and new ways of thinking about the world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085912461509">Munson, 2010</xref>, p. 774). At transition points, where daily routines and social networks have been disrupted, students are more likely to actively seek to establish new relationships and habits. Information that elicits a sense of “moral outrage” is more likely to lead students at transition points into activism. Others, who are more enmeshed in daily routines and social networks, tend to seek outlets in “habituated activity or talk with a close confidante” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085912461509">Munson, 2010</xref>, p. 775). While college students might have had the opportunity to become involved in campaigns before college, it is often “only in the context of having to rely on new friends and having to create new relationships that [many] individuals take the plunge into activism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085912461509">Munson, 2010</xref>, p. 778). Entry into a teacher education program marks another transition point where much of the flexibility in the structures and relationships that characterized college quickly fade away. Prospective teachers’ lives often become highly structured by the required university coursework, student teaching, and professional credentialing requirements. Many of the contextual factors that facilitated college student activism are absent within their professional program settings, forcing students to deeply question the possibilities for change that they had envisioned as college students as well as the efficacy of associated strategies.</p>
<p>Based on his study of student divestment protests at Columbia University, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085912461509">Hirsch (1990)</xref> identifies consciousness-raising, collective empowerment, polarization, and joint decision making as four central processes in college student activism. These processes are critical to student recruitment and participation in movements that “create a willingness to sacrifice personal welfare for a collective cause” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085912461509">Hirsch, 1990</xref>, p. 244). Consciousness-raising involves convincing potential recruits that a group’s cause is just and that since “institutional means of influence have been unsuccessful,” “morally committed individuals must fight for the cause” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085912461509">Hirsch, 1990</xref>, p. 245). Collective empowerment occurs when a large number of members are “willing to sacrifice themselves for the movement,” which creates a “bandwagon effect” that persuades others to participate because of the “presumed ability to accomplish the movement goal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085912461509">Hirsch, 1990</xref>, p. 245). College student activism is also characterized by polarization, where “each side sees the battle in black and white terms, uses increasingly coercive tactics, and develops high levels of distrust and anger toward the opponent” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085912461509">Hirsch, 1990</xref>, p. 245). Hirsch also argues that the relationship between the group and the individual, particularly through collective decision making in which the decisions of the group take precedence over individual preferences, plays an important role in “motivating and continuing the commitment of movement participants” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085912461509">Hirsch, 1990</xref>, p. 246).</p>
<p>College student activists who enter programs of teacher education have witnessed the power of consciousness-raising, polarization, collective empowerment, and joint decision making, in recruiting and engaging peers to exert pressure on institutions. Either through their own experience, or through the living memories of earlier struggles such as the free-speech movement and the divestment campaigns, prospective teachers with experience as college student activists know that these organizing strategies are immensely powerful in affecting social, political, and economic change. As potent as these means are in anti-institutional battles, they are also severely limited in the context of the classroom. The implicit theory of learning in this model’s definition of consciousness-raising is that the activist possesses truth and knowledge and that she must ultimately convince others of the importance of the information she holds. Furthermore, notions of polarization, collective empowerment, and joint decision making in this model severely limit diversity of thought and attention to individual needs. While these approaches are powerful, perhaps even necessary, within the context of college student activism, from a learning perspective, they are diametrically opposed to the ideals of a student-centered classroom. Prospective teachers are challenged to think of learning, student needs, and the classroom community in fundamentally different ways in programs of teacher education. From constructivist and sociocultural perspectives of learning such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085912461509">Bruner (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042085912461509">Vygostsky (1978)</xref>, to theories of culturally relevant pedagogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042085912461509">Howard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042085912461509">Ladson-Billings, 1995</xref>), funds of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042085912461509">Moll, Amanti, Neff, &amp; Gonzalez, 1992</xref>), and critical pedagogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085912461509">Freire, 2001</xref>), college student activists in programs of teacher education are encouraged to take a radically different epistemological stance by building on the knowledge of students and colearning with them. Thus, on top of the struggles that prospective teachers face more generally in reconceptualizing learning and teaching, these college student activists must also rethink the moral certainty and justification they had for their epistemology and theory of social change.</p>
<p>In the study described below, I explore how a prospective teacher, who identified as a person of color and had experience as a college student activist, reconceptualized central aspects of what it meant to be a teacher-activist. In particular, I examine how her perspectives on teaching related to the four processes identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085912461509">Hirsch (1990)</xref> became more nuanced, textured, and multidimensional over the course of her first year in a teacher education program.</p>

<title>The Study</title>
<sec id="section4-0042085912461509">
<title>Contextualizing the study</title>
<p>This study took place in my home institution’s 2-year master’s and teacher credential program (hereafter referred to as “the program”). The first year of the program is largely comprised of coursework and student teaching. The second year entails full-time teaching in specified urban schools and the completion of an action research project for their master’s degree. The program has a widely recognized reputation for its focus on social justice and urban schools, which is communicated to students during recruitment and orientation, and through its day-to-day workings. While students and faculty share an understanding that the program strives to prepare teachers to teach for social justice, the meaning of this phrase, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042085912461509">Grant and Agosto (2008)</xref> point out, is often ill-defined. To reduce such ambiguity and to develop a collective understanding of what it means to teach for social justice, the program provides a framework that outlines its guiding principles. For instance, one of the principles from the handbook states,
<disp-quote>
<p>teaching has moral, cultural, and political dimensions. Therefore, teachers must assume activist roles and develop strategies to challenge and disrupt the inequities that pervade urban schools in order to successfully serve the needs of racially, culturally, and linguistically diverse students.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While such principles permeate the discourse of the students and faculty and are central to the program’s collective identity, these meanings are undoubtedly also contested. Differing perspectives among students and faculty on whether the program overstresses or underemphasizes the development of an activist stance continually shape how these principles are enacted.</p>
<p>Each year that I have been a faculty member in the program, I consistently encounter a small group of first year students of color who describe themselves as “critical.” They lament that they are not adequately “challenged” by the program. These descriptors have been surprisingly uniform across the years. By self-identifying as critical, these students meant that they had explored theories of systemic inequity, racism, classism, power, and privilege in other formal and informal contexts. In addition, it meant that they had engaged in work as activists in the past or were closely associated with such work. They anticipated that the program would have more explicitly supported them in working with K-12 students to address forms of oppression that affect these students and their communities. The focus on what they perceived as conventional teaching contributed to their sense of not being challenged by the program. These critical students represent a small, but still significant, proportion of the entire cohort. For instance, during the focus group for this study, the critical students who were present estimated that “there were probably only 15 or 16 students like [them]” in the entire cohort of approximately 170. My repeated informal conversations with these self-identified critical students of color over multiple years motivated the current study with the purpose of better understanding their experiences.</p>
<p>Since focus groups provide a context where participants can engage in interactive discussions and make comparisons among each other’s experiences and opinions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085912461509">Morgan, 1997</xref>), I decided to employ such a forum for this study. Given the constraints of time, as I initiated the study toward the end of the academic year, the focus group provided the added advantage of allowing me to gather “concentrated amounts of data on precisely the topic of interest” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042085912461509">Morgan, 1997</xref>, p. 13). As Morgan points out, however, a weakness of focus groups is that it is difficult to gain “an in-depth understanding of a person’s opinions and experiences” (p. 11). Therefore, I supplemented the focus group data with individual interviews of a subset of participants as described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0042085912461509">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>On various occasions over the course of the academic year in which this study was conducted, I had informal conversations with three students who described themselves as critical educators of color. Similar to students before them, these students expressed their frustration with the program for not adequately challenging them to build on their critical perspectives and on their experiences as college student activists. They also expressed a degree of exasperation with students who were “not critical.” I asked these students to recruit other students, whom they identified as critical educators of color, for a focus group. By using this snowball method of sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085912461509">Coleman, 1958</xref>), I was able to find students of color in the program who were identified as critical by their peers. An advantage of this sampling approach is that I did not have to impose outside criteria of what constituted being critical and could rely on critical students’ own recognition of criticality in their peers. A potential disadvantage of this approach is that it excluded students with similar perspectives who might not have been nominated by their peers. Such lack of recognition by peers, however, might indicate unique strengths and needs that are best examined in a separate study. Eleven students in the program were identified through the recruitment process. Ten students agreed to participate in the focus group. Due to constraints of time at the end of the academic year, I was not able to conduct individual interviews with all the participants. In my preliminary analysis of the focus group, as described below, it became apparent that one subset of students only focused on a critique of the program for failing to address their needs, while the other subset, in addition to providing critiques of the program, also reflected on their own process of change. With the intention of better understanding how this latter subset was able to negotiate their identity as critical teachers of color in ways that were meaningful for them within the context of the program, I decided to conduct selective interviews with 3 such participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0042085912461509">
<title>Focus group and interviews</title>
<p>The focus group was three hours long and was conducted toward the end of the participants’ first year in the program. The participants were prompted to discuss the unique strengths that they felt they brought to teaching and the particular challenges they faced in the program. They were also asked to propose changes to the program that could better support critical teachers of color. In the follow-up ninety-minute interviews, each of the selected participants was prompted to elaborate on the questions from the focus group. They were also encouraged to further explain the limitations of their prior stances on activism that they alluded to during the focus group.</p>
<p>The focus group and each of the interviews were transcribed. Using a grounded theory approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042085912461509">Strauss, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042085912461509">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>), I identified key categories pertaining to participants’ self-identified strengths, challenges, and growth through the process of open coding. Codes such as reflection, anger, authority, polarization, process, outrage, coalition building, institutional change, opposition, and resistance were employed to understand variations and self-described changes in participants’ understandings of what it meant to be critical through the processes of axial and selective coding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0042085912461509">
<title>Representational decision to focus on a single interviewee</title>
<p>Given the constraints of the journal format, there is an inevitable tradeoff between characterizing trends and divergences among the interviewees and focus group participants, and providing additional attention to the nuances, texture, and multidimensionality of any one of the participants. Building on the methodological arguments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085912461509">Flyvbjerg (2006)</xref>, I focus on a single-case for its ability to represent a “wealth of details” and “a nuanced view of reality,” which are often lost in cross-participant analyses (p. 223). The interviews and the focus group from this study consisted of a substantial amount of narrative, which embodied the “complexities and contradictions of real life” and are “difficult or impossible to summarize” in ways that are required when looking for inclusive generalizations across a large number of participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085912461509">Flyvbjerg, 2006</xref>, p. 237). Based on the anticipated value I see for teachers and teacher educators in understanding this process of change for college student activists, I decided to represent the findings by focusing on a single participant who was particularly articulate in illustrating her transformations over time.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section8-0042085912461509">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>To elucidate the transitions experienced by a self-identified prospective teacher of color with experience as a college student activist, I focus on Diana, an Arab American prospective high school social studies teacher. In her racial identification and in her activist work, Diana occupied boundary spaces. The boundary space she negotiated with respect to her racial identification was evident as she elaborated on what it meant to be Arab American with immigrant parents from Iraq. She explained the complex racialization of Arabs in the contemporary political context of the United States. On one hand, she explained, they are officially categorized as White. Paralleling arguments by scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042085912461509">Jamal and Naber (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042085912461509">Sirin and Fine (2008)</xref>, Diana explained that Arabs have never “really been White” in Western eyes, and the racialized Othering of Muslims and Arabs in the United States has increased significantly with U.S. interventions in the Middle East over the last four decades and the escalating “war on terror” that is marked by religion and geographical region. Diana highlighted the contradictions inherent to racialization. Given the historical and contemporary political relationships that define Arabs and Muslims, she rejects the label of being White but also recognizes the partial privileges of Whiteness from which she contextually benefits. Within a history of European and U.S. colonization and imperialism, she sees herself as a person of color. She avoids the ambiguities of the White/non-White paradigm, to a degree, by referring to herself as an Arab American.</p>
<p>Diana also experienced a boundary space as a college student activist. She had extensive experience in college as an organizer with Muslim student groups. In these contexts, she felt she had to argue for the importance of solidarity with the struggles of other people of color. In her participation in coalitions of groups working on issues pertinent to students of color more generally, she felt that she was an isolated voice who represented matters affecting Muslim Americans, particularly the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the racial profiling and targeting of Muslims. Perhaps being at the margins of multiple communities (hooks, 1984) contributed to Diana’s ability, in comparison to the other participants, to rethink her role as a teacher-activist and to articulate these changes.</p>
<p>Below, I represent four processes of change that emerged from Diana’s reflections. With the intention of making these processes most useful to practitioners as well as researchers, I have relied on <italic>emic</italic> descriptions. Within each of these accounts, I highlight Diana’s critical reconceptualizations along the four dimensions of college student activism outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085912461509">Hirsch (1990)</xref>, that is, consciousness-raising, collective empowerment, polarization, and the relationship between the group and the individual as evidenced by joint decision making.</p>
<sec id="section9-0042085912461509">
<title>Seeding Reflective Dissent Rather Than Anger</title>
<p>Diana explained that as she became increasingly politicized and aware of the injustices and inequities in the world, a sense of anger was an important motivator in her work for social justice. Entering the program, she believed that she would be a “good educator if [she] can get [her] students angry.” She wanted them “to realize what’s going on and to become angry” so that she could “fuel that anger into doing something.” While maintaining the important role of anger, Diana now feels that her anger “made her reactionary” and she questions, “What’s [just getting angry] going to do?” She was inspired by her cooperating teacher’s words that “reflection is revolutionary.” Instead of being driven by the notion that “anger is revolutionary,” Diana now attempts to embody such reflective dissent. She describes the contrast of these approaches in her classroom:
<disp-quote>
<p>And now, it’s like, I don’t think that anger is going to do anything. Because when you’re angry you do things that aren’t really rational. So, I hope I don’t get my students angry and then walk away. I want them angry, you know for a little bit, because it’s unfair and that it’s right for them to not be complacent, but to be angry. Because when you’re angry you know you can do something about it. But, take it a step further, they should not just be angry. Now they should be reflective on that anger. Why am I angry? And what can I do to think rationally through this anger? And I think, being more reflective, that’s what I mean.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a student activist, it was often effective to incite moral outrage in people to promote their participation in particular public actions as long as the core organizers sustained their commitment and were strategic in their participation. Within the context of a classroom, simply provoking anger is inadequate and often counterproductive. Diana begins to appreciate the importance of nurturing students’ sustained reflective dissent over such outrage.</p>
<p>Diana’s emphasis on reflective dissent emerged from her own consideration of her process of growth and her concern about the sustainability of activism and the well-being of activists who are prompted by anger alone. Based on her experience, and the process of becoming politicized that she has noticed in others, Diana argues that there are three main stages in people’s political development. In the first, “you don’t see anything for what it is. You don’t see, for example, propaganda. You don’t see the racism, or the stereotypes or stuff like that.” In the second stage, “then suddenly, when it’s pointed out to you, you see it all the time and you get so angry.” She feels she was in this stage when she was involved in college activism and even at the beginning of the teacher education program. In the third stage, which she feels she is entering, “you become more transformative” and reflective and ask, “What do I do about the anger?” and “Why am I here?” She explains that this stage is particularly “difficult.” If “you’re not guided” by peers or mentors who have been through the process and are forced “to go through it on your own,” you are likely to “flounder and get disheartened and kind of fall apart.” Diana felt that the formal components of the program did not help her through this crucial process. It was only because of the support of her peers who engaged her in dialogue about reflective dissent that she was able to move past her constraining anger and to “make it through the program.”</p>
<p>In her realizations about seeding reflective dissent, Diana develops a new appreciation for the importance of reflection as a critical dimension of consciousness-raising. She realizes that high levels of polarization and reactionary anger are not sustainable. In college student activism, collective action and the joint decisions of the group in achieving a clear desired outcome took precedence over individual needs and was often a source of strength. Within the classroom and in her work with her colleagues, there is no longer a clearly defined single-issue campaign. Teachers like Diana find themselves working toward a long-term and ever-evolving goal of social justice. In this changed context, Diana begins to see that supporting individuals in their process of growth and working with others to redirect their anger in transformative ways are central elements of collective empowerment.</p>

<title>Being Mindful of One’s Authority as an Educator</title>
<p>Diana explained that before she began student teaching, she failed to recognize how important it was to account for her authority as a teachers. While she was extremely conscious of how race, class, and gender nuance social power and interactions, she thought about the institutional authority of teachers only in terms of when they maintained the status quo or reproduced oppressive hierarchies. As she saw herself as a teacher “on the side of the students” who was helping them “learn about their common oppression,” she did not critically think about her own authority in the classroom. She realizes, “as much as [she] really wants to be that crazy, radical, revolutionary, angry” teacher, she needs to be mindful of her authority and prioritize the process of engaging in dialogue with students and creating a space for dialogue between students. She guards against falling into the role of being the “powerful, expert, revolutionary person who is like, ‘I’m going to revolutionize you,’” and constantly tries to remind herself, given her authority in the classroom, that she needs to “go through the process” with her students even though “it’ll be difficult.” By “going through the process,” Diana meant that her students would have to work through many of the resistances, challenges, contradictions, and tensions that she has struggled with over the years. While Diana does not make the parallel explicit, her realization here highlights the contradictions in educators who simplistically read <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085912461509">Freire (2001)</xref> and critique schools for the preponderance of the “banking method” of teaching, but rely on such methods in attempting to transmit political consciousness.</p>
<p>In her reflections, Diana emphasizes two aspects of a teacher’s authority. One, regardless of whether teachers might consider themselves a part of a common struggle with students and their communities, within the context of the classroom, they are also agents of the state who are vested with institutional power. In contrast to college student organizing, where activists largely recruit and educate peers with similar institutional power, Diana explains that a teacher must be extremely aware of both the hidden and explicit authority they have in public schools. As she observes,
<disp-quote>
<p>You can talk a lot about what I want to do, and this and that, but when you’re in the classroom, you hold so much power as a teacher. It sucks to say that, but that’s the way it is. You’re a teacher. I was even looking on the California state poster, like laws or whatever, and it’s written, it says the teacher is the authority. So, students know that what I say pretty much goes. If you don’t listen to me, you can get expelled, you can be suspended. So, I hold a lot of power.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While it is important for teachers to stand in solidarity with the struggles of their students and their communities, Diana argues that it is important for teachers to recognize the multiple levels and nuances of power within classrooms and the institution of schooling.</p>
<p>As another dimension of a teacher’s authority, Diana contrasts her high school students with college student activists, who choose when and how to “fuel their anger” into a cause. Engaging in critical work is personal, emotional, and often troubling. Diana feels she did not appreciate these crucial differences about the terms on which students choose to engage or not engage in the examination of oppression when she first started student-teaching. She recognizes that she naïvely expected her students to wholeheartedly embrace the process of critically examining oppression because of their race and class positionings. She felt she did not adequately take into account that students might be hesitant to examine oppression because it surfaces aspects of their lives that are personal and that they might not want to make public. She also feels that she overlooked how the process of critical examination makes students vulnerable as it is emotionally difficult, threatening to what they take as normal, and sometimes taxing within the context of their social relationships. Diana reflects on her prior stance and explains how she expected her students to engage with the examination of oppression on her terms without realizing that she was privileging her own perspective and desires:
<disp-quote>
<p>[Teachers like me] are so excited about [issues of racism and classism] and I always tell my students, “I was never taught this, in high school and you should value this because you’re learning this in high school. I learned this in college if that. I’m like, some people won’t even learn this in college. So value this.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She now realizes that even though she was attempting to teach issues that are significant, when she approached learning from a perspective that students must value “these things,” she is “forcing them to value an education that [she] deems important.” Even when students are allowed to pursue topics of their own interest, teachers implicitly “force students to value” a perspective through processes such as assignment structure and teacher questions or prompts that are premised on the belief that only a certain class of student-generated topics are adequately critical. With these differences in mind, Diana argues that teachers need to be aware that how they shape the content and culture of the classroom through their authority has the power to “really create these transformative agents” or “get these students so disheartened with the system that they become self-defeating and they don’t want to even look at it.”</p>
<p>As Diana becomes increasingly mindful of her authority as an educator, she recognizes that consciousness-raising in the classroom cannot be equivalent to persuading a student to take a position. It entails collectively working through the resistances, challenges, contradictions, and tensions that might arise. Polarizations that involve simplistic dichotomies of oppression and authority give way to more nuanced understandings of her own positionality as a teacher with power that stems from institutions and the state. Diana begins to see that a classroom that is collectively empowered must support individual students through the personal and emotional dimensions of examining oppression. She realizes that a group’s singular goal cannot take priority over individual needs and she begins to appreciate how individual students must be supported to engage with issues on their own terms.</p>

<title>Nurturing the Construction of Knowledge Through the Investigation of Social Contradictions</title>
<p>A significant change in Diana’s understanding of social justice occurred when she shifted her focus from <italic>what</italic> she felt students should know to an emphasis on the <italic>process in which they collectively learn</italic>. She acknowledges that she has her “own understanding of social justice” that entails “providing more equity and access.” She stresses, however, “that is [her] definition” and in the classroom, social justice would be embodied by “allowing everyone to come up with their own understanding of what social justice is” and for her to “provide a space for people to talk about it.” Diana characterizes social justice as “being able to have that conversation” about what it “means to be in a society that is socially just.” An essential dimension of social justice in the classroom, according to Diana, is for students to have voice, to acknowledge, and be able to articulate their knowledge, opinions, and needs. Diana recognizes, however, that nurturing voice in students is not uncomplicated. She asks, “How do you tell someone they have a voice? You’re <italic>telling</italic> them they have a voice!” She explains how the desire to give someone else a voice is “kind of weird” and that it “was a big pitfall [she] had earlier.” Similar to the process of activist consciousness-raising, she expected to “give them the voice” by “giving them the knowledge.” She realizes that this vision of voice had the implicit expectation that students would “repeat [the knowledge] back” to her. It did not create the context for students to “construct” their own knowledge. She points to the advice she received from her methods instructor of “simply providing a question and letting the student just talk” as very instrumental in shaping her new approach to teaching. She now tries to hold back on her own opinion because of “her role” as a teacher. She explains that students “have been trained for so long to think that [teachers are] the only source of information. The minute that [she] gives her opinion, it suddenly becomes what everyone thinks is the right opinion.” Therefore, Diana often has “to force [herself] to not give her opinion.” She is careful to emphasize, however, that she has specialized knowledge and ways of thinking about history that she needs to share with her students. She goes on to argue that “the investigation is so much more important than the right or the wrong answer. Giving students the means to investigate is much more powerful than if they get the right answer.” Rather than repeat a definition of democracy, for instance, Diana wants them to “really investigate what democracy look likes” and critically ask if they are “really practicing democracy in their community, their classroom, their school.”</p>
<p>Diana identifies learning about essential questions in her social studies methods course as a transformative point in her growth as a teacher. Early in the program, she had planned a unit on racist and sexist language with her peers. They took the approach, “Let’s talk about our language use and how it’s wrong and how we shouldn’t use this language.” In retrospect, she feels the approach was very limiting since they had a definitive conclusion to which they intended to bring students. It did not allow for student voice or mutual growth. As Diana looks to the opportunity to reteach the unit, she hopes to begin with the essential question, “What is good language?” and allow students to determine through dialogue what they consider “good language.” She anticipates some of the challenges that arise from “having students come to their own conclusions.” For one, students might come to conclusions that are not in line with her own. She also has to accept that “it might not be conclusive” for many students and that they might leave the class with a sense of uncertainty. Part of the richness that she has discovered as a teacher is learning to be at ease, perhaps even excited, to have students “walk away thinking,” even if it means that they have not settled on an answer.</p>
<p>Similar to her use of essential questions, Diana finds contradictions as fertile spaces to engage in a critical examination of society. As an example, she described an interaction that had recently occurred in an elective course that she cotaught, where she was able to raise the questions, “What is one unfair thing that is going on? What is one really blatant contradiction?” Two topics emerged in these conversations. One was the idea that “students are supposed to go to college,” but in urban communities, “a lot are dropping out.” The other was that “we say we’re a country that values immigration, but these laws are being passed saying that we don’t want immigrants.” Diana described how the first question allowed the class to explore the history of education in Los Angeles and in the United States and to examine how these histories differentially affected various groups. She also explained how this approach allowed her to authentically colearn from her students. They offered perspectives that she had never considered before and they added critical knowledge to the discussion, which she could not have possibly included on her own because she does not “know the community as well as they do.” Diana firmly believes that
<disp-quote>
<p>once you see one contradiction, one very big contradiction, then that exposes you to a whole system of contradictions that are going on. [. . .] It opens you up to this pandora’s box of questioning everything that is going on.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Diana’s growing insights into how students learn is reflected in her comments about nurturing the construction of knowledge through the investigation of social contradictions. Increasingly aware of her authority as a teacher and of the importance of dialogue, Diana is now willing to allow the process of consciousness-raising to develop organically in ways in which the outcomes are not tightly controlled by her vision of what is right. She begins to question the usefulness of polarization and recognizes that teachers’ predetermined notions of dichotomous labels limit students’ learning and growth. Diana sees collective empowerment arising from authentic colearning with students, where her role is not to persuade them, but to learn with them. She also begins to complicate the relationship between the group and the individual. Her purpose as a teacher is not to bring her students into an alignment of thought but to create spaces for the coexistence of contradictions and the multiplicity of positions that will spur further investigation.</p>

<title>Being Cautious of Polarization and Open to Broader Coalitions</title>
<p>Diana contrasts her current approach to understanding issues of inequity and injustice with her former reliance on polarization. She realizes that she “shouldn’t have to scapegoat White people as the reason for everything that’s going wrong.” Diana laments “the growing trend” in conversations about race among critical teachers of color who take a simplistic approach and argue, “the White people are oppressing us.” She argues that “we need to move past that idea,” since it misleads us to think that we live in “this dichotomy where if we just get White people to have less power, then we’re going to win and we’re going to get what we want.” She argues that there are “numerous examples of people of color in power that have led to further oppression of our people.” She explicitly reflects on how she previously thought about these issues:
<disp-quote>
<p>If you asked me a year ago or something, I would be like, White people are the oppressor and if you identify with White people then you take a back seat to every social justice issue because a.) you’re either perpetuating it, or b.) it doesn’t even relate to you.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Diana is currently “trying to move away from that idea that if you’re White, you’re an enemy and you’re not an ally” because it is “a very rudimentary form of developing who your allies are and your foes are” and it does not account for power. She is also concerned how such a position might influence her students’ engagement with other racialized groups, since she teaches in urban schools that are in highly segregated neighborhoods and where students often do not often interact with diverse racialized communities. She has observed classes where the conversation devolves into, “let’s get rid of the White people,” instead of creating the space for students to understand and address how issues of power shape society. While Diana recognizes the significance of racism, White privilege, and a society structured by Whiteness, she is concerned that such simplistic and dichotomous language actually prevents a deeper and more nuanced examination of power and oppression.</p>
<p>Similar to her changing perspectives on social justice in the classroom, her views on what it means to engage others in coalitions have also changed. Having “encountered a lot of different people” in education who think about social justice differently, she is beginning to understand the importance of dialoguing with them. She acknowledges that some believe “that you need to allow students to understand that working hard will let them succeed” while others argue for “dismantling that idea that it is about working hard and stressing that it’s about organizing and getting people together.” Diana does not imply that these positions are equivalent or that the differences are inconsequential, but she regrets the tendency for those engaged in social justice work to take the approach that “my way is the right way” and not explore how “at the end of the day,” everyone at the table wants “people who have no access to have access. They want to break down this unfair system.” While she acknowledges the important lessons about coalition building that she learned as a student activist, she wants to move past the tendency for coalitions to essentially define their alliance through the “exclusion” and “demonization” of others.</p>
<p>Diana’s comments about being cautious of polarization and open to broader coalitions focus most directly on her evolving relationships with other educators. Her prior vision of consciousness-raising required drawing distinct boundaries between her own position and the perspective of others. Consciousness-raising now also entails learning to see commonality in the work of others who might think differently from her. She realizes that a polarizing focus on dichotomies often obscures important and necessary analyses of power. She begins to reconceptualize collective empowerment as arising from dialogue with others who not only share similar long-term goals but also think differently in substantial ways. The relationship between the group and the individual is also redefined as Diana begins to see the importance of coalitions that share commonalities but are also inclusive of differences.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The processes of consciousness-raising, polarization, collective empowerment, and joint decision making identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042085912461509">Hirsch (1990)</xref> are central to college student activism. They have been successfully utilized to create monumental transformations at the national and global levels. They have also been extremely effective in local campaigns. Prospective teachers like Diana have experienced how powerful these processes can be. Coming out of college, however, it is also difficult for them to see that this form of organizing has its limitations and is not necessarily effective in other situations that they begin to encounter. As college students, they were immersed in a social context where they and many around them were experiencing transition points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042085912461509">Munson, 2010</xref>). Their understanding of the possibility of change and the effectiveness of particular strategies was shaped by this context. College students activists are involved most often in a particular class of campaigns where they are exerting pressure on an entity or institution in which they are not in a position of authority and where they can easily identity the polarized other. Many student activists have not experienced the multidimensionality of struggles in social movements that extend beyond single-issue campaigns spearheaded by college students. The change that the participants in this study now seek as teachers involves numerous local level issues, alliances with communities, as well as concerns of district, state, and national policy. As teachers, they will be employees of the state. Although they might wish to see themselves in opposition to administrators and bureaucrats, at some level, whether they embrace it or not, they still represent and carry out the functions of the institution. As opposed to campaigns where a political commitment or a tactical outcome often trumped the desires and requirements of members, teachers must engage in their work toward equity and justice as they constantly remain conscious of nurturing dialogue among students and attending to their individual needs. The meaning of collective empowerment and the understanding of the relationship between the group and the individual must also radically transform as a classroom teacher. As Diana pointed out, while prospective teachers naïvely assume that polarization can be used to muster students against “the oppressor,” it often quells deep dialogue and fails to promote engaged learning in the classroom. Similarly, polarization is often not an effective and sustainable strategy when attempting to change institutions as integral members of the institution. The often simplistic polarization that is used in single issue campaigns become decidedly more complicated when it is nuanced by race, class, gender, sexuality, immigration status, language background, and other factors that are harder to account for within the context of institutions as complex as schools and schooling.</p>
<p>As teacher educators, our use of analytical categories to research and support prospective teachers is often driven by predetermined categories such as teachers of color or politicized teachers. Such categories are important to account for, but we must also seek to uncover analytically powerful and meaningful categories that might be less encompassing, but more contextually salient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042085912461509">Philip (2011)</xref>. Based on the findings presented above, I argue that prospective teachers with experience as college student activists is an example of such an analytical category. As demonstrated in this article, the strengths of this group of prospective teachers are unique, but we potentially turn their rich assets into liabilities when we gloss over their particular needs. As teacher educators, we often either praise them for understanding the larger political context of schooling, or lament that their political convictions alienate them from others and do not necessarily translate into better classroom practice. Instead of falling into this dichotomy, we must explore the clear insights with which prospective teachers like Diana enter teacher education programs, how they might be prompted to leverage and deepen such understandings within the context of classroom teaching, and the challenges they are likely to face in the process.</p>
<p>Diana’s process of change was not an inevitable or even typical progression. Data from the focus group suggests that a number of the prospective teachers tenaciously held on to strategies of college student activism and saw themselves in possession of the truth that they felt compelled to impart on others. They perceived the teacher education program, their school, the school district, and the state and federal government as their “enemy” that must be “fought against.” They explained the lack of success that they were experiencing with their students solely in terms of these entities, obscuring any analysis of their own agency or practice. While Diana attributed a few aspects of her deepening understanding of teaching for social justice to programmatic efforts, she primarily credited her peers. This speaks to the decisive value for programs of teacher education to (a) more clearly uncover analytically powerful, meaningful, and contextually salient categories, such as prospective teachers of color with college student activist backgrounds, (b) understand what trajectories of change, such as those summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042085912461509">Table 1</xref>, might be most helpful as these prospective teachers transition to teaching, and (c) work to facilitate and support these trajectories of change within the context of programs of teacher education. The examination of Diana’s transformations contributes to the first two dimensions listed above and prompts us to more deeply explore the third.</p>
<p>As I indicated in the methods section above, I made the representational decision to focus on Diana and to provide emic descriptions that I believe are of particular value to practitioners. I also chose to represent the nuances of her experience rather than attempt to demonstrate the existence of generalities across participants. Such attention to detail, nuance, and texture is essential in building both theory and practice but also carries its set of limitations. Moving forward, it will be important to investigate the extent to which Diana’s trajectory of change represents the experiences of others, what other trajectories of change exist, and the factors that contribute to particular trajectories of change.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In highlighting how Diana negotiated her developing identity as a teacher-activist, I do not mean, in any way, to deemphasize important critiques about the isolation or the lack of space for growth for critical educators in teacher education programs. While there is much institutional work that needs to be done to address these essential concerns and institutional barriers, there is a growing acknowledgement of the importance of such issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042085912461509">Bennett, Cole, &amp; Thompson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085912461509">Frank, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042085912461509">Jones, Castellanos, &amp; Cole, 2002</xref>). I have attempted to show that the strengths of teachers of color who were politicized through college student activism can not only go unrecognized, but if they are not appropriately nurtured, can work counterproductively in their development and sustained engagement as teachers.</p>
<p>Diana’s comments that the formal components of the program did not support her in her process of growth are particularly important to acknowledge. Given the strong commitments to equity and justice with which prospective teachers like Diana entered the program, it is not surprising that their needs were overlooked. Within the context of the “overwhelming presence of Whiteness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042085912461509">Sleeter, 2001</xref>), attention shifts to students who have more glaring needs such as rethinking deficit understandings of students, their families, and their communities. Yet, for prospective teachers to engage in the kind of reflection that Diana demonstrated requires rethinking foundational aspects of their lives such as how social change occurs, how people engage or do not engage in fighting oppression, and even the very purpose of one’s life. As Diana emphasized, this process can lead students to “flounder,” “get disheartened,” or even “fall apart.” Diana was fortunate to have peers who “guided her through the process,” but as teacher educators, we must work toward programmatic spaces that allow students like Diana to understand the nuances, strengths, and limitations of their student activist stances within the context of classroom teaching and institutional change at schools.</p>
<p>As teacher educators, we must remain acutely aware that the processes of change, as experienced by Diana, are slow and difficult. Diana’s reflections about her changing identity as a teacher-activist help name some of the stances that we might facilitate in programs of teacher education so that prospective teachers like her do not have to rely predominantly on informal networks in their process of growth. These include:</p>

<p>If we embrace <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042085912461509">Cochran-Smith (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085912461509">2005</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042085912461509">McDonald and Zeichner (2009)</xref>, and Ladson-Billing’s (1998) vision that teachers must see themselves as teacher-activists, we have the responsibility as teacher educators to support them in effectively growing this identity. They cannot simply graduate from our programs as activists who happen to also teach. Diana’s reflections highlight a few of the critical distinctions between these identities. We must be mindful that in supporting students like Diana to develop the teacher in their teacher-activist identity, we nurture their “radical, critical edge” without pushing them to succumb to the pressure of simply being “reformist” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042085912461509">Gillborn, 2006</xref>, p. 18). The trajectories of change outlined above provide starting points for teacher education programs to create spaces where prospective teachers can learn to strategically navigate institutions and genuinely promote critical dialogue among their own students, while maintaining a “radical edge” in their social analysis and engagement.</p>
