<p>This is a delightful, beautifully written study which raises many questions as it follows the relationships of a number of real-life French literary women between the late seventeenth and mid-eighteenth century. Using diaries and correspondence, personal relationships are carefully analysed and the work could be used as a model of how to get the most out of ego documents. The author also shows how a number of individuals both in fiction and in real life responded to the model of the post-menopausal woman. The view of this woman, as interpreted by male pundits such as Dr Astruc or the enlightenment philosopher Diderot, was utterly negative. This interpretation made the generation of the species the only significant phase in a woman’s life, and as the menopause stripped a woman of this capacity and destroyed her looks, the ‘clever men’ (my collective term for Astruc, Diderot, etc.) urged seclusion as the only fitting response to the redundant years that might follow. In this view, the post-menopausal woman should thus flee public exposure and seek the privacy of her home, while men of her age, robust and allegedly wise could still enjoy the pleasures of society and sexual fulfilment with younger women.</p>
<p>The study is based on a series of case histories of women who rejected the advice of the pundits and continued for a decade or so after the menopause to have sexual relationships or to enjoy the company of mostly much younger men, experiences they recorded in diaries or letters with an engaging frankness. Thus their energetic voice of riposte to the unforgiving male writers who denied them on-going pleasure can be discerned in copious ego documents which constitute the narratives of this work. These women were anxious to construct relationships which brought them friendship and sex but they had their own quite fastidious standards. They without doubt suffered sadness when a relationship with a younger man was terminated and he moved on to greener fields, but, with exceptions, they were stoical in grief. Realism in fact triumphs.</p>
<p>They also had their standards. For example, their response to the fictional conniving of the older woman in <italic>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</italic> who destroys a young virgin by giving her false counsel is interpreted by such women as outrageous. These are older women with high standards, whose early lives may have been darkened by an unhappy arranged marriage but who essentially wish to make use of their remaining in caring and fulfilling relationships.</p>
<p>Taken together, these interpretations of some interesting individuals shatter the male constructed model of the fading, listless post-menopausal woman offered by authors as diverse as Astruc and Restif de la Bretonne. Indeed, and pleasingly, some of them did find in this period of their life a conspicuous happiness in their relationships – often short-term – with younger men. Madame de Graffigny for example, experienced orgasm for the first time when she was over forty. Certainly, there was perhaps a price to pay when the lover disappeared with a younger model. Perhaps the most poignant of the women studied is the hyper-intellectual Belle van Zuylen who lost the young Benjamin Constant to Madame de Staël and was grief-stricken. At such a point suffering was inevitable and it was the price of the earlier joy for the older woman. The young men in these relationships are perhaps less developed as actors than the women. They are, of course, garnering experience and are ultimately self interested. They grow older too and move on.</p>
<p>But so do the women. Perhaps the most interesting case history here is Françoise de Graffigny (1695–1768) who not only wrote about exotic lands but also kept a copious diary revealing her sexual relationships. Hers is an extraordinary text. From her late teens the unhappy wife of a violent man, she escaped to court life in Luneville and then came to Paris in her forties. Quite how she managed to achieve financial viability is not clear, but from Paris she wrote two letters a day about almost everything and became in her time a writer of conspicuous merit. Escaping an abusive husband and with the loss of two children behind her, she builds sequentially a number of relationships. There is a younger male friend called Devaux whom she refers to as ‘PanPan’. The author of the very professional and successful <italic>Lettres d’une Peruvienne</italic> (a princess who was also a letter-writer), her own letters are full of the fabric of life. I like her description of her early Sunday morning as she takes up her pen in her dressing gown: ‘Good day, my friend. After giving my heart to God and having a pee. I think of you and write to you’. She was frequently ill and in pain, had behind her a failed marriage, and had lost all her children young, but once separated from her abusive husband and having escaped dire financial straits, she took a young lover, Desmaret. His interest oscillated and she was very conscious of her fading charms ‘I am wrinkled, my eyes are all red … only the teeth are still the same … ’. When Desmaret defected she found Vallere and discovered orgasm for the first time – ‘senses my soul has never known before’ – at the age of 48. Her literary life took off in a modest way and when her lovers disappeared her finances were in better shape and her writing moved on apace. Illness dogged her closing years – swollen ears and cheeks, haemorrhoids, dizzy spells, rheumatism and cramps but she hung on gamely and was concerned to lead an active life to the end. Her story is not in any sense dramatic – nor are those of the other women in the collection – but they have real verve. All the women of the volume are conspicuously older than the men who interest them.</p>
<p>Some of the relationships are somewhat odd, such as the one based on a set of letters between the Marquise Du Deffand and Horace Walpole, author of the Gothic novel <italic>Castle of Otranto.</italic> They met in her Paris salon in 1766 when she was 69 and he was 38, a bibliophile and an antiquary. The relationship was a curious one. She was enamoured of him and he was interested in her intelligence and the society her salon provided, but he rebuffed what he feared to be her amorous advances and displays and returned to England. Another man, the Scot Robert Liston, 29 years her junior, replaced him in her affections. However, he did not seem to grasp her passion or share her belief that love should not be confined to a specific age. Her erotic letters to him admitted the madness of her sentiments but they also posed the question why not? It is, however, noteworthy that in most of the relationships outlined in the work the price of love is often suffering for the women.</p>
<p>The chapter entitled ‘Generations’ takes us to the experience of the hyper-intelligent Belle de la Charriere (1740–86) who lived in a remote part of Switzerland. She fell in love at 46 with a younger man, Benjamin Constant aged 19, who, though he expressed his love in tender terms, moved on in the way young men in unequal relationships inevitably do. Belle left 2500 letters, which must be something of a record. In the end she married her brother’s former tutor, sustained perhaps by the production of six or more novels, operas, plays and philosophical commentaries. However, illness and depression marked her entire life.</p>
<p>This collection has much to say about the construction of relationships in a particular society, at a particular time from a particular set of women’s viewpoints. The transitory is more apparent than the long term but there is an overarching concern by the women in the book, whatever their experiences, to explore and enrich their passions without fear or restraint by the facile pontifications of Enlightenment gurus.</p>
