<abstract>
<p>This article contributes to knowledge on how users establish the trustworthiness of digital information. An exploratory two-stage study was conducted with Master’s and undergraduate students in information studies. In the first phase of the study respondents commented on the factors and processes associated with trust formation. Participants commented on authorship and references, quality of writing and editing, and verification via links to external reference sources. Findings from the second phase, based on a checklist, suggested that participants relied on a range of factors when assessing the trustworthiness of articles, including content factors such as authorship, currency and usefulness together with context factors such as references, expert recommendation and triangulation with their own knowledge. These findings are discussed in the light of previous related research and recommendations for further research are offered.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>There is increasing evidence that in digital environments trust is both important and difficult to cultivate. Research in a variety of disciplines, including consumer behaviour and purchasing, online communities and social networking, information behaviour and knowledge sharing, provides evidence that trust is a precursor to successful and effective adoption, interaction and ongoing commitment in the digital space. Accordingly, there is a growing body of research regarding trust in digital environments. This research considers the role of trust, and its relationship with other variables, such as use, confidence, risk and user satisfaction. It also considers the indicators and associated factors that influence people in their judgements regarding whether they are prepared to trust a website, an online organization, a brand, a digital document or another person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165551513477820">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165551513477820">2</xref>]. This empirical research is complemented by a number of theoretical and conceptual articles, which propose definitions and models on digital trust and the related concept of credibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165551513477820">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165551513477820">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165551513477820">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165551513477820"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165551513477820">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Much of the previous research on digital trust has focussed on trust in online transactions (see the review by Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165551513477820">1</xref>], although there is some recognition that even in these contexts the credibility or trustworthiness of the information is important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165551513477820">7</xref>]. Information provision and access is a fundamental function of digital environments. In addition to the information provided by commercial web sites, such as those of banks and retailers, there is a plethora of other websites providing information. These include social networking sites (e.g. Mumsnet), news websites (e.g. BBC, CNN), government websites, commercial and public sector websites providing health information and digital documents, such as annual reports, research reports and other open source documents.</p>
<p>There is a longstanding acknowledgement of the challenges associated with the evaluation of Internet information. For example, Fritch and Cromwell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165551513477820">3</xref>] suggest that ‘Traditional measures of authority present in a print environment are lacking on the Internet, and even when occasionally present, are of questionable veracity’ (p. 499). Empirical evidence from Hertzum et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165551513477820">8</xref>] study of software engineers and users of e-commerce sites indicated that cues selected for trustworthiness of information are often ‘feeble’ or ‘surface’. More recently, Lim and Simon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165551513477820">9</xref>], in their study of student evaluation of Wikipedia articles, suggest that ‘Digital information allows people to be more self-sufficient; however, it ironically renders people more responsible for making information decisions’ (p. 1). This is because in the digital space quality control is more variable, the origin of the information less evident, and the range of sources more diverse. Accordingly, in a digital environment, users are faced with dilemmas as to which information to select or reject, trust or distrust. Information providers, and this includes every individual or organization that has a presence in the digital space, are generally interested to present and make available their information in a way that enhances its chance of being judged as trustworthy, and therefore preferred and used. However, empirical research on both the factors and indicators and the processes associated with trust formation is currently limited, and its coherence is undermined by definitional confusion, most significantly associated with the relationship between the concepts of trust and credibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165551513477820">4</xref>]. Further, most of the existing work on trust has been conducted in two contexts: student information use and searching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165551513477820">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165551513477820">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165551513477820">10</xref>] or the use of health advice and information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165551513477820">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165551513477820"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165551513477820">13</xref>]. There is evidence that trust formation may be different in these different contexts; parallel studies on web site trust in general suggest the drivers and role of online trust are context dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165551513477820">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165551513477820">15</xref>], so further research should take context into account.</p>
<p>The aim of this research is, then, to contribute to understanding of trust formation in respect of digital information. The objectives are to:</p>
<list id="list1-0165551513477820" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Seek to profile the relative importance of the different indicators and factors in the formation of trust judgements, in two different contexts, a student assignment and health advice.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Develop an understanding of the way in which those factors are applied by information users in judging a document as trustworthy.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>This paper first offers a literature review that summarizes previous research and theory on trust in the digital environment, and provides a rationale for this research. Next, the research design is outlined, including instrument design, data collection, respondents and data analysis. Findings are then reported in two sections, relating respectively to the profiling of the relative importance of factors in the formation of trust judgements and insights into application of those factors. Section 5, finally, reflects on the findings of this research relative to those of previous research, and offers suggestions for further research.</p>

<title>2.1. Definitions and theories of trust</title>
<p>Trust, which has traditionally been viewed as embedded in face-to-face, social and commercial relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165551513477820">4</xref>], presents a number of challenges in digital environments, where interactions can be viewed as de-personalized by technology. Furthermore, previous research has wrestled with, and failed to reach a consensus on, the definition of key terms and concepts. This is partly because previous writers and researchers have looked at trust from different perspectives, and have differed in the target for the trust; typical examples of targets might be websites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165551513477820">16</xref>], online transactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165551513477820">6</xref>] or information sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165551513477820">17</xref>]. Wang and Emurian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165551513477820">6</xref>] suggest that ‘researchers have difficulty in operationalising what trust is, and they disagree on even basic definitions’ (p. 108); they go on to suggest that trust is ‘often conceptualised by researchers according to the features of the particular context’ and that ‘it is often used interchangeably with related concepts such as credibility, reliability, or confidence’ (p. 108). The picture is further clouded by the fact that various authors have proposed different theoretical models of different types of trust. For example, Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165551513477820">1</xref>] propose a holistic framework of trust in online transactions, and suggest the following types of trust: identification-based, knowledge-based, calculative, institutional, cognition-based and dispositional trust. Kelton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165551513477820">4</xref>], in a comprehensive review of trust in digital information, discuss a model of levels of trust that includes individual, interpersonal, relational and societal, and then go on to propose an integrated model of trust in information. They suggest that information quality criteria, such as accuracy, currency, coverage and believability, are important in influencing judgements of trust. Similarly, Stvilia et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165551513477820">18</xref>] propose an accuracy construct that embeds criteria relating to accuracy, credibility and reliability, and argue that trust and credibility are used to assess information quality (IQ), and Yaari et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165551513477820">19</xref>] implicitly assume a relationship between IQ and trust and credibility, as they draw extensively on this literature to inform their study of IQ assessment. However, much of the mainstream trust and credibility literature makes no reference to information quality. This could be because IQ is difficult to define beyond its general definition in terms of ‘fitness for use’ on account of its context sensitive nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165551513477820">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0165551513477820">20</xref>]. Returning to the theoretical models of trust and credibility, many are complex and would be difficult to test empirically, and are unlikely to reflect the way in which users talk about trust. Finally, the association made between trust and ‘readiness to act on’ by Harris et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165551513477820">11</xref>] and ‘intention to use’ by Kelton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165551513477820">4</xref>] are also important contributions to understanding the essence of trust.</p>
<p>In the context of digital information, one of the most challenging theoretical issues is the confusion between the concepts of trust and credibility. As Tseng and Fogg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165551513477820">21</xref>] suggest, some use them interchangeably [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165551513477820">10</xref>], and do not necessarily define either trust or credibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165551513477820">13</xref>]. Indeed, Hargittai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165551513477820">22</xref>], an otherwise important contribution to the field, refers to ‘trust online’ in its title and then proceeds in the abstract to use the term ‘credibility’. Other researchers show trust or trustworthiness as an element of credibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0165551513477820">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0165551513477820">24</xref>], whereas yet others view digital trust as a complex construct that includes credibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165551513477820">15</xref>]. Finally, Stvilla, Mon, and Yi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165551513477820">18</xref>], back ‘both horses’ and include both credibility and trustworthiness in their study of information quality dimensions for online health information. Tseng and Fogg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165551513477820">21</xref>] recognized this dilemma, and proposed the following distinction:<disp-quote>
<p>Trust indicates a positive belief about the perceived reliability of, dependability of, and confidence in a person, object or process. Credibility is synonymous with believability. (Based on p. 41)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, Kelton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165551513477820">4</xref>] dispute Tseng and Fogg’s definitions of trust and credibility, and argue that their definition of trust is too narrow – they claim that the relationship between trust and credibility is an open area for further research, and generally propose that there is need for more in-depth exploration of the components of the trust concept. While we agree with this, such that enhanced understanding of the trust concept is the purpose of this article, a working definition of trust in digital information is useful, so we propose the following, as a basis for this study:<disp-quote>
<p>Trust in digital information indicates a positive and verifiable belief about the perceived reliability of a digital information source, leading to an intention to use.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, we take the stance that trust, and not credibility, is the focus of this study, but that, in understanding the prior research on the factors that variously influence trust formation, there is much to be learnt from the previous research that focuses on judgements of the credibility of digital information.</p>

<title>2.2. Previous research on the factors affecting trust and credibility in digital information</title>
<p>Previous empirical research on trust and credibility and digital information can be divided into two broad groups on the basis of their sample population and the type of digital information under consideration:</p>
<list id="list2-0165551513477820" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Those studies using an adult population, and studying health websites and related information. In this article we focus on those that concentrate on digital information, and the factors that influence it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165551513477820">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165551513477820">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165551513477820">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165551513477820">25</xref>]. There are other studies on health information, but they variously focus on characteristics of websites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0165551513477820">26</xref>], or on more general aspects of the credibility of health information on the web [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0165551513477820">27</xref>].</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Those studies focussing on student behaviour in relation to web content, in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165551513477820">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165551513477820">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165551513477820">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0165551513477820">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0165551513477820">28</xref>], or with specific reference to Wikipedia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165551513477820">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165551513477820">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0165551513477820">30</xref>]. Further studies pertaining to people’s use of Wikipedia with a general perspective on credibility and trust are reviewed in Francke and Sundin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0165551513477820">31</xref>].</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>An exception to the above categorization is the study by Lucassen and Schraagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0165551513477820">32</xref>], which proposes and tests the 3-S model of information trust. This model suggests that trust formation is influenced by information characteristics and user characteristics (domain expertise, information skills and source experience). Their study suggests that these characteristics lead to different features of the information being used in trust judgements in different contexts, and by different users.</p>
<p>Turning to the first category above, the study by Fogg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165551513477820">16</xref>] investigates how users evaluate the credibility of web sites in 10 categories, including e-commerce, finance, search and health. Despite being a large study with over 2500 participants, this was a qualitative study in which users’ comments were analysed to identify the themes that occurred most frequently in connection with credibility judgements. Top of the list were design look, information design/structure and information focus. Nine factors were mentioned by 10% or more of the population. Sillence et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165551513477820">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165551513477820">13</xref>] have conducted a programme of research into the factors that affect trust into the information provided on health websites. Sillence et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165551513477820">12</xref>] use a 24-item scale to measure trust, and by comparing data from 2000 and 2005 demonstrate that the situation is dynamic and changes as more sources become available and as users gain experience. In 2005, the top five trust markers were that: the site was easy to use, the advice came from a knowledgeable source, the advice appeared to be prepared by an expert, the advice appeared to be impartial and independent, and the reasoning behind the advice was explained to me. In another study, Sillence et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165551513477820">13</xref>] investigate through a small diary study how patients evaluate and make use of online health information. They suggest that the factors contributing to the selection and trust of web sites can be divided into design factors (clear layout, good navigation aids, interactive features), and content factors (e.g informative content, unbiased information, clear, simple language). Another interesting aspect of this study is the focus on trust forming as a process, and the ‘habit-forming’ that leads to a longer term trusting relationship. Finally, Ye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165551513477820">25</xref>] explores the extent of correlation of consumer trust in online health information with income, education, health status, engagement in social network sites, ease of location of information, understandability and trust in health information through other media (doctors, family and friends, print media).</p>
<p>The second main group of studies focuses on student or young people’s use of web content, or specifically of Wikipedia. Walraven et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165551513477820">2</xref>] is a wider study that examines, on the basis of a think-aloud study, how secondary school students evaluate information and sources when searching the web for information. It does not investigate trust formation as such, but is included here because it generates a ranked list of factors that students use in the evaluation of information. These are grouped into usability (language, connection to task, audience, topicality, amount); verfiability (author, references, information agrees with more sites, information agrees with prior knowledge, organization); and reliability (kind of information, objectivity, primary/secondary, goal). They also offer a separate list of factors for evaluating the source, with sub-groups of technical, usability, verifiability and reliability. Hargittai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165551513477820">22</xref>], on the basis of a large study of first year undergraduate students, suggest that the following factors are the most important in credibility assessment: identifiability of information, currency, other sources for validation, whether fact or opinions are presented, authorship and linking sites. Iding et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0165551513477820">28</xref>] explore students’ views on the factors that affect their judgements regarding the credibility of information on web sites. Participants associate credibility with information focus or relevance, educational focus and name recognition; they recognize that information might be wrong on the basis of corroboration with other web sites, own expertise, information focus, information design and bias. Pickard et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0165551513477820">29</xref>] conducted a small questionnaire-based study, supplemented by a round table event, to investigate amongst other things, the internal and external cues that influenced trust or credibility. Finally, Rieh and Hilligoss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165551513477820">10</xref>], examined college students’ credibility judgement in the information-seeking process using an interview-based study. They found that, although not all participants were confident in their evaluations, they nevertheless undertook evaluation, based on their current knowledge on the topic, quality control mechanism (refereeing, editing) and verification (through using multiple sources and co-referencing). However, credibility judgements depended on the criticality of the information need, and on convenience, and users may compromise credibility for convenience.</p>
<p>A few recent studies have examined credibility or judgements, specifically in the context of Wikipedia. Menchen-Trevino and Hargittai [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165551513477820">17</xref>] use task observation interviews to examine the use of Wikipedia in the context of respondents’ regular information seeking habits; they report on respondents’ knowledge of Wikipedia as a source, and offer some comments on credibility judgements, and conclude that students do use Wikipedia for their assignments. Some said that they would verify the information by checking articles, but in practice only a few did. Lim and Simon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165551513477820">9</xref>] also investigate credibility behaviours of college students using Wikipedia, and found that the peripheral cues used differed according to genre (topic). In addition, when they were uncertain about the believability of an article, they were most likely to scan the article length, the list of contents, references, warning messages and external links. Two studies have explored the relationship between the stage of study of students, and their trust judgements concerning articles in Wikipedia. Muilwijk et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0165551513477820">33</xref>] use a think-aloud experimental study to explore the difference in the information features that three groups of students attended to when making trust judgements. High school students frequently mentioned accuracy, whereas college students and PhD students predominately attended to authority; strategies for all groups were dependent on their familiarity with the topic. Traphagan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0165551513477820">34</xref>] also use Wikipedia with two different groups of undergraduate students, and find that engaging students in tasks including drafting Wikipedia entries changes their perceptions of the use of web-based resources. There are also a few related studies that investigate how users evaluate the information quality of Wikipedia articles. Yaari et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165551513477820">19</xref>] offer a summary of such articles and report on their recent study which shows that some of the factors that emerge in studies of trust in relation to Wikipedia also surface in studies of information quality. This review demonstrates that information quality is a concept related to, but distinct from, trust and credibility. Nevertheless, some of the criteria that the participants in Yaari et al.’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165551513477820">19</xref>] study identified in the context of judgements regarding information quality often surface in studies on trust and credibility. For example, the following criteria were frequently cited by participants in their study: coverage, length structure, writing style, number and relevance of internal links, and number and quality of external links. Finally, Fallis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0165551513477820">35</xref>] and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0165551513477820">36</xref>] note that, while there are concerns regarding the reliability of Wikipedia, people will acquire knowledge and strategically use the information. Lim’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0165551513477820">30</xref>] study on perceptions of Wikipedia’s information finds that around a third of the students use Wikipedia in their studies, reportedly for checking facts and finding background information. A number of factors, including past experience and disposition to information, were explored and the findings indicate information utility as a core factor related to outcome expectations and use of the information.</p>

<sec id="section6-0165551513477820">
<title>3.1. Study context</title>
<p>The aim of this research is to contribute to understanding of trust formation in respect of digital information. More specifically, we have chosen to centre our research on the open source encyclopaedia Wikipedia, for three reasons:</p>
<list id="list3-0165551513477820" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Wikipedia is ranked as the sixth most popular website in the world (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites">www.alexa.com/topsites</ext-link>) and is found in top positions in search engines result listings.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>There is a growing body of research on the use of Wikipedia, fuelled primarily by doubts as to the trustworthiness of Wikipedia and other open source documents; hence this seems a rich context in which to explore the formation of digital trust.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>We felt that a critical incident approach would yield the most insightful responses regarding trust formation, and therefore we sought a source and a document that our potential sample of students would all be equally familiar with. Wikipedia was suitable for this purpose.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0165551513477820">
<title>3.2. Research design</title>
<p>This exploratory research adopts a research design that includes both inductive and deductive elements. This approach was adopted in order to capitalize on both previous research on trust in other digital contexts and theoretical models on trust in digital information, which offer insights into the possible factors in the formation of trust judgements, while also listening to participants. A four-part data collection instrument was used to survey the views of a convenience sample of undergraduate and Master’s students on the development of their notions of trustworthiness.</p>
<p>The four main sections in the data collection instrument were:</p>
<list id="list4-0165551513477820" list-type="alpha-upper">
<list-item>
<p>Formulating notions of trustworthiness – an open question in which participants were invited to examine an article from Wikipedia, and write a paragraph on how they would judge whether the article was trustworthy.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Your profile – participants were asked to provide the level of the course that they were enlisted on, their subject of study, their age and their gender.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Judging trustworthiness in the context of an assignment – participants were asked to indicate the relative importance of a range of factors in influencing whether they would use and cite a relevant Wikipedia article in their assignment.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Judging trustworthiness in the context of medical or health information – participants were asked to indicate the relative importance of a range of factors in influencing the level of trustworthiness that they would accord a Wikipedia article on a minor health complaint from which they were suffering.</p>

Students are recognized to have varying abilities in their evaluation of information sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165551513477820">2</xref>]. Also, as well as the convenience of ready access to a group of participants, using this group enhanced the comparability of our findings with previous research. We were, however, careful to include both undergraduate and postgraduate students in the study. Postgraduate students (including those studying both full and part time) typically not only have greater experience of study, but also more life experience than undergraduate students. In addition, undergraduate respondents are mostly male, while Master’s participants are predominantly female. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0165551513477820">Table 2</xref> summarizes the profile of participants.</p>

<title>3.4. Process</title>
<p>Data collection instruments were distributed to students in a class setting. Most students in the class were willing to participate in the research. After a very brief introduction, the first page of the instrument (sections A and B) was distributed, together with a copy of a two-page Wikipedia article on Generation Z, a topic with which students were expected to have some familiarity. They were given 20 minutes to look at the article, and to respond to the open question in Section A. When participants had completed sections A and B, these were collected and the second part of the instrument, with sections C and D was distributed, completed, and collected. The two-stage distribution was important to ensure that the statements in sections C and D did not influence responses to section A.</p>

The responses were scanned for factors or indicators mentioned by participants, and a list of themes was generated.

First, it is useful to consider the response to the question on how likely they are to use an article from Wikipedia for an assignment or for health information. Responses are very low, leading to the conclusion that the remainder of the responses on specific factors have been given in a context in which there is a low pre-disposition to use, possibly suggesting a propensity to distrust, grounded on debates and comments on the trustworthiness of Wikipedia.</p>

<p>Turning specifically to the factors, most of the indicators or factors have values that are above the mid-point of the scale, 4, which suggests that trust judgements involve a range of factors that are applied to varying extents by different people. Selecting those factors with a rating of 5 or more on the importance scale, the following factors emerge as the most important: authorship, currency, references, expert recommendation and triangulation/verification, with usefulness just below this threshold. In other words, participants valued having articles that were written by experts on the subject, that were up to date, and that they perceived to be useful (content factors). They were also influenced by the extent of references or links to related articles, whether the information was consistent with information that they found elsewhere, and expert recommendations from teachers or health professionals (context factors). Interestingly these factors all seemed more or less equally important for both contexts, with the exception of references, which for predictable reasons were seen as having greater importance in the context of assignments. However, in respect of some of the slightly lower ranking factors, responses do vary between contexts:</p>
<list id="list5-0165551513477820" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>The interest level of the article content, the fact that Wikipedia is free to access, the fact that Wikipedia is a well-known brand and the structure of the article were more important in an assignment.</p>

<p>One of the unique features of Wikipedia articles is that, since Wikipedia is an open source document, authorship is open, and there is no information on the authorship, so users have to find substitutes.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section15-0165551513477820">
<title>4.2.2. References</title>
<p>The presence of references to indicate the evidence base for the article was an indicator mentioned by the majority of respondents. Some (15) simply mentioned the value of references:<disp-quote>
<p>The article provides readers with references and links to related articles … so that they can expand their research.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>
<?h -4?>However, others elaborated further. For example, one participant had very strong views on the role of references and what constituted trustworthy references:<disp-quote>
<p>I would judge an article to be trustworthy based on the references cited. Trustworthy references are those from academic texts (books, journals), from credible organisations that carry out reputable studies and reputable news organisations i.e. New York Times. The references have to be current … I would not trust an article on Wikipedia and I would use other sources (journals, books) to find information on a topic. The experience of the author indicates their knowledge on the topic and whether it will be relevant e.g. if they are an expert on the subject.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>
<?h -4?>Others referred to the transference of trust from the referenced sources to the Wikipedia article:<disp-quote>
<p>I would assess the trustworthiness of this article by looking at the references the author has used. If these are reliable sources I would expect the page to be more trustworthy.</p>
<p>The problem with Wikipedia is that others can add, delete or change information … so it may not be trustworthy if you don’t know where a certain piece of information in the article has come from.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>
<?h -4?>Some (8) mentioned that they would check the references and other sources in order to evaluate the Wikipedia article:<disp-quote>
<p>I would also cross reference with other sources to check the information is correct.</p>
<p>I am not sure if my own conceptions of Wikipedia are colouring whether I would trust it or not (although I would be happy to trust it as a starting point, and to use their references and to direct to the sources myself).</p>
<p>I would usually verify what I read on Wikipedia against other sources.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Others talked about the number of references (2) and their quality (3) or credibility (1), in terms of the sources or their currency (1).</p>
<p>While participants were agreed as to the importance of references, there was a much lower level of consensus as to whether the sources of the references in the example article had a positive or negative impact on the article’s trustworthiness. Some (7) suggested that too many of the references were to newspapers, and that therefore they were opinion pieces:<disp-quote>
<p>Most of the citations are from newspapers and Internet news sites which confirms my view that this article is more opinion than research based.</p>
<p>The vast majority of sources cited are from ‘news’ articles from newspapers/online media. Generally these articles are not based on research but are ‘opinion’ pieces’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Or to express this a different way:<disp-quote>
<p>The citations are not from academic sources.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Others (5) saw the same sources as adding to trustworthiness:<disp-quote>
<p>The article has a list of references, although many are from the same or similar source (New York Times and other news sources). These generally seem to be well regarded source, adding to trustworthiness.</p>
<p>Many of the references shown are for articles appearing in the New York Times which generally has a good reputation for trustworthiness.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>
<?h -4?>One participant was more ambivalent:<disp-quote>
<p>Although one may trust a few articles from Time Magazine and the New York Times, it would not be advisable to trust an article that relied solely on these types of publications.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>
<?h -4?>While others (3) made more general or vague statements, such as:<disp-quote>
<p>the reference list suggests the sources are credible, such as the New York Times.</p>
<p>If the links seem valid then I would normally trust the article.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some participants (4) differentiated between those parts of the article that were well-referenced and those that were less well-referenced, thereby indicating that they would trust some of the article, but not necessarily all of it. For example, one participant commented:<disp-quote>
<p>In the beginning the article seemed trustworthy due to the number of references and how they were used within the article … By the end of the article, though, a lot of claims and information aren’t based on any references and may have no base at all.</p>
<p>Parts of this article are well-referenced, although looking at all the sources would give a better indication … the final paragraph is opinion-based as does not contain references; this would not be trustworthy.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Two participants suggested that they were less interested in the content of the article, than they were in the reference list. One suggested that they used Wikipedia to locate other sources, rather than for the content of the articles:<disp-quote>
<p>I normally do not reference directly from the Wikipage but from the sources instead.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>
<?h -4?>while the other indicated that they would use the reference list for further reading, and ‘back this up with more academic reading’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0165551513477820">
<title>4.2.3. ‘Citation needed’ statements</title>
<p>Complementing their concern with references, a number of participants commented on the ‘citations needed’ statements that Wikipedia inserts in order to invite further contributions to support the content of articles. Quite a few participants (15) simply commented on the negative effect of these statements on trustworthiness. Others elaborated further:<disp-quote>
<p>I would also look at the ‘citation needed’ as if an article has many of these I would think that the author hasn’t properly researched the topic.</p>
<p>there are several ‘citations needed’ entries. This makes me question its trustworthiness and encourages me to think of it as opinion rather than research based.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0165551513477820">
<title>4.2.4. Structure/style/quality of writing</title>
<p>Several participants (13) commented on the importance of the quality of the writing of the article, but did so in a variety of different ways. Some commented on the readability of the article, for example:<disp-quote>
<p>The document was very easy to read which made it more trustworthy.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>
<?h -4?>Others (3) talked positively about the style:<disp-quote>
<p>The style that the article has seems of good quality, and thus trustworthy.</p>
<p>text flow, information talked about logically.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>
<?h -4?>Or, the language use and sentence construction (1). One participant suggested that:<disp-quote>
<p>I wouldn’t wholly trust it because it seems to jump around a lot.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another commented on the length of sentences, the concepts mentioned in the article (globalization and postmodernism), and the contextualization of Generation Z with reference to other current events and four others commented on the use of lists. One participant suggests that the use of lists ‘does not reflect an analytical process’ regarding the inclusion and structuring of content, while another suggests that the lists in this article are ‘not constructed properly for academic writing’.</p>
<p>A few participants (3) were concerned about the extent to which the article made generalizations:<disp-quote>
<p>It makes massive generalisations about people without any evidence to back this up.</p>
<p>There are several broad sweeping generalisations and comments within the text which do not appear to be backed up with references, so the trustworthiness of those comments may be called into question.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0165551513477820">
<title>4.2.5. Grammar/proofreading</title>
<p>Several participants (5) commented on the impact of grammar and spelling and proofreading on their judgements of the trustworthiness of the source. Some participants commented that they viewed grammatical errors and spelling mistakes as reducing the trustworthiness of the article:<disp-quote>
<p>bad grammar would make me think the content of the article was less trustworthy.</p>
<p>I would judge the writing, looking at whether it is formal and grammatical in order to judge the written attention to detail.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>
<?h -4?>Others commented, either negatively or positively, on the spelling and grammar in this particular article:<disp-quote>
<p>Spelling and grammar – seems fairly good, but some sentences seem to ramble and be unfocussed which would make me question accuracy.</p>
<p>There are no obvious spelling or grammatical errors, suggesting that a reasonably erudite person or persons authored the piece.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>
<?h -4?>One participant gave their ideal:<disp-quote>
<p>Stylistically, a trustworthy article would be grammatically correct, have concise paragraphs and sentences, and contain academic citations.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0165551513477820">
<title>4.2.6. Authorship</title>
<p>A number of participants (7) commented on the authorship of the articles. Some specifically indicated their awareness that Wikipedia was open source:<disp-quote>
<p>Wikipedia could have been edited by anyone.</p>
<p>As a student, I have been warned against the validity of articles on Wikipedia because anyone can edit or add information.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>
<?h -4?>One participant made the more positive observation that:<disp-quote>
<p>For basic factual opinion it’s more likely to be correct as a large number of people seeing an inaccuracy would be motivated to change it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>
<?h -4?>And another commented on the fact that the open source nature of Wikipedia would mean that some articles would be trustworthy and others would not:<disp-quote>
<p>Articles can be trustworthy as well as untrustworthy … because anyone can write and edit an article … so the readers can not be sure whether or not this article is trustworthy.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>
<?h -4?>Some participants who were possibly less aware of the nature of authorship in Wikipedia offered more subjective comments:<disp-quote>
<p>Sounds like the writer has some knowledge … on the topic.</p>
<p>The article lacks the names of academics for it to be considered trustworthy.</p>
<p>The article does not give any information on who the author is and where the article has been published.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0165551513477820">
<title>4.2.7. Tampering (or lack of editorial control)</title>
<p>The research article included a flippant remark. Several participants commented on this remark and its negative effect on the trustworthiness or credibility of the article. Further, it would appear that for some (13) this lack of editorial control overrides positive indicators of trustworthiness:<disp-quote>
<p>When I got to the point where the article stated that digital ‘hobbies of the generation’ include among others ‘writing articles on Wikipedia while on amphetamines’, then the article lost any credibility it had as far as I’m concerned and is not trustworthy.</p>
<p>started off as a valid entry … due to citations strengthening this … however came to the last paragraph and the whole document was marred by the insert of ‘writing articles on Wikipedia while on amphetamines’ … just feels that you can’t trust anything now.</p>
<p>There is one point which suggests that the article has been tampered with … this could suggest that other parts of the article are not perfectly factual and trustworthy.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<title>5. Discussion and conclusions</title>
<p>This two-stage study identifies the factors that students use in judging whether they might trust open source, Wikipedia articles, and offers insights into how these trust indicators are applied and used in the context of web information. We confirm the factors that influence trust assessment, and offer some analysis of the processes involved in the use of these and other factors in forming a trust judgement. Our study of trust in a research context that emulates ‘in situ’ reveals how these factors may be applied and in doing so highlights the importance of the ‘context of use’ in researching and understanding the essence of trust. The emerging insight into the formation of trust, in the context of digital (web) information, further provides an opportunity to consider the relationship between trust and this context of use and usage of digital information. With regard to this study and its findings, in this section we speculate on the significance of the findings and conclude with recommendations for further research in the area.</p>
<p>The first element of this study, which focuses on identifying factors used in trust formation, first and foremost suggests that students use a range of factors in keeping with various previous studies that have investigated trust or credibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165551513477820">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165551513477820">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165551513477820">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165551513477820">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0165551513477820">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0165551513477820">29</xref>], and related concepts such as information quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165551513477820">19</xref>]. Whether these factors should be regarded as antecedents of trust or dimensions of the trust concept remains to be resolved. The factors that students identify as being the most important are, in order of importance: the expertise of the author (also mentioned by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165551513477820">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165551513477820">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0165551513477820">29</xref>]; the appropriateness of the references (also mentioned by 9, 10, 17, 19, 29]; consistency with other information (also mentioned by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165551513477820">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0165551513477820">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0165551513477820">29</xref>]; whether the article was recommended to them by an expert; and, whether they perceived the article to be useful.</p>
<p>There is some alignment of the factors identified in this study and those discussed by other authors, but it is evident that there is also a high degree of variation between studies. Some might argue that this diversity arises from the different contexts of the studies, in relation to the respondents, the subject or genre and/or the purpose of the information search [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165551513477820">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165551513477820">10</xref>]. However, in this study, while there were some modest differences in ratings of factors between an assignment search, and a health information search, there was a high degree of consistency in the factors regarded as important in trust formation. Others have also suggested that variations in the relative importance of factors may arise from perceived criticality of information need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165551513477820">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165551513477820">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165551513477820">10</xref>], or from the fact that there is inconsistency between what respondents do and what they say they do. Lucassen and Schraagen’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0165551513477820">32</xref>] model suggests that this variability might be the result of user characteristics, such as source experience, domain expertise and information skills. On the basis of the existing knowledge base it is difficult to conclude whether the differences between studies arise from different information behaviours in different contexts or from the different theoretical and empirical stances adopted by different researchers. Only further resolution of the conceptual ambiguities in this area, and further empirical research, will generate more robust theory and understanding.</p>
<p>The second element of this research generates insights based on the open responses to an invitation to comment on how respondents would judge an article to be trustworthy. These comments on their information behaviour confirm that information users do seek trust indicators in order to assess the trustworthiness of information and, that alongside making other assessments on the information, such as usefulness, this involves an elaborate and adaptive process.</p>
<p>Thematic analysis identified the following as key themes, in the order of their frequency of occurrence: references, ‘citation needed’ statements, structure/style/quality of writing, authorship, grammar/proofreading and tampering (or lack of editorial control). Comparing this list with the most important factors in the first phase of the study, there is both consistency and disparity. This could be accounted for by inconsistencies of reporting which has been encountered by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165551513477820">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165551513477820">9</xref>], but it is more likely to arise from the differences in the task. When presented with an actual Wikipedia article, students had the opportunity to examine its content and were prompted to comment on factors that they use in trust judgements that they might otherwise have overlooked. In particular, they remembered the importance they accorded to the structure of the document, its style and the quality of writing; they also observed tampering, also mentioned by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165551513477820">17</xref>], and consistent with findings from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0165551513477820">39</xref>], and from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165551513477820">19</xref>] in the context of information quality, concerning the importance of evidence of editorial behaviour and the stability of the article. Tampering prompted them to remember that they expected a certain level of editorial control. This is consistent with Marsh and Dibben’s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0165551513477820">40</xref>] assertion that ‘the way information is presented often affects our perceptions of both the information and its credibility’ (p. 484), which is also corroborated by Robins et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0165551513477820">41</xref>]. However, the other key themes, authorship and references (coupled with ‘citations needed’) are corroborated by the first phase of this study and by various previous studies.</p>
<p>The second element of this research not only surfaces key factors, but also generates insights into how they are applied. References are clearly very important in validation per se (transference of trust), but also in the opportunity they offer to extend the search to identify other sources, which can corroborate the Wikipedia article. Indeed, they saw the ‘citations missing’ statement as having a negative effect on trustworthiness. Interestingly, however, while respondents appreciated references, they held different views as to the authority of the referenced sources. This, in turn had consequences for whether references to specific sources had a negative or positive effect on their perceptions of the trustworthiness of the Wikipedia article. Respondents also commented on the open nature of the authorship of Wikipedia, but they were unsure about the effect that this would have on the trustworthiness of the articles. The other main group of comments concerned the content of the article. Arguably, in the absence of declared authorship, respondents fell back on ‘whether the author could write’, or the quality of the writing, commenting on style, structure and the extent of ‘sweeping’ generalizations. They were also concerned about grammar and spelling, seeing proofreading oversights, and flippant and ‘inappropriate’ remarks as evidence of lack of editorial control.</p>
<p>The context in which our study was conducted, specifically on a single Wikipedia article has provided some insight into the formation of trust and on how the trust factors were used in this process. This insight gives us cause to reflect upon the impact that this context may have had on respondent’s formation of trust, or at least how they talked about their judgement of trustworthiness. Our study was conducted in a context of a source which respondents show a low disposition to use, which is consistent with the public view that Wikipedia is untrustworthy. However, we might expect, along with others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0165551513477820">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0165551513477820">35</xref>], that students may perceive an article in Wikipedia to be useful for gathering background information or some strategy other than direct use in their study. It is possible, then, that the trust indicators and the understanding we have gained of their use are moderated in some way by the respondents’ expected use of the information in a Wikipedia article.</p>
<p>In taking forward the notion of trust for research on the use of digital information others have indicated that an association is made between trust and ‘readiness to act on’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165551513477820">11</xref>] and ‘intention to use’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165551513477820">4</xref>]. Our respondents’ comments on the application of a range of trust factors indicates that this is an elaborate process involving interrelated activities of, for example, verifying and checking which we might expect to be moderated by the respondents’ anticipated use of the information. Furthermore, the enabling environment of digital information could be seen to influence the reported behaviour in trust formation. While our respondents indicated that they are likely to develop notions of reliable sources on the basis of authorship and recommendation, it was evident that, in contexts where this is not an option, verification procedures are and will be developed that are heavily biased towards comparison with other sources, as well as with prior knowledge. In the context of digital information, specifically in linked information environments, there is opportunity for user interaction with the information in this way, for example in the comparison between information sources, and thus in facilitating the active process of forming judgements of trust.</p>
<p>It is evident from our investigation that there is much more to be learnt about the process of trust formation and the associated processes that contribute to building confidence in and willingness to use or act on digital information, and the interaction between trust judgements and judgements of other facets of information quality. Our study also provides additional evidence that judgements of trust, and other precursors to information use, such as accuracy, relevance, usefulness and information quality, are at least to some extent context sensitive. Furthermore we need to learn more about how these judgement and evaluation processes are integrated into information behaviour in dynamic digital environments, with diverse document types, open or invisible authors, with their own agendas and expertises, and intriguing search opportunities as we seek substitutes for traditional indicators of trust and exploit alternatives offered in digital environment. While our study has confirmed trust indicators and provided further insight into their context of use, there remains much to be resolved and addressed in further study. There is scope for a considerable programme of further research in relation to the role of trust in information behaviour and the identification, selection and evaluation of digital information sources. As such we conclude this paper with the core avenues for further research which have arisen in the course of this preliminary investigation of trust formation in digital information.</p>
