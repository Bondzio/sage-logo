<abstract>
<p>Mutations causing metaphyseal chondrodysplasia type Schmid (MCDS) (e.g., <italic>Col10a1</italic>p.N617K) induce the pathology by a mechanism involving increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress triggering an unfolded protein response (UPR) in hypertrophic chondrocytes (Rajpar et al. 2009). Here we correlate the expression of mutant protein with the onset of the UPR and disease pathology (hypertrophic zone [HZ] expansion) in MCDS and <italic>ColXTg</italic><sup><italic>cog</italic></sup> mouse lines from E14.5 to E17.5. Embryos homozygous for the <italic>Col10a1</italic>p.N617K mutation displayed a delayed secretion of mutant collagen X accompanied by a UPR at E14.5, delayed ossification of the primary center at E15.5, and an expanded HZ at E17.5. Heterozygote embryos expressed mutant collagen X from E14.5 but exhibited no evidence of a UPR or an HZ expansion until after E17.5. Embryos positive for the ER stress-inducing <italic>ColXTg</italic><sup><italic>cog</italic></sup> allele expressed Tg<sup>cog</sup> at E14.5, but the onset of the UPR was not apparent until E15.5 in homozygous and E17.5 in hemizygous embryos. Only homozygous embryos exhibited an HZ expansion at E17.5. The differential onset of the UPR and pathology, dependent on mutation type and gene dosage, indicates that hypertrophic chondrocytes have a latent capacity to deal with ER stress, which must be exceeded to trigger the UPR and HZ expansion.</p>

<p>Long bones are formed by the process of endochondral ossification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022155412458436">Karsenty 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155412458436">Kronenberg 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022155412458436">Provot and Schipani 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022155412458436">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022155412458436">Mackie et al. 2008</xref>). Chondrocytes first form a cartilaginous template called the anlagen, and following vascular invasion and formation of the primary center of ossification, the chondrocytes become organized into highly structured growth plates. Within the growth plate, chondrocytes proliferate, align into columns, and adopt a flattened appearance. Next, these chondrocytes exit the cell cycle and undergo hypertrophy. The hypertrophic chondrocytes can be distinguished from other chondrocytes by their increased cell size and expression of collagen X—the only specific molecular marker of hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022155412458436">Schmid and Linsenmayer 1985</xref>). During terminal differentiation, the collagen X-rich matrix becomes mineralized, and the hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo apoptosis as the mineralized base of the growth plate is invaded by blood vessels. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-driven process of vascular invasion introduces osteoclasts that degrade the mineralized extracellular matrix (ECM) and osteoblast precursors that differentiate and replace the eroded collagen II- and collagen X-rich cartilage with collagen I-rich bone.</p>
<p>Differentiation across the growth plate is governed by a complex cascade of growth factors and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022155412458436">Karsenty 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155412458436">Karsenty et al. 2009</xref>). Longitudinal bone growth is dependent on the strict temporal regulation and control of chondrocyte differentiation, proliferation, hypertrophy, apoptosis, and vascular invasion within the growth plate. Disturbances to this coordinated process cause a large number of skeletal growth disorders.</p>
<p>More than 400 skeletal disorders have been classified, and several are the direct result of mutations in cartilage ECM genes critical to endochondral ossification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022155412458436">Newman and Wallis 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022155412458436">Warman et al. 2011</xref>). Although individually rare, collectively they are relatively common and cause a significant impact on the quality of life for patients suffering from skeletal abnormalities. For instance, mutations in collagen X cause metaphyseal chondrodysplasia type Schmid (MCDS), a relatively mild autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022155412458436">Warman et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022155412458436">Wallis et al. 1994</xref>). Collagen X is a homotrimer of three α1 (X) chains, each containing a 463–amino acid Gly-X-Y collagenous domain (COL1) flanked by a 38-residue N-terminal non-collagenous domain (NC2) and a 161-residue C-terminal non-collagenous domain (NC1). The majority of mutations found in collagen X cluster within the C-terminal NC1 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022155412458436">Bateman et al. 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Many experimental approaches have been adopted to try to elucidate the disease mechanisms responsible for the development of MCDS, and recent evidence has converged to reveal involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the resulting unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022155412458436">Mclaughlin et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022155412458436">Wilson et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022155412458436">Wilson et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022155412458436">Ho et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155412458436">Tsang et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412458436">Rajpar et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Briefly, the UPR is triggered by increasing levels of ER stress, which ultimately impairs ER function (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022155412458436">Malhotra and Kaufman 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155412458436">Ron and Walter 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022155412458436">Lin et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155412458436">Boot-Handford and Briggs 2010</xref>). ER stress can be caused by many different factors, physiological and pathological, and the UPR is a protective response evolved to restore homeostasis in terms of protein folding in the ER. The UPR is mediated through three ER resident transmembrane proteins that act as ER stress sensors: the basic leucine zipper pancreatic ER kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). Under stressed conditions (i.e., increasing concentrations of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen), activation of signaling cascades results in attenuation of protein translation reducing the load of nascent proteins arriving at the ER, upregulation of genes involved in ER-associated degradation (ERAD), and upregulation of chaperones, such as BiP (Grp 78). The upregulation of BiP has been used extensively as a key marker of the UPR to increases in ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022155412458436">Lee 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022155412458436">Samali et al. 2010</xref>). The UPR involves a set of protective measures aimed at alleviating the increased ER stress. However, if the UPR fails to restore protein homeostasis, apoptosis can be triggered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022155412458436">Tabas and Ron 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies on transgenic mouse models of MCDS have produced significant advances in our understanding of the disease pathogenesis. In a transgenic mouse line expressing an MCDS-causing 13-base pair (bp) deletion in <italic>Col10a1</italic> (13del), the mutant collagen X protein was intracellularly retained and an ER stress response was elicited within hypertrophic chondrocytes, which subsequently led to altered chondrocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155412458436">Tsang et al. 2007</xref>). Similar results were also observed in a knock-in <italic>Col10a1</italic> p.N617K MCDS mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412458436">Rajpar et al. 2009</xref>) and in another transgenic mouse line bearing the mouse equivalent of a human MCDS p.P620fsX621 mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022155412458436">Ho et al. 2007</xref>). To functionally characterize the putative role of ER stress in the disease mechanism of MCDS, a transgenic mouse line was generated in which ER stress was targeted to hypertrophic chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412458436">Rajpar et al. 2009</xref>). In this <italic>ColXTg</italic><sup><italic>cog</italic></sup> mouse, expression of an ER stress-inducing protein (<italic>cog</italic> mutant form of thyroglobulin—Tg<sup>cog</sup>) was driven by the <italic>Col10a1</italic> promoter. Interestingly, the targeted stimulation of ER stress in hypertrophic chondrocytes was sufficient to replicate and closely “phenocopy” the MCDS phenotype independently of any <italic>Col10a1</italic> mutations, thereby illustrating the pivotal role played by increases in ER stress in the disease mechanism of MCDS.</p>
<p>In the <italic>Col10a1</italic> p.N617K and <italic>ColXTg</italic><sup><italic>cog</italic></sup> mouse models, a disease phenotype (expanded HZ of growth plate) was observed in newborn mice homozygous for the mutant allele, but the onset of the disease phenotype earlier in development has not been explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412458436">Rajpar et al. 2009</xref>). The objective of this study was to characterize, correlate, and ultimately compare the onset of mutant gene expression with the onset of the UPR and pathology in <italic>Col10a1</italic> p.N617K and <italic>ColXTg</italic><sup><italic>cog</italic></sup> mouse embryos. We demonstrate that the onset of the UPR and tissue pathology did not always correlate with the spatial and temporal expression of the ER stress-inducing mutant protein but was dependent on the nature of the mutant protein and the gene dosage. The results provide new insights into the capacity of mouse hypertrophic chondrocytes to tolerate threshold levels of ER stress that need to be exceeded to induce the UPR and the resulting pathology.</p>

<title>Generation and Genotyping of Mutant Mice</title>
<p>The generation and genotyping of the <italic>Col10a1</italic> p.N617K and <italic>ColXTg</italic><sup><italic>cog</italic></sup> mouse lines have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412458436">Rajpar et al. 2009</xref>). Briefly, the <italic>Col10a1</italic> p.N617K mouse line was generated via gene targeting technology, and mice carrying the <italic>Col10a1</italic> mutation were maintained on an SV129/C57Bl6 background. Genotyping was performed using primers GAT TTA TGG TGA GTT AGA GTC (forward) and GTG AGC ACT TCC TGT CAA GC (reverse) flanking the LoxP site. The <italic>ColXTg</italic><sup><italic>cog</italic></sup> mouse line was generated by pronuclear injection, and mice carrying the <italic>ColXTg</italic><sup><italic>cog</italic></sup> transgene were maintained on an FVB/N/C57Bl6 background.

<p>Timed matings of heterozygous mice were used to generate embryos at 14.5, 15.5, and 17.5 days of development. Pregnant female mice were sacrificed by carbon dioxide overdose, and embryos were immersed in ice-cold PBS followed by ice-cold fixative.</p>

<title>Histology and Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Embryonic samples were fixed overnight in RNase-free ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) or 95% ethanol/5% acetic acid. The samples were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol solutions, cleared twice in xylene, embedded in paraffin wax, and sectioned (5 µm). For hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, the slides were dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated, and H&amp;E stained using Varistain 24.4 automated stainer (Thermo Shandon, Waltham, MA). Slides were then dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol and then cleared in xylene; and mounted using a xylene-based mounting solution.</p>
<p>Immunohistochemistry was performed on 95% ethanol/5% acetic acid-fixed sections. Antigen unmasking for collagen X immunohistochemistry was carried out in 0.5 mg trypsin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)/ml of PBS for 4 min at room temperature followed by washes in PBS. Antigen unmasking for Tg<sup>cog</sup> and BiP immunohistochemistry was carried out in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) heated to &gt;85C for 10 min followed by washes in PBS. Quenching of endogenous peroxidase activity was carried out in 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 5 min. Tissue sections were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature and incubated with primary antibody at 4C overnight.</p>
<p>Primary antibodies used were collagen X (polyclonal rabbit anti–collagen X against recombinant mouse NC1 domain) diluted 1/500 in PBS containing 2% goat serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412458436">Rajpar et al. 2009</xref>), thyroglobulin, which was detected via its myc-tag using an anti-myc mouse monoclonal (cat. no. 05-724; Millipore, Billerica, MA) diluted 1/300 using a mouse-on-mouse (M.O.M.) immunodetection kit (BMK2202; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and BiP, which was detected using an anti-Grp 78 goat polyclonal (SC-1051; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1/300 in PBS containing 2% horse serum. Secondary antibodies used were biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (E0432; DakoCytomation Ltd., Carpinteria, CA) diluted 1/1000 in 2% goat serum, biotinylated anti-mouse IgG as provided with the M.O.M. immunodetection kit, and biotinylated horse anti-goat IgG (BA 9500; Vector Laboratories) diluted 1/1000 in 2% horse serum.</p>
<p>Sections were then incubated with ABC reagent (PK-6100; Vector Laboratories) for 30 min and developed using the Vector VIP kit (SK-4600; Vector Laboratories). Slides were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, then cleared in xylene and mounted using a xylene-based mounting solution. Negative control sections for immunohistochemistry were performed with the appropriate serum minus the primary antibody.

<p>The postnatal growth plate phenotypes of the <italic>Col10a1</italic> p.N617K and <italic>ColXTg</italic><sup><italic>cog</italic></sup> mouse lines were characterized previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412458436">Rajpar et al. 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412458436">Rajpar et al. (2009)</xref> and other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022155412458436">Ho et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155412458436">Tsang et al. 2007</xref>) revealed that the hypertrophic chondrocytes expressing mutant forms of collagen X experienced a profound UPR, a disrupted differentiation pattern including decreased expression of VEGF, and a decreased recruitment of osteoclasts to the VIF, causing an expansion of the hypertrophic zone. Changes in proliferation or apoptotic rates in affected growth plates played no part in the pathological expansion of the hypertrophic zone in any of the lines examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155412458436">Tsang et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412458436">Rajpar et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022155412458436">Cameron et al. 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the key pathological features of MCDS were replicated in vivo by directly triggering a UPR in hypertrophic chondrocytes through the targeted expression of Tg<sup>cog</sup>, demonstrating the central role of increased ER stress in the disease mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412458436">Rajpar et al. 2009</xref>). The current investigation was undertaken to characterize, correlate, and compare the onset of mutant gene expression, UPR, and pathology in the <italic>Col10a1</italic> p.N617K and <italic>ColXTg</italic><sup><italic>cog</italic></sup> mouse lines during embryonic development.</p>
<p>Collagen X expression was not detected at E13.5 (data not shown) but was apparent by E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412458436">Fig. 1B</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412458436">C</xref>), in agreement with previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155412458436">Tsang et al. 2007</xref>). In the <italic>Col10a1</italic> p.N617K m/m embryos, the expression of mutant collagen X at E14.5 had immediate effects in terms of altered spatial and temporal expression of mutant <italic>Col10a1</italic> mRNA and the induction of <italic>BiP</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412458436">Fig. 1</xref>). The “speckled” appearance of mutant <italic>Col10a1</italic> expression accompanied by a marked induction of <italic>BiP</italic> mRNA was apparent in E15.5 and E17.5 m/m embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155412458436">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412458436">3</xref> respectively), as previously described in 3-week-old m/m mice, and is indicative of a robust UPR and a disrupted pattern of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155412458436">Tsang et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412458436">Rajpar et al. 2009</xref>). We therefore examined when the first signs of disruption of ossification became apparent. The central diaphyses had ossified by E15.5 in wt/wt embryos, whereas in the m/m equivalents, the diaphyses remained hypertrophic cartilage based on collagen X mRNA expression and collagen X immunolocalization, with no signs of vascular invasion and primary center ossification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155412458436">Fig. 2</xref>). Indeed, this developmental delay in the E15.5 m/m embryos correlated with a lack of osteoclast invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155412458436">Fig. 4A</xref>), the invasion being required to form the primary center of ossification. It is of particular note that throughout this period of development, the wt/m embryos, which express half the level of the ER stress–inducing mutant collagen X compared with m/m littermates, showed no signs of either a UPR or disrupted differentiation in terms of collagen X and <italic>BiP</italic> mRNA expression, ossification of the diaphysis, and osteoclast recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412458436">Figs. 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155412458436"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412458436"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155412458436">4</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>13del</italic> transgenic model of MCDS has a more severe phenotype than the models described above but does not have a delay in formation of the primary center because the transgene’s relatively short <italic>Col10a1</italic> promoter only becomes active around E15, and so induction of the UPR is delayed until after primary center formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155412458436">Tsang et al. 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In the transgenic <italic>ColXTg</italic><sup><italic>cog</italic></sup> mouse, collagen X and the Tg<sup>cog</sup> expression were both evident at E14.5 in the HZ of the developing growth plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0022155412458436">Fig. 5B</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0022155412458436">C</xref>), demonstrating that the <italic>ColXTg</italic><sup><italic>cog</italic></sup> transgene, with its relatively long <italic>Col10a1</italic> promoter, recapitulated the expression of the endogenous <italic>Col10a1</italic> gene. However, the level of ER stress–inducing Tg<sup>cog</sup> expression at E14.5 was not sufficient to provoke a UPR in terms of the upregulation of <italic>BiP</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0022155412458436">Fig. 5D</xref>) in contrast to the m/m <italic>Col10a1</italic> p.N617K embryos described above. However, by E15.5, more than 24 hr after <italic>Tg</italic><sup><italic>cog</italic></sup> expression was instigated, <italic>BiP</italic> expression was upregulated in newly differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes but only in the mice that were homozygous for the transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0022155412458436">Fig. 6D</xref>). By E17.5, the HZ had expanded significantly in c/c growth plates and the +/c hypertrophic chondrocytes were beginning to upregulate <italic>BiP</italic> expression, although their growth plates were not significantly expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0022155412458436">Fig. 7</xref>). The delay in onset of the UPR in c/c embryos meant that the primary ossification process, starting around E15, was little affected. Collectively, these data emphasize that it is the induction of the UPR rather than the timing of the expression of the ER stress-inducing protein that is critical in determining the pathology in MCDS. In some cases, expression of the ER stress-inducing protein and triggering of the UPR are coincidental, but in other cases, expression of the protein can precede induction of a UPR by many hours to days.</p>
<p>The delayed onset of <italic>BiP</italic> mRNA upregulation, with respect to the expression of the ER stress-inducing protein in wt/m <italic>Col10a1</italic> mutant embryos and in both c/c and +/c <italic>Tg</italic><sup><italic>cog</italic></sup> embryos, supports the contention that hypertrophic chondrocytes have a finite capacity to deal with ER stress that must be exceeded before the UPR is triggered. There are several possible explanations for why the <italic>ColXTg</italic><sup><italic>cog</italic></sup> c/c embryos were delayed in comparison with the m/m <italic>Col10a1</italic> p.N617K embryos in terms of UPR activation. First, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412458436">Rajpar et al. 2009</xref>), the <italic>Tg</italic><sup><italic>cog</italic></sup> mRNA concentration in c/c mice was approximately one-third of the mRNA concentration of endogenous collagen X transcripts within hypertrophic chondrocytes, suggesting that the rate of Tg<sup>cog</sup> protein synthesis may be significantly lower than that of collagen X. Second, the level of ER stress caused by the misfolding of the two mutant proteins may differ significantly. This is clearly the case when comparing the consequences of expressing the <italic>Col10a1</italic> p.N617K mutation reported above with that of the <italic>Col10a1 13del</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155412458436">Tsang et al. 2007</xref>). As described above, the heterozygote wt/m mice did not exhibit <italic>BiP</italic> expression above that of the wt/wt controls at E17.5, although BiP expression is clearly elevated after birth in these animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412458436">Rajpar et al. 2009</xref>). In contrast, as soon as the <italic>13del</italic> allele was expressed in hemizygous E15.5 embryos, <italic>BiP</italic> expression became markedly upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155412458436">Tsang et al. 2007</xref>). Therefore, a tissue’s response to the expression of a mutant protein depends critically on two factors: first, the amount of mutant protein expressed and, second, the ER stress-inducing nature of the specific mutation, as different mutations within the same gene can have the potential to elicit different levels of stress as in the case of N617K and <italic>13del Col10a1</italic> mutations described above. Different mutations in the same protein will influence the nature of the misfolding, which will affect the cells’ ability to either refold it successfully or process it for degradation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, several analyses in addition to the current study have revealed different levels of UPR activation in <italic>Col10a1</italic> p.N617K and <italic>ColXTg</italic><sup><italic>cog</italic></sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412458436">Rajpar et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022155412458436">Cameron et al. 2011</xref>). For instance, activation of ATF6 and IRE1 pathways was reported in both mutants by biochemical and microarray analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412458436">Rajpar et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022155412458436">Cameron et al. 2011</xref>). However, increased phosphorylation of PERK-activated eIF2α was apparent only in <italic>Col10a1</italic> p.N617K mice, which, together with the microarray data, supports our conclusion that Tg<sup>cog</sup> elicits a milder ER stress and, consequently, a milder phenotype than <italic>Col10a1</italic> p.N617K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022155412458436">Cameron et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412458436">Rajpar et al. 2009</xref>). MCDS is a dominant disease in humans and usually has a relatively mild phenotype that is not apparent at birth but becomes evident as a child starts to walk. This correlates well with our findings in the <italic>Col10a1</italic> p.N617K and <italic>ColXTg</italic><sup><italic>cog</italic></sup> lines in which a mild growth plate phenotype and bone growth defects only become apparent in heterozygotes or hemizygotes, respectively, as maximum growth rates are achieved at around 3 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412458436">Rajpar et al. 2009</xref>). These data demonstrate for the first time that hypertrophic chondrocytes have a latent capacity to deal with increases in ER stress prior to eliciting the UPR and BiP upregulation. In the heterozygote MCDS mouse and, by implication, in human, the latent capacity of the hypertrophic chondrocyte to deal with ER stress appears only to be exceeded after birth as longitudinal bone growth accelerates. These data add further to our understanding of the importance of the ER and regulation of ER stress in chondrocytes. Recent studies describing the effects of knocking out ER stress-related factors, such as BBF2H7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022155412458436">Saito et al. 2009</xref>) and site-1 protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022155412458436">Patra et al. 2007</xref>), have reported the most severe effects on chondrogenesis. Chondrocytes clearly require a well-developed ER capable of processing and secreting the large quantities and variety of proteins required to assemble the abundant extracellular matrix of cartilage tissue. The data presented here illustrate that chondrocytes have a little “spare” capacity to cope with fluctuations in ER stress and that this spare capacity needs to be used up to trigger a UPR. As a consequence, variations in phenotypic severity in MCDS may arise in part because of the different levels of ER stress provoked by distinct mutations in collagen X coupled to genetic variations affecting the capacity of individuals to effectively deal with ER stress. Of particular hope in terms of disease therapy, strategies designed to reduce the level of ER stress through administration of chemical/pharmacological chaperones or by increasing the rate at which the unfolded protein is degraded (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022155412458436">Papp and Csermely 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022155412458436">Engin and Hotamisligil 2010</xref>) are likely to be of potential benefit in either preventing or limiting the pathological consequences in MCDS and other ER stress-related connective tissue disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155412458436">Boot-Handford and Briggs 2010</xref>).</p>
