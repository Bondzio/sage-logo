<p>It is well known that Deng Xiaoping made his first steps in his post– Cultural Revolution strategy during a time of a fierce controversy with Mao Zedong in 1975–1976. Recent analyses have introduced some new elements that afford us a better understanding of that biennium as a key passage in China after the Cultural Revolution. However, the most singular feature of the dispute between Mao and Deng, that is its theoretical-political content, remains unexplored or largely ignored. This article reviews some major issues at stake in that dispute, which was launched by a series of theoretical questions raised by Mao in December 1974. Deng’s project was markedly shaped by the nature and the development of that dispute, albeit through a symptomatic denegation of any value in Mao’s theses.</p>

<p>Although the present era of the Chinese state is generally dated from the late seventies, with the full affirmation of Deng Xiaoping’s leadership, it is well known that Deng—or, more precisely, the post–Cultural Revolution Deng, who is quite different from the pre-1966 Deng<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0097700412454528">1</xref></sup>—made his first moves in his strategy during a fierce controversy with Mao Zedong in 1975–1976. Recent analyses add some new elements that help us to understand better the importance of those two years as a key moment in China after the Cultural Revolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0097700412454528">Cheng and Xia, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0097700412454528">Teiwes and Sun, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0097700412454528">2</xref></sup> However, the most singular feature of the dispute between Mao and Deng, that is its theoretical-political content, remains unexplored or largely ignored.</p>
<p>The theoretical issues of the Chinese revolutionary era have rarely aroused any real interest in “Sinological” research either in the United States or in Europe and are generally considered, with few exceptions, simply “rhetoric” concealing the “power struggles” in a “totalitarian system.” This is especially the case with the Cultural Revolution. Chinese scholars nowadays are no less dismissive of those issues, albeit with some formal reverence paid to the value of the “ideological struggle.” The Cultural Revolution for most of them is nothing other than the result of Mao’s theoretically erroneous and politically catastrophic extremism, which was luckily redressed thanks to the correct line followed by a group of wise leaders, above all Deng Xiaoping, who finally led China back onto the right path of “modernization” after a decade of radical “disorder.”</p>
<p>In this article, I review the principal theoretical questions at stake during that biennium in China. In my opinion, studying political disputes is a necessary prerequisite for research into twentieth-century Chinese politics, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s. The main difficulty, however, does not arise from the “non-ideological” standpoint of many “Western Sinologists,” or from the vacuous “orthodoxy” of their Chinese counterparts. The most important problem is, rather, how to evaluate the impact of Chinese political events of the 1960s and 1970s on the political culture within which they arose.</p>
<p>In other words, I propose to take the “cultural” attribute in the syntagm “Cultural Revolution” literally and ask to which “culture” that “revolution” was addressed. We could say that the principal feature of the Cultural Revolution was the peculiar tension between political subjectivities and political culture, that is, between political ideas and the “political <italic>epistème</italic>.” The political disputes of the last two years of Maoism were, on the one hand, deeply embedded in a given “language of the situation,” as Alain Badiou would call it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0097700412454528">Badiou, 2001</xref>), that is to say all the actors spoke the political language of what at that time was called “Marxism-Leninism.” On the other hand, they also went beyond that language in unexpected directions, and exceeded its boundaries to such an extent that they radically destabilized the entire network of the basic cultural references of modern revolutionary politics.</p>
<p>The years 1975–1976 were a decisive biennium not only for the immediate success of Deng Xiaoping and his allies over the Maoists but also for Deng’s subsequent long-term strategy. Deng’s project was largely shaped by the nature and the development of that dispute. It was the “final battle” between great adversaries, who could not but maintain an element of mutual respect, despite their conflicting views on the most essential and urgent political options. They were both fully aware that their divergences concerned not only the destiny of China but also the global geopolitical relations in which China had been increasingly participating in the preceding few years. The most important point the protagonists shared was the idea that they had to face an epoch-making change. The Cultural Revolution had shaken an order that could no longer be restored as such: a change in the approach to the very nature and the role of the “socialist state” was unavoidable. In the mid-1970s, all the most important political leaders in China were aware that the events of the last ten years had closed an era. However, it was very uncertain which form a new era might take.</p>
<sec id="section1-0097700412454528">
<title>“Why Did Lenin Speak of the Dictatorship over the Bourgeoisie?”</title>
<p>The main question for Mao in 1975 was which political evaluation of the Cultural Revolution should inspire the decisions concerning this necessary change. In January 1975, during the Fourth National People’s Congress, when a new ministerial cabinet was established and a new constitution approved, a formally positive evaluation of the Cultural Revolution was given. Mao himself contributed to this constitution, to which he added the key point of the “freedom to strike.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0097700412454528">3</xref></sup> This was, we should note, an issue that would previously have been inconceivable in the classical doctrine of the socialist state. Being a state that had declared itself fully “representative” of the workers, the latter had no major reason to express any disagreement or dissatisfaction. In proposing to mention explicitly the “freedom to strike,” Mao pointed out how fanciful that earlier vision was because contradictions between the workers and the system of power in the factories were the norm, not only under capitalism but in the socialist state as well, and should therefore be fully “recognized.”</p>
<p>In any case, Mao considered neither the new constitution nor the formally positive evaluation of the Cultural Revolution expressed in the People’s Congress to be decisive in themselves. The crucial question, Mao felt, remained unsolved, because the basic political concepts for weighing up the achievements and failures of those events had been radically destabilized by the events themselves. In other words, what was needed was a solution to how that theoretical-political destabilization might be faced and how new concepts for evaluating the Cultural Revolution might be thought up. In fact, Mao’s initiative started in December 1974, precisely at the conclusion of the preparatory work for the Fourth National Congress and the new constitution. When a new version of the “supreme law” of the state was on the point of being passed, Mao launched a battery of theoretical questions, involving, as we shall soon see, the concepts of “rights” and “legal power.”</p>
<p>Mao’s opening move was apparently highly abstract: it was to propose a series of topics of “theoretical study” concerning nothing less than the “dictatorship of the proletariat,” that is to say the basic concept, the true <italic>Grundbegriff</italic>, of Marxist political culture. The problem was that not only did the events of the preceding decade belong to the political–cultural network that pivoted around the concept of the “dictatorship of the proletariat,” but also that they had created a radical theoretical impasse within that very conceptual network. How might the concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat be conceived after the Cultural Revolution? The latter was formally eulogized, even during the Fourth National Congress in January 1975, for having “strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat,” but what did that really mean? What sort of concrete achievements in the form and the function of the state had it introduced? In what sense could those events be conceptualized within the theoretical framework of a socialist state led by a “Communist party,” “representative” of the “proletariat,” and its “long-term alliance” with other “working classes”? What was the political content of that “special government” (which is, in Chinese, the name for “dictatorship” 专政) of one “class,” the “proletariat,” over another “class,” the “bourgeoisie”? The political value of all these concepts, even the very distinctiveness of the socialist form of state, Mao maintained, were unsolved key questions, obscure points that “had to be clarified.”</p>
<p>It is remarkable that of all Mao’s theoretical theses in late 1974 the initial one was merely a question, a question to which he gave no answer: “Why did Lenin say dictatorship over the bourgeoisie?” (列宁为什么说对资产阶级专政?)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0097700412454528">4</xref></sup> Mao’s question was not rhetorical but an appeal, to virtually anyone, for a theoretical reconsideration of a fundamental principle: “The whole country should be informed [of this question]” (要使全国知道). “This problem must be clarified” (这个问题要搞清), Mao warned, because “without such a clarification” (这个问题不搞清楚), a “probable revisionist transformation” would occur (就会变修正主义). Given the conditions of the time of both the Chinese state and the economy, Mao stated that it was “very easy to make capitalism” (搞资本主义很容易), with the added complication that the criteria for distinguishing capitalism and socialism had undergone a radical upset during the Cultural Revolution. In fact, for Mao those criteria had started to become uncertain much earlier, at least at the time of the ideological dispute with the Soviet Union in the second half of the 1950s. In 1956, the first official text by the Chinese communists that initiated the controversy with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) was an editorial in the <italic>People’s Daily</italic> titled “On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat,” to which Mao made important revisions and additions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0097700412454528">Mao, 1992 [1956]</xref>). Twenty years later, the political worth of that concept was for Mao an even more essential issue, something that had become “obscure” and thus needed to be fully reexamined from its very outset.</p>
<p>The question was undoubtedly considered by Mao to be intrinsically political, but not in terms of the legal form of the state. In raising this question Mao distanced himself from the Stalinist viewpoint according to which socialist legality was a radical alternative to the capitalist one, and definitely superior to it. The socialist form of the state was in Stalinism the only true and just legality, while that of the enemy “camp” was just a smokescreen for concealing the capitalist relationships of exploitation. Mao, on the contrary, considered that the socialist forms of “rights” (or “legal power” 法权, according to the lexicon used in this debate) were basically homogeneous to those of the capitalist forms. Far from suppressing “bourgeois rights” (资产阶级法权), the socialist state had inevitably to introject them as a major criterion in its operative system. In socialism, too, Mao argued, production remained essentially a “production of commodities” to be regulated by the law of “exchange at equal value.” The legal framework guaranteeing the operation of the “law of value,” or “bourgeois rights,” was shared both by the capitalist and the socialist forms of the state. On this plane, between capitalism and socialism “there are not many differences” (没有多少差别).</p>
<p>On this subject we should recall that the generalization of “exchange at equal value” is for Marx the basic condition of the “capitalist mode of production,” which plays a special role in the “bourgeois” social order. “Exchange at equal value” is, according to Marx, a fiction that obliterates the different conditions under which commodities are produced. The “equality” of the exchange of commodities, Marx wrote, constitutes a “fetish” (“The Fetishism of Commodities and the Secret Thereof” is the title of a famous chapter in <italic>Das Kapital</italic>), since it reflects on the “producers” an “image” of social relations that are totally abstracted from the social differences that structure the real fabric of sociality. It, therefore, exacerbates social inequalities, which are masked, and for this reason are harder to restrain, by the mere logic of the “exchange of commodities.”</p>
<p>The relationships between workers and capitalists are for Marx the most elaborate instance of the “ideological” role of the “commodity”: they are formally exchanges of equivalent commodities (“labor force”) for their “general equivalent” (money), but are in fact dominated by radically unequal relations between the owners of the means of production and the “owners” of their “labor force.” Only the fiction of the equality of each commodity with its general monetary equivalent, Marx argued, permits a social consensus on the real system of inequality in the “market” for labor force. Thus, according to the modern doxa, labor force is “equal” to any other “commodity,” through the “arcane” transubstantiation fulfilled by the “general equivalent.” Thus, everybody can be “recognized” as “owners” who go to the market taking their commodities to sell and buy; all men are equal in the face of the market or, rather, in the face of money, as we are constantly told.</p>
<p>The socialist state, Mao argued, had inevitably inherited this condition; therefore a mere change in the form of ownership would not be really decisive. Not only did “bourgeois rights” persist in the socialist state, he said, but it was also necessary to “protect” them. The production of “commodities” and their “exchange at equal value” were a major factor in economic development; hence their growth should be welcomed. As Zhang Chunqiao, one of the most important theoreticians in Mao’s group, wrote during that period: “We had always affirmed that our country, instead of having too many commodities, does not have them in abundance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0097700412454528">Zhang, 1975b</xref>: 11). On the other hand, as Marx had pointed out, “bourgeois rights” played the specific “ideological” role of the sole criterion of “equality,” therefore masking the real conditions of inequality and hindering policies for reducing them.</p>
<p>What was to be done? Mao’s solution in no way simplified matters: on the contrary, it made the theoretical framework more complicated. The persistence of bourgeois rights, he said, could not be suppressed, but “could only be limited” (只能加以限制) “under the dictatorship of the proletariat” (在无产阶级专政下). It should be noted that this formulation concerning bourgeois rights in the socialist state was totally new. The Marxist and Leninist doctrine of the state spoke of “overthrowing the bourgeois state,” “breaking the state machine,” even considering it as a “half-state.” However, the concept of “limiting” (限制), an essential function of the state (which was to protect bourgeois rights), was essentially extraneous to this conceptual framework, with the further complication that the instrument of this “limitation” was, for Mao, to be the very “dictatorship of the proletariat.” But, in 1975, was not the “dictatorship of the proletariat” precisely the obscurest point? It is clear that this conclusion led back to the original question.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0097700412454528">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mao’s argument could not avoid a paradox, and in fact it did not try to do so. The factor of the “limitation” of “bourgeois rights” should certainly be political, but the supremacy of “politics” in China at that time coincided with the most unstable concept of the entire web of theoretical references. How could the “dictatorship of the proletariat” restrict “bourgeois rights” if it was “unclear” why Lenin talked about a “dictatorship over the bourgeoisie”? Mao’s arguments began with an interrogative, which equated to a radical questioning of the theoretical worth of a basic concept, but ended up by using the same concept again in the same key place within the theoretical device. It is a sort of a peculiar “metaphysical” move, one might say, in the sense of the “dialectical metaphysics” theorized by Alain Badiou: the indetermination of an essential concept in an area of knowledge, in this case of the general framework of modern revolutionary political knowledge, as the starting point in a process of thought aiming at a new determination of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0097700412454528">Badiou, 2000</xref>). The issue of the “dictatorship of proletariat” had to be declared “obscure” as a necessary precondition so that it could “be clarified”: the political events of the preceding decade required a radical reopening of that basic theoretical concept.</p>

<title>The Impact of the Cultural Revolution on the <italic>Danwei</italic> (单位) System</title>
<p>To urge virtually everyone in China to “study” this problem (“All the country should be informed of it”) was indeed an arduous task and it involved a tangle of economic, political, and philosophical concepts. The “movement for the study of the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat” (according to its official name in the Chinese press in those days) initiated by the publication of Mao’s above-quoted theses in February 1975 was an effort to reconsider unsolved theoretical knots, and not a campaign for popularizing an established doctrine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0097700412454528">6</xref></sup> But which forces, even potential ones, could be mobilized to engage in political research at such a level of theoretical abstraction?</p>
<p>Although Mao’s urgent appeal was addressed to “everyone” without any further specification, there were some recipients that were arguably closer to Mao’s intent. Among them were a number of political experiments that had begun in Chinese factories in the late 1960s. Many factories were deeply involved in the campaign for the “study of the theory” in 1975. Not only were “study groups” of workers highly dedicated to Mao’s theoretical issues formed, but the question of what the “factory” should be in socialism itself became a crucial political topic in the dispute.</p>
<p>We must remember that the “socialist factory” had been a major epicenter in the political storms of the Cultural Revolution. As is well known, from the autumn of 1966, political activism among workers resulted in a general crisis in the whole system of power in Chinese factories. Eight years later, that crisis remained in most aspects unsolved, and finally revealed itself to be unsolvable within the cultural and institutional order of the pre-1966 Chinese state. The political and institutional impasse of the “socialist factory” in China and the different paths for finding a way out of it were the object of increasingly profound rifts in 1975.</p>
<p>The critical point of no return can be traced back to the 1967 “January Storm” in Shanghai, when the rise of independent workers’ organizations led to the collapse of the Municipal Committee of the largest Chinese industrial city. Those events not only made the divergences that had exploded in the preceding months inside the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership irreversible but also destroyed the principles with which those divergences had been corrected in the past. The “January Storm” was a crucial event in the transformation of the modern Chinese state, and the fact that one of the most important political events in the twentieth century is the very one to be least examined in historical research is a sign of its intrinsic difficulty. The Shanghai events not only jeopardized the overall stability of the Chinese party-state but also the entire political culture of the “dictatorship of the proletariat.” It was the collapse of a system of power, a kind of implosion, rather than the result of a violent attack, caused by events that could hardly be conceptualized within the canons of acquired political doctrines, and for which a suitable research perspective still has to be found. January 1967 could not simply be considered like any ordinary popular unrest, yet neither was it exactly a “seizure of power” (夺权) on the part of a “class,” even if the Chinese press initially presented it as such, on the part of “true proletarians” against the “new bourgeoisie.” That was not the core of the event. Nonetheless, the “January Storm” could not be considered a “counterrevolutionary” or “anticommunist” movement, since the participants on both sides believed themselves to be definitely more “red” than their opponents. With all these paradoxes, and above all the insurmountable difficulty of setting it within an acquired conceptual framework, the “January Storm” was a crucial moment that took place at the very beginning of the transformations in the contemporary Chinese state. In the following years, any effort at reorganization could not avoid dealing with the true, profound causes of that event. A pure and simple return to a previous situation was no longer possible.</p>
<p>From the late 1960s, the Maoists promoted a series of political experiments in a number of factories (both in Shanghai and in other industrialized areas, such as the regions in the northeast) aimed at finding a new path for the “socialist factory.” In 1966–1967, the emergence of independent workers’ organizations was the most challenging issue both for the factory order and for the overall socialist state order. The existence of these independent workers’ organizations posed a challenge to ideology and organization, and no one knew how to deal with it by applying “classical” socialist political doctrine because the workers’ organizations had broken a crucial link in the political and conceptual chain that connected the workers, the factories, and the state within socialism. The formula of the “classical” socialist doctrine can be summarized as the conceptual chain “worker–class–factory–party–state.” In other words, the relationship between the “worker” and the “factory” was politically and socially recognized (in the Hegelian sense of <italic>Anerkennen</italic>) through the concept of the “working class,” organized by a “party” that led a special form of “state,” which on its part fully recognized the political and social relationship between worker and factory. The circularity of the argument is evident but is also symptomatic of the structural instability of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>In fact, in the Marxist perspective, the relationship between worker and factory has no stable place in the social relationships of the age of “large capitalist industry.” It is, on the contrary, a sort of empty point in sociality. Far from occupying the “lowest” place in society, the worker–factory relationship is placed at the most precarious point in the social bond. The worker cannot be “linked” within any established “communitarian order,” which as such is but an obstacle to the very logic of the “large capitalistic industry” and to the concept of the “free market.” With respect to the factory, the worker is necessarily unlinked from any customary “community.” On the other hand, the worker belongs even less to a “factory community.” The latter is the most artificial and the most precarious community we can imagine: the purely anarchic requirements of capital are those that decide whether a certain “factory community” may exist or not. In short, labor force cannot have any social communitarian consistency. It must be “individualized” in order to circulate as just one of the various “commodities” that are equally interchangeable on the “market.” In Marx’s perspective, the link of the worker with the factory is not an ordinary social tie but can only be established through a special form of coercion, which Marx called “factory despotism.”</p>
<p>What did socialism promise? To overturn the situation completely and to attribute a special political worth to the figure of the worker and his or her relationship with the factory. If in capitalism the relationship between worker and factory is placed at an empty point in the social bond and is subject to the “unconditioned authority of the capitalist,” in socialism the worker could acquire the value of a political protagonist, and the worker–factory relationship could become the major factor in the consistency of the state. The conceptual chain of worker–factory–class–party–state therefore played a fully operative role at an organizational level. In China, for example, the organization of the “industrial danwei,” or the typical form of the socialist “state factory,” largely inherited from the Soviet system, was conceived as the embodiment of the “historical” conjunction between the “working class” and its “party-state.”</p>
<p>One could say that the immense task of twentieth-century socialism was to transform the worker–factory relationship, which in itself is devoid of any intrinsic sociality, into a fully social and political relationship. In order to do so, it created a special form of sociality, such as the industrial danwei in China and the Soviet Union’s <italic>kombinat</italic>, whose “link” was guaranteed by its inclusion in the organization of the state. On the other hand, the state itself was modeled on the need for the inclusion of the “socialist factory” in itself. It is significant, for example, that the industrial danwei had a peculiar institutional function: in China it was also a kind of organizational pattern for all the institutions belonging to the state. A hospital, a post office, or a university were all organized from the 1950s in the form of a danwei, or “work unit,” with administrative and organizational patterns similar to those of the industrial danwei and largely derived from it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0097700412454528">7</xref></sup> The danwei, a term that literally means “unit of account,” was in fact the “unit of account” for the “grip” of the Chinese state on society. Since 1949 the “danwei system” has been the paradigm of the institutional unification of the state.</p>
<p>On this point, the entanglement between “ideological and organizational” factors, to quote Franz Schurmann’s renowned formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0097700412454528">Schurmann, 1965</xref>), was particularly rigid. The danwei system was a specific organizational form founded on the highly elaborate conceptual network quoted above, which linked the “workers,” as a “class,” to the “factory,” through the leading role of the “party” in the “state.” Thus, the party fully “represented” the “class interests” of the “proletariat,” so that the very idea of workers’ organizations that could express their own political propositions outside the party was totally inconceivable. It was for this reason that the events in Shanghai in 1967 were so cataclysmic. As we have seen, even the “freedom to strike” was an issue that encountered doctrinal obstacles.</p>
<p>The socialist “factory order” was therefore a basic condition of the overall stability of the socialist state. But, in its turn, the factory order was conditioned by the fact that the political role of the worker should be fully internal to the party-state. Therefore, the emergence in 1966–1967 of new forms of political subjectivity among Chinese workers, with innumerable independent workers’ organizations that exceeded the framework of the party-state in the factories, created a serious instability. The subjective issues at stake could not be dealt with by means of the conceptual chain worker–factory–class–party–state, and at the same time could not but have a destabilizing effect on the “factory order.” The very concept of “working class” was questioned, resulting in a radical subjective and organizational crisis in the relationship between the “class” and the “party-state.” What could legitimate the Communist Party’s authority, as the leading apparatus of the socialist state machinery, if its “historical-political” connection with the “working class,” which was its major “social basis,” was challenged on the very terrain of political organization?</p>
<p>It is well known that the monopoly of the party-state as the sole legitimate site for politics had already been seriously challenged by the creation of the students’ independent organizations, the Red Guards, in the summer of 1966. The most decisive passage in the events was the rise of Red Guard organizations even among workers in the autumn. The strong opposition of the Shanghai authorities to the groups of “Revolutionary Rebel Workers” that had arisen outside the party had a doctrinal background and was even able for a moment to win the support of masses of loyalist workers. Groups of pro-municipality “Scarlet Guards,” for example, were organized in Shanghai against the Red Guard groups of rebel workers. There were maneuvers on the part of the authorities to support and to organize them directly, but the “Scarlet Guards” also represented, in the latter weeks of 1966, an element of subjective commitment to the figure of the “state worker.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0097700412454528">8</xref></sup> Their disbandment, following the collapse of the municipal authorities, then marked the point of no return in the political crisis of that figure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0097700412454528">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>As far as the magnitude of that political split, which involved millions of people on both sides, is concerned, sociologists have searched in vain for its “social” causes, such as age, status, wages, etc. Although the results are somewhat controversial, no one has succeeded in demonstrating that the “objective” conditions of various groups of participants were really different. A detailed examination of the biographies of the leaders of several organizations has shown that their “social background” was essentially the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0097700412454528">Perry and Li, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>However, notwithstanding all the social factors and the active role of the bureaucracies in supporting the “loyalists,” the political split was essentially subjective. The very concept of “working class” was in itself perturbed by a profound anxiety: how was one to be a “communist worker”? What relationships were to be established with the “factory,” with the “leadership of the party,” and even with opposing groups of the same “class”? These were the issues that nourished an unprecedented activism. The Municipal Committee in Shanghai collapsed because it was incapable of dealing with the new situation other than by measures that increased the confusion. During the most difficult time, the political and administrative leaders of the municipality distributed a bonus to placate the discontented: in return they gained the fierce indignation of the “revolutionary rebels,” who denounced this maneuver as “economistic,” aimed at buying their acquiescence. In the end, the Municipal Party Committee de facto abdicated its institutional functions.</p>
<p>Against this background, in the following months and years the process of the reorganization of the state and the experimentation with new political forms in factories were some of the most urgent and difficult tasks for the Maoists. The tortuous development of the Cultural Revolution remains inexplicable without taking into account these issues. If masses of workers declared such a strong determination to create self-organized forms of political activity, how was the socialist factory to be managed? The whole organization of the “industrial danwei” was shaped by the presupposed stability of a “working class” that was fully inscribed in the state machinery. The industrial danwei, as stated above, was a state institution, even an institutional pattern for the socialist state, and the worker was in some ways a petty “state official.”</p>
<p>The change that the political existence of workers’ organizations outside the party wrought in the established “ideological” relationships formerly linking the workers to the factory, as well as to the state and the party, inevitably produced destabilizing effects on all the “organizational” planes, from the most elementary relationships in the workshop to the implementation of the tasks assigned by the state plan. The very existence of a chain of command in the factory, the technical regulations, the production discipline, the job assignments, the peculiar forms of “wages” (only partly in money), and the sociality of the danwei itself became questions that could not be decided simply on the basis of the previous “socialist factory order.” In addition, the industrial danwei’s role as an institutional paradigm in the Chinese state machinery placed at the top of the “political agenda” the problem of how to deal with a profound institutional crisis that went beyond the issue of the organization of production.</p>
<p>All this prolonged the hitherto unresolved difficulties in creating what Wang Hui calls a “new order” in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0097700412454528">Wang, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0097700412454528">2004</xref>), which had originated in the particular nature of the “January Storm” in Shanghai. For the Maoists, a prerequisite for finding a new order was discovering how to remold the political role of the workers in the factories together with the entire state system. The rhetoric of the “marble man,” the “socialist labor hero,” the “model worker,” inspired by the Stakhanovism of the thirties in the USSR, was largely discredited by the events of 1966–1967, which revealed its disciplinary and anti-political nature. It was in fact used by the “loyalists” and by the Shanghai party authorities to quash the independent workers’ organizations. The canonical formula of the workers as “the masters of the state” remained empty propaganda if new forms of the relationship between worker and factory were not experimented with by going beyond the terms of the ordinary functioning of the “industrial danwei.”</p>

<title>Experiments in the Factories and the “Study of Theory”</title>
<p>In 1975, at least two kinds of experiments were active in several important Chinese factories: “workers’ universities” (工人大学) and “workers’ theoretical contingents” (工人理论队伍). The former were first established in Shanghai in 1968, and in 1973–1974 the scope of the experiment was extended to China’s other main cities. They were projects for the reform of industrial organization in order to reduce the hierarchies based on the technical division of labor by means of an interchange among the jobs on the different levels. The aim was that workers, through periods of study, should be able to master technical and management responsibilities, and technicians and managers should cooperate with them and regularly participate in periods of productive tasks.</p>
<p>The “workers’ theoretical contingents” were also organized in 1973, during the <italic>pi Lin pi Kong</italic> 批林批孔 movement, or the movement for the “criticism of Lin Biao and Confucius,” another moment rich in political and historical questions that merit being explored from new perspectives. These groups for “theoretical study” could coordinate part of their activities with their working duties. Though they were not detached from production, their organization was strongly debated since the very idea that the “study of theory” might be an activity inherent to the job of a worker was unprecedented, both in socialist and in capitalist organizations, not to mention in the present conditions of a wage-earning labor power.</p>
<p>The topics the “workers’ theoretical contingents” studied in 1973 were mainly historical and political. In this case, too, the groups were created during a theoretical movement that was not aimed at the mere transmission of a doctrine. The subject matters were some of the thorniest questions in Chinese history. One of the crucial topics in 1974 concerned the historical role of the struggle between the political visions of the “Legalists” and the “Confucians” (the two most incompatible schools of thought in all of China’s tradition) in shaping the imperial state system. Moreover, the “workers’ theoretical contingents” adopted the most controversial positions, that is a fully positive reevaluation of the rationalist role of Legalist thought, which for more than two thousand years the dominant Confucianism had portrayed as the personification of “evil.”</p>
<p>These two series of experiments, the “theoretical groups” and the “workers’ universities,” both aiming at a political reinvention of the factory, were the places where Mao and his group orientated many of their efforts to develop the “movement for the study of the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat” (hereafter referred to as the “movement for the study of the theory”). The study groups in the factories, the “workers’ theoretical contingents,” which had already started to gain experience in very entangled historical issues during the <italic>pi Lin pi Kong</italic> movement, were further developed to explore a set of highly abstract questions, such as those raised by Mao on the very nature of “the dictatorship of the proletariat.” Moreover, this made it possible for factories to become key sites in the discussion concerning the nature of the factory itself in socialism. The industrial danwei was placed as a key link in the conceptual device that had the “dictatorship of the proletariat” at its apex. The workers’ universities, for their part, were attempts to gain leverage over the improvement of workers’ technical capacities in order to curb the hierarchical structure of the division of labor. This was a question, as we shall see, that was soon related to that of how to “limit bourgeois rights.” All these experiments were seen by the Maoists as belonging to a set of socialist “new-born things” (新生事物) that arose during the Cultural Revolution, and for this reason were seen as even more suitable places for elaborating new political ideas.</p>
<p>Some theoretical “classical” references must be briefly cited here for the role they played in those years in Chinese political debates. Workers’ universities were a project rooted in Marx’s vision of the modern factory. “Large industry” was for Marx a singular historical phenomenon suspended between the most archaic forms of despotism and immense potentialities for liberation. The key issue was the division of labor: large industry put an end to the division of labor that was socially structured among the productive branches (the “social division” of labor typical of pre-capitalist forms), but introduced a more severe “technical division” concentrated in the factory itself, which separated mental and manual functions. In the “social division” each “producer” was annexed for a lifetime to a single specialized activity of which he or she mastered both the “mental” and the “manual” skills, but ignored almost all other specializations. <italic>Ne sutor ultra crepidam</italic>. In the “technical division,” on the other hand, all separation among the branches of production was removed, and nearly everybody could do almost every job, but every worker was also “expropriated of the mental power of the production.” In large industry the worker is “annexed” to machine systems, about which he or she knows only what is strictly necessary to his or her own particular job, a very tiny portion indeed of the technical and managerial system. The structure of the “technical division of labor,” having at its two extremes manual and mental labor, fashions in fact all the relationships within the factory. Above all, it establishes the rationale of the chain of command, since the “mental powers of production,” from which the workers are “expropriated,” are concentrated in the “unconditioned authority of the capitalist.” This organization is, however, largely determined by “ideological” factors (in the Marxist, not Schurmann’s, sense): in this case, too, a phenomenon of fetishism is at work. For Marx the “fetishism of technology” transmits back to the people the image of their mutual relationships as solely determined by technical relationships among machines, independently of any real personal and social difference. It is thus the fetishism of technology that plays a major ideological role in creating the social consensus concerning the hierarchical and disciplinary order in the modern factory.</p>
<p>These Marxist analyses of the structure and functions of the modern factory became widespread references in 1975 in China, quoted in hundreds of articles and essays. Subtle aspects of the “twofold nature of the commodity” were hotly discussed, and not without some literary taste, for example in an “Autobiography of the Commodity” published by the Maoist journal in Shanghai 学习与批判 (Study and Criticism). Its radical brother 北京大学学报 (Journal of Beijing University) was in 1975–1976 another major source of elaborate theoretical articles such as those analyzing the interchange between “double fetishism,” goods, and technology.</p>
<p>The fundamental point was that rather than solely concerning the capitalist system, Marxist references were seen, in mid-1970s China, as illuminating key features of the socialist factory itself. In the socialist system, the Maoists argued, crucial forms of the capitalist organization, including its “fetishes,” were still fully operative. Far from being the defenders of the intrinsic superiority of a “socialist order,” the Maoists were deeply concerned with the fact that socialism as such was, in some important respects, a direct continuity of the “capitalist order.” The question of how to experiment with new forms of politics in the factories after the crisis of 1966–1967 involved, therefore, two converging difficulties: not only did the political activism of the workers exceed the limitations of the party-state in the socialist factory, thus requiring new forms of political organization, but also the “technical” organization of the socialist factory should not be “fetishized,” and in key points it should be deeply transformed. The two planes were obviously interrelated because in the industrial danwei the technical and the political organizations were closely knitted, if not totally fused, together. Moreover, the “technical division of labor,” on which the chain of command pivoted, was basically homogeneous, the Maoists argued, to its capitalist counterpart, a perspective that radically departed from Stalin’s formulas in the 1930s, according to which “the technique decides everything, the cadres decide everything.”</p>
<p>The “movement for the study of the theory” was addressed in particular to the factories, not only because there were a number of “new socialist things” in them, such as the “workers’ universities” and the “theoretical groups,” that could play an active role in theoretical-political study, but also because in the end the questions concerned the destiny of the socialist factory itself. They also concerned, for the reasons discussed above, the fate of the socialist form of the state. The most urgent political options and, at the same time, the most abstract conceptualizations were at stake. Only through “theoretical study,” the Maoists believed, could those options be elucidated, and the factories were certainly considered by them as places where both the basic concepts and the operative methods required a thorough reconsideration.</p>
<p>The effects of this theoretical impulse on the existing political experiments were remarkable: the workers’ universities, for instance, were analyzed anew from the new theoretical perspective. The policies for reducing the technical and hierarchical gap between workers and management were therefore considered forms of “limitations of bourgeois rights.” The “workers’ theoretical contingents,” for their part, considered themselves vanguard organizations for reducing the gap between manual and intellectual labor on all social levels. In the Marxist theoretical tradition, the latter was seen as the major source of inequality (even lying at the root of the “division among classes”), and therefore as the very basis of “bourgeois rights.” The whole set of “new-born things” was considered by the Maoists as a series of experiments embodying the search for the true political content of otherwise empty concepts. Only those experiments, the Maoists argued, could lead to forms of “limitations of bourgeois rights.”</p>
<p>As is well known, Marx’s analysis of the modern factory system included the prediction that the workers, if politically organized, would be able to spark off unprecedented possibilities starting with the transformation of the conditions of the technical division of labor. The question involved nothing less than the passage from “partial workers annexed for a lifetime to a social function of detail” to persons endowed with “omnilateral” capacities. Marx called the political organization of workers capable of realizing this passage the “dictatorship of the proletariat.” In 1975, however, this had become the name for a peculiar form of the state whose political capacities were very dubious. What was “unclear” was how the “dictatorship of the proletariat” could be an institutional framework within which the potential of omnilateral men and women could actually be opened up. Only “new-born” inventions, the Maoists said, could be the true organizational terrain for deploying the capacities of the workers to realize such a radical change in the political and technical relationship in the factory. In other words, the 1975 experiments, such as that of the “workers’ universities,” were conceived as the only way to reinvent the content of a set of <italic>Grundbegriffe</italic> that had by then become obscure.</p>
<p>In the final years of the Cultural Revolution, the limitation of the Maoists’ experiments in the factories was that they tried to restore full compatibility between the party-state and the new forms of political subjectivity that had arisen after the establishment of the independent workers’ organizations. In fact, since 1968 the experience of the independent political organizations called the Red Guards had come to a close, especially after the students had entered a total impasse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0097700412454528">Russo, 2005</xref>). In the following years, the Maoists promoted the recruitment of many of the activists—especially workers—of the period 1966-1968 as new party members. However, both the “theoretical groups” and the “workers’ universities” were experiments that took place within the institutional framework of the party-state. They exceeded the ordinary functioning of the industrial danwei, but they were inevitably conditioned by the competition for power among groups of leaders. This was their weak point on which, as we shall see, their detractors levered.</p>
<p>A remark on the style of Mao’s political appeals in his last years is called for. Since the mid-sixties the style of his “directives,” that is the theses he introduced into the political debate, was a mixture of impatience and fatalism. There was certainly an element of urgency and, at the same time, the awareness that the task was not only very difficult, but also probably destined to initial failure. Nevertheless, these efforts had to be made because their actual results were not comparable to the failures that they would probably have had in those peculiar historical and social conditions. In fact, throughout the Cultural Revolution Mao raised questions that challenged the conditions of that specific conjuncture, which were probably destined to be overcome by “the present state of things,” but which he nonetheless considered crucial, even beyond their specific outcome in the terms of state power. I have discussed elsewhere Mao’s category of “probable defeat” (可能失败) during the Cultural Revolution, as a decisive subjective component of his politics in those years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0097700412454528">Russo, 1998</xref>). In the last two years of Maoism this attitude was even more explicit. It was urgent, Mao said, to reexplore the basic concepts of politics, otherwise a change in the nature of the state was very likely. On the other hand, that change was perhaps unavoidable, because the political distinctiveness of the socialist state was no longer clear.</p>

<title>Deng Xiaoping after the Cultural Revolution</title>
<p>Deng’s strategy started immediately <italic>after</italic> (periodization is important) Mao’s theses of December 1974 that concerned the “study of the theory,” especially after their publication in newspapers early in February. Deng was named vice-premier during the Fourth People’s Congress in January 1975. After some years of relative political inactivity that followed his “fall” (along with most of the other leaders of the party-state) in 1966–1967, he held, between 1973 and 1974, some minor posts that paved the way for his full rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0097700412454528">10</xref></sup> Needless to say, the new position in the government gave Deng a breadth of resources and a remarkable freedom of maneuver. However, none of what Deng had done in the preceding two years had anticipated his moves in 1975, the year of the decisive turning point.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0097700412454528">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Before that date there are no signs that Deng Xiaoping, and those who would later be his greatest allies at the top of the party, had a definite program. One might think that they had carefully avoided revealing their intentions before they had reached positions of authority in the government, which occurred only with the Fourth National People’s Congress, but it is far more likely that they neither had an effective plan nor constituted a cohesive coalition. Many leaders of the CCP at every level were animated by a strong desire for revenge, both political and personal, as a result of the setbacks they had suffered in 1966; they were also aware that any effective strategy would simply be based on the continuation of previous structures, but they did not know what any necessary discontinuity should be. Even for those who harbored the bitterest resentment against the Cultural Revolution, a new state order could not be the simple reaffirmation of an “orthodoxy.” Many wanted to “settle accounts” with those who had challenged their positions in the state hierarchy, but none of them could seriously think of restoring the status quo ante. Only Deng Xiaoping was able in 1975 to identify exactly on which point he could make a clean break with the past, and on this he founded a winning program.</p>
<p>There are two politically distinct Deng Xiaopings, one before and the other after the Cultural Revolution. The latter Deng was undoubtedly the more original and important and, I will argue, was formed principally during the political struggles in the crucial year of 1975.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0097700412454528">12</xref></sup> The question of the real source of the subjective energy that fed Deng’s political strategy needs to be closely reexamined. His action was, needless to say, not a “restoration” of a “socialist” state system and was not even, as is often repeated, putting either a country in disarray or a collapsing economic system in order. China in 1975 was anything but chaotic, and the economy was in good health, even according to the most “economistic” canons.</p>
<p>The fundamental difficulty, which lay at the root of an unprecedented subjective political tension, was the singular relationship between a state order and a highly important political event such as the Cultural Revolution. Deng certainly desired to restore a state order: this was the only guiding light for his action in 1975, but his greatest strength was understanding what in the former state was to be erased in order to be able to establish a new one. Anticipating the conclusions of this argument, we may say that Deng’s fundamental decision was to break up what had subjected the previous socialist state order to political conditions, taken to mean a subjective mass mobilization on egalitarian issues. In other words, what Deng achieved, at a key moment, was a fundamental depoliticization of the state as a condition of the state order itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0097700412454528">13</xref></sup> Deng’s position, however, was not the result of a matter of principle (it is well known that he was praised as a “pragmatist” who despised “ideological chit-chat”) but went through a series of coherent moves in those specific circumstances.</p>
<p>The key point in Deng’s strategy was the “thorough negation” (彻底否定) of the Cultural Revolution, as his renowned canonical formula stated. This was the culmination of the 1975 strategy (although the immediate result was his second overthrow in 1976), and the starting point of all his following course from 1977–1978 onward. However, this “negation” was in no way truly “thorough,” and could never have been so. It would have been quite ineffective, indeed, if Deng Xiaoping had not succeeded, at the same time, in incorporating into his strategy of “negation” something essential that the Cultural Revolution itself had “negated” with respect to the previous state order. In other words, Deng did not return to pre-1966 “socialism.” Less obvious, however, is what Deng actually derived from the Cultural Revolution while so firmly “denying” it. The issue at stake for him was how to renovate and strengthen governmentality, but it was the Cultural Revolution itself that showed him what of the pre-1966 order could no longer be resurrected.</p>
<p>The details of the compromise that was reached in order for Deng to be rehabilitated in 1972–1973 are not known. It is very likely that Mao relied mainly on Deng’s ability as a “statesman,” and it is known that the condition for his return to government was his declaration that he would never “reverse the verdict” (翻案) on the Cultural Revolution. During the dispute of 1975, Deng was blamed for, among other things, not respecting this promise. However, the true question of how to evaluate the Cultural Revolution had been radically reopened by the theoretical questions posed by Mao in late 1974. As we shall see, Mao himself suggested reconsidering the issue more directly. What was, in fact, the “historical verdict” on the Cultural Revolution to be if it was “not clear” what the “dictatorship of the proletariat” was? The 1975 “movement for the study of the theory” was therefore an essential condition in the formation of Deng’s program. Deng used this movement with an intent that was completely opposed to that of Mao. For Mao the problem was how to discover new theoretical criteria in support of the Cultural Revolution. For Deng, on the other hand, it was how to “deny” it, even if he could not but incorporate some key issues concerning the destruction of the old order.</p>
<p>Deng’s strategy had been formed during a series of moves taken at that key moment when the value of the fully positive assessment of the Cultural Revolution was called into play again by Mao himself with his theoretical theses. The questioning nature of those theses was the key point in the situation: “Why Lenin? . . .” Why did Lenin speak of “special government”? And with him, Marx, Engels, and all the others? What did he really mean? What was the difference in principle between socialism and capitalism? No communist political leader at that time would ever have put a question mark, other than in a rhetorical sense, after a quotation from Lenin. Although Deng initially seemed to be occupied with something else (in his words “putting in order everything in every field”), what guided all his work in 1975 was the problem of how to handle this series of issues and all the political activism stirred up by these theses. Since in China in 1975 the questions concerning the “dictatorship of the proletariat” could not but be strongly felt among the workers, the factories became one of the explicit targets of Deng’s initiatives.</p>
<p>During that year we can distinguish three main steps in Deng’s tactics. First, he hedged in every way discussing or even mentioning Mao’s theses: this was not only an elusive move, but a very clear stand. In the second step, given the developments of the situation, that is the political activism that those issues were stimulating, he could no longer avoid mentioning Mao’s theses, so he formulated, in his turn, a set of opposing arguments summarized in a “general program.” Finally, in the third step, which was the decisive one, he made a seemingly passive move, almost a renunciation of continuing to support his own line, which caused his second short-term political downfall, but which really cemented his strong position and then led him to achieve a complete victory. Let us look at these three stages in detail.</p>
<sec id="section5-0097700412454528">
<title>“Everything Must Be Put in Order in Every Field”</title>
<p>For several months at first, Deng showed indifference to Mao’s theoretical arguments and spoke almost exclusively about the need to “restore order” (<italic>zhengdun</italic> 整顿), which was the true key expression in all his interventions in 1975. It must be recalled that Mao’s theses had been the subject of a heated debate within the central organs of the party since December, and from early February they were relaunched daily by national and local media with hundreds of articles and essays. In addition to the theoretical novelty they contained and the subjective urgency they manifested, the importance of those theses was heightened by the fact that for several years no important statements by Mao had been published. That the main thesis was a crucial question without any definitive answer increased the attention and the degree of subjective “anxiety” that those theses involved. In order to take them seriously, a very personal theoretical effort was needed, for which no one, including Mao himself, had any predetermined solution. In short, the appeal that “it is necessary for the whole country to be informed” was taken very literally, and the themes soon began to be the subject of public discussions, not only in party meetings at all levels, but also in very different places, namely in the different kinds of danwei, particularly in the factories.</p>
<p>In the first months, Deng never cited Mao’s theories on the study of theory and refrained especially from intervening in their content. His lack of interest in theoretical matters and issues of principle has become proverbial, as in the famous motto of the “color of the cat.” Mao would sometimes say that Deng was “deaf,” meaning that he was deaf to political theory, and Deng was highly disturbed by the very existence of ideological debates, which he considered a waste of time, time stolen from an effective management of state command. However, Deng’s careful avoidance of reference to Mao’s call to “study theory” was in itself a manifestation of a precise intention, although at the time he was in a weak position and his intention could not yet be fully declared. In all his speeches in 1975, or at least in those later collected in his <italic>Selected Works</italic>, Deng spoke in particular of zhengdun, a term that in Chinese political language means “to correct a disorder” in an unmistakably disciplinary sense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0097700412454528">14</xref></sup> “Discipline” (纪律) and “more severe rules” (规章制度严一些), Deng continually repeated, were indispensable to combat the main evil of the moment: “disorder” (乱), and more specifically “factionalism” (派性).</p>
<p>Before examining the issue “put in order” versus “disorder/factionalism,” it should be noted that, unlike Mao’s calls for theoretical study that were basically aimed at anyone, the appeals made by Deng in 1975, which were no less urgent and full of subjective pathos, had very definite targets: they were primarily meant for the ruling cadres at all levels of the party-state and especially for the leading groups in the industrial danwei. The other major topic of these interventions was what Deng called “put the word ‘dare’ in the first place” (把‘敢’字当头). The formula echoed the slogan of the early months of the Cultural Revolution “to dare to rebel against reactionaries.” (In fact it was a slogan with a very long revolutionary pedigree, going back at least to Saint Just.) But this time the significance of the call was quite the opposite: “to dare” to give the “rebels” a lesson.</p>
<p>Deng addressed chiefly a huge <italic>nomenklatura</italic> that had been seriously contested during the Cultural Revolution: leading cadres at all levels—from the danwei up to the provincial and central governments, like Deng himself, who after being overthrown (被打倒) in 1966–1967 had returned to their seats in about 1972, only after publicly acknowledging that they had committed political mistakes in their bureaucracy by opposing the mass movements at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. The problem was now, as Deng said, that many of these leaders continued to be “afraid of being overthrown,” even of being criticized, and had therefore “put the word ‘fear’ in the first place” (把‘怕’字当头), tolerating the disorder brought about by “factionalism” everywhere. If they continued to be afraid, he warned, they would definitely be overwhelmed. Deng stated that he personally was “not afraid,” and did not care who criticized his policies of “putting-in-order” as a “program of restoration.” He, indeed, pressed for an increase in severity: orders, rigid rules, iron discipline, and so on were the only remedy to a situation that Deng depicted as being on the edge of an abyss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0097700412454528">Deng, 1975b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0097700412454528">1975c</xref>). The alternative was between a total engagement in Deng’s “putting-in-order” policies by the party-state cadres or their catastrophic overthrow, this time definitively.</p>
<p>The nature, the real extent, and the true causes of the “overthrow” that Deng declared he wanted to avoid are issues that deserve a consideration that goes beyond his version of the facts. However, it must be recognized that the strong subjective pathos of the appeal was undoubtedly a key component in the success of his strategy. The argument of facing an absolute risk, that is the danger of the destruction of the entire structure of hierarchical positions in the system of state control, was a factor that created a coalition with an extraordinary ideological and operational unity within the ranks of the senior cadres of the Chinese state-party. A comparison must be made with the ruling groups of the Soviet Communist Party in those years, whose intrinsic weakness was, on the contrary, the illusion of being predestined by “history” to an everlasting government. This also explains the different outcomes of the USSR and China in the following decades. It is true that in the USSR the situation was very different because there had been no political mass movement threatening the state order, but the crisis in the socialist system was even more profound, mainly because it did not become as fully apparent as it did in China. In that situation, the USSR power elite, convinced of being eternal, exhausted themselves in the conflicts and compromises between power groups that paralyzed any chance of a transformation in the system, so that when Gorbachev arrived the situation was already hopeless.</p>
<p>In contrast, Deng’s appeal to the leaders of the Chinese party consisted in proclaiming that the risk was absolute, and that the only opportunity not to be toppled forever was “not to be afraid” of being overthrown at that precise moment. The subjective tension of the appeal was essential: it was certainly an appeal for “courage.” But if we try to analyze 1975 in China, the picture Deng gave of the situation should be reviewed in depth, not because a fundamental crisis was not actually involved (the persuasiveness of Deng’s appeal to the leaders of the CCP did not rest on purely imaginary elements) but because the diagnosis made by Deng was the <italic>result</italic> of the very solution that he prescribed as the only possible one, not its analytical “objective” premise, as he claimed it to be. In other words, it was because Deng was unable to conceive of anything but the command of state order that he saw “disorder” everywhere. What Deng called “disorder” was actually a series of political experiments—it is true, embryonic but far from chaotic—in search, particularly in factories, of new forms of emancipation and equality in the organization of the collective existence of ordinary people. Those experiments were being carried out, and this was the main difficulty, within the horizon of an irreversible crisis, not only of a certain institutional state order, but also of a cultural order and even of a political <italic>epistème</italic>.</p>
<p>Deng and his supporters in 1975 greatly exaggerated the actual extent of the “disorder,” which they depicted as a matter of “public security,” as well as exaggerating, retrospectively, the effectiveness of the real “putting-in-order” at that time. The official biographies of Deng show, moreover, that the policies of <italic>zhengdun</italic> lasted only a few months, in particular between March and May, and in actual fact focused on the specific situation of an important railway junction. Although these reconstructions remain fairly vague in the detailed description of the event, it seems that the disorganization in that area was also the result of the overlapping among the authorities at different government levels (neighboring provinces, the Ministry of Transport, local authorities, etc.) and was not generically “disorder.”</p>
<p>Even less convincing are the data on the miraculous effects of the policies of zhengdun on production. To show how effective the “putting-in-order” policies had been in 1975, Deng’s biographers cite a GDP growth of 11.9 percent compared to 1974, and 15.1 percent in industry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0097700412454528">15</xref></sup> Besides the question of the precision of the Chinese government’s statistics, which especially for those years are controversial, it is unlikely that this extraordinary economic performance was the result of immediate policies, which in a few months were supposed to have wiped out the almost endemic anarchy Deng and his team portrayed in speeches and documents in the spring of 1975. The data on economic growth in 1975 are probably accurate, but such results would have been impossible without a solid structural ground and a high degree of organizational stability. In this regard, one cannot but observe that if the data are true, the growth of GDP in 1975 was even slightly higher than today’s, and that purely in terms of the growth of the GDP there are no differences with the past three decades of the “Chinese economic miracle.” Although this point is usually barely mentioned, it is certain that the Chinese economy in the decade of the Cultural Revolution was quite solid: the average GDP growth for the years 1967–1976 is estimated at 7.1 percent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0097700412454528">16</xref></sup> The question was not a fall in “production,” and Deng’s turn, with his “reform policy,” was in no way a solution to any economic crisis.</p>
<p>Moreover, after 1969 not only was serious “turmoil” (in the sense of the violation of “public order” concerning the police authorities) very rare in China but also a large rise in production capacity had been achieved, as is shown by the statistics cited to prove Deng’s miracles in 1975. Considering the extent of mass movements in the preceding years and the complexity of the disputes under way, besides the structural instability of the modern factory as such, the situation in Chinese factories in the mid-1970s was very orderly. The fact that the high degree of the workers’ political involvement created a sense of responsibility, self-discipline, and personal attachment to the factory, which was a major organizational factor, should not be underestimated. On the other hand, the political activism of the workers in the factory at that time made the reinvention of organizational criteria unavoidable. The problem was not one of “public order,” but of how to create an organization of collective life in the factory that might match the workers’ heavily politicized activism, with the added complication that this politicization surpassed the previously established relationship between the “working class” and the “industrial danwei.”</p>
<p>As for the equivalence between “disorder” and “factionalism,” Deng’s key topic in those months, it must be said that in the mid-1970s the situation was quite different from that in 1967–1968.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0097700412454528">17</xref></sup> What Deng treated as “factionalism” in the factories in 1975 was, in any case, a phenomenon that could in no way be compared with that of the clashes between student factions in the early years of the Cultural Revolution. Deng was right to locate the phenomenon in the “industrial danwei,” but what he portrayed as pure chaos, to which disciplinary order had to be restored, was in point of fact a crucial political problem: what was the relationship that should exist between the above-mentioned experiments and the reorganization of the leading organs in factories? Given the depth of the rupture that the events of the Cultural Revolution had caused in the previous forms of organization, the reorganization of the leading groups of the industrial danwei, along with all levels of the party-state, was certainly a much entangled web of issues.</p>
<p>Immediately after the January Storm, new forms of organization had been created: they were known as “triple combinations” (三结合) and were intended to involve in the leading groups the cadres of the party-state, the technicians, and the new activists that had emerged from the ranks of the “rebel” workers during the Cultural Revolution. Many of these, whose political experience had begun in organizations that were independent of the party, had later been admitted into the party itself. The Maoists were trying to find a balance between the party-state and the new forms of political subjectivity that had emerged during the Cultural Revolution. For example, at the end of 1973, during the Tenth Congress of the party, much emphasis was placed on the designation of Wang Hongwen, one of the main leaders of the “January Storm,” as vice president of the CCP. All these attempts were inevitably caught between the strain to renew the political style of the party-state, as the Maoists hoped, and the reabsorption of tensions in the typical bureaucratic competition among officials.</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, membership of the CCP had almost doubled compared with 1966, and many new members were recruited among the activists of the late 1960s. In the factories, these young politicized workers were those most involved in experiments like the “workers’ universities” and the “theoretical groups.” Most of the previous cadres’ organizations were probably less enthusiastic, or at least more skeptical about those “new things” that diminished their hierarchic prestige and implied a great theoretical effort that had to be vigorously supported. For Deng Xiaoping this situation was simply a clash between “factionalism” and “order.” Only those who were members of the party before the Cultural Revolution should be considered reliable, while the new members were, as Deng said, “fans of the rebel leaders”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0097700412454528">18</xref></sup> and were therefore a factor of “disorder” to be faced with an intensification of “regulations.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0097700412454528">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, although he continued to deal with the situation only in disciplinary terms throughout the first half of 1975, the development of the “movement for the study of the theory,” and with it the spread of forms of political experimentation in the factories, hence the subjective personal and intellectual growth of many workers, revealed that the issues could in no way be reduced by the application of more stringent regulations. The question was what role the political activism of the workers should play in the experimentation of a new political idea of the factory. It is likely that in the factories in which the aforementioned political experiments were weaker, and preexisting cadres were less inclined to be involved in the search for new paths, politicized groups of workers were more polemical about the direction of the danwei, something that fueled disputes between those workers who supported either one or the other group of leading cadres. What was at stake, needless to say, was also the new composition of the leading groups in the Chinese factories, an issue that inevitably involved, in this case as in any form of state organization, a high rate of bureaucratic competitiveness, which finally had depoliticizing effects. However, there was a fundamental difference between resolving such disputes by using regulations or by giving them the chance to reconsider the theoretical and practical political relationships between workers and the socialist factory. Moreover, not only, as already noted above, was there in China during those months no significant problem of “social disorder” but, on the contrary, this theoretical-political tension gave Chinese society a peculiar dynamic “stability.” That is to say, people’s attention focused on theoretical issues, which were certainly very abstract but which also directly concerned specific issues in the organization of collective life, particularly in the industrial danwei.</p>

<title>The “Three Directives as the Axis”</title>
<p>While in mid-1975 the development of the “movement for the study of the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat” was under way, Deng realized that he could no longer so blatantly ignore the theoretical and political issues at stake by merely opposing them with disciplinary measures. In such circumstances, Deng could not exercise any real political influence simply by invoking a restoration of “order” and imposing “regulations” and could not, therefore, avoid exposing himself to a direct confrontation with Mao’s theories. This was a second important moment in the definition of his strategy in 1975: from February he had simply argued that it was necessary to “put everything in order” without any reference to the theoretical issues under discussion. After a few months, however, he could not help but also “put in order” Mao’s theoretical arguments.</p>
<p>All things considered, the main source of “disorder” was the theoretical issues themselves, because they reopened concepts which were fundamental to an order that was both ideological and institutional. To reopen the question of the political core of the “dictatorship of the proletariat” was so highly destabilizing precisely because of what I have called above its peculiarly “metaphysical dialectic” nature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0097700412454528">20</xref></sup> In this thesis, Mao stated that a fundamental concept of the edifice of knowledge that organized the socialist state was radically indeterminate and he appealed to “the whole country” to find a new rational determination for it. It is precisely to this “metaphysical” thesis that Deng opposed his “total putting-in-order.” Our interpretation here is perhaps too <italic>symptomale</italic>, as Althusser would say, but if we only consider the explicit aim of Deng’s “putting-in-order” policy, we do not grasp either its importance or its effectiveness. Moreover, the appeals to order, to be taken as a rejection of a “metaphysical” position, are part of a precise modern tradition. To put it approximately, it was the same “positivist” option that Comte, for example, had opposed to the “metaphysical critique” of the French Revolution. Deng, of course, was not Comte, but it was after all a vision conceived of in terms of “order and progress” that inspired his political position after the Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p>Deng Xiaoping had no inclination to compete directly in a theoretical and political dispute of that sort, which needed to be addressed on a considerable level of abstraction (where he could not feel at ease), and through a series of organizational experimentations that were very risky (to which, however, he did not attribute any value). He therefore relied on “professional” ideologists. In late spring, he organized his own think tank, the State Council Political Research Office (国务院政治研究室), a working group composed of some of the most prestigious CCP theorists of the years preceding the Cultural Revolution, which worked out, especially in the summer of 1975, a series of ideological countermoves to adapt Deng’s policies to the theoretical level of the political situation at that time. In late summer, the working group had drawn up at least three documents reflecting Deng’s policies in the preceding months and organized them into an ideological framework that, at least formally, referred to the theoretical topics raised by Mao. The most important of these documents was a “General Program of Activities of the Whole Party and the Whole Country,” which was completed in October.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0097700412454528">21</xref></sup> Immediately after the publication of the “General Program,” Mao, who in the preceding months had maintained a fairly neutral position toward Deng’s initiatives, began to reply very critically.</p>
<p>The main point that the Political Research Office developed during the summer, undoubtedly under Deng’s guidance, concerned Mao’s statements on the “study of theory.” The “General Program,” in actual fact, did not discuss the content of Mao’s theses, but it did finally cite them, whereas for several months Deng had simply ignored them. The main point was the following: “Mao’s directive on the study of theory,” as the program called it, was surely “very important” but “it could not be separated in any way” (implying an error that the Deng ideologists defined not casually as “metaphysical”) from the other two “directives of Chairman Mao” in earlier months: one that called for “stability and unity” (安定团结), and another that wished for “further development of the national economy” (把国民经济搞上去).</p>
<p>The theoretical group created by Deng then enunciated the formula “taking the three directives as the axis” (以三项指示为纲) and declared that it should become the main point of the “General Program of Activities of the Whole Party and the Whole Country.” The slogan took to be equivalent, on the one hand, the disturbing questions raised by Mao about a possible epochal passage in the socialist form of state, which was the main theoretical question at stake in those months, and, on the other hand, two general assertions about the advisability of social cohesion and economic growth, statements that Mao could have made at various other times. To continue our <italic>symptomale</italic> line of interpretation, the invention of the “three directives as the axis” aimed to counterbalance the “metaphysical” argument with “order” and “progress.” This was an attempt by Deng’s group to stifle the issues that were animating the movement for the “study of the theory” within a liturgy that deprived them of any political value.</p>

<sec id="section7-0097700412454528">
<title>How to Rethink the Cultural Revolution?</title>
<p>For much of 1975, Mao did not raise any objection to Deng’s policies of <italic>zhengdun</italic> and let him work according to his own ideas. In early October, however, facing the distortion of his own position, which was even presented as the key point in a “General Program of Activities of the Whole Party and the Whole Country,” Mao intervened with a statement that completely repudiated such a “creative” interpretation (as it is still presented by Deng’s official biographers). The tone was one of great impatience: “What ‘three directives as the axis’ (什么‘以三项指示为纲’)! ‘Stability and unity’ do not mean that there is no class struggle. Class struggle is the main thread in the net. The rest are just the meshes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0097700412454528">Mao, 1998b</xref>: 486).</p>
<p>Mao’s intervention became a turning point in his relationship with Deng, but it did not reach the point of a definitive break. Nor could it have done so because if Mao was asserting that addressing the problems of China at that time, including social cohesion, should be given priority in politics (“class struggle” obviously being its main synonym), then the series of theoretical issues he had raised in December had reopened the question of what exactly the actual content of politics itself was after the Cultural Revolution (“dictatorship of the proletariat” was another important synonym for politics); he had also reopened the problem of what assessment should be given to the political events of the preceding decade. It was precisely this point that Mao explicitly disputed in the following weeks.</p>
<p>It should be noted that in this crucial transition Deng maintained a totally uncompromising stance, whereas Mao showed a remarkable willingness to come to an agreement. Deng Rong, Deng Xiaoping’s daughter, wrote in her memoirs that Mao’s attitude toward her father was at that time of the “utmost tolerance and patience” (仁至义尽) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0097700412454528">Mao Mao, 2000</xref>: 426). In October, when Mao refuted the formula of the “three directives as the axis,” he was not seeking full antagonism. Rather, he immediately made Deng an offer that tackled the crucial point, i.e., the evaluation of the Cultural Revolution. Mao proposed starting a broad public debate in order to evaluate thoroughly all the aspects of the preceding decade, starting with the negative ones, and asked Deng himself to lead a discussion on a national level. The proposal was obviously very difficult: it was divisive, but also very generous, and Mao repeatedly tried to persuade Deng to accept it. Mao was fully convinced that to open a public discussion of the Cultural Revolution was decisive. The Cultural Revolution had been, he said, basically, but not completely, good. Using a “classical” percentage, he said it had been “seventy percent positive,” but it had been thirty percent “inadequate” (有所不足). Of those events, he said, there were “very different points of view” (看法不见得一致). Also, among those who were not in favor, there were some who were simply “dissatisfied” (不满意) because they had been treated unfairly, and others, on the other hand, who wished “to settle accounts” (算帐) with the Cultural Revolution. It was time to discuss these issues openly: it was necessary to submit openly the evaluation of the Cultural Revolution to “research” (研究, the same term used when talking about research and “scholarly” study) in order to understand precisely what had been inadequate or insufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0097700412454528">Mao, 1998b</xref>: 487–88). In short, Mao argued that it was time to explore primarily what had not worked in the Cultural Revolution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0097700412454528">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mao proposed that Deng Xiaoping should assume the task of leading a work group created in the Central Committee to launch a national campaign of “research” into this crucial issue. He received a very clear rejection, which Deng reiterated on several occasions during the autumn of 1975. Deng replied he was not the right person for the job because he was not aware of events in which he had not participated from 1967. It was obviously a pretext, which put him in a very difficult position indeed. In refusing to assume the political leadership of “research” into the Cultural Revolution, Deng actually even renounced exerting any national political role, particularly when Mao so clearly distanced himself from his “General Program” and from the way he used his “directives as the axis.” Deng’s choice, however, was only apparently a renunciation. Although his firm rejection of Mao’s proposal in October 1975 involved a substantial limitation of his direct interventions for about a year (Deng was, however, very influential in all the events of 1976), his intransigence on this point in fact became the main element in his following success.</p>
<p>One may wonder what sort of mass debate there might have been in China at the end of 1975, that is to say a debate launched by Mao and directed by Deng about what was wrong with the Cultural Revolution, on the basis, moreover, of the previous campaign for the study of the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This passage in the autumn of 1975 was undoubtedly crucial and also shows the extent of the alternatives in the Chinese political situation at the time, at least from Mao’s perspective. That Mao made an impossible invitation in order to put Deng in a tight spot should not be taken for granted. Mao repeated his invitation several times in October, and Deng’s official biographers, including his daughter, all reveal some surprise when reporting how resolutely Deng refused it.</p>
<p>Deng was certainly one of those who wanted to “settle accounts” with the Cultural Revolution, yet there were also many other leaders of the CCP that wanted to do the same but did not know how. The sense of Deng’s move—his stubbornness and in particular its effectiveness—should be seen within the context of the whole political situation in 1975. Deng could have exerted an enormous influence as chairman of a commission of the Central Committee to lead a movement of national study on the mistakes and shortcomings of the Cultural Revolution. Deng, however, was in no way interested in a political rethinking of the Cultural Revolution. Rather, considering his subsequent strategy, it became clear that the prohibition of any political rethinking of the Cultural Revolution was for Deng the fundamental condition for restoring state order. What he indicated, even running the risk of immediate failure, was to clear the way for what became the “thorough negation.” This third step of Deng’s in October 1975 was thus essential for all his future strategy.</p>
<p>Deng’s position immediately became weaker, and in the last months of the year every single previous initiative ceased completely, including the “Political Research Office.” In the following spring, Deng was “overthrown” again, but this second fall was brief. In October 1976, exactly one month after the death of Mao, after a small Thermidor during which the Maoist leaders on the Central Committee were arrested, the “thorough negation” of the Cultural Revolution began, becoming the basic formula on which the “new Chinese order” was built. In China, the whole period from October 1975 to October 1976 was marked by very strong political tensions, which remain to be analyzed in depth, especially as far as ideological disputes are concerned. The role of the university after the Cultural Revolution was, for example, a crucial topic. However, during that same year Deng wielded an important, though indirect, influence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0097700412454528">23</xref></sup> The dispute with Mao ended in the autumn. In the months that followed, the political situation was not shaped by Deng’s statements and initiatives. What he said and did in 1975, however, remains essential to all that followed and laid the foundation for the coalition that still heads the party-state in China.</p>

<sec id="section8-0097700412454528">
<title>The “Thorough Negation”</title>
<p>Let us briefly recapitulate. In 1975, Deng Xiaoping based his comeback neither on a preconceived plan nor on the extension of his position before 1966, but on a succession of moves, each of which was made as an exact reply to the development of the political situation that had begun with Mao’s theses at the end of 1974. This does not mean that his success was accidental. The “reactive” nature of Deng’s subjective position produced a coherent and extremely effective strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0097700412454528">24</xref></sup> His refusal to lead a national debate on the “inadequacies” of the Cultural Revolution in October was the direct consequence of policies that had started with the <italic>zhengdun</italic> in the spring and continued with the “three directives as the axis” in the summer.</p>
<p>In each of these three stages, Deng was unbending in declaring the theoretical debates and political experimentations that Mao was promoting in those months not only worthless but also dangerous sources of disorder. The targets of Deng’s initiative continued and changed according to developments in the situation itself. Initially it was a “symptomatic” reaction which, if isolated, would have been ineffective. Deng repeated throughout the spring how important it was to tackle “disorder,” while never mentioning the true root of the problem, which was definitely not “factionalism” but the views expressed by Mao at the end of December 1974. In a second step, given that Mao’s “metaphysical” theses were gaining an influence that could no longer be ignored, Deng changed his mind and indicated “putting in order” those theses, but this time he found an obstacle in Mao himself. Mao, in turn, made a move clarifying that what was at stake was the evaluation of the Cultural Revolution. On this point the differences between them became irreconcilable. Deng was in no way interested in politically rethinking the Cultural Revolution: he simply wanted to “thoroughly deny it.”</p>
<p>However, this “denial” could not be truly “thorough.” In order to be effective, it had to necessarily incorporate some essential elements of discontinuity that the Cultural Revolution had introduced compared to the old order. In other words, Deng acted effectively because he clearly understood what the one key point in that necessary break could only be, taking it from both the Cultural Revolution, particularly the January Storm, and from the 1975 political situation. Deng said he did not know much of what had happened during the Cultural Revolution, but he said this to avoid what would otherwise have become a serious obstacle to any of his eventually successful strategy. In fact, Deng was very familiar with, and considered very carefully, the Cultural Revolution and, despite the official formula, his politics were based on a “selective negation.” By taking from the Cultural Revolution only those decisive elements of the “destruction” of the previous ideology and organization, and at the same time rejecting all forms of “construction” in terms of political experimentations, it became possible for Deng to restore state order in China.</p>
<p>First of all, Deng understood that the previous relationship between the “working class” and the “party-state” was the point that had undergone the most radical destabilization in the Chinese socialist system. As we have said, the entire edifice of the socialist state was founded on the inclusion of the political figure of the worker in the state. The Cultural Revolution, particularly the events in the autumn–winter of 1966–1967 in Shanghai, with the radical questioning of the political value of the relationship between the worker and the industrial danwei, had dismantled a key point in the epistemic network and, at the same time, in the state consistency based on the conceptual chain of “worker–factory–class–party–state.” In tackling that irreversible break, two courses were opened up: the first was experimentation with a new political consistency in the socialist factory with schemes such as the “workers’ university” and the “theoretical group”; the second, pursued by Deng with the utmost determination, was to radically depoliticize the worker–factory relationship, reducing it to a technical–disciplinary one.</p>
<p>However, the decisive move to depoliticize the industrial danwei could not be primarily a showdown with the Cultural Revolution in general. What Deng realized in 1975 was that the depoliticization of the socialist factory was a prerequisite for maintaining state order and that this could never be achieved without going through the denial of all attempts to re-politicize the factory that were underway at that time. Moreover, he would never have achieved his goal without believing in the importance of the reconsideration, which was taking place in those months, of the political categories that supported the state as based on the existence of a “proletariat.” Deng considered them to be merely a factor of permanent instability and appealed to the whole apparatus to react against a foreign body that had to be eliminated quickly before a catastrophic destruction of the state order occurred.</p>
<p>Deng would never have succeeded in his task without rejecting, step by step, all the novelty and the singularity of the 1975 political situation. The end of workers’ universities and the theoretical groups, and the repudiation of the whole “movement for the study of the theory,” were decided immediately after Hua Guofeng’s Termidorian coup d’état in October 1976, long before Deng’s return to the scene. This is a clear sign that Deng had formed a determined coalition to eradicate that “metaphysical disorder” in 1975, and that they had acted in full accordance with his ideas, even in his temporary absence. As is always the case, the Chinese Thermidorians, or at least those who merely wanted to eliminate the “excesses,” were in their turn also removed after a few years.</p>
<p>The wager Deng won was the reconstitution of a “socialist order” that would not depend on the inclusion of the political figure of the workers in the state, although even today the constitution of the Chinese Communist Party still declares that the CCP is the “vanguard of the proletariat.” One of Deng’s achievements was also maintaining the formulas of the old political language as a mere state ritual while depriving them of their concepts. Conversely, the Maoists’ weakest point at the end of the decade of the Cultural Revolution, far from being the “disorder” described by the winners, was the hope that those political experiments for reinventing the political value of the worker might not only be carried out within the framework of the party-state, but also that they could be a factor of political regeneration and even of stabilization. Deng decided, on the other hand, that he could reconstitute a state order only by eliminating the problem of how to seek a political essence of the worker, which for him was empty sophism.</p>
<p>The decade of the Cultural Revolution, briefly, marked the beginning of an irreversible crisis in the political existence of party-states, which then spread throughout the world, bearing consequences that have lasted up to the current crisis in contemporary state systems. For more than three decades, Deng’s turning point ensured China a stability of institutions far exceeding that of many other state systems, not to mention those socialist countries and communist parties around the world that collapsed. One of the factors behind China’s stability was certainly Deng’s ability to anticipate an epochal crisis in the forms of the state. However, the decisive factor in his success was the elimination from the political scene of the figure of the worker, after the rejection of that singular political moment represented by 1975 in China. In so doing, Deng launched a worldwide trend (called “neoliberalism”) which created a temporary stabilization of the state but which was in fact merely apparent, that is to say it actually produced a far more severe instability than the “disorder” Deng had initially wanted to tackle.</p>

These theories had been initially set forth by Mao in December 1974 in a “theoretical seminar” held in the presence of Zhou Enlai, presumably as part of the preparatory meetings for the Fourth National Congress. Meetings for theoretical study at the top of the party were part of a tradition that dates back to the years of the War of Liberation and to some extent still remains today. Zhou Enlai personally arranged the circulation of the transcript of the interview, first in the central structures of the party and then in the press. Mao’s choice of Zhou Enlai as the first interlocutor of those theoretical issues is a sign of the close relationship between the two, which lasted until the end. However, since late 1973 and throughout 1974 Mao had various disagreements with Zhou Enlai with regard to foreign policy, which cannot be dealt with here.</p>

<p>In Vogel’s biography, Mao’s theses and the following “movement for the study of the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat” do not play any significant role in the scene of 1975, which is fully occupied by a struggle between a Mao “mercurial” and “paranoid” and a Deng firmly committed to “restoring order.” However, as I will discuss below, denying that Mao’s theoretical theses had any value, or merely paying them lip service, was part of Deng’s deliberate political behavior on that scene. In this case, Deng’s alleged pragmatic lack of interest in “ideological” issues should not be taken too literally. Without paying close attention to Mao’s theses in 1975, and elaborating a series of specific moves for responding them, Deng would have never been able to build any winning strategy.</p>

<p>Sylvain Lazarus has noted that the events of Shanghai in 1966–1967 started a global crisis over the question of the value of the category of the “working class,” a crisis that reached its apex in the late 1970s with the Polish Solidarność movement, after the 1969 Italian “autunno caldo” (hot autumn) and the rebellions of French workers in the late 1960s and early 1970s. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0097700412454528">Lazarus, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0097700412454528">Lazarus, 1993</xref>. Wang Hui has rightly noted that in the early nineties the collapse of the Soviet Union was accompanied by the loss of peasants’ and workers’ “dignity” (尊严感), even if it had always been precarious, as seen in the political struggles of the twentieth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0097700412454528">Wang, 2010</xref>: 371–81). The issue of the political worth of workers and peasants has been central in the entire Chinese revolutionary politics. I would add that the origin of the contemporary annihilation of the political dignity of workers and peasants has to be sought in the very conclusion of the Chinese political events of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

<p>The memoirs published by his daughter, Deng Rong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0097700412454528">Mao Mao, 2000</xref>), show that after 1966 Deng Xiaoping was not particularly oppressed, nor jailed; on the contrary, he was carefully protected by both Mao and Zhou Enlai in view of a possible return to government. Since 1967 Mao himself suggested this possibility. From 1969 to 1972 Deng was sent to an agricultural district in Jiangxi, where he lived with his family and took part in manual work in a factory. His living conditions were quite proportionate to his ranking. From this village he kept up relationships with the government and with the party center.</p>

<p>I use depoliticization in a very different sense from Carl Schmitt. For him it means the lack of “the political,” that is the disappearance of the opposition <italic>amicus</italic>/<italic>hostis</italic>. For me egalitarian politics involves a series of subjective inventions and organizational experiments that go beyond that opposition. The depoliticization carried out by Deng concerned the full rejection of the Cultural Revolution. The ban, which is still in force in China, on reflecting on the Cultural Revolution is a condition of state consistency today. I have outlined some working hypotheses on this issue in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0097700412454528">Russo, 2006</xref>.

<p>Even in the early years of the Cultural Revolution, what is usually defined as “factionalism” really concerns different kinds of phenomena. For example, the fighting in Shanghai toward the end of 1966 between groups of workers called “Rebel Revolutionaries” and “Scarlet Guards,” which had the recognition of independent workers’ organizations at stake, had different content from the clashes that from the middle of 1967 increasingly saw opposing student organizations from different universities, leading to armed struggle between “factions” opposing each other over the largely imaginary issue of the “seizure of power.” These clashes, which increasingly became brawls between groups fighting for bureaucratic supremacy on the campuses, led to the political self-destruction of the student organizations themselves. After the second half of 1968, with the dissolution of the Red Guard student groups, the clashes ended, but the universities had almost no students until 1972–1973. The situation in the factories was quite different. In Shanghai the disputes between the groups of workers were particularly intense in December 1966 and January 1967, but the city later became a quite peaceful place so that it was an important center for political experimentation from the end of the sixties. I have analyzed the student factions during the first two years of the Cultural Revolution in the above mentioned essays, particularly in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0097700412454528">Russo, 2006</xref>. The most interesting sociological overview of those events is still the one carried out some years ago by Lynn T. White III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0097700412454528">White, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0097700412454528">White, 1991</xref>). White argues that the violence that erupted between opposing groups during the Cultural Revolution had its roots in the structure of “state policies” that had become merely forms of social discipline, such as the use of categories like “class” or “good political behavior.” The analytic perspective I have proposed is very different from White’s, but I share the idea that the organizational structure of the Chinese state in those years lay at the root of factionalism: those students and their new independent political organizations after a few months of political vitality completely failed to break down that scheme. In a couple of years their political novelty had evaporated. In short, I believe the factionalism of 1967–1968, far from being a result of excessive politicization, was actually an effect of the “depoliticization” exercised by the bureaucratic model of socialist state. A limitation of recent analyses of Red Guard organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0097700412454528">Walder, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0097700412454528">Andreas, 2009</xref>) is in my opinion the failure to distinguish the early disputes of the second half of 1966, which, also among students, had the issue of the political self-organization at stake, and the brawls of 1967–1968, whose major content was merely how to annihilate opposing “factions.” These analyses are in fact much more convincing for the latter moment. The situation in 1975 was in any case very different from the “factionalism” in 1967–1968.</p>

At the time none of these “programs” was officially published in the press, due to the fact that Deng’s political initiative ended in October 1975. In the following weeks, however, there were widespread editions for “internal use” (i.e., not directly available in the official press or in bookshops but distributed only within the “working units”), and these were later reprinted in early 1976 as appendixes to three separate volumes of criticism on Deng Xiaoping’s three programs.</p>

This certainly fits into the current image, but the available documents show rather that Mao was really interested in a critical reflection on the mistakes of Cultural Revolution, while Deng was definitely hostile. It is true, however, as Vogel notes, that if Deng would have accepted in that moment to discuss, even critically, the Cultural Revolution, his following strategy based on the “thorough negation” would have been impossible.</p>
