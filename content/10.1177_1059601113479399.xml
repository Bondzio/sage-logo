<abstract>
<p>Recent research shows the powerful impact of counterproductive behavior in teams. This study explores how team characteristics combine to influence bad behavior in groups. It builds upon recent work in organizational justice by exploring the relationship between overall justice climate and work groups’ deviant and political behavior. Findings suggest that the structure of the work itself, in the form of functional dependence, moderates this relationship. Specifically, it is argued that the relationship between injustice climate and deviant and political behavior will be strongest when functional dependence between employees is low. Results from a sample of 539 employees and 113 supervisors in 113 work units support the hypotheses.</p>

<p>Research points to the considerable costs organizations incur due to employee misbehavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1059601113479399">Tepper, 2007</xref>). Thus, scholars increasingly seek to understand its causes. For example, individual differences such as personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059601113479399">Berry, Ones, &amp; Sackett, 2007</xref>), work attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059601113479399">Dalal, 2005</xref>), justice orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059601113479399">Cohen-Charash &amp; Spector, 2001</xref>) and moral philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059601113479399">Henle, Giacalone, &amp; Jurkiewicz, 2005</xref>) have been shown to be related to counterproductive work behaviors. More recently, scholars have turned their attention from the individual predictors of misbehavior to contextual factors, such as the relationship an individual holds with the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1059601113479399">Thau, Crossley, Bennett, &amp; Sczesny, 2007</xref>) and the characteristics of the group and organization itself that may trigger or increase bad behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059601113479399">Enns &amp; Rotundo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1059601113479399">O’Boyle, Forsyth, &amp; O’Boyle, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This article seeks to explain employee misbehavior in work units by extending research on contextual rather than personal antecedents. We draw upon and extend current scholarship in the organizational justice literature by exploring how collective perceptions of fairness (and unfairness) influence negative behavior in groups. In particular, our focus is on how collective perceptions of overall justice (overall justice climate) shape negative group behaviors. Second, we explore the extent to which the nature of the work itself—in this case the functional dependence that exists between work unit members—may act to strengthen or weaken the impact an unfair climate exerts on counterproductive work behaviors.</p>
<p>Counterproductive work behavior (CPWB) is a general description for deliberate actions aimed at causing harm to the organization or its members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1059601113479399">O’Boyle et al., 2011</xref>). This article focuses on two types of counterproductive work group behaviors. The first is interpersonal deviance, which encompasses deviant acts intentionally directed at another individual, such as violence, gossip, or threats aimed at coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601113479399">Bennett &amp; Robinson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059601113479399">Berry et al., 2007</xref>). The second counterproductive behavior is self-serving political behavior, defined as manipulative social influence efforts aimed at self-serving outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059601113479399">Kacmar &amp; Carlson, 1997</xref>). Research shows that both types of behavior harm other people, compromise important group processes, and violate organizational and social norms as well as group expectations of proper conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601113479399">Bennett &amp; Robinson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059601113479399">Kacmar, Bozeman, Carlson, &amp; Anthony, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Scholarship on the emergence of CPWBs in work units is scarce. (For an exception, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1059601113479399">Mayer, Kuenzi, Greenbaum, Bardes, and Salvador (2009)</xref>, who showed ethical leadership as an antecedent of deviant behavior in work groups.) Therefore, one goal of this study is to understand more clearly how counterproductive behavior emerges in work teams. We do so by drawing upon and extending recent work in the organizational justice literature. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601113479399">Cropanzano, Li, and Benson (2011)</xref>, it is proposed that group-level perceptions of unfairness will be related to interpersonal deviance and political behavior in work groups.</p>
<p>It is further argued that this relationship between justice climate and group misbehavior is moderated by the work structure of the group. Research has demonstrated the effects of different structural components, such as centralization and formalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059601113479399">Ambrose &amp; Schminke, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1059601113479399">Schminke, Cropanzano, &amp; Rupp, 2002</xref>), or team characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601113479399">Andrews, Kacmar, Blakely, &amp; Bucklew, 2008</xref>) on the relationship between fairness perceptions and outcomes.</p>
<p>Although research has shed light on how aspects of organizational structure may moderate the influence of justice perceptions, it has yet to examine how the structure of the work itself will influence the relationship between justice perceptions and employee behaviors. Here, we predict the relationship between overall justice climate and work group misbehavior will be stronger when the job performance of one worker does not directly depend on the contribution of another, a condition known as low functional dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1059601113479399">Morris &amp; Steers, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, this study extends previous research in three distinct ways. First, this article contributes to the understanding of counterproductive behavior in teams by extending the search for antecedents to include the context in which work is performed (in this case, the fairness of the work setting). Second, it adds to the literature on organizational justice by extending the overall justice construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601113479399">Ambrose &amp; Schminke, 2009</xref>) to the climate level and exploring the impact of justice climate on counterproductive work group behaviors. Finally, this study examines how characteristics of the work itself, in the form of functional dependence, may influence the impact overall justice climate has on interpersonal deviance and political behavior of the work group.</p>
<p>The article is organized to provide an overview of the construct of overall justice first, before combining theoretical foundations from the organizational justice, teams, and work interdependence literatures to develop the hypotheses.</p>
<sec id="section1-1059601113479399">
<title>Overall Justice</title>
<p>Research on organizational justice has shown that distinct facets of justice, such as procedural, distributive, or interactional justice, influence employee behavior and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059601113479399">Colquitt, Conlon, Wesson, Porter, &amp; Ng, 2001</xref>). However, recent work on organizational justice seems to suggest that employee behavior and attitudes may be better examined by assessing perceptions of overall justice instead of facet-specific justice dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059601113479399">Ambrose &amp; Arnaud, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601113479399">Ambrose &amp; Schminke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059601113479399">Colquitt &amp; Shaw, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059601113479399">Greenberg, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Scholars present several reasons for why—and when—the use of overall justice might be more appropriate. For example, researchers have argued that simply studying facet-specific justice dimensions may present limitations for researchers and lead to a fragmented literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059601113479399">Holtz &amp; Harold, 2009</xref>) because (a) the power of justice perceptions to explain organizational outcomes varies depending on the type of justice examined, (b) the influence of justice types on employee attitudes has been shown to be person, context, and time specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059601113479399">Cojuharenco, Patient, &amp; Bashshur, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059601113479399">Colquitt, Scott, Judge, &amp; Shaw, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1059601113479399">Schminke, Ambrose, &amp; Noel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1059601113479399">Scott &amp; Colquitt, 2007</xref>), and (c) the different justice dimensions may not capture how individuals actually form justice perceptions in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601113479399">Ambrose &amp; Schminke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059601113479399">Colquitt &amp; Shaw, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The latter reason is theoretically grounded in fairness heuristics theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1059601113479399">Lind, 2001</xref>), which argues that individuals use cognitive shortcuts when processing information and forming justice judgments. That is, employees experience fair procedures regarding bonus pay or promotion and this information is, in turn, used by the individual to craft global fairness perceptions of the overall work environment. This theory suggests that people form overall justice perceptions regarding their work environment to reduce uncertainty and increase understanding of a situation and workplace instead of forming facet-specific judgments about procedural or distributive justice.</p>
<p>Research also points to the superior predictive validity of overall justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059601113479399">Beugre &amp; Baron, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601113479399">Jones &amp; Martens, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1059601113479399">Kim &amp; Leung, 2007</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601113479399">Ambrose and Schminke (2009)</xref> conducted two studies, which demonstrate that overall justice perceptions fully mediate the relationship between distributive, procedural, and interactional justice and employee behavior. This finding indicates that overall justice is the most proximal factor to outcomes when exploring the relationship between justice judgments and behavior. Moreover, research has shown that overall justice predicts employee behavior and attitudes above and beyond the specific facets of justice and beyond a composite measure composed of justice facets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601113479399">Ambrose &amp; Schminke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601113479399">Jones &amp; Martens, 2009</xref>). In all, previous theoretical as well as empirical research suggests that individuals do form overall justice perceptions when exposed to different justice cues in the workplace, and that these overall justice perceptions influence employee behavior in organizations.</p>

<title>Overall (In)Justice Climate and Group Behavior</title>
<p>In addition to an interest in overall justice, scholars have placed an emphasis on group-level perceptions of fairness (i.e., justice climate) and its influence on employee attitudes and behaviors, including job satisfaction, commitment, performance, and organizational citizenship behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601113479399">Ehrhart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601113479399">Liao &amp; Rupp, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1059601113479399">Mossholder, Bennett, &amp; Martin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1059601113479399">Naumann &amp; Bennett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1059601113479399">Simons &amp; Roberson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1059601113479399">Walumbwa, Hartnell, &amp; Oke, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059601113479399">Li and Cropanzano (2009)</xref> define justice climate as the degree to which workplace fairness is perceived by a work unit. That is, employees form shared perceptions about the extent of fair treatment exhibited toward them in the work unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601113479399">Ehrhart, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Within the justice climate literature, only a few studies have investigated the relationship between justice climate and negative workplace behaviors. However, this evidence suggests that unfair climates prompt negative outcomes, such that employees are likely to engage in behaviors that no longer promote the performance and desired outcomes of the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059601113479399">Dietz, Robinson, Folger, Baron, &amp; Schultz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059601113479399">Enns &amp; Rotundo, 2012</xref>). This study will further extend this line of research by showing that justice climates may impact counterproductive work behaviors at the group level.</p>
<p>To explain the effects of justice at the work unit level on employee outcomes, scholars have primarily drawn on social learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059601113479399">Bandura, 1977</xref>) or social information processing theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1059601113479399">Salancik &amp; Pfeffer, 1978</xref>). These theories indicate that employees observe and learn (un)fair behavior from others or interpret fairness-related cues in their environment that prompt corresponding future behavior. Moreover, researchers draw on the group value or group engagement models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1059601113479399">Tyler, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1059601113479399">Tyler &amp; Blader, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1059601113479399">2001</xref>), which propose that when a work group is treated fairly, employees develop pride for the group as well as feelings of self-worth and self-esteem. Developing positive feelings toward the group increases members’ identification with the team and results in positive group-oriented behavior.</p>
<p>More recent work on group-level justice phenomena proposes that certain group processes provide the link between justice climate and employee behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601113479399">Cropanzano and colleagues (2011)</xref> suggest that justice climate influences task and interpersonal teamwork processes. Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059601113479399">Hoegl and Gemuenden’s (2001)</xref> taxonomy of team processes, Cropanzano et al. argue that a fair climate positively impacts the quality of several work unit processes, including communication, coordination, contribution, cohesion, effort, and support. These positive group processes, in turn, prompt people to engage in group-oriented behaviors. For example, a fair climate provides an environment in which employees are comfortable speaking up and sharing ideas, strengthening communication and collaboration among members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059601113479399">Chen &amp; Kanfer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059601113479399">Chen, Kirkman, Kanfer, Allen, &amp; Rosen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059601113479399">Chen, Sharma, Edinger, Shapiro, &amp; Farh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059601113479399">Detert &amp; Burris, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1059601113479399">Kirkman &amp; Rosen, 1999</xref>). Conversely, group-level perceptions of unfairness may decrease employees’ engagement in these group processes and, therefore, foster behavior that is more self-serving in nature. Research has shown that unfair treatment of a work group prompts members to withdraw from the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059601113479399">Blader &amp; Tyler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1059601113479399">Tyler &amp; Blader, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1059601113479399">2003</xref>), decreasing team states such as cohesion and attachment. Subsequently, the lack of cohesion, communication, interaction, and dependence may initiate group members’ engagement in negative behaviors, such as deviant and self-serving behaviors to harm members of the group.</p>
<p>Interdependence theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059601113479399">De Cremer &amp; Van Vugt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601113479399">Kelley &amp; Thibaut, 1978</xref>) provides further rationale for this relationship. The theory suggests that when work teams experience less interaction and interdependence, a “transformation of motivation” takes place. This shift in motivation puts group goals and accomplishments in the background, whereas self-serving and competitively oriented individual goals are strengthened. Research demonstrates support for the assertion that a lack of positive group processes influences deviant and self-serving behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601113479399">Andrews et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1059601113479399">Kidwell &amp; Valentine, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1059601113479399">Scott &amp; Judge, 2009</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1059601113479399">Thau et al. (2007)</xref> showed that group cohesion mediates the relationship between trust and antisocial behavior of employees.</p>
<p>In sum, drawing on the groups and justice literature, we argue that group-level perceptions of unfairness influence work groups’ deviant and self-serving behaviors. Specifically, perceptions of injustice have been shown to negatively impact group processes such that members display lower levels of communication, effort, collaboration, and cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059601113479399">Blader &amp; Tyler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601113479399">Cropanzano et al., 2011</xref>). The limited engagement in group processes increases individuals’ self-serving and deviant work behavior within the work unit. This discussion leads to the first hypothesis:</p>

<title>The Moderating Effect of Functional Dependence</title>
<p>The justice literature recognizes the importance of contextual variables to the emergence and impact of justice perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059601113479399">Colquitt et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059601113479399">Cropanzano, Byrne, Bobocel, &amp; Rupp, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601113479399">Jones &amp; Martens, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1059601113479399">Lind &amp; Tyler, 1988</xref>). Specifically, the structure and design of the organizational environment play an important role in understanding fairness perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601113479399">Schminke, Ambrose, &amp; Cropanzano, 2000</xref>). These earlier findings warrant the investigation of further structural variables that affect the impact of justice perceptions in organizations. Some research has demonstrated the importance of structural components and group dynamics on justice perceptions and employee behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059601113479399">Andrews et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601113479399">Schminke et al., 2000</xref>). This current article aims to extend this focus on contextual and structural components by studying how the structure of the work itself—in the form of functional dependence—may enhance or mitigate the influence of group-level justice perceptions on group member behaviors.</p>
<p>Functional dependence refers to the interdependence between work group members when performing tasks, such that the success of one employee depends directly on the contribution of another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1059601113479399">Morris &amp; Steers, 1980</xref>). It describes the degree to which individuals must rely on interaction partners to accomplish tasks and the degree to which one’s work outcome is influenced by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1059601113479399">Rusbult &amp; Van Lange, 2003</xref>). Functional dependence of work groups has been shown to impact a variety of group processes. For example, dependence influences individuals’ interactions with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1059601113479399">Rusbult &amp; Buunk, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1059601113479399">Rusbult &amp; Van Lange, 2003</xref>), coordination and communication patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1059601113479399">Stewart &amp; Barrick, 2000</xref>), members’ group identification and attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059601113479399">De Cremer &amp; Van Vugt, 1999</xref>), and exchange relationships and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1059601113479399">Morris &amp; Moberg, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1059601113479399">Stewart &amp; Barrick, 2000</xref>). Interdependence theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601113479399">Kelley &amp; Thibaut, 1978</xref>) suggests such dependence is an essential part in determining how individuals interact in work settings, the type of relationships they will develop, and the behavior (cooperative vs. self-serving) they will display. When members’ work goals and outcomes are interdependent, team interactions will further increase and motivation shifts toward objectives of the greater group or work unit, while neglecting the pursuit of individual goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059601113479399">De Cremer &amp; Van Vugt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059601113479399">Kelley &amp; Thibaut, 1978</xref>). Thus, highly functional interdependent groups place an even greater focus on team processes, such as communication, support, cohesion, and collaboration, which promotes behaviors that benefit the group. Conversely, under conditions of low functional dependence, employees are able to perform tasks independently of others and without the help of fellow workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059601113479399">Aubé, Rousseau, Mama, &amp; Morin, 2009</xref>), thereby deemphasizing team processes and interactions.</p>
<p>In all, characteristics of a low functional dependence setting and the resulting lack of team interaction and even greater self-focused motivation set the stage for enhancing the relationship between perceptions of injustice and deviant and self-serving behaviors in the work unit. As outlined before, an unfair climate may prompt individuals in groups to misbehave. Low functional dependence presents a condition in which members have even fewer group interactions and are further encouraged to engage in self-serving behaviors. Therefore, in work units characterized by low levels of functional dependence, employees possess not only less attachment, communication, and coordination but also experience greater self-interest, which may promote behaviors aimed at aiding the self, even at the expense of others. This rationale suggests the following interaction effect:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The authors surveyed employees of work units in a variety of organizations in the southeast United States. Organizations ranged in size from six to 100,000 employees with an average of 31,171 employees. These organizations also ranged in size from a single work unit to 1,000 work units. Participants included employees from a wide variety of organizations and industries. These organizations contained work units characterized by low functional dependence (such as grocery stores), moderate functional dependence (such as insurance agencies and retail services), and high functional dependence (such as hospitals). Overall, the sample represents a diverse group of organizations across multiple industries, with both U.S. and international roots.</p>
<p>To collect the data, a contact person in each participating work unit was identified to hand-deliver survey packets to at least five employees and the supervisor of that unit. Depending on the availability and size of the work unit and organization, work units received seven or eight surveys, including the supervisors.</p>
<p>Contact persons were asked to distribute surveys randomly to work unit members. Respondents were assured of the confidentiality of their responses. To reinforce this point, participants were able to complete the surveys on their own time and in a location of their choice (including away from the organizational setting). Furthermore, they were able to mail their responses directly to the research team.</p>
<p>The research team contacted approximately 220 work units. In all, 128 work units from 116 organizations agreed to participate and received the surveys. From these work units, usable data were obtained from 113 work units across 101 organizations, resulting in a unit-level response rate of 51% with a total of 652 responses (average 5.77 surveys per work unit). Of these, 539 were employees and 113 supervisors. The employee sample was 49.1% male. Respondents had an average age of 29.03 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.49) and an average of 2.56 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.41) of experience with their department and 3.18 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.17) of experience in their organization. The supervisor sample was 55% male, had an average age of 36.93 (<italic>SD</italic> = 10.67) and an average of 5.91 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.54) of experience in the department and 8.63 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.85) of experience in the organization overall.</p>
<p>The sample included a variety of organizations ranging from small entrepreneurial firms to large corporations. This procedure resulted in a large range of work unit sizes, which varied from five to six people per work unit to hundreds of people per unit. The mean for the size of a work unit was 36 employees, although this number may not accurately reflect the central tendency in work unit size because of the presence of a few very large units. A better sense of the typical unit size in the sample may be reflected by the modal work unit size of six employees or the median unit size of 13 employees. Overall, about half of the total employees in the work units were represented in the sample (46%) and provided ratings about the variables of interest. (However, due to the variation in work unit size, the percentage of responses per work unit ranged from 100% for smaller work units to less than 1% for the very largest unit.)</p>
<p>Employees and supervisors in each department worked in the same physical work environment and interacted on a consistent basis. The employees rated statements about overall justice climate, functional dependence, general political behavior, and work unit size (control variable). The supervisor surveys assessed the level of workplace deviance in the entire work unit they managed.</p>
<sec id="section5-1059601113479399">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, all scales and items in the surveys were introduced to the participant with the following wording: “Remember, we’re most interested in how things work in your specific work unit/department. Please indicate the extent to which you agree or disagree with each statement.” This introductory sentence was provided to ensure participants were clear on the appropriate referent for all items. That is, because some items referred more broadly to “employees,” “others,” or “fellow workers,” participants were instructed to think about employees <italic>in their own work unit</italic> when responding to questions. This introductory statement and clarification of one’s work unit as a referent was provided to maintain consistency between the study’s theory and definitions (which focused on the work unit) and the established measures utilized in this study (some of which did not provide an explicit work unit focus).</p>
<sec id="section6-1059601113479399">
<title>Overall (In)Justice Climate</title>
<p>Overall justice climate was assessed with ratings provided by employees from the work unit. Consistent with other research in justice and teams, we employ a referent-shift consensus model to describe overall justice climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059601113479399">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601113479399">Colquitt, Noe, &amp; Jackson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601113479399">Cropanzano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1059601113479399">Naumann &amp; Bennett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1059601113479399">Seibert, Silver, &amp; Randolph, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1059601113479399">Spell &amp; Arnold, 2007</xref>). A referent shift refers to a modification in the target of a survey item (i.e., who is referenced in the item) prior to assessing agreement among individuals and aggregating the data to the group level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059601113479399">Chan, 1998</xref>). The referent of these items is therefore shifted away from employee perceptions of his or her own experiences, focusing instead on perceptions of others’ experiences in the work unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059601113479399">Ehrhart, 2004</xref>). Performing a referent shift creates a new construct that is conceptually distinct from the original individual-level construct. That is, overall justice ratings with a referent shift reflect a psychological collective climate that, when aggregated to the group level, forms an organizational-level construct (organizational collective climate). Chan argues that this referent shift practice should be used when researchers are interested in how an individual believes others are treated or perceive the work environment, rather than how the individual completing the survey item perceives these things. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601113479399">Klein and Kozlowski (2000)</xref> state this referent shift model is most appropriate in these cases because it best reflects the conceptual underpinning of group-level constructs like climate.</p>
<p>In all, we measured overall justice climate with the three referent-shift items (α = .70) contained in the 6-item overall justice scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601113479399">Ambrose and Schminke (2009)</xref>. Employees were asked to rate the extent to which they agreed with statements that dealt with how fairly the organization treats its employees. The items read as follows: “Usually, the way things work in this organization are not fair,” “For the most part, this organization treats its employees fairly” (reverse coded), and “Most of the people who work here would say they are often treated unfairly,” using a 5-point response format (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>).</p>
<p>Scholars have previously used three out of the six overall justice items to assess justice perceptions. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601113479399">Ambrose and Schminke (2009)</xref> showed in supplementary analyses that utilizing three items (three personal vs. three general experience items) resulted in the same pattern of results as when using all six items. Following Ambrose and Schminke’s findings, Ambrose and her colleagues examined individual perceptions of overall justice and employed three items in which the referent pertained to the individual only, excluding statements referring to the fair treatment of others in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1059601113479399">Melkonian, Soenen, &amp; Ambrose, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1059601113479399">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1059601113479399">Soenen, Melkonian, &amp; Ambrose, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>To create a measure of overall justice climate, individual ratings were aggregated to the group level, reflecting the average perception of organizational justice toward employees in the work unit. That is, scores of overall fairness were averaged across individual group members and the mean was used as the reflective group-level score of overall justice. However, prior to aggregation two things were verified: (a) that there were a sufficient number of respondents per unit to reflect unit-level perceptions and (b) that agreement among these respondents was sufficient to justify aggregation of the data to the unit level, as evidenced by multiple indicators of interrater agreement.</p>
<p>First, previous research indicates that three to five responses from a work group are sufficient to aggregate measures to the group level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059601113479399">Colquitt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1059601113479399">Newman &amp; Sin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1059601113479399">Richardson &amp; Vandenberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1059601113479399">Schminke, Ambrose, &amp; Neubaum, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1059601113479399">Schneider, Hanges, Smith, &amp; Salvaggio, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1059601113479399">Schneider, White, &amp; Paul, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1059601113479399">Schneider, Salvaggio, &amp; Subirats, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1059601113479399">Tracey &amp; Tews, 2005</xref>). The sample was comprised of sets of four to six members per unit who responded to these justice items. Therefore, each work unit sample contains sufficient data to reflect unit-level perceptions.</p>
<p>Second, interrater reliability and agreement within the work unit was assessed in two ways. Following previous climate research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601113479399">Liao &amp; Rupp, 2005</xref>), agreement was assessed by conducting a one-way ANOVA, which showed the level of between-group variance was significant for overall justice climate (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). This result indicates greater between-group variance compared with within-group variance, suggesting the existence of good interrater reliability.</p>
<p>In addition, within work unit agreement was assessed by computing intraclass correlation coefficients ((ICC(1), ICC(2)) and r<sub>wgs</sub> for the measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059601113479399">Bartko, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059601113479399">James, Demaree, &amp; Wolf, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1059601113479399">Shrout &amp; Fleiss, 1979</xref>). All of these indices are commonly used to justify aggregation to the group level. The ICC(1) compares the variance between units to variance within units, whereas the ICC(2) assesses within-unit variability. To accompany the ICC statistics, the r<sub>wg</sub> assesses the overall agreement among group members about the construct.</p>
<p>All of these indices rely on guidelines, often referred to as cutoff values, for judgments about whether aggregation is appropriate. Acceptable cutoff values are somewhat arbitrary and should be interpreted accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601113479399">LeBreton &amp; Senter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1059601113479399">Schneider et al., 1998</xref>). However, scholars suggest an r<sub>wg</sub> of .70 (or higher) for acceptable interrater reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059601113479399">James et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1059601113479399">Nunnally, 1978</xref>), and an appropriate value for ICC(2)s is .60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059601113479399">Glick, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1059601113479399">Ostroff &amp; Schmitt, 1993</xref>). Many researchers have argued that lower levels of agreement among raters are also acceptable for aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601113479399">Liao &amp; Rupp, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1059601113479399">Schneider et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1059601113479399">Tucker, 2007</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601113479399">LeBreton and Senter (2008)</xref> distinguished between moderate interrater agreement (.51-.70), strong agreement (.70-.90), and very strong agreement (.91-1.00).</p>
<p>The final indicator of agreement, ICC(1), can be interpreted as an effect size, ranging from .01 as a small effect to .10 as a medium effect and .25 as a large effect size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601113479399">Klein &amp; Kozlowski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601113479399">LeBreton &amp; Senter, 2008</xref>). Generally, ICC(1) ranges from 0-.50 with a reported median of .12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059601113479399">James, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1059601113479399">Ostroff &amp; Schmitt, 1993</xref>). Evidence suggests a “small” ICC(1) may reveal an underlying group effect, such that group membership affects individual ratings, and further investigation about the appropriateness of aggregation should be conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601113479399">LeBreton &amp; Senter, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The ICC and r<sub>wg</sub> statistics in this study confirm the appropriateness of aggregating overall justice climate scores. The ICC(1) and ICC(2) for the justice climate measure were .36 and .69, respectively. Furthermore, the r<sub>wg</sub> reflected a score of .75, also showing good within-group agreement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059601113479399">James et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601113479399">LeBreton &amp; Senter, 2008</xref>). In all, this evidence suggests aggregation was appropriate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1059601113479399">
<title>Functional Dependence</title>
<p>Functional dependence was assessed using Morris and Steers’ (1980) measure. The scale consists of three items (α=.78) on a 5-point scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). Employees responded to items such as “The kind of job I have requires that I work closely with others who have a job similar to mine,” “The way in which my fellow workers do their work has very little to do with whether or not I can do my job,” and “In order to do my job, I am very much dependent on my fellow workers to do their jobs, too.”</p>
<p>To create a measure of shared perceptions of functional dependence among employees in a work unit we employed a direct consensus model, in which individuals report on their own experiences, and these experiences are aggregated with other unit members’ perceptions to create a measure of the collective construct. Thus, similar to other group-oriented constructs (e.g., job interdependence, group identity), this measure asks individuals to report on their own experiences with other members of a work unit. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059601113479399">Chan (1998)</xref>, the direct consensus model represents the most common composition model for group-level researchers.</p>
<p>As with the overall justice measure, the one-way analysis of variance suggested good interrater reliability (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In addition, the intraclass correlation coefficients ICC(1) and ICC(2) for the functional dependence measure were .19 and .53, respectively, and the r<sub>wg</sub> was .73. These indices provide evidence for acceptable agreement among raters. Specifically, the ICC(1) provides a medium to strong effect size and a higher score than the median reported score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059601113479399">James, 1982</xref>). Moreover, the r<sub>wg</sub> exceeds the guideline value of .70. The ICC(2) is slightly lower than that of the overall justice measure. However, scholars have argued that a value of .50 or above is an acceptable level of group agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059601113479399">LeBreton &amp; Senter, 2008</xref>) and provides sufficient evidence for aggregation of the individual scores. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1059601113479399">Schneider et al. (1998)</xref> have argued that values slightly below common cutoff values are not low enough to prohibit aggregation. This belief carries through the organizational climate literature, such that group-level perceptions with slightly lower ICC(1) or ICC(2)s have commonly been aggregated (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601113479399">Liao &amp; Rupp, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1059601113479399">Schneider et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1059601113479399">Tucker, 2007</xref>). In all, the body of evidence suggests aggregation of the functional dependence measure was appropriate, as well.</p>

<title>Interpersonal Deviance</title>
<p>Interpersonal deviance was assessed using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059601113479399">Bennett and Robinson’s (2000)</xref> 7-item (α = .78) scale. Supervisors rated the frequency with which employees of the work group engaged in deviant behavior toward one another on a 7-point response format (1 = <italic>never</italic>, 7 = <italic>daily</italic>). Scale items include “Said something hurtful to someone at work” and “Physically threatened someone at work.”</p>
<p>When studying counterproductive or aggressive work behavior, one criticism in the literature has been the potential for common method variance. To counter this methodological concern, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1059601113479399">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsakoff (2003)</xref> suggested employing “other ratings” of these employee behaviors. That is, asking a different set of individuals (in this case, supervisors) to rate outcome variables, whereas employees rate the predictor variables. Podsakoff and colleagues note this solution eliminates the risk that social desirability tendencies, mood states, leniency effects, consistency motifs, or implicit theories on the part of participants will inflate or deflate observed relationships. Within the workplace deviance literature, researchers have turned to supervisor ratings of deviant acts they witness among their employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1059601113479399">Mawritz, Mayer, Hoobler, Wayne, &amp; Marinova, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1059601113479399">Thau et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>All of the variables reside at the group level, which is consistent with the theoretical rationale upon which our hypotheses rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059601113479399">Klein &amp; Kozlowski, 2000</xref>). Thus, to test the hypotheses, hierarchical ordinary least squares regression was utilized. Hypothesis 1 predicted overall injustice climate would be positively related to interpersonal deviance and general political behavior in work units. As is appropriate in interpreting regression results, the regression coefficients of the fully specified model (Step 3) were interpreted when examining the impact of both the main effect (overall justice climate) and the interaction term on negative group behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059601113479399">Echambadi, Arroniz, Reinartz, &amp; Lee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059601113479399">Echambadi, Campbell, &amp; Agarwal, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059601113479399">Echambadi &amp; Hess, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1059601113479399">Stone-Romero &amp; Liakhovitski, 2002</xref>).

<p>Hypothesis 2 predicted the relationship between overall injustice climate and negative outcomes would be stronger under conditions of low functional dependence. Results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059601113479399">Table 2</xref> reveal the interaction between organizational injustice and functional dependence is significant in predicting interpersonal deviance (β = −.19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and general political behavior (β = −.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The goal of this article was to explore antecedents of counterproductive work behavior in groups. Recent work points to contextual, rather than personal, influences on bad behavior in organizations. This article adds to this research stream by emphasizing emerging work in the organizational justice literature that points to the constructs of overall justice and justice climate as potent predictors of employee and organizational outcomes. That is, the construct of overall justice climate is introduced as an antecedent of counterproductive group behavior. The view of how contextual factors influence counterproductive behavior is further extended by considering the nature of the work itself—in the form of functional dependence—as a moderator of the relationship between overall justice climate and outcomes.</p>
<p>Results support the hypotheses. Group-level perceptions of overall fairness (overall fairness climate) exerted a significant direct effect on both interpersonal deviance and general political behavior in work groups. Functional dependence (the interdependence between team members when performing tasks) moderated both of these direct effects such that under conditions of low functional dependence, the relationship between injustice climate and work group misbehavior was significantly stronger than under conditions of high functional dependence. More specifically, when members of a work unit collectively perceived their work environment to be unfair, they were more likely to engage in political behavior and interpersonal deviance directed at members of their work unit when the work unit’s functional dependence was low.</p>
<p>These results represent contributions on several fronts. First, they contribute to the literature on counterproductive work behavior as a group-level phenomenon. The literature has been limited in determining antecedents of negative employee behavior in work units. This study shows that group-level characteristics, in the form of overall justice climate and functional dependence, are important predictors of deviant and political behavior of work groups.</p>
<p>The findings further add to the emerging literature of overall justice and the application of more general measures of justice that capture employees’ holistic justice perceptions. Previous justice research has tended toward exploring the impact of climates related to specific justice facets (e.g., procedural, distributive, and interactional justice) on positive and negative organizational outcomes such as organizational citizenship behavior and aggression (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059601113479399">Dietz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059601113479399">Liao &amp; Rupp, 2005</xref>). However, research and theory suggest that overall assessments of justice may more accurately capture the collective justice experiences of team members. They may, therefore, give us a more accurate understanding of how people perceive the fair treatment of their work group and how employees in a work group may react when they perceive the work environment to be unfair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059601113479399">Ambrose &amp; Schminke, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although overall justice has been established as a meaningful construct with predictive power beyond that offered by individual justice facets, research investigating how overall justice climate influences work outcomes has been limited. Previous research demonstrates that the work unit’s perceived fairness affects employees’ behaviors because the group’s fairness judgments influence important team processes, such as coordination, communication, and cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601113479399">Cropanzano et al., 2011</xref>). The present research advances this view by showing that overall justice climate perceptions exert influence on important behavioral outcomes that affect the performance of the work unit. Thus, this study not only extends research on overall justice but also justice at the group level by expanding our knowledge about the effects of overall justice climate on deviant and political work group behavior.</p>
<p>This work further suggests that these work unit processes may be shaped by the functional dependence of work unit members. The influence of contextual moderators has enjoyed recent attention within the overall justice and deviance literatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059601113479399">Duffy, Ganster, Shaw, Johnson, &amp; Pagon, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, structural components have been shown to influence the relationship between justice perceptions and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1059601113479399">Schminke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1059601113479399">Schminke et al., 2002</xref>). We posit that in units where functional dependence is low, communication, coordination, and support are likely lower than in work groups where functional dependence is higher and communication, coordination, and mutual support are encouraged and required for task achievement and performance. Fewer group interactions further increase self-interested motivations and may therefore foster negative group behavior.</p>
<p>In all, this work advances understanding of the source of counterproductive behavior in groups on both theoretical and empirical fronts. But it has practical implications, as well. The study shows that the context in which employees work plays a significant role in how group members may act toward each other and engage with one another. In particular, perceptions about how their work is organized (i.e., functional dependence) exert a significant influence on how employees react to perceived unfairness. The findings suggest that employees in work units with low levels of functional dependence who experience injustice are more likely to engage in wrongdoing as a result. This relationship describes a potential downside to group or work environments, which foster greater autonomy in employees’ task performance and planning. Generally, more flexibility and greater autonomy in the workplace might appear attractive to employees in many ways and are often praised for creating positive contributions to worker well-being and productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059601113479399">Hackman &amp; Oldham, 1976</xref>). This study shows that this may not always be the case.</p>
<p>At first glance, the results might suggest that managers consider restructuring work in ways that increase functional dependence. And in some cases, that response might represent a reasonable and useful response. However, work structures should be driven by factors beyond the desire and need to decrease negative, counterproductive, and self-serving behaviors. But in settings in which lower levels of functional interdependence are appropriate, managers and team leaders may want to facilitate face-to-face interaction among employees and share individual work assignments and achievements with the unit. Furthermore, managers could discuss and emphasize how each individual’s contribution adds to the goals of the organization, both indirectly and directly. Such conversations may help to mitigate some of the potential downsides of functional independence between workers.</p>
<sec id="section13-1059601113479399">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>All studies have limitations and this one is no exception. First, all data are cross-sectional. Hence, causality cannot be inferred, due to the fact that the data were collected at a single point in time. Second, because all data were collected via surveys, the study may be subject to common method variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1059601113479399">Podsakoff et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1059601113479399">Podsakoff et al. (2003)</xref> outline remedies for common method concerns on both procedural and statistical fronts. Procedurally, they advise obtaining measures of predictor and outcome variables from different sources. The data used in this study largely reflect this procedure. The predictor variables were all collected from employees, whereas one of the outcome variables (deviance) was collected from supervisors. Results were similar between the model in which the dependent variable was collected from supervisors and the model in which the dependent variable was collected from employees. This similarity provides additional evidence that common method variance may not represent a serious threat.</p>
<p>Third, we did not model or measure several of the constructs discussed in the theory development sections, which describe the processes by which these effects unfold. For example, the theoretical foundations describe injustice triggering fewer group interactions and engagement in group processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059601113479399">Cropanzano et al., 2011</xref>). Previous research demonstrates these effects clearly, but they were not measured in the study. Similarly, although our theorizing involved the role of self-serving motivations under conditions of low functional dependence, this study did not include measures of employees’ levels of motivation. The results of this study are consistent with the theoretical framework and extant research has provided empirical support for the theoretical perspectives called upon in this article. However, additional research will be needed to open the black box and determine the precise processes by which these effects unfold in this context.</p>
<p>Fourth, although the contact person was asked to randomly distribute the surveys to coworkers, the researchers were unable to track this behavior. Therefore, the study may be subject to a selection bias such that the contact may have provided surveys in a nonrandom fashion (e.g., to similar others), which may impact the level of agreement within groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1059601113479399">Schneider, 1987</xref>). Another concern about the sample may be the issue of representativeness. Not every member of each work group participated in the data collection. On average, the sample reflected responses from about half of the employees represented in the work units surveyed. But a few of the work units had large numbers of employees, which leads to the question of whether the sample of four to six employees per department may be an adequate representation of the entire work group. This shortcoming in the sample limits the ability to generalize the findings across these departments.</p>
<p>Finally, the sample lacks generalizability across cultures, as participants from other parts of the world were not part of this data collection effort. Replication and extension of this research across cultures paves an interesting way for future research.</p>

<sec id="section14-1059601113479399">
<title>Future Research</title>
<p>Research on counterproductive behavior in organizations has received considerable attention in recent years. In particular, interest in the contextual and relational drivers of bad behavior has increased. This research points to justice-related issues as relevant in those analyses, suggesting additional work may be warranted on several fronts to understand these phenomena more fully.</p>
<p>First, more needs to be known about the construct of overall justice climate and its ability to demonstrate predictive power either in lieu of, or in addition to, other (facet-specific) types of justice climate. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059601113479399">Ambrose and Schminke (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059601113479399">Jones and Martens (2009)</xref> show that at the individual-level perceptions of overall organizational justice predict outcomes above and beyond perceptions of specific facet types. But little is known about whether this finding holds at the climate level, as well, and how those effects may translate into understanding counterproductive behavior such as organizational-level deviance.</p>
<p>In addition to examining the predictive validity of overall justice climate above and beyond justice facets, future research should also focus on other important outcome variables besides negative work behaviors, including citizenship behavior, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, psychological well-being, and so on. Further research in these arenas will help to broaden the nomological net of the justice climate construct.</p>
<p>Research that continues to emphasize the relevance of context on organizational-level as well as individual-level outcomes is also encouraged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059601113479399">Johns, 2006</xref>). In this study, the contextual variable of functional dependence is introduced to the counterproductive work behavior and justice literatures, and it demonstrates that characteristics of the work itself matter. However, it would be naïve to think functional dependence represents the only work structure or group variable with this potential. For example, the reward structure of a work unit, or relational variables within the group (or between individual members and the supervisor), may provide fruitful avenues for future studies.</p>
<p>In this study, group-level phenomena are examined. However, it may also be useful to explore additional individual-level factors that might shape deviant and political reactions to work structure and workplace fairness. Some individuals may be more or less inclined to engage in deviant or self-serving behaviors depending on their personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1059601113479399">Tepper, Duffy, &amp; Shaw, 2001</xref>) or, as already noted, based on the relationship they hold with their supervisor or peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1059601113479399">Duffy et al., 2006</xref>). All of these areas represent fertile ground for cross-level theorizing and cross-level analyses in future studies.</p>
<p>Lastly, researchers may be able to correct some of the methodological limitations noted. Longitudinal designs would allow for stronger inferences of causality among these constructs. Explicit measurement of theorized mediation effects would do the same. Further, testing alternative mediation processes, such as social information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1059601113479399">Salancik &amp; Pfeffer, 1978</xref>), represents a promising avenue, as well.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Overall, this study makes several contributions to the group literature. It adds to the literature on counterproductive behavior in work groups by expanding the search for antecedents of bad behavior in teams to include the contextual factor of work group fairness. It extends the organizational justice literature by integrating work on justice climate with work on overall justice and exploring the impact of overall justice climate on counterproductive behavior in work units. Finally, this research contributes to both literatures by suggesting the nature of the work itself is relevant to understanding the reactions employees have to unfair conditions.</p>
