<p>The Code of Practice for Victims of Crime, introduced by the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, is portrayed as an important advance on the previous two Charters, particularly with regards to the complaints process available in cases where service providers breach these obligations. This article provides a detailed description of the Code’s complaints process as well as its functioning in order to evaluate its efficacy. The methodology behind this evaluation comprises several interviews with members of the Parliamentary Ombudsman’s office and analysis of legal documents such as statutes, case law, reports and the relevant academic literature on victims. The article argues that the Code’s complaints process is not an effective and adequate mechanism for victims of crime, since contrary to its aims, it is largely inaccessible, long, overly complex and does not provide sufficient guarantees of privacy and objectivity as well as adequate redress and remedies for victims when service providers breach their duties. Instead, victims of crime would benefit from the development of a new mechanism that is sensitive to their needs, values accessibility and objectivity and provides effective remedies to ensure redress and accountability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, there has been increasing debate among policy-makers, and within the media and the academy, on the role of victims in the criminal justice system. The traditional adversarial paradigm in common law jurisdictions between the State and the accused has become less rigid with the expansion of victims’ role in the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, various legal instruments have been enacted and policies introduced in common law jurisdictions that recognize that victims have certain rights within the system. Generally, these rights are classified in two categories: service and procedural rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748895811424765">Ashworth, 2010</xref>). Service rights can be defined as victim-oriented initiatives undertaken by criminal justice personnel that aim to facilitate the victims’ experience following the crime. They include respectful and sympathetic treatment, support, the provision of information, facilities at court and compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1748895811424765">Sanders, 2002</xref>). Procedural rights, on the other hand, remain controversial since they provide victims with a participatory role in the decision-making process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748895811424765">Edwards, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748895811424765">Erez and Roberts, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748895811424765">2009</xref>). They include opportunities to provide information and sometimes opinion on key criminal justice decisions on prosecution, bail/custody, sentence, parole release and licence decisions, largely accommodated by ‘victim impact’ or ‘victim personal’ statements.</p>
<p>In England and Wales, service rights have been recognized in charters that support the idea that agencies in the criminal justice system should comply with minimal service standards towards victims of crime. In recent years, the Home Office introduced the Code of Practice for Victims of Crime (the Code), established under a statute, the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, which replaced the previous Victims’ Charters of 1990 and 1996.</p>
<p>The current Code is the first instrument enacted under a statute which provides a comprehensive and detailed description of the minimum level of uncontroversial services that victims should expect from various service providers. These services mainly include information victims are entitled to receive within certain timeframes, but also protection, compensation and measures to facilitate respectful treatment from all criminal justice agencies. Research has shown that the need for victims to be kept informed throughout the process is considered one of their priorities. When service providers fail to inform victims about the criminal justice process and keep them up to date with ‘their’ case, studies suggest that victims can often suffer from secondary victimization by the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748895811424765">Newburn and Merry, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1748895811424765">Shapland et al., 1985</xref>: 190–191; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1748895811424765">Victim Support, 1990</xref>: 22).</p>
<p>Despite the importance of service rights and their uncontroversial nature to minimize secondary victimization, studies suggest that breaches of duties by service providers still occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748895811424765">Crawford and Enterkin, 2001</xref>), particularly with regards to the right to be kept informed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1748895811424765">Victim Support, 1995</xref>: 22; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1748895811424765">Wemmers, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1748895811424765">Victim Support, 2011</xref>). Thus, the Code of Practice was portrayed as an important development for victims of crime for its comprehensive information provisions and for expressly providing for the first time a mechanism by which victims of crime can address their complaints when service providers fail to respect their duties under the Code.</p>
<p>To date, most academic literature on victims focuses on the debate regarding the controversial procedural rights of victims, particularly the role of victims at sentencing with victim impact/personal statements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748895811424765">Ashworth, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748895811424765">Cassell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748895811424765">Edwards, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748895811424765">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748895811424765">Erez, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748895811424765">Hoyle, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1748895811424765">Manikis and Roberts, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748895811424765">Roberts, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1748895811424765">Roberts and Edgar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1748895811424765">Roberts and Erez, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748895811424765">Roberts and Manikis, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1748895811424765">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748895811424765">Sanders, 2004</xref>) and the integration of victims in restorative justice initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748895811424765">Crawford and Burden, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748895811424765">Cunneen and Hoyle, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748895811424765">Hoyle, 2008</xref>). The literature on victims’ rights and their enforceability remains underdeveloped in most common law jurisdictions. Thus, legal scholars have yet to address how the rights of victims can be <italic>enforced</italic> and whether some mechanisms of enforcement are more effective than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748895811424765">Hall, 2010</xref>). Some commentators have addressed the rationales behind the enforcement of state obligations by highlighting the importance of recognizing consequences when obligation breaches occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1748895811424765">Manikis, 2012</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1748895811424765">Jackson (2003)</xref> argues that in order for criminal justice agencies to take their duties seriously, consequences must be attached to non-compliance. In the United States commentators have suggested that individual victims should have legal standing, remedies and review processes available to enforce their rights (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748895811424765">Beloof, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748895811424765">Beloof et al., 2010</xref>) Despite the importance of these duties, very few mechanisms of enforcement and redress have been analysed and evaluated in the victims’ literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748895811424765">Manikis, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Without an effective mechanism of enforceability, victims run a greater risk of suffering from secondary victimization. Hence, victims have not only been victimized by the crime committed, the breach of information duties by service providers, but also victimized a third time by the absence of an effective mechanism to respond to this breach. In these circumstances, victims can feel even more powerless and suffer from further (secondary) victimization since there is nothing effective they can do to remediate these injustices.</p>
<p>The following article evaluates the Code’s complaints mechanism to determine whether it provides victims with an effective enforcement mechanism when service providers have breached their obligations under the Code. It begins with a brief historical overview of the policy aims behind this mechanism, followed by a description of the process and an analysis of its efficacy. It argues that its structural components render the process inaccessible, complex, lengthy and politically driven, leaving victims of crime unable to address their complaints effectively. False promises have yet again been made to victims of crime, leaving them without an effective redress mechanism when service providers fail to meet their obligations towards them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1748895811424765" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Understanding the complaints mechanisms’ historical ethos, its practical functioning as well as the needs of victims of crime are crucial elements to the evaluation of the process’ accessibility, objectivity and effectiveness in responding to victims’ complaints. A mixed methodology was used to collate the data, which included a predominantly empirical study (qualitative and quantitative) as well as a secondary source analysis (theoretical, historical and legislative documents) to complete my findings.</p>
<p>The collation of data for this small empirical study includes the completion of nine interviews/correspondences by electronic mail between October 2009 and July 2010 with two members of the Parliamentary Ombudsman’s office, namely a representative of the legal team and a Public Affairs Analyst. A jurisdiction adviser was also consulted by the Public Affairs Analyst for certain questions. These interviews were semi-structured and began by a series of precise questions about the functioning and quantitative information regarding the complaints that gave rise to further and follow-up queries. These follow-up exchanges took the form of informal discussions that allowed me to collect information on the practicalities of the process, understand its functioning and purposes as well as collate quantitative data to allow an evaluation of the process.</p>
<p>This research contains limits due to confidential data protections that cannot be shared or made available to the public. The Parliamentary Ombudsman is subject to the Data Protection Act and a statutory bar (section 11 of the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967) prevents the release of information obtained by the Ombudsman, or officers acting on her behalf, in the course of or for the purposes of an investigation. Nevertheless, I was able to obtain relevant quantitative data following a Freedom of Information request to the Parliamentary Ombudsman’s office, but was unable to view the complaints or obtain any information that would allow me to identify the complainants. Due to this limited access of data and time restraints, I was unable to identify the MPs that filed a complaint and thus did not interview MPs. Instead, I collated secondary sources, namely governmental and non-governmental reports as well as historical documents that allowed me to discover and understand the objectives as well as the functioning of the MP filter. Further, I attempted to contact the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and victim/witness care units to inquire on their handling of internal complaints, but was unable to conduct interviews due to their time restraints and unavailability for research purposes. The CPS, however, was able to provide me with information and written guidelines they are instructed to follow when they receive internal complaints by victims of crime. Despite its limits, this information sheds light on this specific internal mechanism’s functioning.</p>
<p>Further secondary sources were collated, namely legislation, guidelines, reports, historical documents a court decision on the Parliamentary Ombudsman and administrative law as well as criminological literature on victims’ needs. I collated this data by conducting a library-based legal research my mainly using the University of Oxford’s Solo databases as well as Westlaw.</p>

<title>Historical Overview and Aims behind the Code’s Complaints Mechanism</title>
<p>This section describes why the Parliamentary Ombudsman was selected to handle victims’ complaints despite other propositions. It also seeks to illustrate the importance of objectivity as a legitimizing value required by the adjudication process.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811424765">Paul Rock (2004</xref>: 539; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748895811424765">Home Office, 2001</xref>) has thoroughly researched the policy making behind the Code’s complaints mechanism and clearly describes these decisions. The following section draws on his work and summarizes key decisions in the political process.</p>
<p>Following the criticisms regarding the 1996 Charter’s unenforceability, in February 2001, the Home Office began consultations to create a new mechanism that would handle complaints in cases where agencies would be in breach. Initially, the creation of a Victims’ Rights Ombudsman was considered to handle complaints in situations of breaches. This proposition was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811424765">Rock (2004</xref>: 539) in the following terms:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>What might constitute a pragmatic compromise between the service standards of the 1996 Charter and ‘fully fledged rights’ would be the appointment of a Victims Ombudsman to consider complaints when the procedures of the individual agencies had been exhausted, and provide a neutral assessment of the performance of the CJ agencies and have the power to award compensation when s/he was satisfied that maladministration had taken place.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, after a meeting between the Home Office, the Cabinet Office and the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (Parliamentary Ombudsman or PO),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1748895811424765">1</xref></sup> this proposition was set aside based on insufficient guarantees of impartiality. Thus, according to the PO, the Charter review’s Victims Ombudsman proposition was a hybrid creation which was quite contrary to the Government’s own June 2000 review of public sector ombudsmen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811424765">Rock, 2004</xref>). Thus, recommendation 6.15 of this Review (the Colcutt Review; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811424765">Colcutt and Hourihan, 2000</xref>) stated that ‘An ombudsman’s function must remain grounded in addressing injustice caused to [<italic>sic</italic>] an individual and own-initiative investigation appears inconsistent with impartiality.’ In other words, the Parliamentary Commissioner suggested that the proposition to have the Victims Ombudsman’s role as champion of victims was incompatible with the notions of impartiality and neutrality as well as the adjudicative functions proper to an Ombudsman. In January 2002, he stated: ‘It would be impossible both to be a champion of a particular group and accepted as an impartial investigator of disputes between members of that group and other persons or organizations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811424765">Rock, 2004</xref>: 553). Additionally, the Parliamentary Commissioner in these discussions expressed his fear that the Victims Ombudsman would encroach on existing terrain already occupied by him as an independent investigator into complaints towards public administrators and public services. Essentially, to avoid losing terrain and to ensure objectivity, the PO placed considerable pressure on the Government to handle victims’ complaints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748895811424765">Home Office, 2002</xref>: 37).</p>
<p>Following these discussions, at the second meeting of the Victims’ Charter Review Working Group in January 2002, the Home Secretary decided to announce that the Victims Ombudsman/Commissioner’s model was clearly inconsistent with the implementation of the Colcutt Review, intended to become law in 2003–2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811424765">Rock, 2004</xref>). An Ombudsman/Commissioner whose role would be to investigate complaints and champion victims’ interests would be in direct contradiction with Recommendation 6.15, on the importance of impartiality. Objectivity was therefore portrayed as a crucial element for an Ombudsman model that would receive complaints from victims. The importance of impartiality was also emphasized in the White Paper <italic>Justice for All</italic>, which greatly contributed to the Code’s enactment and suggested that the Parliamentary Ombudsman would be responsible for handling complaints placed by victims and witnesses who were not satisfied that the Code had been followed.</p>
<p>Finally, in England, the Colcutt Review noted that the Ombudsman’s primary function was to continue to respond to <italic>individual grievances</italic>, as opposed to other jurisdictions in which the Ombudsman gives equal prominence to both individual complaints and general administrative difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748895811424765">Rock, 2004</xref>). In brief, the PO’s aims in England and Wales were to offer a ‘quick, inexpensive, informal, and investigatory path’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1748895811424765">Varuhas, 2009</xref>: 114) for victims of crime to address their individual grievances and obtain redress.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary Commissioner is an English body created under the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 (the Act) (PCA) which gives MPs access to an independent and authoritative investigator in order to protect the citizen efficiently from executive maladministration which results in injustice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748895811424765">Home Office, 1965</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the adoption of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 and the Code of Practice for Victims of Crime, special provisions have been added to the 1967 Act (Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967, s. 5(1B)(a)) to create a separate remit for the PO to address victims’ complaints under the Code. This separate remit rests on broadly the same principles as the ordinary remit for complaints about maladministration and therefore the content of the specific provisions for victims’ issues are very similar to the Ombudsman’s general remit. The jurisdiction adviser at the Ombudsman’s office, stated that this separate remit for victims was suggested by the Parliamentary Ombudsman during the January 2002 discussions with the Home Office because the term ‘maladministration’, used under the Act’s general remit, was rather vague and whether a breach under the Code could be defined as maladministration would have been open to interpretation (Ombudsman Communication with jurisdiction adviser, 2 June 2010). Thus, instead of referring to maladministration under this separate remit, the Act refers to breaches under the Code of Practice for Victims of Crime.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1748895811424765">
<title>Describing the Code’s Complaints Mechanism</title>
<p>In order to understand the complexity of the complaints process victims may be subjected to, it is fundamental to provide a description of this mechanism. The process is not clearly described in one document, and thus victims of crime may have to consult legislation as well as the Code to understand the various steps of the process. The following section describes the process to illustrate its complexity and provides an illustrated figure which facilitates better understanding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1748895811424765">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The first step to the complaints process is referred to as the internal complaints or local resolution and requires that the victim contacts the service provider directly. It is described in section 16.1 of the Code as the following:</p>
<fig id="fig1-1748895811424765" position="float">
<label>Figure 1.</label>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1748895811424765-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If the victim feels that any of the service providers has not delivered their obligations under the Code, they should discuss their complaint with the person they have been dealing with at that organisation. Following this, they should make a complaint through the internal complaints procedure of that service provider.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To illustrate the complexity of this initial procedure for victims, the CPS’s internal complaint process will be provided as an example.</p>
<sec id="section5-1748895811424765">
<title>The internal complaint to the service provider: The example of the CPS</title>
<p>If a victim wishes to complain about the way ‘her case’ has been handled by the CPS, the Code requires that she should start by writing to the CPS office that originally dealt with it and include as much information as possible related to the case. The CPS has tried to reduce the length of this process by committing itself to respond to complaints within three working days of receipt of the letter. If it cannot send a full reply within that time, it will acknowledge receipt of the letter and aim to provide victims with a full reply within 10 working days. If the victim remains dissatisfied with the CPS’s local office reply, she is advised to contact the Chief Crown Prosecutor for the Area. Complaints that cannot be resolved at an Area level should be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions or Chief Executive who will consider whether to send that complaint to another senior member of staff, or to a member of the Correspondence Unit who will draft a reply for the Director, or the Chief Executive’s approval. It is interesting to note that the Correspondence Unit does not usually consider any complaints that relate to an ongoing case, since this may interfere with court proceedings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1748895811424765">
<title>Referral by a Member of Parliament</title>
<p>If victims remain dissatisfied by the internal process, the Code (section 16.2) states that ‘they may refer the issue, through a Member of Parliament, to the Parliamentary Ombudsman for consideration’.</p>
<p>Thus, before having their complaint referred to the Parliamentary Ombudsman, victims must contact their Member of Parliament (the ‘MP filter’).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1748895811424765">
<title>Reaching the Parliamentary Ombudsman</title>
<sec id="section8-1748895811424765">
<title>Preliminary assessment by the PO</title>
<p>Once a complaint has finally reached the PO, all enquiries must undergo a preliminary assessment to determine whether the Ombudsman will accept an enquiry for investigation. This preliminary assessment includes looking at whether a complaint is ‘in remit’ (if it falls within the Ombudsman’s jurisdiction), is properly made and has initially exhausted all local complaints procedures (Ombudsman Communication, 22 December 2009).</p>
<p>Second, the Ombudsman must verify that a statutory requirement under the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 (the Act) about the processing of a complaint has been met: complaints must be made in writing to a Member of Parliament and referred to the Ombudsman by an MP, with the consent of the aggrieved and a request from the MP to investigate the complaint.</p>
<p>The substance of the complaint is not assessed without it being properly made. Where these requirements are not met, the case is referred back to the complainant, with advice about how they should proceed (for example, providing the name and contact details for the appropriate constituency MP, or information on the completion of local resolution) (Ombudsman Communication, 22 December 2009). In exceptional circumstances,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1748895811424765">2</xref></sup> the Ombudsman may waive the requirement for local resolution to be completed, as this is a policy contained in the Code, rather than a statutory requirement.</p>
<p>Even if these preliminary requirements have been met, the Ombudsman is not required to investigate all complaints referred to him for investigation, and does not do so (Ombudsman Communication, 22 October 2009). Hence, the Ombudsman has wide discretion to initiate, continue or discontinue an investigation. If a complaint succeeds in the preliminary assessment (as described earlier), then a further assessment takes place in which the Ombudsman exercises her specific and general discretion to determine whether the complaint is worth investigating.</p>
<p>Elements taken into consideration on the exercise of <italic>specific discretion</italic> are framed by the following questions (Ombudsman Communication, 22 December 2009):</p>

<title>The Ombudsman’s investigation and powers</title>
<p>Section 7(2) of the Act provides the Ombudsman with wide discretion to conduct investigations as she sees fit:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Every such investigation shall be conducted in private, but except as aforesaid the procedure for conducting an investigation shall be such as the Commissioner considers appropriate in the circumstances of the case; and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision the Commissioner may obtain information from such persons and in such manner, and make such inquiries, as he thinks fit, and may determine whether any person may be represented, by counsel or solicitor or otherwise, in the investigation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Ombudsman’s adjudicative process can be compared to the judicial process but with wider discretion. Her investigative powers are similar to those possessed by courts in continental jurisdictions, where judges have very broad powers to conduct their investigation. The Ombudsman can allow any person or public body appearing before her to be legally represented during the investigation. She can require witnesses to attend, examinations to take place under oath and possesses more extensive powers than courts to compel the production of documents.</p>
<p>While exercising her functions, the Ombudsman should respect procedural guarantees and principles of natural justice that render the adjudicative process fair and legitimate for all parties involved. The Department accused of maladministration/breach under the Code (s. 7(1) and 7(1A)) of the Act, has a right to be heard and can comment on any allegation.</p>
<p>Further, when the PO reaches a decision, she must write a <italic>report</italic> and send a copy to the Department (s. 10(2) and 10(2A) of the Act) as well as the MP (s. 10(1) of the Act) to inform them of her investigation findings or her reasons for not conducting an investigation. There is no statutory requirement to send the report to the victim/complainant.</p>
<p>The investigation should conclude, unless it is discontinued, with the issuing of a report that explains whether or not the complaint has been upheld. Except for any monitoring of compliance with the Ombudsman’s recommendations, this final step should be the end of the Ombudsman’s involvement in this process.</p>
<p>Finally, in cases where complainants are dissatisfied with the Ombudsman’s service or with the decision on an enquiry or the outcome of an investigation, they can request an internal review. If they remain dissatisfied after this internal review, they can request that a decision or report be judicially reviewed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1748895811424765">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Complaints Received by the Ombudsman under the Code</title>
<p>The number of complaints received by the Ombudsman provides some indication of the complaints mechanism’s accessibility for victims. This section will outline the number and type of complaints received by that agency, drawing on data collected from communications with the Ombudsman. The content of these complaints is confidential and could not be released, since investigations must be conducted in private and remain subject to a statutory bar contained in the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 (the Act). The effect of this statutory restriction renders this information inaccessible even under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. While this imposes limitations on empirical research, the Ombudsman was able to provide data on the important elements of this mechanism.</p>
<p>Since the Code came into effect on April 2006, few studies have been undertaken and the data collected remain very limited, particularly regarding the complaints process. In order to assess the types of cases that have been referred to the Parliamentary Ombudsman, nine interviews/correspondences by electronic mail were conducted with the Ombudsman. The data provided by her office build on the results of reports carried out by the Cabinet Office and the former Victims’ Champion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748895811424765">Casey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748895811424765">Payne, 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Concerns have been raised regarding the low number of complaints under the Code received by the Ombudsman in the past few years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1748895811424765">Reeves and Dunn, 2010</xref>). In 2007, the PO’s <italic>Annual Report</italic> records that three complaints about the police and two about the CPS have been received by the Ombudsman. Further, the report states that ‘we lack any firm evidence to suggest why the volume of complaints has not been as high as expected’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748895811424765">Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, 2007</xref>) The following year’s <italic>Annual Report</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1748895811424765">Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, 2008</xref>) lists only two complaints received under the Code, both about the National Probation Office, with identical results recorded in the 2009 <italic>Annual Report</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1748895811424765">Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, 2009a</xref>).</p>

<p>Where the Victims’ Code does apply, the available statistics paint a worrying picture. Only 46 complaints have been received by the Parliamentary Ombudsman since the inception of the Code in 2006.

<p>During the timeframe of my research, only 50 complaints relating to the Code had been received by the Ombudsman from 1 April 2006 until July 2010. From these 50 complaints, only two have been accepted for investigation, one of which was discontinued,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1748895811424765">8</xref></sup> while the other was fully upheld. Unfortunately, due to the privacy of this investigation, I was unable to receive further information on the case that was upheld or the follow-up and remedies that were suggested by the Ombudsman.</p>
<p>The remaining complaints were closed at the enquiry stage for various reasons: 16 complaints were rejected because they were ‘out of remit’, in other words an investigation was declined because the body complained against or the action complained about fell outside the Ombudsman’s jurisdiction. Eight complaints were rejected because they were judged ‘premature’ – the local complaint resolution was not exhausted (as described earlier, all internal review steps to the concerned agency must usually be met before the Ombudsman can consider a complaint). Further, the Ombudsman noted that ‘[a] number of cases are closed because the complainant failed to obtain a referral from an MP when advised that such a referral was required’ (Ombudsman Communication, 22 December 2009). Four complaints have been denied and closed because the complainant contacted the Ombudsman directly without previously obtaining an MP referral and did not return to the Ombudsman after being told they needed an MP referral within three months (Ombudsman Communications, 28 October 2009, 22 December 2009 and 19 July 2010). Six complaints, including the four closed for failure to obtain an MP referral, were closed after being withdrawn/referred back to the complainants (Ombudsman Communications, 28 October 2009 and 22 December 2009). Finally, five were declined after the Ombudsman used his general discretion, for reasons previously explained.</p>
<p>Further, information was provided on the mode of delivery used by complainants to contact the Ombudsman. It shows that only 16 complaints were referred by an MP, while the rest of the 34 complaints were initially made without the required MP referral by e-mail (twelve), by letter (five) and by telephone (nine). In eight cases information about the mode of delivery was unavailable (Ombudsman Communications, 22 December 2009 and 19 July 2010). See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1748895811424765">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>In some cases where enquiries were rejected, the Ombudsman provided suggestions on other possible steps the complainant could take to have their complaint examined. Examples of such circumstances were provided during our communication and include advising the complainant if another body or complaint handler may be able to assist them when the enquiry is out of remit and advising the complainant of what needs to happen for the Ombudsman to consider their complaint (i.e. wait for the internal process with the agency to cease, if it is considered premature, or contact an MP for referral) (Ombudsman Communication, 22 December 2009).</p>

<title>Evaluating the Code’s Complaints Mechanism and Its Implications for Criminal Justice</title>
<p>In order to evaluate the complaints mechanism provided in the Code, the relevant data obtained through various legislative documents, reports and communications with the Ombudsman will be analysed in this section. These results will be used to demonstrate the complexity and concerns regarding the accessibility of this process for victims of crime as well as the possible remedies and their limited ability to address victims’ needs. Finally, it is worth expanding this analysis and reflecting about what this case-study of the Code can teach us about these redress mechanisms being applied to criminal justice more generally.</p>
<sec id="section13-1748895811424765">
<title>Navigating through the complaints process</title>
<p>The previous section provides a description of the processing of victims’ complaints. Referring to the complexity of this complaint mechanism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748895811424765">Casey (2008</xref>: 15) stated that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>For victims who feel that the Criminal Justice System has not treated them as it should, there is a complex process for raising their concerns. In the first instance, they themselves must work out which particular agency they feel has let them down and complain to that agency. There could be up to 10 criminal justice agencies involved with a case but it is up to the victim to work out who has let them down, without recourse to any statutory help to navigate the complaints process. This is in sharp contrast to those accused of crime, who if their case is serious, can often acquire legal aid to pay solicitors throughout the process.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The considerable variability in internal complaints procedures across the different agencies and locales is also an important problem for victims under this mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748895811424765">Payne, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The Code is a lot clearer than its predecessors in identifying the agencies’ duties. However for someone who is not legally trained or familiar with the terminology, it may not be easy to identify the agencies responsible to perform certain duties and the ones that have not met their obligations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748895811424765">Payne, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The picture is further confused in those cases that have involved breaches by more than one agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748895811424765">Casey, 2008</xref>). The Ombudsman noted that sometimes two or more agencies are involved in breaches. For example, five complaints concerned the actions of the CPS and the police. In such cases, the complaint process is hard to navigate, particularly in the first stage which requires that the victim identifies and approaches the <italic>relevant</italic> agency. In cases where a number of agencies have breached their duties, it can take considerable time for victims to contact all the relevant agencies, or even identify and make the links between the various agencies that should be sharing information and duties. Unlike a legal claim in which many agencies can be listed when it is not clear which particular one breached its duty, this complaint mechanism requires from the very beginning of the process the specific identification of the agency at fault.</p>
<p>Further, once the identification process is successful, victims will have to exhaust all internal recourses to the identified agency. The CPS’s example, discussed earlier, illustrated the number of steps required before complaints are reviewed by an objective body represented by the Ombudsman. In other words, the internal complaint process remains for some time within the remit of the agency alleged to have breached the Code and therefore does not provide outside scrutiny by an impartial observer. A victim who has to file her complaint to various sub-departments in that agency may be under the impression that this process lacks objectivity and decide to discontinue the pursuit of this complaint.</p>
<p>Even if a particular agency takes steps to speed up its own internal review process, it remains a lengthy process. In cases where victims’ interests have been ignored – which includes information breaches – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748895811424765">Payne (2009</xref>: 33–34) found throughout her interviews with victims, that they would rather seek immediate redress as soon as breaches occur, instead of undertaking the lengthy process provided in the Code:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I also found a tendency to engage formal complaints processes where what was really wanted by the victim or witness was straightforward redress of whatever they perceived the problem to be. The majority of victims I met who were unhappy with the CJS would have been satisfied if the issue had been resolved early on and did not wish to enter into a formal complaints process. A common issue was lack of information or disagreement with a decision that could have been rectified by the appropriate agency communicating with the victim and having an open dialogue.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Instead, we have seen that the disconnect between victims’ remedial needs and the Code is confirmed by the CPS’s internal complaints mechanism that specifically states that their Correspondence Unit does not usually consider any complaints that relate to an ongoing case, since this may interfere with court proceedings. Victims in these circumstances will therefore have to wait for the criminal process to be over before launching a complaint, instead of getting a response to their needs quicker and more efficiently.</p>
<p>Finally, the fact that victims must address their complaints to an MP instead of directly sending them to the Ombudsman adds another layer of complexity and limits the accessibility of the complaints process.</p>
<p>The combination of these complex structural elements is likely to discourage victims from taking their complaints further. The very low number of complaints received by the Ombudsman suggests the need for a more simple remedial mechanism that takes into account the interests and needs of victims. Considering the enormous numbers of victims who become engaged with the criminal justice system each year it is inconceivable that the small number of complaints received by the Ombudsman is due to a near universal satisfaction amongst victims with the service received from the various criminal justice agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748895811424765">Payne, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The Ombudsman’s procedure was designed to be quick and as informal as possible to facilitate accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748895811424765">Home Office, 1965</xref>), but this analysis suggests that the process is long, overly complex and insufficiently accessible, particularly for individuals that are unfamiliar with the justice system and the administrative process, leading inevitably to victim dissatisfaction with the criminal justice system. Dissatisfaction is already felt towards the system and the difficulty in making a complaint can only ‘lead to more damaging consequences for both individuals and agencies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748895811424765">Payne, 2009</xref>: 34).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1748895811424765">
<title>The MP filter: A barrier for achieving justice and responding to victims’ needs</title>
<p>This next section argues that the MP filter is a needless structure that politicizes the process and threatens the complaint mechanism’s value of impartiality. The rationale behind the MP filter is briefly described, followed by evidence that this structure does not accomplish its initial aims but rather creates important barriers for victims and jeopardizes the process’ objectivity.</p>
<sec id="section15-1748895811424765">
<title>The MP filter: Constitutional symbol of parliamentarism</title>
<p>In the United Kingdom, Parliament was traditionally chosen to be the most important channel for making representations to the Executive about grievances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1748895811424765">Whyatt Committee Report, 1961</xref>). Early political discussions in 1966 on the creation of a Parliamentary Ombudsman made clear that the Ombudsman had to follow ‘high constitutional principle’ by respecting the British parliamentarian tradition and avoiding foreign models.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1748895811424765">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>MPs have therefore played an important role in handling individual complaints and protecting citizens’ rights, a practice which continues today. The presence of the MP filter remains a structural component of the Code’s complaint process and the Parliamentary Commissioner’s Act requires victims to refer their complaints to an MP before reaching the Parliamentary Ombudsman. This structure remains controversial and it has recently been suggested by the Ombudsman that ‘the anachronistic barrier to citizen access it now represents outweighs its symbolic value’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748895811424765">Abraham, 2008a</xref>: 543). The following sections describe how this filter represents an important obstacle for victims of crime that wish to complain about an injustice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1748895811424765">
<title>The MP filter: A barrier to efficiency and accessibility</title>
<p>One of the subsidiary reasons provided by policy-makers for the MP filter was to, where reasonable, avoid an overload of cases received by the Ombudsman. MPs would therefore do the initial screening to resolve certain complaints more expeditiously with the Minister through the use of parliamentary methods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1748895811424765">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Instead of contributing to expediency, however, the filter lengthens the process and makes it inefficient for victims of crime. Thus, despite the filter, many victims still send their complaints directly to the Ombudsman who ends up returning their complaints in order to obtain an MP referral. Sir John Foster, one of the filter’s rare opponents in 1966, rightly predicted this outcome and qualified it as ‘rather needless waste’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1748895811424765">Standing Committee B, 1966</xref>). Results have shown that as many as <italic>34</italic> complaints were addressed directly to the Ombudsman without an MP referral and were sent back to complainants (Ombudsman Communications, 28 October 2009 and 19 July 2010). According to the Parliamentary Commissioner Act (s. 5(1) (1A)), the Parliamentary Ombudsman can only consider a complaint referred by an MP, thus preserving Parliament’s primacy.</p>
<p>Further, there is no need to control the amount of complaints sent by victims since a very low number have been sent in the first place. The MP filter does not provide victims with an effective complaint mechanism, since different political priorities may hinder the process. For instance, the Ombudsman stated in her appearance before the Public Administration Select Committee (PASC) (the Committee), that when Parliament dissolves prior to the General Election, there will be a period of at least five weeks where individuals will not be able to bring their complaints due to the absence of MPs to refer their complaint. This period will certainly be even longer in constituencies with new Members who are unfamiliar with the Ombudsman system, since they will need time to arrange an office that can handle this casework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748895811424765">PASC, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1748895811424765">2009b</xref>). For this reason, the Committee suggested the removal of the MP filter in its report entitled <italic>Parliament and the Ombudsman</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1748895811424765">PASC, 2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>Clearly, the MP filter creates an important barrier to <italic>direct communication</italic> between victims and the Ombudsman. Communication with complainants is a fundamental step to the understanding and resolution of complaints in order to achieve justice. When complaints have to be passed on by an intermediary, important elements may get lost in the process. The Ombudsman confirmed these concerns and stated that ‘the Ombudsman has regularly called for the removal of the MP filter in her speeches and articles because of the barrier it puts in place between the Ombudsman and the citizen’ (Ombudsman Communication, 8 February 2010). Similarly she suggested that ‘when it comes to the practical relationship between the Ombudsman and the aggrieved citizen, the MP filter does rather interpose an unhelpful barrier and threatens to undermine the investigative and adjudicative authority of the Ombudsman’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748895811424765">Abraham, 2008b</xref>: 375).</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, after completing her investigation, the Ombudsman must disclose the report with her findings to the Department whose actions have been investigated as well as to the MP who referred the complaint (ss. 10(2) and 10(2A) of the PCA). Complainants and victims of crime can therefore be excluded from this since there is no statutory requirement that the findings be made available to them. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895811424765">Kirkham (2008</xref>: 260) states:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>because the ombudsman process leads to the complainant losing control of his or her complaint once it has been submitted to the ombudsman … it seems highly probable that this level of disconnection with the resolution of the complaint heightens the frustration of complainants who do not succeed through the ombudsman route.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For victims of crime this disconnection can have particularly important consequences considering they usually launch a complaint because they have been excluded from the criminal justice process. This form of re-exclusion can certainly add insult to injury, which can also explain the low referral to this mechanism.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1748895811424765">
<title>The MP filter as a barrier to objectivity: Protecting vested interests and politicizing the complaints process</title>
<p>The present section argues that the filter threatens the complaints process’ objectivity. Objectivity has been at the heart of the Code’s complaints mechanism and confirmed by the Colcutt Review. Ostensibly, for the Code’s policy-makers, objectivity was a fundamental trait that an adjudicator had to possess in order to investigate legitimately victims’ complaints. This fundamental value legitimizes the Ombudsman’s investigative and adjudicative functions. However, despite the importance of objectivity, the MP filter serves, above all, the interests of MPs and politicizes the complaints process.</p>
<p>Since the creation of the PO, the MP filter has been deeply embedded in serving political interests. As seen earlier, the filter was seen as a means to protect the MPs role as a champion of individual grievances. Earlier discussions reflected the important worries that the Ombudsman would undermine the MPs’ traditional role and their relations with the public. They feared that by giving citizens direct access to the Ombudsman they would not write to their MP and would by-pass the parliamentary institution. MPs’ self-importance was at risk and backbenchers needed to legitimize their role by increasing their power and influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811424765">Gregory and Alexander, 1972</xref>: 324–325).</p>
<p>Priority is therefore placed on legitimizing the MP’s role instead of ameliorating the complaints process by addressing victims’ needs and resolving Code breaches that lead to injustices. For MPs, satisfying their electoral base and legitimizing their role are important priorities that serve their interests. Victims and other agencies are not the priority unless they coincide with the MP’s agenda.</p>
<p>Further, since victims can refer their complaints to any MP, political tensions among MPs can be expected. To gain political points, this may incite MPs to refer cases automatically to the Ombudsman, which would render the filter pointless for some and enforced for others. Complainants can also approach a Member in a political party they support who may automatically accept a referral to the Ombudsman for political gain. On the other hand, this political filter may become a permanent barrier for victims who have complaints but who wish to remain apolitical and avoid MPs. For example, many victims have very important privacy concerns and may not want to expose their complaints to an MP. Based on the data provided, 34 out of the 50 complaints were initially sent without an MP referral. Four complaints were closed because they failed to return with an MP referral within three months. This is quite concerning, since not many complainants use this mechanism in the first place and from the ones who do, quite a few are sent back because they have not been referred by an MP. The PO explained that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[w]here complainants come to us without a referral, we inform them about the requirement. Some complainants then come back to us with an MP referral, others don’t … If they do not get an MP referral then the complaint is closed as withdrawn. (Ombudsman Communications, 14 July 2010 and 19 July 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many reasons can explain the fact that some complainants do not come back with a referral. It may be that the MP refuses to provide a referral, or that victims may not want any MP’s involvement in the process. Finally, they may decide to abandon the process because it is lengthy.</p>
<p>The MP filter politicizes the process and can encourage Members to act as victim champions. MPs with a victim-oriented agenda can therefore devote substantial resources to equipping their staff and advertising their cause in order to attract cases and justify their utility in the public eye. Political gain can therefore motivate MPs to use victims to advance their interests instead of focusing on victims’ needs. The filter’s role illustrates the claim that new victim policies do not seek the interests and voices of individual victims or even victims’ groups, but rather those of a political projection of victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748895811424765">Garland, 2001</xref>). They do not seek to address victims’ needs by focusing on ‘what works’ but rather deploy efforts to achieve ‘what looks good’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1748895811424765">Reeves and Dunn, 2010</xref>: 57) to advance their political interests.</p>
<p>Today the MP filter is a symbolic structure serving politicians, without a legitimate purpose, and represents an important obstacle for victims of crime. Despite surveys that have shown ‘almost universal dissatisfaction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748895811424765">Colcutt and Hourihan, 2000</xref>: 20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748895811424765">PASC, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1748895811424765">2009b</xref>) with the MP filter and recommendations for its removal, this structure remains in place and hinders the Code’s complaint process. ‘As a matter of urgency’ a single clause to the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill could easily achieve such a change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1748895811424765">PASC, 2009b</xref>: 4). Victims are still waiting for this change, suggesting that their needs are not considered a priority.</p>
<p>In brief, since complaints filed by victims of crime are different from other types of complaints investigated by the PO, the Parliamentary arena and the existing ‘constitutional arrangements’ are not effective forums and instruments to remediate breaches caused to victims of crime by the Executive. These complaints involve a group of complainants that require special measures of protection, including the highest degree of confidentiality. Instead, the current mechanism requires that victims address their complaints to MPs before reaching an impartial adjudicator, and often require parliamentary involvement at the remedial phase. These requirements can certainly be enough of a burden to discourage them from coming forward with their complaints.</p>

<title>The Ombudsman’s legally unenforceable recommendations as a ‘servant of Parliament’</title>
<p>The Ombudsman’s investigation process and wide discretion are important elements that legitimize the process and contribute to apparently reliable findings and recommendations. Based on wider constitutional agendas, the Ombudsman serves ‘the dual function of upholding the rights of citizens in their dealings with the public sector while encouraging the promotion of good administration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748895811424765">Kirkham et al., 2008</xref>: 527).</p>
<p>Despite the Ombudsman’s legitimate and reliable recommendations, in a recent court decision, justices confirmed that the Parliamentary Ombudsman is not a court or a parliamentarian and therefore has limited powers in implementing her decisions (<italic>R (on the application of Bradley) v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</italic> (Pensions case)). The Court emphasized the political nature of the Parliamentary Ombudsman and therefore as an institution at the service of Parliament, the Ombudsman can hold the Executive to account through Parliament. The Act creates a mechanism for securing principally <italic>political accountability</italic>, but this suggests that her decisions are not legally binding.</p>
<p>Thus, the Ombudsman in her report can suggest a remedy to the department in order to <italic>remediate</italic> the injustice. These remedies are listed in the Ombudsman’s document entitled <italic>Principles for Remedy</italic> and include the following:</p>
<list id="list3-1748895811424765" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>an apology, explanation and acknowledgement of responsibility;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>remedial action, which may include reviewing or changing a decision on the service given to an individual complainant; revising published material; revising procedures to prevent the same thing happening again; training or supervising staff; or any combination of these;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>financial compensation for direct or indirect financial loss, loss of opportunity, inconvenience, distress or any combination of these.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The document also provides a clear and detailed way to calculate financial loss as well as interest rates. When proposing a remedy, the Ombudsman’s underlying principle is to ‘ensure that the public body restores the complainant to the position they would have been in if the maladministration or poor service had not occurred. If that is not possible, the public body should compensate them appropriately’ (Ombudsman, no date).</p>
<p>The type of remedies the Ombudsman proposes can effectively remediate injustices and breaches under the Code, but since the Ombudsman is a ‘servant to Parliament’, these suggestions are legally <italic>non-binding</italic>. When the Department in breach fails to provide a remedy, the Ombudsman can choose, if she thinks fit, to lay before each House of Parliament a <italic>special report (ad hoc report)</italic> upon the case. This process is separate however and adds another layer of complexity to the process. Due to space constraints the effectiveness of this process and the implications of the Pensions court case cannot be analysed in this article and will be left for another day.</p>

<title>The Code’s redress mechanism and its implications for the criminal justice system</title>
<p>The Code’s redress mechanism has important implications for victims, criminal justice agencies and the criminal process in general. In England and Wales, relationships between victims’ rights and criminal justice agencies have been primarily based on co-operation and discussion. The enforcement mechanism available for victims under the Code is no exception – as it espouses a collaborative philosophy based on political persuasion. The PO process in itself is an informal dispute-resolution process which engages in thorough fact-finding investigations and political persuasion – based in the spirit of communication and co-operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895811424765">Kirkham, 2008</xref>). What does this case study on the Code teach us about this type of redress mechanism being applied to criminal justice more generally? Since criminal justice agencies are considered government agencies, it is worth examining the effects of persuasion on such agencies and its limits in the context of criminal justice.</p>
<sec id="section20-1748895811424765">
<title>Persuasion and government agencies</title>
<p>Arguably for some organizations, <italic>persuasion</italic> may be preferable to coercion and therefore codes can be more effective means of securing acceptance and compliance than law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748895811424765">Ganz, 1987</xref>). For instance, studies on enforceability have shown that persuasive models, such as various ombudsmen are usually successful and taken seriously by governments that generally comply with their findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748895811424765">Hertogh, 2001</xref>). Not all ombudsmen models are the same and some are more successful than others, but positive results have often been generally noted. For instance, in England and Wales, researches on the PO demonstrate that the Government usually accepts and acts upon the PO’s reports and findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895811424765">Kirkham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748895811424765">PASC, 2009a</xref>). The PO is found to be the most convincing Ombudsman in England and Wales since it must report to the PASC, which is claimed to be the most independent minded of all Parliamentary Committees. To be persuasive, Ombudsmen engage in discussions and co-operation with the Executive more frequently than courts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895811424765">Kirkham, 2008</xref>). Particularly when dealing with the PO – who aims at securing accountability with political discourse – this political process entails the exchange and debate of many viewpoints including state institutions and the media as a way to scrutinize the Government’s decision. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895811424765">Kirkham (2008)</xref>, at its best the Ombudsman technique can even help facilitate long-term administrative reform by engaging public authorities in the process of identifying flaws in their administrative processes. This process of engagement is easier to undertake precisely because the Ombudsman is not perceived as a court. Thus over the years, the PO as an enforcement mechanism has provided effective redress for many complainants whose conflicts fell within the PO’s remit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895811424765">Kirkham, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1748895811424765">
<title>The limits of persuasion in the context of criminal justice</title>
<p>Despite its successes, however, the persuasive approach has its limits with regards to individual redress provided to victims of crime. The PO’s successes and degree of effectiveness may not be generalizable and may vary from types of complainants, governmental agencies involved and contexts under which the mechanism operates. For instance, the current case-study on the Code of Practice illustrates that in some respects this enforcement mechanism in its current form may not be suited for individual victims and the criminal justice context.</p>
<p>First, the present case study on the Code of Practice illustrates that the complaints mechanism enacted in England and Wales may not be structurally adapted for individual victims and thus may be less effective and accessible for them. As seen, victims often have problems understanding the complex process and the MP filter is an additional obstacle which remains present within this structure. Further, victims of crime have specific needs that are different, in many respects, to those held by other complainants that use the PO’s mechanism to address their complaints. For instance, as mentioned previously, many of them have privacy concerns and thus may not want to involve the political process.</p>
<p>Second, since this mechanism is separate to the criminal process and can only be invoked once the criminal process has ended it can be inefficient to redress information breaches and prevent new ones from occurring. A redress mechanism that operates before the criminal process has ended can indeed remediate information breaches at an early stage of the criminal process and prevent further breaches from taking place. It can also respond to victims’ need for speedy remedial mechanisms expressed by them to the Victims’ Commissioner.</p>
<p>Once a complaint surpasses the initial obstacle-course and reaches the investigation stage however and the PO makes recommendations for redress, the redress process for victims may have more chances of succeeding since criminal justice agencies may become more persuaded to follow these recommendations. In effect, past experience in areas that fall within the PO’s remit has shown that there is a high acceptance rate among government agencies with regards to the PO’s findings and recommendations. However, the data collected for this case-study suggest that only two complaints reached the investigation stage of the PO process and all the others were closed for various reasons identified above. There is therefore room to suggest that the process as a whole and its structural components may not be as effective for victims as it may be for other complainants within the PO’s remit.</p>
<p>Further, the literature on enforcement has suggested that persuading the Executive in some areas, namely in relation to public authorities and local government has been very difficult to achieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748895811424765">Ganz, 1987</xref>). It is therefore not surprising that the legally enforceable rights discourse has been proposed over the years as an alternative solution to the persuasive option. In that sense, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748895811424765">Ganz (1987</xref>: 104) states that ‘when there has been a breach in the observance of conventions, there may be a call for embodying them in legislation’.</p>
<p>Finally, despite the PO’s successful persuasive mechanism, there are important examples of individual cases in which the Executive has not only avoided its duties but has also left individuals without redress following the PO’s findings and recommendations (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748895811424765">Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1748895811424765"><italic>R (on the application of Bradley) v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</italic>, 2008</xref>). Space limitations and time constraints do not allow an analysis of these cases and will therefore be left for another day. Commenting on these situations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748895811424765">Kirkham (2008</xref>: 261) notes that ‘it is an unfortunate truth that public systems cannot be built around individual cases’. If this were to happen in a case under the Code, victims’ individual needs would severely be undermined, which would increase the probability of secondary victimization suffered by victims. As stated by the JUSTICE committee, criminal justice agencies should be accountable not only to society and the State, ‘but also to <italic>each</italic> individual member of society who comes into contact with criminal justice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748895811424765">JUSTICE, 1998</xref>: 111, emphasis added). To achieve this important task and avoid further secondary victimization, effective reforms to the current enforcement mechanism that focuses on victims’ needs must be made.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Pursuant to the Code’s complaints mechanism, victims can now bring their complaints through their MPs to the Parliamentary Ombudsman who has important powers to investigate their complaints properly and provide recommendations to the Government. Based on research findings, this article argues that structural components – namely the local resolution and the ‘Member of Parliament filter’ – render the complaints process insufficiently accessible and overly complex for victims. Further, historical elements seem to suggest that elements of this mechanism serve to politicize the process and threaten the mechanism’s impartiality. MPs are not necessarily equipped to deal with individual grievances related to victims of crime. They are more experienced in raising Parliamentary Questions, dealing with certain systemic issues or raising a matter on the adjournment. Scholars have stated that ‘no one takes a grievance to his MP so that it may be made the subject of a Question in Parliament’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748895811424765">Gregory and Alexander, 1972</xref>: 331). This may be particularly true for victims of crime since their complaints often contain private elements that they may not wish to share in the public arena. As Lord Justice Wall opined in the Pensions case (2008: 141), the applicants’ ‘remedy is political, not juridical’.</p>
<p>Finally, this study lends support to the claim that the Ombudsman’s investigation process and wide discretion are important elements that legitimize the process and contribute to apparently reliable recommendations. However, since the Ombudsman merely acts as a ‘servant to Parliament’ these recommendations are legally unenforceable. Despite the Parliamentary Ombudsman’s successful track record with regards to persuading public agencies, there have been cases where the PO’s recommendations were ignored which would be very detrimental to the criminal justice system if it were to happen in the Code’s context. Thus, the mechanism’s complexity coupled with its inability to remediate injustices adequately suggest that reforms must be made to provide victims with a more accessible and effective mechanism that adequately responds to breaches under the Code. This mechanism further illustrates claims defended by the vast criminological literature which suggests that victims can and might be used in the service of system efficiencies and system legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748895811424765">Crawford and Goodey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748895811424765">Elias, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748895811424765">Fenwick, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748895811424765">Garland, 2001</xref>). Without an effective mechanism, obligations under the Code will be considered false promises – often benefiting the political system – that may end up further re-victimizing victims of crime.</p>

<p>In general, the Ombudsman will not investigate a complaint sent to an MP more than 12 months after the complainant was aware of the facts giving rise to the complaint.

<p>Ombudsman Communication, 1 April 2010: an alternative legal remedy refers to the possibility of taking a complaint to a court or tribunal which could provide the remedy the complainant is seeking. This includes cases where the complainant initiates his/her own legal action or when he/she has a designated statutory right of appeal. The Ombudsman only has jurisdiction in cases where a full legal remedy has not been provided. This includes circumstances where a remedy is not available, where it has been pursued unsuccessfully, where the complainant has decided not to resort to it and where the complainant did not know that one was available. In these specific cases the Ombudsman’s jurisdiction and discretion allows her to decide whether or not she should consider the complaint.</p>
