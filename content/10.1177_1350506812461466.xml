<p>By now, discussions about transnationalism have been on the social sciences’ research agenda for almost two decades. In their path-breaking work <italic>Nations Unbound: Transnational Projects, Postcolonial Predicaments and De-territorialized Nation States</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350506812461466">Linda Basch, Nina Glick Schiller and Cristina Szanton Blanc (1994)</xref> have challenged the long-time belief that migration is a linear project of <italic>emigration</italic> from a particular country to <italic>in-migration</italic> into another one, in which membership to one nation is superseded by belonging and acculturation to a new one. In their intervention the authors have criticized this view as short sighted and in denial of a range of processes that occur in the interstices between emigration and immigration, of the cultural, economic and material movements, exchange practices and mutual interferences that challenge the traditional conception of a nation-state as container. Since then new work on transnationalism has been published at frequent intervals. The term ‘methodological nationalism’, first introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1350506812461466">Andreas Wimmer and Nina Glick Schiller (2002)</xref>, underlined the critique of social sciences’ use of the nation state as a primary and often implicit, unexplained frame of reference and launched the concept of transnationalism as a new way of theorizing processes of mutual permeation, changing perceptions of space, territory, states, goods and notions of belonging and citizenship.</p>
<p>Over the last 20 years, the question whether transnationalism is just a fashionable proxy for globalization or internationalization, camouflaging the ongoing power relations between social groupings and struggles within or between nation-states or whether it is a new phenomenon of the 21st century which derives its significance from the rise of mobility and migration movements and accessibility of new forms of networks and technologies has been the subject of heated discussions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350506812461466">Faist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1350506812461466">Vertovec, 2009</xref>). While the dispute about the significance of transnationalism to understand changes of social life on a global scale is in full swing, gender studies scholars have been using the term widely, both as a theoretical and analytical tool (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350506812461466">Mahler and Pessar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350506812461466">Pessar and Mahler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350506812461466">Salih, 2003</xref>). From a European perspective, the notion of transnationalism requires attention to both national contexts within Europe, as well as the countries of emigration, and the level of European governance which affects the constitution of gender relations in legal practice, in social movements, as well as through migration regimes which are regulated by both European and national aspects.</p>
<p>The articles in this special issue show that the transnational is a category of analysis which is relevant for the understanding of gendered processes in various sites and on various levels. This reaches from supra-national and national as well as civic and educational <italic>institutions</italic>, to <italic>social movements</italic>, and to the level of <italic>family relationships and constructions of self</italic>. These articles look at how sustained relationships of exchange between individuals, between and within families and households, institutions and social movements in a transnational space shape gendered relations. Moreover, they show that the ways in which people identify and ‘do’ gender relate to multiple points of reference within transnational spaces. Alternative visions of gender relations as well as restrictive views of gender are increasingly constructed and validated in a transnational frame. This influences the relationship between national identities, gender relations and the symbolism of gender, family and ‘proper’ or ‘liberal’ conceptions of sexuality. Furthermore, multiple intersecting social divisions of class, racialization, ethnicity, generation and others shape and mark gender and sexual differences.</p>
<p>While the intersection of transnationalism and gender lies at the heart of this special issue, the articles that follow analyse it on different levels of the social. Garcia del Moral and Korteweg as well as Zontini and Madziva look through very different lenses and case studies at how (trans)-national legal practices challenge <italic>the governmentality</italic> of gendered relations and the article by Binnie and Klesse shows how transnational social movements help to fight gender and sexuality discrimination in their institutionalized form. The next three articles, by Erel, Szczepanikova and Phoenix and Bauer, look at different aspects of migrants’ gendered family relations in the European transnational field. The reader will see that the articles in this issue speak to one another in that they all make very clear their particular understanding of the interrelation of gender and transnationalism.</p>
<p>The first article, by Garcia del Moral and Korteweg, deals with the question whether and how transnationalism can help us in thinking through the governmentality of gendered relations. In particular with respect to reproductive rights, supra-national and transnational institutions have played an important role in promoting rights-based approaches to reproduction. Yet, the idea of the nation-state’s power being superseded by international or supra-national governance is too simplistic. Instead, Garcia del Moral and Korteweg argue that the national, supra-national, international and transnational levels of governance need to be understood as interrelated levels of governmentality. Looking at legal practices around abortion, they interrogate the analytical potential of categories of the supra-national, the transnational and the postnational to understand the Irish state’s handling of abortion rights. In Ireland, abortions are illegal, except for strictly defined exceptional circumstances. The article explores four cases, where women sought an abortion or sought to travel abroad to obtain an abortion. The cases highlight that the different positioning of women in the power relations of class, ethnicity, racialization and immigration status affected the differential conceptualization of their rights on the levels of the Irish state, international (European Court of Human Rights) and supra-national (EU) bodies.</p>
<p>While migration is an important way in which transnationalism is produced, we must also keep in mind that nation-states’ regulation of migration prevents some from engaging in transnational practices. Zontini and Madziva argue that the literature on transnational families has shown how transnational migrants, often mothers, find many different ways of maintaining close family relationships with their children left in the care of others, often family members, in the home country. However, the viability of transnational family practices depends on the specific circumstances of migrant mothers’ insertion into the society of residence. Thus, asylum-seeking mothers’ family practices are often severely curtailed through the lack of recognition of their migration and family rights in the receiving state. The authors draw on fieldwork with Zimbabwean asylum-seeking mothers in the UK, who are caught in a legal limbo, not recognized as refugees, prevented from taking up legal work while at the same time excluded from access to state benefits. This leaves the asylum-seeking mothers themselves destitute, often unable to provide any economic support to their children in Zimbabwe. The article shows that not only do both mothers and their children suffer incredible economic, social and emotional deprivations, but children and family and friends in Zimbabwe also reproach the mothers for their inability to bring their children to the UK or provide for them economically, with severe consequences for the children who live in a society characterized by deep crisis and conflict. Under these circumstances, the asylum-seeking mothers experience deep feelings of guilt and helplessness.</p>
<p>In the third article, Binnie and Klesse show that the transnational not only pertains to new forms of governmentality, but also to new social movements. The authors demonstrate how transnational relationships have been central in building social movements concerned with equality around sexuality and gender in Poland. They emphasize, however, the particular ways in which political aims and practices are constructed differently on the level of the locality, here exemplified through the equality marches in Kraków, Poznan and Warsaw, the national level, and on the level of transnational solidarity politics. Binnie and Klesse’s article points out that building solidarity is a complex task and that there are different challenges for building solidarity on the local, national and transnational levels. Furthermore, the article draws our attention to how ‘the transnational’ has different meanings and different functions in different contexts. While it can be an arena for articulating sexual identities and rights in local but transnationally supported social movements, conservative and fascist political movements in Poland portray the involvement of European transnational bodies in the equality marches as a sign that sexual equality politics undermines national sovereignty.</p>
<p>Erel’s contribution looks at how the transnational is an emergent social field within Europe. Through a study on European migrant mothers in London, she explores how intra-EU mobility, a key aspect of European citizenship, contributes to the emergence of a European transnational space. While their European citizenship, middle-class identification and cultural capital of whiteness enables the mobility of this particular group of women, as mothers they are called on to transmit cultural resources to their children, a task that creates ethnic and class-specific belongings. Despite their privileged migration status, Erel argues, these mothers experience a lack of national cultural capital. Drawing on a case study, Erel shows how mothers instead engage in creating European transnationally validated cultural capital for their children to compensate for their lack of national capital on one hand, and to create the transnational field as an emergent form of distinction on the other. Whether this European transnational field will emerge as a new category of privileged cultural capital alongside European national cultural capitals remains an open question, yet the gendered responsibility of mothers in producing not only national but also emergent transnational social fields should be recognized.</p>
<p>Szczepanikova’s contribution critically examines the claim that Chechen refugee women in Europe are re-traditionalizing their gender roles. While many young Chechen refugee women in Poland, Germany and Austria turn to strict patriarchal gender roles, Szczepanikova contests the thesis of re-traditionalization which suggests that this is based on the young women taking up gendered ideas from pre-migration Chechnya. The article contrasts the young women’s modes of femininity with those embodied by an older generation of Chechen women, who had access to education, paid work and models of successfully combining Chechen and Russian gendered norms in a multi-ethnic, peaceful and economically secure pre-war Chechnya. The experience of war has deprived the young women of education and social experiences of varied modes of femininity. Furthermore, the insecurity of war and refugee life as well as anti-Muslim racisms in their European countries of residence make their participation in the public sphere difficult. It is in this context, that they embrace models of Muslim femininity valorizing their role as mothers and home-makers. Yet, these transnationally circulated models of Muslim femininity do not so much revive Chechen traditions, as connect with ideas circulated in a global Muslim public sphere. This article shows that gender relations are formed and changed in the interplay of specific local factors, as well as different, at times competing, transnationally circulating ideas of femininity.</p>
<p>Phoenix and Bauer in their contribution bring a psychosocial approach to the study of how adults retrospectively view their childhoods as part of transnational families spanning the Caribbean and Britain. The authors explore how these adults view their identities and experiences of transnationalism through their reflections on sibling relationships. Applying a complex analytical framework of intersectionality, they find that gender, particular experiences of migration, separations from parents but also other primary carers in the Caribbean, are key factors along which their participants narrate their identities. Experience and memory of life in the Caribbean thus for many was important in their identity formation, often marking a clear difference from siblings born in the UK. They recount different articulations of childhood based on being Caribbean or UK-born, often centred around expectations of helping in the household. Phoenix and Bauer show how these factors always need to be understood through a multiplicity of social relationships: gendered identities were as central to these participants’ experiences of childhood as was transnational migration. Indeed, the authors’ analysis shows how gender and transnationalism are constitutive of the social relationships, the experiences of migration as well as the identities of the participants. Thus, gender and transnationalism are constitutive of and constituted by large-scale social structures but can also be found in the minute details of people’s narrations of self.</p>
<p>Taken together, the contributions to this special issue raise key questions of how gender and transnationalism are articulated in the sites of transnational families, governmentalities as well as social movements. We hope that this will further stimulate research that considers the specifically European articulations of gender and transnationalism, developing our empirical knowledge of fast changing realities, as well as our conceptual and analytical tools and theoretical frameworks.</p>
