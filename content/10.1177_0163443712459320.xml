<p>Europe, ontologically and as a research object, continues to provide ample material for interpretation and theorisation. To start with, the claim of ‘Europe’ alone raises questions about the region’s geographical, political or cultural constitution, its corresponding borders and assumed principles. What kinds of delimitations accompany a research project that aims to explore European societies as part of a greater sum? What kinds of questions are best left un-asked so that the right ones come to the foreground? Where does the researcher stand in relation to the ‘Europe’ in question: an integral part of it, an unintended participant observer or a convinced political opponent? Although the writings about Europe and its various institutional and geo-cultural incarnations have been plenty, one can hardly claim that the aforementioned questions are closer to an answer or that the fascination causing such rich scholarly work, mostly represented under the rather broad umbrella of ‘European Studies’, is fading. Scholars have gained the historical memory of observing and treating Europe for its high and low tides when it comes, for example, to institutional development and maintain to a great extent a ‘calmer’ more nuanced perspective on the continent (and its islands).</p>
<p>Two such pieces of work come to remind us of the multifaceted dimensions of Europe and its dynamic and ever evolving nature that includes both the political construct of the European Union and the broader terrain that reaches the Ural Mountains. Maurice Roche and Monica Sassatelli have each provided ambitious, multilevel analyses of Europe that move seamlessly between the examination of the role of institutions to that of society, history and culture, economics and politics. Both provide sociological approaches that aim to offer complex accounts of the central role of these factors in the shaping of Europe as political, social and cultural reality in the lives of citizens. To do that, both authors visit familiar and less known territories, and the results are very interesting.</p>
<p>Roche’s book is organised in three parts: the first part is entitled ‘The development of social complex: civilisations and nation-states’; the second part turns its attention to the role of the state in modernity and the European social complex (nations, warfare and welfare states); finally part three opens up the discussion to processes of change at societal level with 21<sup>st</sup> century Europe and particularly European welfare capitalism. The main concern of the book is processes of ‘Europeanisation’ in their historical development and the author aims to design a sociological view of ‘Europe’. Roche’s tools for the development of a sociological framework are the European ‘duality’: Europe and the EU. In his book, Europe is approached as an aggregate of nation states and their differences or commonalities. His argument is simple, yet powerful: Europe is a society. Roche is acknowledging rather than emphasising the differences or commonalities among nations and national societies and their impact on the everyday lives of Europeans. He insists on ‘staying’ with Europe in his analysis instead of fleetingly discussing it in passing. Roche engages with Europe in terms of its social structure, social change and Europe as a network on the level of governance and nation state sovereignty. Moreover, he investigates Europe communicatively in the form of ‘visualisations’ and imaginations through discourse, including the knowledge society and communication technologies. As a sociological object, Europe is also discussed as an ‘neo-empire’ that exhibits the varying qualities of networks from core nodes such as the UK, Germany and France to looser associations like with the accession countries. Europe is also an empire in a multi-polar world. Roche concentrates on commonalities in the historical development of European ‘society’ which underpin a notion of European ‘civilisation’ that refers to the pre-modern era.</p>
<p>He traces Europe’ empire roots back to Alexandrian Greece which incorporated many languages, cultures and ethnic groups and provided a model in which Empire-building took place through the Pan-Hellenic unification of Europe and Asia under Alexander the Great. Later unifications were achieved through Celts and Romans, and the Byzantium, while schisms were derived from Christianity. Roche continues with the historical account of social change in the continent by focusing on the spheres of culture, polity and the economy. This is an interesting view which however does not sufficiently differentiate itself from other versions of rehearsed European history that situate progress (technological, philosophical) with the West and war with the East. In this vein, Eastern or South European regions do not appear convincingly in the discussion except through disasters in the ‘long’ 15<sup>th</sup> century account.</p>
<p>Roche’s account of European modernity concentrates on showing the development of the nation state as a process that seems in a sense to be destroying the coexistence of different language and groups and to problematize it. The motivations of elites propagated through means of communication served to provide an advantage over rival powers in processes of colonisation. Based on the ‘natural’ and the godly (godsend) myths of continuity, the function of ‘imagined community’, and the invention of ‘race’ and heritage nation states legitimise their strategies of spreading the ‘word’ and ‘civilising’ the world in colonies. The cultivation of nationalist discourses has taken the form of bloodline and more recently of ‘continualist’ perspectives that show links to the historical functions of nations. This occurs even in remote times through biblical references, for example. Roche considers war-making and capitalist ‘evolution’ as inextricable factors in the development of the European complex and considers in particular the states that have been most able to control the risks of war through their dominant position as mercantile and industrial capitalist forces. This brings his discussion to modern Europe and its welfare states. Roche argues that differences developed in the form of nations without states or governments, while post-imperial nations inform the citizens’ complex and changing relation with the state in Europe.</p>
<p>Roche’s account focuses on culture and the social, demonstrating the ways in which they underpin the European complex of politics, citizens and economy. Roche’s proposal to study Europe as a complex in its own right and not as the sum of nation states or even regions is simple, clear and thought provoking. Given how much sense it makes, one wonders why we have not seen more accounts and studies built this way. Of course the difficulty is to methodologically talk about and approach the European complex, although Roche seems to propose a model based on the historical revisiting of sub-complexes of politics, culture and social relations.</p>
<p>Sassatelli also adopts a sociological approach to the study of the process of ‘becoming European’ and examines three instances where this is interestingly visible. Hers is clearly a culture-centred approach that pays attention to the institutional and social spheres of the management and practice of culture. These are the contexts of cultural policy in the EU and their much discussed role in forging a form of identity through imaginary cultural continuities as expressed in official discourses. The first part of the book also focuses on the role of cultural policies in the process of integration. Sassatelli attempts a juxtaposition between official cultural policies and what can be understood as the ‘grassroots’ of Europe and the varying and even conflicting understandings of Europeanisation.</p>
<p>The second part of the book explores the sociology of what has become an important event in the European Union, the ‘City of Culture’. The idea of a European ‘City of Culture’ has gained momentum in Europe and has become an opportunity for urban centres to reinvent themselves and economically regenerate through funds and structural works. At the same time, the much adopted institution of European City of Culture is not entirely a matter of showcasing what is considered European culture or the encouragement of cultural production. Sassattelli discusses what she sees as a transformative event not only for the geopolitical regions it involves as ‘Cities of Culture’, but also as a process of culture and identity. For Sassatelli, the importance of ECOC is not in the elements she identifies as dismissed European dimensions, but in the ways in which grassroots and twinning projects and accompanying events bridge the local and the European. This occurs not simply through the nation, but also through the attention to a particular ‘global’. These are all elements of a cultural making of identities and therefore a vivid process of Europeanisation.</p>
<p>Sassatelli argues that through this series of cities we see a reconceptualization of what it means to be European and also to become European. This process is however dynamically transformative for the cities themselves. The examples are plenty and for Sassatelli they serve to illustrate both the symbolic but also the real (material?) dimensions of culture. This becomes most vividly exemplified through the case of the year 2000 when nine cities held the title simultaneously.</p>
<p>The third part of the book examines a less researched area in European integration and European cultural studies: the case of landscapes. This part again adopts an exploratory approach as to the ways in which ‘Europe’ is being constructed and created in the contexts of landscapes and spatial experience. Similarly to the previous parts, this section discusses the policy level but then expands the discussion to the anthropological and sociological level of understanding European space. The author argues that the ways in which policymakers and experts have been looking at the European landscape as intertwined with, but admittedly limited to, monumental approaches have evolved to include urban and rural, exceptional and common spaces as part of the same project of evolution and integration. The stepping away from the ‘special’ landscape involves less essentialist and more processual understandings of the living spaces of Europe where identity is being transformed, negotiated, lived and reformed. This section thus examines not only the shaping of a cultural space, but also the cultural transformations of the political.</p>
<p>Both books are concerned with the totality of Europeanisation as a process that involves not only institutional but also social processes, while cultural dimensions are an integral part of any process of integration, unification or shaping of identity. The authors offer interesting and systematic studies of Europeanisation that turn the focus on –ultimately- the self-evident and unquestioned as well as contradictory ways of being European and of constructing Europe.</p>
