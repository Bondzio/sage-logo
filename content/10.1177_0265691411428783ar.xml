<p>This is a wonderfully unusual book about Russian theatre. Its story is governed not by legendary directors, prima donnas, backstage myths, first-night scandals, wicked dim-witted state censors, nor by the later Brechtian assumption that oppressive politics makes for good drama and wise, self-aware audiences. On the contrary, when streets become dangerous, people stay home and theatrical enterprises go bankrupt. The catchphrase ‘culture and power’, invoked by du Quenoy with some irony throughout his book, is resolved unambiguously at the end: theatre was one thing that faltering Tsarist Russia did right. With the delicacy of a surgeon piecing together bits of injured tissue, du Quenoy re-examines falsely politicized ‘affairs’ – Rimsky-Korsakov’s temporary dismissal from the St Petersburg Conservatory in 1905, for example (91–99) – to strip off the crude revolutionary labels that have distorted the record of musical, dramatic and balletic activism. The performing arts, du Quenoy insists, were a showcase ‘in Imperial Russia’s ongoing evolution from autocracy to pluralism… a highly visible and relatively successful aspect of the Empire’s burgeoning civil society’ (253).</p>
<p>His case is persuasive. Russian theatre censorship was more permissive than its Western counterparts – the licensing commissions and vice squads of fin-de-siècle Britain or the USA (44–54). The administration of the Imperial Theatres, as well as the state-subsidized ‘People’s Houses’ with their diverse dramatic repertories, indulged Russia’s stage stars, sponsored <italic>risqué</italic> or radical plays (if they promised a decent box office return), underwrote actors’ aid societies, and rarely punished politically dissident actors. Drawing on a vast archival and in-print database, du Quenoy whittles away at the myth that art was seen by theatre-going Russians as oppositional, sacred, or (as Symbolist theorists so hoped) some mystical ritual. His documents range from ticket stubs, fiscal reports, newspaper columns and memoirs to the percentage of male orchestra members drafted into the Great War. From this mass of detail, du Quenoy extracts a series of real-life stories in the economic and psychological sphere. His conclusion: that audiences wanted to be entertained– not mobilized, preached at, or recruited to a cause. Actors wanted to perfect their craft – and if the perks of stardom were beyond their reach, they hoped at least for some guarantee of a living wage for long days of work. Students in drama schools, ballet academies and conservatories dreaded any interruption in their highly demanding daily regimen. Theatre managers sought material security. Political unrest (the benchmark year is 1905) threatened these civic values and was resented by the performing arts community. Of primary interest to this community, and to du Quenoy, is the task of training professionals, maintaining a solvent theatre, and mounting a show.</p>
<p>Du Quenoy divides his findings into six chapters. Chapter one provides institutional background on the three tiers of Russian theatrical life: the six Imperial theatres; the abundant, struggling, often transient private stages and cabaret venues; and the ‘popular stage’ financed by the government for working-class patrons, as cultural enrichment and an alternative to nightly drunkenness (37). Chapter two focuses on the disastrous effect that Bloody Sunday 1905 had on the health, morale, and finances of this vigorous and largely a-political performance community. Chapters three, four and five deal respectively with Imperial Theatre personnel, private and popular theatre performers, and audiences. Each title is preceded by a quote from some exasperated participant in that chapter’s story: ‘Politics are Death’ (ch. 3), ‘Our Theater Will Not Strike!’ (ch. 4), ‘You Dare Not Make Sport of Our Nerves!’ (ch. 5). All testify to the same reality: that the institutions of Russian theatre were conservative (that is, oriented toward commercial success), their personnel well-treated, and their tickets inexpensive and accessible to all classes. We are hardly surprised when veteran actress Mariya Savina, reigning prima donna at Petersburg’s Aleksandrinskii Theatre from the 1880s until 1915 and a powerful influence on performing arts management, remarked in an interview in October 1905: ‘As is well known, art does not like trouble’ (112). What <italic>does</italic> surprise is the intense resistance at all social levels against bullying left-wing agitators who tried to radicalize theatres into striking (with boorish behaviour but at times with revolvers and poison gas). It was widely felt that the tsarist police was insufficiently severe with these dangerous elements. For good reasons did the progressive intelligentsia look aghast at this gifted body of theatre folk, whose tastes ran to ‘melodrama, suspense, human relations, comedy, and general “decadence” inherent in the newer and more explicit themes of sex and violence’ (213). As Jeffrey Brooks demonstrated in 1985 with his path-breaking revisionist study <italic>When Russia Learned to Read: Literary and Popular Culture, 1861–1917</italic>, when Russians learned to go to the theatre, they went for their own reasons.</p>
<p><italic>Stage Fright</italic> is a book, as the Russians say, ‘with a tendency’. It seems du Quenoy has two targets: one easy to attack, the other more viable and entrenched. The easy target is the Soviet-era historian, inclined (or required) to glorify pre-1917 theatres as sites of radical protest. The other target, one suspects, are Western theatre historians and theorists dazzled by the rebel, the revolutionary, the mean Old Regime that justified Lenin’s thrillingly mean methods of fighting back – and dazzled too by the possibility of forcing people to partake in experiences that will alter their vision, appetites and goals. Du Quenoy has little patience with the avant-garde. When the rise of Vsevolod Meyerhold (224–42) is told not from the perspective of an enraptured 1920s–30s but as experienced by scandalized actors who considered their creativity repressed, or by irritated bored audiences who didn’t wish to be manipulated but entertained, the whole picture of this period shifts. Simply in terms of filling the house and paying their bills, most radical theatre manipulators failed. ‘Idea’ plays flopped; parodies of them survived.</p>
<p>The only parts of this impressive study that do not ring wholly true or fair are its two final chapters, ‘Russian Modernism and its Discontents’ (ch. 6) and ‘A Conclusion’. Du Quenoy tends to classify all post-Realist experimentation – from Symbolist mystery plays through Evreinov’s ‘monodrama’, Tairov’s rhythmically-based Moscow Chamber Theatre, and of course Meyerhold – as ‘modernist’ and thus doomed to dissatisfy the public. Only what these post-Realists learned from the Moscow Art Theatre (and this was a great deal) is reliably praised. But Modernism is simply too crude a tool for a cultural historian of du Quenoy’s precise methods. These groups polemicized creatively among themselves and won devoted fans. The ‘Conclusion’ likewise moves too quickly and generalizes too cavalierly through what is, for this book, the aftermath: the Stalinist and post-Soviet periods. Lunacharsky and Gorky, Shostakovich and Prokofiev flicker in and out in a paragraph, usually with the worst parts of their careers given prime time. The great merit of du Quenoy’s work is its devastating command of the historical record in late Imperial Russian theatre. The worlds that followed are best left to their own light and darkness.</p>
