<abstract>
<p>Alemtuzumab is an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody with remarkable efficacy in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). In clinical trials and off-label use in MS, alemtuzumab has been administered intravenously (IV). Alemtuzumab is approved for chronic lymphoid leukemia as IV. Oncology guidelines recommend alemtuzumab subcutaneous (SC) over IV. There is no report of alemtuzumab SC in MS. We report two patients with highly active relapsing MS who were treated with SC alemtuzumab, had significant improvement and tolerated SC alemtuzumab well without the typical infusion-associated adverse events. SC alemtuzumab in MS warrants further studies as this may enhance patient convenience and minimize infusion-associated adverse events.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alemtuzumab is a humanized anti-CD 52 monoclonal antibody, currently FDA-approved for the treatment of chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL). Phase II studies in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) have shown remarkable efficacy compared with interferon-beta therapy, indicative of its potential to emerge as a new therapy in MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511435716">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511435716">2</xref></sup> In all prior MS clinical trials as well as off-label use in MS, alemtuzumab has been administered only intravenously (IV). However, the subcutaneous (SC) route of administration of alemtuzumab has been investigated in the treatment of CLL, as it appears to have fewer infusion-associated adverse events compared with IV administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511435716">3</xref></sup> Several studies in oncology have reported the use of SC administration without compromising therapeutic efficacy. Current published guidelines for oncology indications recommend alemtuzumab SC instead of IV, even though alemtuzumab is approved for the treatment of CLL as an IV administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511435716">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511435716">5</xref></sup> We explored the efficacy and tolerability of SC administration of alemtuzumab in highly active MS.</p>

<title>Case report</title>
<p>Two patients with highly active relapsing MS with predominant brainstem involvement leading to severe disability in a relatively short period of time were treated with alemtuzumab SC. Once the decision to treat with alemtuzumab was made, since it is currently only approved for oncological indications, we consulted with our oncologist. Based on their experience with alemtuzumab and published oncology guidelines, the SC route of administration was recommended. After our discussions and review of available data, we chose the SC route. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and laboratory data were obtained prior to and following alemtuzumab.</p>
<p>Patient 1: A 37-year-old man with a one year history of relapsing MS was referred to our center due to disease refractory to first-line disease-modifying therapy. He had been on interferon β1a 44 μg three times/week. Despite treatment he continued to have relapses and radiologic progression. He received two monthly infusions of cyclophosphamide but continued to worsen with increasing neurologic disability. His Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score prior to starting alemtuzumab was 8.5. He was restricted to bed due to severe ataxia, and needed help with activities of daily living including needing a feeding tube due to dysphagia. Alemtuzumab 12 mg/day SC for 5 days was administered at that point. Post-alemtuzumab, he has not had further relapses, and has experienced significant improvement in disability. Brain MRI scans show reduction in T2 lesion volume without contrast-enhancing lesions. Currently, 14 months later, his EDSS is 6.0 with considerable improvement in activities of daily living (ADLs) and independent functioning.</p>
<p>Patient 2: An 18-year-old female presented with a fulminant course of relapsing MS and within a few months developed severe disability due to multiple polysymptomatic relapses. Her clinical status continued to worsen despite multiple courses of IV Solu-Medrol and plasmapheresis, reaching an EDSS score of 7.5. Due to severe ataxia she could not take more than a few steps with assistance. A decision was made to treat with alemtuzumab 12 mg/day SC for 5 days, based on earlier success with patient 1. Post-alemtuzumab, she has not had further relapses and her brain MRI scans have shown considerable improvement compared with pre-alemtuzumab scans (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1352458511435716">Figure 1</xref>). Ten months later, her EDSS is 2.5, with minimal weakness and mild ataxia.</p>

His current lymphocyte subsets, 14 months after treatment, show a CD4 count of 574/mm<sup>3</sup> (normal range 588–1202), CD8 of 887/mm<sup>3</sup> (normal range 394–672) and a CD19 B-cell count of 600/mm<sup>3</sup> (normal range 54–620).</p>

<p>In patient 2 the lymphocyte depletion was again within days, and the lowest count was zero. Her lymphocyte count started recovering at 3 months and currently, 10 months post-alemtuzumab it is 0.8 × 103/mm<sup>3</sup>. This patient also had significant prolonged neutrophil depletion, and the total WBC count at 10 months remains low at 2.1 × 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, SC alemtuzumab was well tolerated and effective in reducing relapses and improving disability in two patients with highly active relapsing MS. The decrease in the WBC count and consequent lymphocyte depletion was achieved within days of the SC administration. This observation suggests that SC administration of alemtuzumab may be a potentially efficacious and well-tolerated route of administration. Current oncology literature supports the use of SC over IV alemtuzumab. Subcutaneous administration of alemtuzumab in MS warrants further studies, as this may enhance patient convenience and minimize infusion-associated adverse events without compromising efficacy.</p>
