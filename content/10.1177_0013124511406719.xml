<abstract>
<p>This longitudinal study examined the effects of formal (i.e., school-based) and informal (i.e., home-based) Latino parent involvement using data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS:88). Both forms of support were significant predictors of student achievement; the impact of informal support was nearly as great as that of formal support. It was suggested that Latino students benefit from both methods of involvement, and both formal and informal parent involvement should be acknowledged and supported. This study fills a gap in the literature by discussing parent involvement as a multidimensional construct, looking at the effects of parent involvement in a sample of Latino secondary students, and viewing Latino parental involvement as a strength instead of something that is lacking.</p>

<p>Parent involvement (i.e., academic support) is an empirically validated predictor of school success. Research has shown parental involvement to be a positive factor for children as young as kindergarten and this effect is equally apparent through all levels of a child’s educational experience: elementary school, middle school, high school, and even into the college years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013124511406719">Alfaro, Umaña-Taylor, &amp; Bámaca, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511406719">Barnard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013124511406719">DeGarmo &amp; Martinez, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124511406719">Jeynes, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124511406719">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124511406719">Martinez, DeGarmo, &amp; Eddy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013124511406719">McWayne, Hampton, Fantuzzo, Cohen, &amp; Sekino, 2004</xref>). Although parental academic support is valuable to students of all races and ethnicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124511406719">Glick &amp; White, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013124511406719">Okagaki &amp; Frensch, 1998</xref>), research has suggested that parent involvement may be even more beneficial for Latino and other minority students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124511406719">Behnke, Piercy, &amp; Diversi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013124511406719">Olivos, 2004</xref>). In fact, parental support has been found to be a key predictor of Latino academic achievement, beyond the effects of teacher and peer support and other demographic factors such as parent education, nativity, and language proficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013124511406719">Alfaro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124511406719">Behnke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013124511406719">DeGarmo &amp; Martinez, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124511406719">Martinez et al., 2004</xref>). The reasons behind why parental involvement is more beneficial for these racial/ethnic subpopulations is not readily apparent, but the concept of functional substitution, that emphasizes the importance of any given resource when there are fewer resources overall, has been suggested as a likely mechanism (Mirowsky &amp; Ross, 2003, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013124511406719">Crosnoe, Johnson, &amp; Elder, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although parent involvement and its advantages are frequently studied, the underlying meaning of this multidimensional construct is inconsistently defined among educators, parents, and researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124511406719">Jeynes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124511406719">Lightfoot, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124511406719">Zarate, 2007</xref>). For example, when educators discuss parent involvement, they are usually referring to formal (i.e., visible) participation in the schools, such as attendance at a Parent Teacher Association (PTA) meeting, chaperoning field trips, or volunteering in a classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013124511406719">Bohon, Macpherson, &amp; Atiles, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124511406719">Quiocho &amp; Daoud, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013124511406719">Valencia &amp; Black, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124511406719">Zarate, 2007</xref>). Although many Latino parents do provide formal support for their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124511406719">Zarate, 2007</xref>), it is more typical for educators to view parental involvement within the Latino population as something that is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124511406719">Lightfoot, 2004</xref>). When teachers do not see Latino parents visibly participating in the schools within the teachers’ framework of what participation means, they may often conclude that Latino parents are “not involved” in their children’s schooling or that they “do not care” about their children’s educations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124511406719">De Gaetano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013124511406719">Olivos, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124511406719">Quiocho &amp; Daoud, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013124511406719">Valencia &amp; Black, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>However, even though formal participation is not always observed, research indicates that Latinos place great emphasis on their children’s educations and that they care deeply about their children’s academic progress and school success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124511406719">Behnke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124511406719">De Gaetano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124511406719">Drummond &amp; Stipek, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124511406719">Martinez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013124511406719">Valencia &amp; Black, 2002</xref>). These conflicting beliefs between educators and Latino parents are present, in part, because Latino parents typically have different beliefs regarding what it means to be involved in their children’s educations. Culturally relevant educational research has found that Latino parents often provide informal (i.e., invisible to educators) academic support for their children, such as helping with homework, encouraging scholastic endeavors, providing a quiet homework setting, or discussing future plans with their child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013124511406719">Auerbach, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124511406719">Zarate, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Latino parents may purposely choose to avoid formal school participation out of respect for their children’s teachers. As a culture, Latinos highly respect teachers and trust the American education system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013124511406719">Auerbach, 2007</xref>), and it is commonly believed that contacting a teacher is disrespectful because it challenges the teacher’s authority and would be counterproductive to the educational experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124511406719">Quezada, Díaz, &amp; Sánchez, 2003</xref>). Latino parents may also be less formally involved because they feel uncomfortable communicating with school staff for several reasons—Latino parents might have limited English proficiency, have a lack of familiarity with the school system, or perceive discrimination or feeling that the school discounts Latino’s social and cultural capital or because Latino parents themselves may have had negative experiences in school when they were younger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013124511406719">Auerbach, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124511406719">Quezada et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, there are real-life factors that can limit Latino parents’ formal involvement with schools such as lack of child care or transportation, inflexible work schedules, or the lack of translation services at the school. It is equally likely that some parents from different cultures may simply value academic involvement at home over visible involvement at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511406719">Lee &amp; Bowen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124511406719">Quezada et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124511406719">Zarate, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although research has found that Latino parents are involved in their children’s academic lives in both formal and informal ways, a recent meta-analysis of parent involvement in urban secondary school settings was unable to draw firm conclusions about which aspects of parental involvement have the greatest impact on children’s success in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124511406719">Jeynes, 2007</xref>). Instead of using the deficit perspective from which Latino parent involvement is typically viewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124511406719">De Gaetano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124511406719">Lightfoot, 2004</xref>), this longitudinal study is designed to use a strengths perspective to parse out which form of parent involvement (i.e., formal or informal) has the greatest influence on student academic achievement within the Latino population.</p>
<sec id="section1-0013124511406719">
<title>Formal Parent Involvement</title>
<p>Formal parent involvement typically includes visible participation in the schools, such as volunteering in the classroom or school building or helping with field trips or in the lunch room (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124511406719">De Gaetano, 2007</xref>). It can also include attending PTA meetings or parent–teacher conferences or participating in fundraisers or school events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013124511406719">Bohon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124511406719">Quiocho &amp; Daoud, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013124511406719">Valencia &amp; Black, 2002</xref>). In addition to being physically present at the school, formal parent involvement can include contacting the school about the child’s academic progress, behavioral concerns, upcoming activities, or opportunities to volunteer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511406719">Barnard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124511406719">Glick &amp; White, 2004</xref>). In general, formal parent involvement includes external activities in which parents are physically present at the school or at a school-related function or in which they initiate contact with the school.</p>
<p>No recent quantitative studies were found that examined how educational attainment is affected by parent involvement during secondary school years within the Latino population. This lack of quantitative studies was noted in a recent meta-analysis on parental participation in secondary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124511406719">Jeynes, 2007</xref>). The reasons behind the lack of focus on secondary school could be because formal parental school involvement has, in the past, been found to decrease as children progress through school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511406719">Barnard, 2004</xref>). However, parent school involvement during the high school years likely indicates a history of formal school involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124511406719">Glick &amp; White, 2004</xref>), and informal school involvement has not been studied enough to determine if or how it changes as the child ages or how it may affect children of different cultures over time.</p>
<p>A few quantitative studies were located that examined the effects of formal parental involvement during the elementary school years, although they were not specifically looking at Latino students. Results of these studies have been mixed. Using data from the Chicago Longitudinal Study (CLS), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511406719">Barnard (2004)</xref> examined the relationship between parent reports of school involvement in elementary school and educational attainment in a sample of 1,165 urban minority students (i.e., 94% African American and 6% Latino). She found that parent ratings of school involvement were not associated with educational outcomes. However, the scale used to measure parent involvement had low internal reliability (α = .63), which could have limited the results. Recently, using data from a nationally representative sample of 11,999 participants in the second wave of the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS:88), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511406719">Stewart (2008)</xref> examined the relationship between student-, school-, and parent-level variables and grades; formal school involvement was not associated with grades. Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511406719">Lee and Bowen (2006)</xref> studied the relationship between formal parent involvement and early academic achievement in a sample of elementary school students to determine differences by race/ethnicity; formal parent involvement predicted academic achievement.</p>

<sec id="section2-0013124511406719">
<title>Informal Parent Involvement</title>
<p>Informal parent involvement includes behaviors, activities, and emotional support that occur in the home. For example, Latino parents may tell family stories and give advice about school experiences through cultural narratives called <italic>consejos</italic>, and they may provide moral and emotional support by talking with their children about future ambitions and the value of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013124511406719">Auerbach, 2007</xref>). For example, a Latino father shared with his son that “. . . success comes according to the <italic>empeña</italic> (dedication, commitment, effort) you invest in what you are doing . . . If you are dedicated, then you can achieve whatever you want. If you don’t put <italic>ganas</italic> (will, drive) into it, you become like us” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013124511406719">Auerbach, 2007</xref>, p. 263). Latino parents may caution their children against quitting school and only qualifying for low-paying jobs, and some explicitly connect academic success with college and later adult economic security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124511406719">De Gaetano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124511406719">Martinez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013124511406719">Valencia &amp; Black, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124511406719">Zarate, 2007</xref>). For example, another father shared, “I always use me as an example. Like, ‘Look at me. Do you want to work like me? You know, work hard and live like this? If you want to be more comfortable later, you have to work hard now, go to school” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013124511406719">Auerbach, 2007</xref>, p. 263).</p>
<p>Other ways that parents informally support their children’s educations include making sure the children arrive at school on time, providing a quiet time and place to do homework, regularly helping with homework, and monitoring school attendance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013124511406719">Auerbach, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124511406719">De Gaetano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124511406719">Zarate, 2007</xref>). These parents may eliminate potential distractions (e.g., requiring an adolescent to work or babysit younger siblings) or they may provide emotional support by boosting their children’s self-esteem and applauding their progress or hard work. Generally, the main message of informal parental support is sharing spoken and unspoken messages about the importance of school and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124511406719">De Gaetano, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies on informal parental involvement during the secondary and elementary school years were examined, and they had mixed results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511406719">Stewart (2008)</xref> found that parent–child discussions during adolescence were positively associated with grades. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511406719">Barnard (2004)</xref>, however, found no relationship between parent ratings of parent home involvement during the elementary years and educational attainment in a large sample of mostly African American students; however, internal reliability in the scale used to measure informal parent involvement (α = .50) may have influenced the results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511406719">Lee and Bowen (2006)</xref> also found no relationship between educational discussions and academic achievement in a sample of elementary school children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0013124511406719">
<title>School Success</title>
<p>School success, or academic achievement, can be measured in different ways. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511406719">Barnard (2004)</xref> examined the effects of parent involvement in elementary school on educational attainment using rates of high school dropout, on-time high school completion, and highest grade completed as indicators of educational attainment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124511406719">Glick and White (2004)</xref> studied the relationship between immigrant generational status, familial resources, and educational expectations and educational achievement using postsecondary school participation as a measure of achievement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511406719">Stewart (2008)</xref> measured academic achievement by calculating an average of each student’s grades in math, English, history, and science (i.e., grade point average [GPA]). In a study of parent involvement and early academic achievement, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511406719">Lee and Bowen (2006)</xref> created an academic achievement composite by standardizing scores on teacher-report measures. In addition to these measures, other studies have also included standardized test results as an indicator of school success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124511406719">Jeynes, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the inconsistency of terminology in the literature on parent involvement and the tendency to evaluate parent involvement as a unidimensional construct, different facets of parental academic support are not frequently studied. Consequently, there is a dearth of literature on the effects of differing methods of parent involvement within ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124511406719">Jeynes, 2003</xref>). The present study builds on existing research on parent involvement by (a) analyzing longitudinal data from a large, nationally representative sample of Latinos using the NELS:88, (b) discussing parent involvement as a multidimensional construct, (c) assessing the impact of different forms of academic support on educational outcomes within the Latino population, (d) filling a gap in the literature by looking at the role of parent involvement within the Latino population, and (e) addressing Latino parent involvement from a strengths perspective instead of deficit perspective.

<sec id="section5-0013124511406719">
<title>Sample and Procedure</title>
<p>Information for this sample was drawn from the NELS:88 longitudinal data file from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Base year data as well as information from the second follow-up were included to assess the effects of different aspects of parent involvement over time on educational success. The NELS:88 is a nationally representative sample of children who were in eighth grade in 1988 that has been updated to follow these children through high school and beyond the secondary level. Information in the NELS:88 consists of answers from students, family members, teachers, and counselors. The NELS:88 includes data on approximately 12,000 students. For the purposes of this study, only data from self-identified Latino students and their parents were used. These sampling criteria yielded a final sample size of 1,476 students and parents.</p>

<sec id="section6-0013124511406719">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>To measure the construct of formal support for base-year data collection, principal components analysis (PCA) was used to reduce six items measuring how often the parent contacted the school and five items measuring whether the parent physically participated in school functions. The PCA yielded a one-component solution, and the internal reliability of this 11-item scale measuring formal support when the child was in the eighth grade was .99. To measure the construct of formal support for the second follow-up data collection, seven items measuring how often the parent contacted the school and three items measuring whether the parent physically participated in school functions were reduced using PCA. Again, the PCA yielded a one-component solution, and the internal reliability of this 10-item scale measuring formal support when the child was in 10th grade was .99.</p>
<p>Two items measuring the presence of family rules about education and three items measuring how often the parent discussed educational issues with the child during base-year data collection were reduced using PCA to measure the construct of informal support. The PCA initially yielded a two-component solution; however, a one-component solution was selected for consistency. The internal reliability of this five-item scale was .70. Three items measuring the presence of family rules and six items measuring the frequency of educational discussions between parent and child were reduced using PCA to measure the construct of informal support during the second follow-up data collection. The PCA yielded a one-component solution, and the internal reliability of this nine-item scale was .99.</p>
<p>Academic achievement was measured as whether the student completed high school on time. On-time high school completion was coded as 1 = <italic>graduated on time</italic> (including receiving a General Educational Development [GED]) or 0 = <italic>did not graduate on time</italic>. This outcome was chosen because it represents a significant difference in adult earnings as high school graduates annually earn above US$8,000 more than nongraduates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013124511406719">Swanson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Measures of individual and structural characteristics that may influence the student’s academic achievement were included in the analyses. Socioeconomic status (SES) has been found to influence high school completion rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511406719">Lee &amp; Bowen, 2006</xref>). In this study, SES quartiles were used to represent SES, and the categories were dummy coded, with Low (Quartile 1) being the reference category. Family structure may also affect educational outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124511406719">Glick &amp; White, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124511406719">Jeynes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511406719">Stewart, 2008</xref>). In the current study, family structure was dummy coded into four variables: (a) child lives with single mother, (b) child lives with both parents (reference category), (c) child lives with parent and parent’s partner, or (d) child has other arrangements (e.g., single father, other relatives, etc.). Language background may also affect the child’s educational attainment and influence the parent’s decision of whether to be formally involved in their child’s education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124511406719">Glick &amp; White, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124511406719">NCES &amp; U.S. Department of Education, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124511406719">Quezada et al., 2003</xref>). In this study, language was dummy coded into two variables: (a) English is the main language spoken at home (reference category) and (b) Spanish is the main language spoken at home. An additional variable was included to indicate whether both English and Spanish were spoken at home. Finally, mother’s and father’s educational attainment may predict the child’s achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124511406719">Jeynes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511406719">Lee &amp; Bowen, 2006</xref>); parent achievement was coded as 1 = <italic>graduated from high school</italic> and 0 = <italic>did not graduate from high school</italic> (reference category).</p>

The sample was nearly divided in half by gender, and approximately half of the students lived with both parents. The majority of the sample (62%) reported speaking both English and Spanish in their homes. In a separate question, 35% reported mainly speaking English at home and 34% reported speaking mainly Spanish at home. Forty-five percent of fathers were high school graduates, and 49% of mothers graduated from high school.</p>

<p>Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to analyze the data in SPSS 16.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013124511406719">SPSS, Inc., 2007</xref>) to efficiently reach general conclusions about the effects of parent involvement on school completion. GEE is an extension of the generalized linear model (GLM) that analyzes correlated data and is more efficient than analyzing the effects of covariates from separate waves. GEE methods are desirable to use with longitudinal data and a binary outcome; it calculates robust standard errors while allowing flexibility in specifying the correlation structure within cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124511406719">Ghisletta &amp; Spini, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0013124511406719">Zeger &amp; Liang, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0013124511406719">Zorn, 2001</xref>). For this analysis, the data from the two waves of the NELS:88 were pooled and then treated as cross-sectional data while still taking into account the correlation among repeated measurements for each individual.</p>
<p>Two models were examined; Model 1 included formal support and Model 2 included informal support. Both models were significant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0013124511406719">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0013124511406719">Table 3</xref> for parameter estimates). Of the individual and structural variables, family structure and SES were significant in both models. Those students who lived with a parent and parent’s partner or with a single mother were approximately half as likely to graduate as those students who lived with both biological parents. There were also differences in the odds of graduating among students from different levels of SES. In both models, the odds of students in the second quartile graduating on time were nearly twice that of students in the lowest quartile. The odds of those in the third quartile graduating on time were nearly five times the odds of students in the lowest quartile. The odds of those students graduating on time in the highest quartile were nearly seven times the odds of those in the lowest quartile.</p>

<p>Formal support was positively related to on-time graduation, and the odds of those students whose parents were formally involved in their education over time graduating on time were 1.142 (<italic>p</italic> = .005). In other words, students whose parents physically participated in school functions or who chose to contact the school were more likely to graduate on time than not. Informal support was also positively related to on-time graduation, and the odds of those students whose parents were informally involved in their education over time graduating on time were 1.116 (<italic>p</italic> = .021). Therefore, students whose parents had family rules and educational discussions at home were also more likely to graduate on time than not.</p>

<sec id="section8-0013124511406719" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Both formal and informal parent involvement during the secondary school years were found to be predictive of academic achievement. In fact, the impact of informal parent involvement on achievement was nearly as great as that of formal parent involvement. These results are somewhat surprising because prior studies that included both forms of parent involvement found either formal or informal parent involvement to significantly predict academic achievement, but not both. Specifically, the results are partially consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511406719">Lee and Bowen’s (2006)</xref> study that found a relationship between formal parent involvement and academic achievement, but no relationship between informal support and achievement. The results of the current study are also partially consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511406719">Stewart’s (2008)</xref> study which found a positive relationship between informal support and grades, but no relationship between formal parent involvement and grades.</p>
<p>As the previous studies included primarily White or African American samples, the differences between results suggests that the educational needs of Latino secondary students may not be the same as the needs of White or African American students. The Latino culture values collectivism, which includes valuing themselves through others, emphasizing family bonds, and preferring communal goals rather than individual goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013124511406719">Comas-Díaz, 2006</xref>) This is a possible explanation for why support at home is beneficial for Latino students.</p>
<p>This study provides insight into the multidimensional construct of parent involvement. Formal support (e.g., physical participation) is normally the focus of attention in articles on parent involvement, and Latino parents are often viewed as being uninvolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124511406719">De Gaetano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013124511406719">Olivos, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124511406719">Quiocho &amp; Daoud, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0013124511406719">Valencia &amp; Black, 2002</xref>). However, although less than one quarter of Latino parents in this study reported formally participating in their children’s educations (i.e., 21.3% for base year, 24.7% for follow-up), approximately three quarters of Latino parents reported providing informal educational support for their children (i.e., 75.6% for base year, 63.8% for follow-up. This study found that the impact of informal support (e.g., educational discussions) throughout the secondary school years was nearly as great as that of formal support. Therefore, given that a large portion of Latino parents report being informally involved in their children’s educations and the current findings that informal parent involvement is positively related to academic achievement, it is necessary to acknowledge multiple methods of parent support and to encourage informal Latino parent involvement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0013124511406719">
<title>Strengths and Limitations</title>
<p>As the first wave of data was collected when the students were in the eighth grade, it is unknown how prior parent involvement (i.e., in elementary school) influenced the outcome. Some research has found that parent involvement during the elementary school years predicts educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511406719">Lee &amp; Bowen, 2006</xref>), although not all research has confirmed this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511406719">Barnard, 2004</xref>). Moreover, research has found that formal parent involvement tends to decrease as the child ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511406719">Barnard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124511406719">Zarate, 2007</xref>), so even if a parent is no longer formally involved in the child’s education in middle or high school, there is the possibility that the parent was previously involved, which could contribute to the child’s educational attainment. In addition, there are many personal attributes of the students themselves that may have influenced their academic achievement, such as looking at certain hardships as challenges or having an internal drive to succeed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013124511406719">Greene, 2002</xref>). Although relevant, these variables can be difficult to measure and were beyond the scope of this study.</p>
<p>This study is strengthened primarily by its longitudinal design, large sample size, and the gap that it fills in the literature. The longitudinal design permitted observation of how formal and informal support throughout adolescence effects academic achievement, and this study had high power, which allowed for the detection of significant findings. Finally, very few studies have examined the role of formal (i.e., school-based) and informal (i.e., home-based) parent involvement and the impact of different forms of parent involvement on academic achievement; No studies were located that examined this topic solely within the Latino population. As the Latino population continues to rapidly increase (i.e., from 12.6% of the U.S. population in 2000 to a projected 24.4% in 2050; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0013124511406719">U.S. Census Bureau, 2004</xref>), and the rate of Latinos not completing high school remains considerably higher than any other race/ethnic group (i.e., nearly one quarter of Latinos dropout; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124511406719">NCES, 2007</xref>), this study addresses a timely topic and sheds light on an issue that ultimately influences the futures of Latino youths.</p>

Although this study included variables that were suggested in prior research, such as family structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124511406719">Stewart, 2008</xref>) and family SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511406719">Lee &amp; Bowen, 2006</xref>), the models in this study did not control for everything that influences parent involvement. Additional variables, such as cognitive ability, resiliency characteristics, and educational expectations of students and parents should be included in future models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511406719">Barnard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013124511406719">Greene, 2002</xref>). It is also possible that there is a bidirectional relationship between parent involvement and student achievement that should be further explored; Parents may be more involved if the student is doing well in school, or parents may be more involved if the student is struggling academically or behaviorally at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511406719">Barnard, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Generational status should be included in future models as immigration status has been shown to effect educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124511406719">Glick &amp; White, 2004</xref>). In addition, the role of social desirability in studies using parent self-reports should be considered as some researchers using Latino samples have speculated that participants may respond according to what the researcher finds most socially acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511406719">Barnard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013124511406719">Ortega &amp; Rosenheck, 2000</xref>). Finally, discriminatory structural barriers at school may actively prevent or discourage Latino parents from formally participating in their child’s education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013124511406719">Cline &amp; Necochea, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124511406719">Martinez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013124511406719">Olivos, 2004</xref>); Future research should examine how discriminatory policies, procedures, attitudes, and actions may influence the formal school participation of Latino parents and how these barriers may influence student school success.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Parent involvement is a multidimensional construct that is not always seen as such by educators and school administrators. Although many Latino parents are formally involved in their children’s educations, for cultural and practical reasons, they are more likely to be informally involved at home. Informal parent involvement is not typically recognized by educators, but given the significant findings of this study, teachers and school administrators should be aware of the importance of home support within the Latino culture. As educator awareness and receptiveness grows, more support and recognition should be given to Latino parents who are consistently informally supportive and who make personal sacrifices for the sake of their children’s educations.</p>
<p>As stereotypes are broken and due recognition is given, Latino parents may also become more formally involved in their children’s schools. To encourage this, educators need to be supportive and considerate of Latino parents, and the school system should support parental involvement. Recommendations for how to formally involve Latino parents in their children’s schools include provide translators at every school event, offer flexible schedules for parent–teacher conferences and other activities, seek parents’ input on school issues, send information home in English and Spanish, plan meetings as social events outside of school, and make Latino parents feel welcome at their children’s schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124511406719">Quezada et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124511406719">Zarate, 2007</xref>). Within the schools, teachers should be rewarded for recognizing and supporting home and school parent involvement, and teachers should be given incentives for offering flexible hours and arrangements for meetings and conferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124511406719">Zarate, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0013124511406719">
<title>Implications for Policy</title>
<p>Places of employment should be required to allow parents to be involved in their child’s school. For example, employers could allow flex time for employees to attend their child’s parent–teacher conferences and school open houses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0013124511406719">Zarate, 2007</xref>). As parent involvement is an indicator of school success, and success in school can lead to a more productive adult life, federal, state, and local legislation should support the relationship between home and school. Legislation should require or strongly recommend that schools report how they are actively supporting and encouraging both home and school parent involvement; schools should also report their measurements of home and school parent involvement within school districts.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Instead of viewing all students through a mainstream lens, the need for family support and home involvement among Latino students should be acknowledged, encouraged, and viewed as a strength. Although “color blindness” is often encouraged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013124511406719">Sue, 2003</xref>), the results of this study highlight the fact that students from diverse cultures may benefit from more than one form of support.</p>
