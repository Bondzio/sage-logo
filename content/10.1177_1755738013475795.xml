<p>We’ve all seen it - letters that are typed from the dictation machine not quite as we had intended. Some of these secretarial bloomers can be quite amusing. Here are a few that we have collected over the past year.<disp-quote>
<p>‘The patient has been much better since we started her on asthma nailers'</p>
<p>‘I would be grateful if you would consider removing a 1.2 m diameter pigmented lesion that has appeared on Mr X’s nose’</p>
<p>‘This lady has been complaining of instrumental bleeding for several months'</p>
<p>‘The ultrasound showed no pee fluid in the pelvis'</p>
<p>‘This patient has a very stubborn anal fisher'</p>
<p>‘Although one of our GPs did manage to inject her right shoulder excessively, her neck pain persists'</p>
<p>‘I would be grateful if you would arrange nerve conduction studies for this 72 year old lady who is profoundly dead’</p>
<p>‘Mrs X has a large sister seal’</p>
<p>If you come across any secretarial bloomers in your practice, please send them to <italic>InnovAiT</italic> and (if they are good enough and not offensive in any way) we will publish them on our blog.</p></disp-quote></p>
