<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>: The aim of this study was to compare bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) equations developed for healthy pediatric populations and for HIV-infected children using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as the gold standard. <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>: A cross-sectional study was carried out with 40 prepubertal, HIV-infected children who regularly attended the Pediatric Infectious Disease Clinic at the Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. The study was conducted from August to November 2008. Demographic data, clinical parameters, immunological status, and use of antiretroviral therapy were obtained from the patients’ medical records. We performed anthropometric parameters and body composition analyses, analyzed body composition by BIA and DXA, and compared the results obtained from BIA through using equations for both healthy and HIV-infected populations. <italic>Results</italic>: The mean ± SD age of the study population was 9.8 ± 1.2 years. Half of the population were females, and 82.5% of the children were clinically classified as B and C. Total body fat, by both absolute mass and by percentage, exhibited high homogeneity between the results obtained from BIA and DXA. However, there was no concordance in fat-free mass. The equation for healthy children showed good sensitivity and specificity when comparing the percentage of total body fat measured by DXA. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: BIA provides reliable data on total body fat but not fat-free mass when compared with DXA. The BIA equation developed for healthy pediatric populations can be used to determine total body fat in HIV-infected children.</p>

<body>
<p>During the early decades of life, the processes of growth and development involve compositional changes to lean body mass due to a reduction of total body water and an increase in bone mineral content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612471401">1</xref></sup> In pediatric populations, body composition is influenced by an array of variables, including sex, pubertal stage, genetics, nutrition status, and health conditions. In children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), additional factors also contribute to changes in body composition such as the infection itself, chronic use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), clinical and metabolic alterations, delayed growth, weight loss, and insufficient intake of both macronutrients and micronutrients. Evaluating and monitoring body composition should be essential in the treatment of these children.</p>
<p>A wide range of methods have been developed to analyze body composition. Some techniques are not readily available and are also expensive to perform, whereas others can be easily applied to clinical and field studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612471401">2</xref></sup> One such method is bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). To conduct a BIA, a low-intensity electrical current is run through the body. Lean tissues are good conductors because of their relatively high water content and the presence of electrolytes, whereas fat and bone show high resistance to electrical currents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612471401">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612471401">4</xref></sup> BIA is a 2-compartment model that divides the body into fat-free mass (FFM) and total body fat (TBF).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612471401">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another technique that can be used in body composition analysis is dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). DXA analysis involves exposure to low doses of X-ray radiation of 2 different energy levels to determine bone mineral density and body composition. DXA is a 3-compartment model that provides a highly accurate measurement of different tissues such as fat, bone, and muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612471401">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612471401">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both BIA and DXA studies have shown that HIV-infected children exhibit losses in lean body mass and subcutaneous body fat with an increase in visceral fat compared with noninfected children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612471401">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612471401"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612471401">9</xref></sup> Thus, it might seem that both methods are equally suited to body composition analysis in HIV-infected children, but this is not the case. Although BIA is a noninvasive and cost-effective method for predicting TBF and lean body mass, it cannot be used to assess body fat distribution and may be imprecise under conditions of lipodystrophy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612471401">10</xref></sup> On the other hand, although the DXA method is also noninvasive and considered the clinical gold standard because it provides highly accurate measurements of total and peripheral fat, its main drawbacks are that it requires advanced technology and is costly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612471401">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the economic constraints of large-scale clinical studies, BIA appears to be an attractive method for tracking body composition changes. However, aside from the above-mentioned issues, another concern about BIA is that its prediction equations have been questioned with regard to their applicability to pediatric populations. Indeed, the equations were developed for healthy children and may have limitations in their applicability to different ethnicities, ages, sexes, and stages of sexual maturation. Recently, some equations have been developed for specific medical conditions, including models for HIV-infected children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612471401">11</xref></sup> The purpose of this study is to assess the accuracy of BIA equations developed for healthy and HIV-infected children using DXA as the gold standard.</p>
<sec id="section1-0884533612471401" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A cross-sectional study was performed with 52 prepubertal, HIV-infected male and female children ranging from 7 to 12 years of age. The children were patients of the Care Center of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics (CEADIPe) at the Universidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP/EPM) in São Paulo, Brazil, from August to November 2008. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Universidade Federal de São Paulo, and signatures of informed consent were obtained from all participants’ parents or guardians.</p>
<p>Since BIA is intended for children older than 7 years owing to the lack of validated standards for children younger than 7 years, only patients older than this age were included. Following the criteria set by Marshall and Tanner,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612471401">12</xref></sup> pubertal maturation was assessed by physicians, and only children in stage 1 were included in the study. Because the hormones of puberty interfere with growth and other body changes, children in more advanced maturation stages were not eligible for this study. Patients were also excluded if they had additional chronic conditions such as cerebral palsy or genetic syndromes.</p>
<p>Clinical details such as HIV transmission; prophylaxis use during pregnancy, labor, and breastfeeding; and current antiretroviral therapy use were determined from each patient’s medical records. Patients were classified according to their clinical (N = not symptomatic, A = mildly symptomatic, B = moderately symptomatic, and C = severely symptomatic) and immunological (1 = no evidence of suppression, 2 = evidence of moderate suppression, and 3 = severe suppression) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stages (1994).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612471401">13</xref></sup> Presence of clinical lipodystrophy was assessed by a trained physician and was classified as lipoatrophy, lipohypertrophy, or a mixed form (lipoatrophy and lipohyperthophy).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612471401">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Measurements were performed in the morning during routine visits to the clinic. None of the children were hospitalized or receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition therapy. Body weight was measured with each child wearing only light clothing and no shoes to the nearest 0.1 kg. Height was measured while each child stood with his or her head, shoulders, buttocks, and heels touching a flat surface such as a wall to the nearest 0.1 cm. The <italic>z</italic> scores for height-for-age (H/A<italic>z</italic>) and body mass index (BMI<italic>z</italic>) were to characterize nutrition status. Children were classified as stunted (H/A<italic>z</italic> &lt; −2.0 SD), well nourished (BMI<italic>z</italic> −1.0 to +1.0 SD), thin (BMI<italic>z</italic> &lt; −2.0 SD), overweight (BMI<italic>z</italic> &gt; +1 SD), or obese (BMI<italic>z</italic> &gt; +2 SD) according to the <italic>World Health Organization Child Growth Standards</italic> (2007).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612471401">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Body composition was assessed by either DXA (LUNAR DPX-L, pediatric software version 1.5; LUNAR Radiation Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) or BIA using a Quantum BIA-101Q (RJL Systems, Inc, Clinton, MI). All DXA measurements were performed by the same experienced technician working in a specialized tertiary care center. Likewise, BIA analysis was also performed by 1 trained dietitian using 4 electrodes set to a single frequency of 50 Hz. Phase angles (PhA) were derived from the resistance (R) and reactance (Xc) measurements by using the following equation: arctangent (reactance/resistance) × (180/π). BIA model equations transform resistance and reactance values into FFM and TBF values. We used a reference created for healthy pediatric populations developed by Houtkooper et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612471401">16</xref></sup> and 2 specific equations validated for HIV-infected children reported by Arpadi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612471401">17</xref></sup> and Joffe et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612471401">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>All blood sample collections were performed by venipuncture, and approximately 9 mL was collected from each child. HIV viral load was determined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (Cobas Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Test, version 1.5; Roche Molecular Systems, Inc, Branchburg, NJ). Values &lt;50 copies/mL were considered undetectable, and HIV-RNA levels were logarithmically transformed. CD4 T-lymphocyte counts were measured by a flow cytometer (BD FACSCalibur System; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) to classify immunological stage of HIV infection.</p>
<p>Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 12.0 (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, IL).</p>
<p>Continuous variables were compared using 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and after showing statistical significance, a post hoc test (Bonferroni) was used to determine the significant differences between DXA and BIA mean values. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was performed to compare the results between the 2 methods. Sensibility, specificity, predictive value, and efficiency of BIA equations were determined by comparison with DXA total body fat as the gold standard using the cutoffs set by Dencker et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612471401">18</xref></sup> (females: values over 21.9%; males: values over 16.5%).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of all the individuals screened for the study, 5 children with cerebral palsy or other genetic syndromes were excluded from the study, 6 other children were not given permission to participate, and 1 hospitalized patient died during the study period, leaving 40 eligible patients to complete the study. The mean ± SD age at enrollment was 9.8 ± 1.2 years.</p>
<p>Demographic variables, immunological parameters, antiretroviral drug use, nutrition status, and BIA measurements are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612471401">Table 1</xref>. Most of our participants displayed moderate to severe symptoms and signs of HIV infection (82.5% of participants were classified as category B or C). On average, the group had been receiving antiretroviral therapy for 7.8 ± 2.4 years, but at the time of enrollment, 6 children were not receiving any antiretroviral drugs. The absolute CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts in our sample averaged 795.4 ± 589.1 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, and 19 patients (47.5%) presented an undetectable viral load (&lt;50 copies/mL). Regarding the <italic>z</italic> scores, the overall average ± standard deviation was −0.1 ± 1.6 for BMI<italic>z</italic> and −0.8 ± 1.3 for H/A<italic>z</italic>. According to the nutrition status, 33 patients (82.5%) were well nourished (BMI<italic>z</italic> −0.6 ± 0.79), 6 patients (15%) were overweight or obese (BMI<italic>z</italic> 2.96 ± 1.33), 1 patient (2.5%) was thin (BMI<italic>z</italic> −2.27), and 6 patients (15%) were stunted (H/A<italic>z</italic> −2.76 ± 0.75).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most BIA equations are targeted to healthy subjects and can be used for heterogeneous populations of varying age, sex, and body fat levels. On the other hand, more specific BIA equations that have been developed to target particular age groups, ethnicities, sexes, physical activity and body fat levels, and sometimes also disease conditions can only be applied to subjects whose characteristics are similar to the referred subgroup.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533612471401">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the current study, we used the general equation for pediatric populations proposed by Houtkooper et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612471401">16</xref></sup> that was validated with 94 healthy white children of both sexes between 10 and 14 years of age. We also employed equations specific to HIV-infected children. The first pediatric BIA-based predictive equation for HIV infection was established by Arpadi et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612471401">17</xref></sup> who studied a sample of 20 HIV-infected children aged 4–11 years. A later formula proposed by Joffe et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612471401">11</xref></sup> included 30 HIV-infected children aged 3–13 years and 15 HIV-infected children aged 4–19 years of different races.</p>
<p>Pubertal stage was not included in any of the equations described above. Since the process of sexual maturation leads to muscle and adipose tissue changes as well as modifications in body shape that differ by sex,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533612471401">20</xref></sup> only prepubertal children were enrolled in our study. Regarding race, the Brazilian population is characterized by ethnic miscegenation, so it is difficult to define specific ethnic groups.</p>
<p>In the first study of HIV-infected children,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612471401">17</xref></sup> the depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was linked directly to the disease severity and may have be associated with diarrhea, wasting, and other secondary diseases that influence hydration status and body cell mass depletion. It should be considered that this equation was developed in the 1990s, the first decade of antiretroviral therapy; nowadays, new drugs and better therapeutic programs preserve and enhance the immune system, improving nutrition status and reducing mortality. Indeed, clinical and metabolic alterations resulting from HIV infection and HAART use were initially described in adults by the end of the 1990s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533612471401">21</xref></sup> and later in children and adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612471401">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>One explanation for why our results are different from previous studies with HIV-infected children may be related to the difference in immunological status as measured by CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes. The absolute CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts in our sample averaged 795.4 ± 589.1 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. The study by Arpadi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612471401">17</xref></sup> showed lower values (319 ± 330 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>), whereas the study by Joffe et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612471401">11</xref></sup> showed their subjects had high CD4<sup>+</sup> counts (643 ± 521 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> in the reference group and 812 ± 530 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> in the validation group).</p>
<p>The pathogenesis of body fat redistribution is multifactorial and remains unclear. Joffe et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612471401">11</xref></sup> did not include patients who presented with lipodystrophy because they argued that visceral fat accumulation might influence the results. The prevalence of lipodystrophy in our study was 27.5% (10% lipoatrophy, 7.5% lipohypertrophy, and 10% mixed type). As we have demonstrated previously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533612471401">22</xref></sup> children with and without lipodystrophy showed similar values of TBF and FFM; they only differed in body fat distribution and not in overall body composition. Given our prior observations, we chose not to exclude patients who presented this condition from the current study.</p>
<p>Comparing BIA and DXA measurements of TBF and FFM, our results show that the equation by Arpadi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612471401">17</xref></sup> underestimates TBF, leading to lower absolute and percentage values of fat mass while yielding a higher percentage of FFM than the reference values obtained by DXA. To the contrary, the equation by Joffe et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612471401">11</xref></sup> led to transformed BIA results that overestimated most TBF values when compared with DXA.</p>
<p>In this study, the correlation coefficients obtained by comparing BIA and DXA results for TBF, in both kilograms and percentages, revealed a high degree of homogeneity (<italic>r</italic> &gt; 0.9). Conversely, we found a weak correlation with FFM between the 2 methods. Given that TBF showed a strong correlation, we performed an accuracy test using TBF percentage as a parameter. The appropriate cutoff points were chosen given the age, sex, and sexual maturation of our sample population. Our results showed that the equation by Joffe et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612471401">11</xref></sup> is the most sensitive in identifying HIV-infected children with higher levels of TBF. Reflecting the fact that it was exclusively formulated for HIV-infected pediatric populations, it seems to be a good tool for assessing body fat in these patients.</p>
<p>Although the equation by Houtkooper et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612471401">16</xref></sup> was developed from data obtained from healthy children in different stages of sexual maturation, it nonetheless had strong sensitivity and specificity when compared with DXA TBF. Furthermore, it was the most efficient of the 3 equations for TBF. Most of our patients were well nourished (82.5%), and this may be one reason why the equation for healthy children showed comparable results in our sample of HIV-infected children.</p>
<p>The low sensitivity of the model by Arpadi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612471401">17</xref></sup> may be explained by their limited number of participants and also because they only used age as a variable. Furthermore, their patients were more immunologically compromised and showed lower levels of body fat compared with the other studies.</p>
<p>A study carried out with 86 HIV-infected children found equal values of lean body mass when employing the equations proposed by Houtkooper et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612471401">16</xref></sup> and Arpadi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612471401">17</xref></sup> However, the lean body mass results obtained by both equations were lower in patients belonging to B and C categories compared with those in N and A categories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612471401">7</xref></sup> The DXA assay demonstrated that lean body mass negatively correlated with viral load replication and insufficient dietary intake. In the present study, there was little concordance between both methods in the lean body mass outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612471401">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>We did not perform body composition analysis in children younger than 7 years or in pubertal patients, so this study should be interpreted with caution when considering other age groups. Other limitations of our study are that our study group was largely mixed race and included only a limited number of patients (n = 40).</p>
<p>In conclusion, body composition analysis should be included in the routine nutrition assessment of young, HIV-infected patients. Our study shows that BIA equations produce reliable data for TBF and can be used in clinical practice; however, they have limitations for lean body mass measurement. It will be necessary to identify more convenient methods for determining lean body mass given that DXA requires specific equipment and special software. Finally, after comparing 3 different predictive equations for transforming BIA measurements, our results showed that they do not perform equally. This study demonstrated that the BIA equation for healthy pediatric populations was the best choice for analyzing TBF in prepubertal, HIV-infected children in good clinical and immunological condition.</p>
