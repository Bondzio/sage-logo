<abstract>
<p>Drawing on theories of multi-modality and critical visual literacy, this article focuses on images that five-and six year-olds painted in a class-made book, Voice on the Bus, about racial segregation. The article discusses how children used illustrations to convey their understandings of Rosa Parks’ bus arrest in Alabama. A post-structural view focusing on images that five- and six year-olds painted in a class-made book, <italic>Voices on the Bus</italic>, about racial segregation, the article discusses how children used illustrations to convey their understanding of Rosa Parks’ bus arrest in Alabama. A post-structural (Kind, 2010) idea of art as an encounter, not as a fixed representation, shaped how the images were <italic>experienced</italic> for analysis. Using the notion of synaesthesia (the joining of senses), paintings were analysed for evoked emotions and blended sensations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468798411433364">Berman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468798411433364">Boston, 2001</xref>). Additional analysis focused on sedimented meanings (Rowsell and Pahl, 2007), looking for traces from curricular conversations and local/global D/discourses about segregation, schooling experiences and religious undertones (Gee, 1996). The following analytical questions are discussed: In what ways does this illustration evoke a synaesthetic response? How is this image agentic? What are the sedimented meanings from the images? Insights gained are that children can create synaesthetic images to evoke emotions; educators can find traces of sedimented histories in student-made artefacts; and perhaps social action is embodied and expressed through art. Researchers are encouraged to continue using a hybrid of literacy theories and tools for multi-modal analysis.</p>

<list-item><p>Today I read the book <italic>Voices in the Park</italic> by Anthony Browne… tomorrow I plan to divide the students into groups to begin authoring a parallel text about Rosa Parks and racial bus segregation. We’ll start thinking about what the different perspectives might have been on the bus with Rosa… to see if this helps the students take on multiple perspectives of the same situation. Hopefully, this will lead to some possible answers to Annie’s question of why White people would make a rule to separate people on buses. (notes, 23 June)</p></list-item>

<p>Two day later …
<list id="list2-1468798411433364" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>It was very hard for the students to take on a perspective of a group such as the other White or African Americans on the bus more so than a perspective of a specific person like Rosa or the bus driver. I wanted them to consider what these groups of people might have thought or been feeling as Rosa was arrested … a lot of students looked through picture books and that was helpful for them to see photographs and illustrations of other African Americans and how their faces looked. They kept talking about how Rosa was not lifting her head and that she would not look the bus driver in the eye. The students were talking about how the other African Americans might have been afraid that they could get arrested themselves. Some thought that maybe the other White people did like African Americans but they were afraid of getting arrested and so that is why they did not speak up or do anything differently… Racial segregation is a really hard issue to grapple with … I struggle to know how to lead the discussion and what to say next. I think it is hard for the students to imagine what it’s like in someone else’s shoes. (notes, 25 June)</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The opening vignettes taken from my teaching journal capture the struggle of working with relatively affluent, but racially diverse, five- and six-year-old children in a summer enrichment programme in the southern USA, dealing with social justice issues such as segregation. Our discussions about segregation stemmed from an incident that occurred in our playground. A couple of teachers came out for recess duty and one told my students that they must get off the bench; basically, the bench is for adults. Sadly, I was unsure what to do at that point. The programme consisted of teachers (and children) from multiple school districts. Therefore, there were no stated universal playground rules. The teacher was older than me, and she and her daughter (also a teacher) were people I had not met before. So, I sat. I watched my students gather up their lunch boxes. Some students looked towards me, possibly for help, while others moved their stuff as if this was routine or expected.</p>
<p>My notes from that day indicated how uneasy I was with the situation:
<list id="list3-1468798411433364" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>I decided to bring up to the class the issue I was noticing on the playground… I just wanted to see how/what the kids thought about that, if they thought it was fair or not… why the children had to move to allow the adults to sit down and just see where they would go with that. (notes, 10 June)</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>When I brought this observation back to the class, one child’s comment stood out to me: ‘That’s just the way it is, that they’re adults so you move.’ This statement intrigued me and yet made me angry. This is exactly what I wanted the children to interrogate – rules or actions that seemed to be norms, to question why we assume benches are for adults.</p>
<p>The following day, during a class meeting, I made a connection to Rosa Parks being asked to move out of her seat on the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, during the time of the 1950 civil rights movement. Rosa’s refusal to obey the segregation laws on buses resulted in her arrest. During this period in the USA, laws were enforced that separated African Americans from Whites, for example in restaurants and bathrooms. African Americans had their own water fountains and were even banned from borrowing books from libraries. Through systematic racism, where African Americans lived and the schools their children attended were segregated. Even though the bus incident took place in the same geographic region where my students lived, most were unfamiliar with this history and began asking questions.</p>
<p>I am responsible for inserting Rosa into our inquiry. I realize one might view the connecting of Rosa to what happened on our playground as an act of minimizing the struggle and oppression of African Americans. I acknowledge that the struggle for civil rights was about much more than where to sit on a bus and that Rosa’s decision not to move was strategic for a larger social movement. With my students, I discussed how Rosa’s actions were not a choice she made one day haphazardly because she was tired, but a planned response to racial segregation. Although not equal in nature, I do believe both Rosa’s and my students’ experiences are examples of vertical power relations. I found the struggle for civil rights a historic process that the students might use to unpack issues of injustices. The children began asking questions, such as, why was Rosa told to get up from her seat and why was she arrested for her decision? These questions shifted the curriculum from solely an exploration of the bench, into investigating racial segregation.</p>
<p>Several days later, during a conversation with Annie (all students' and assistant teachers' names are pseudonyms), she kept asking questions about Rosa’s life and her decisions on the bus. Annie asked to bring her pressing question, of why a law was created to separate people, back to the class for more discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468798411433364">Kuby, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468798411433364">2011</xref>). Over the following weeks, I read children’s literature and information from the Internet about racial segregation – on buses, in restaurants, in libraries – to help the children have an understanding of the historic events and laws that led up to the civil rights movement. We constructed an audit trail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468798411433364">Figure 1</xref>) to help explore questions and document our inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468798411433364">Vasquez, 2004</xref>). The audit trail had charts from our class discussions, questions, photocopies of books we read with our responses, a timeline, a small group brainstorming webs used to write a class book, and other artefacts.

</fig></p>
<p>The use of an audit trail to document our learning supported the pedagogical practice of teaching from a critical literacy stance. Literature on early childhood critical literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468798411433364">Comber, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468798411433364">Cowhey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468798411433364">O’Brien, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468798411433364">Sahni, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1468798411433364">Souto-Manning, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1468798411433364">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1468798411433364">Vasquez, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468798411433364">2004</xref>) demonstrates that even young children are able to think critically about power, position and privilege. The students asked questions about the bench and Rosa’s life, both examples of power relations. The students used paintings, verbal role-play and writing as ways to process injustices in multi-modal forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468798411433364">Kuby, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468798411433364">Rowsell and Pahl, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468798411433364">Siegel and Panofsky, 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="sec1-1468798411433364"><title>Art as an experience: Post-structural perspectives on encountering paintings</title>
<p>Primarily centring on the images that the students painted in a class-made book, <italic>Voices on the Bus</italic>, this paper joins several theoretical perspectives together with an analytical focus on synaesthesia and sedimentation. This article demonstrates a teacher’s encounter with young children’s paintings that conveyed their understanding(s) of a social injustice. Using the notion of synaesthesia (the joining of senses), I analysed the paintings for evoked emotions and blended sensations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468798411433364">Berman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468798411433364">Boston, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468798411433364">Rowsell and Pahl (2007)</xref> discuss sedimentation as a process of identities layering into a text; therefore, texts can be seen as traces of social practice with children’s identities instantiated within the text. This article focuses on sedimented meanings in the images, looking for traces from our curricular conversations and local/global discourses about segregation, schooling experiences and religious undertones.</p>
<p>It is important to note that I resonate with a post-structural view of art as an experience. Kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468798411433364">2010</xref>, p. 126) writes about art as an encounter instead of art as a representation of fixed meaning:
<list id="list4-1468798411433364" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>This means conceptualizing art, and children’s artistic engagements and productions, not primarily as self-expressive, individual, interior, or private experiences, even though they may exhibit and invite these qualities, but as a complex, conceptual, inventive, shared, participatory, and investigative encounter.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>It was a shift for me not to think of art as a production or a mere representation, but as a shared participatory encounter. Kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468798411433364">2010</xref>, p. 126) articulates that ‘meanings are constituted in the relation between things and in moments of disruption of previously held ideas’, and then builds upon this by writing: ‘This means not looking at what art is, but at what it does, or its effects’ (pp. 127–128). My intention as the teacher/researcher was to experience or have an emotional encounter with my students’ illustrations as a way to better understand how they were making sense of racial bus segregation in light of their prior experiences and histories. Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468798411433364">Colebrook’s (2002)</xref> scholarship, and influenced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468798411433364">Deleuze and Guattari (1987)</xref>, Kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468798411433364">2010</xref>, p. 128, original emphasis) writes: ‘Art may well have meanings or messages but what makes it <italic>art</italic> is not its content but its <italic>affect</italic>, the sensible force or style through which it produces content.’ For literacy educators, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468798411433364">Rosenblatt’s (1978)</xref> transactional reader response theory might be a familiar frame to conceptualize art as an encounter. Rosenblatt articulates that each time a person reads a text, a unique poem (or experience) is evoked between the text and the reader. She also states that each reading is different because the experiences and cultural understandings we bring to a text change over time. Reader response theory has some similar attributes to the notion of art as an encounter.</p>
<p>In this same spirit, the focus of this article is not on the authors’ (students’) intentions or stated meanings from the paintings. Instead, it is on the encounter or evoked poem from the perspective of the viewer (me). The heart of the analysis centred not on what the child said the image was to ‘represent’, but on my encounter with each image. Through analysis, I was consistently asking myself what effect the images had on me. What are the evoked responses? A post-structural perspective for analysis is not common in the field of early childhood literacy, as we typically seek out the child’s intention for their art. Scholarship on post-structural theory and pedagogy is flourishing, inviting early childhood educators to embrace movement, flows, rhythms and intensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468798411433364">Olsson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468798411433364">Pacini-Ketchabaw, 2010</xref>), to go beyond a theory/practice divide using an intra-active pedagogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468798411433364">Lenz-Taguchi, 2010</xref>), and to welcome experimentation and unexpectedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1468798411433364">Olsson, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468798411433364">Lenz-Taguchi (2010)</xref> challenges educators to think not only of how children act on materials, but how materials (i.e. art, paint, paper, etc.) act on people. Analysis shifts to an experience, not a fixed meaning or way of knowing. Kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468798411433364">2010</xref>, p. 130) invites educators to ‘think beyond representation and to imagine art as a place of encounter – to find ourselves’. I invite you to find yourself in the students’ art – to encounter it.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1468798411433364"><title>Contextualizing the research: Creating <italic>Voices on the Bus</italic></title>
<p>I approached teaching from a practitioner inquiry stance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468798411433364">Campano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468798411433364">Cochran-Smith and Lytle, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468798411433364">2009</xref>), curious about the ways young children talk about injustices. I spent a summer learning alongside children, kidwatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468798411433364">Owocki and Goodman, 2002</xref>) and talking with them about issues they experienced in their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468798411433364">Sahni, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1468798411433364">Vasquez, 2004</xref>). The university-sponsored summer programme was advertised as an enrichment programme, where children learned through ‘hands on/minds on’ experiences. I had 27 five- and six-year-old children. Of the 21 students with consent for the study, 8 female and 13 male students were identified by their parents as African American, Caucasian, Asian and biracial (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468798411433364">Table 1</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468798411433364">Table 2</xref> indicates the race, gender and income levels of the specific children discussed in this article.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468798411433364">Table 3</xref> indicates the income levels of all students based on parent questionnaires (Appendix A). This is significant, because most literature on critical literacy scholarship is focused on children who are considered marginalized for various reasons (i.e. race, class, language, gender, sexual orientation, etc.) and is about empowering marginalized groups to find their voice and place in a society based on the ideologies of dominant groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468798411433364">Blackburn and Clark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468798411433364">Campano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468798411433364">Comber and Simpson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468798411433364">Edelsky, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468798411433364">Fine, 1997</xref>). I think it is important for marginalized groups to become empowered and stand up to hegemonic practices. I value and embrace the empirical research done with children of marginalized groups; this is noble and necessary work to help people to deconstruct their worlds and find ways to take action. After studying my own privileged upbringing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468798411433364">Kuby, 2010</xref>), I see a need to provide relatively affluent children with spaces to discuss injustices in their communities and, hopefully, through these conversations, initiate and engage in social change. While this might sound simplistic, hearing the voices of those who are oppressed is only one piece of social justice work. Those in positions of power and privilege need to understand how their lives and actions, even if unconsciously, oppress others. If this does not happen, it seems that oppression will remain and the voices of the marginalized will continue to be met with opposition, because those with privilege do not typically want to relinquish their powerful positions.

<sec id="sec3-1468798411433364"><title><italic>Voices on the Bus</italic> learning engagement</title>
<p>During the fourth week of the programme, I noticed my students had a difficult time thinking of varied perspectives related to the complicated issue of civil rights. I hoped to create a learning engagement that would provide space for critical conversations and an opportunity for students to explore and represent their understanding of bus segregation. I read aloud the post-modern book, <italic>Voices in the Park</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468798411433364">Browne, 2001</xref>), with the intention of the class authoring a parallel text about the day Rosa was arrested. We entitled it <italic>Voices on the Bus</italic>. <italic>Voices in the Park</italic> is in four sections, representing the perspective of two adult and two young gorillas on the same visit to a park. After reading Browne’s text, my teaching assistant, Sandy, and I divided the students into four groups: Rosa Parks, the white bus driver, the other African Americans and the other White people on the bus. I grouped the children based on a mixture of races and participation levels, such as shy versus outspoken. In these groups, we used images in picture books and verbal role-play (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468798411433364">Kuby, 2010</xref>) as ways to hypothesize what these people might have felt. We used questions such as: have you ever been on a bus before? Did you get to choose where to sit? How did you feel? How would you feel on a bus if you were told where you could and couldn’t sit? What do we notice in the picture books? After typing up the written text based on the group discussion webs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468798411433364">Figure 2</xref>), each child illustrated one page using a black permanent marker and watercolours.
<fig id="fig2-1468798411433364" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Brainstorming Web of Text for <italic>Voices on the Bus</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468798411433364-fig2.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Within each section of our book, students amazed me with how they were able to tease apart various perspectives in sophisticated ways. For example, in the section on Rosa’s voice, students not only stated that Rosa felt the law was unfair but also articulated that she might have felt sad because she knew her choice to boycott could result in her arrest, which meant she would miss her family while she was in jail. To realize that Rosa might have contemplated the consequences of her actions – one, hopefully to get the unfair law changed and two, that there were negative repercussions to being separated from her loved ones – demonstrates the complex ways in which children can pull apart and hypothesize perspectives.</p>
<p>Another example comes from the section written about the voice of the bus driver. Students hypothesized that even if the bus driver liked African Americans, he might have been too afraid to stand up for their rights because he felt pressured by the law and might have been afraid to lose his job. The group that wrote the section about the voices of the other white people on the bus thought there might have been at least two perspectives: some might have been jealous that their seats were taken by African Americans, and some might have felt the law was unfair but were afraid to say anything because they might get arrested for speaking out. The group from the perspective of the other African Americans focused on their possible fear of getting arrested and how they observed Rosa’s movements, such as her not looking the bus driver in the eyes (as indicated in picture books). Within each of these groups the students were able to play with possible viewpoints.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1468798411433364"><title>Reflexivity and ethical concerns</title>
<p>Reflecting on my own position and upbringing is important as a teacher/researcher. I spent time, before teaching, analysing experiences from my childhood that shape my ideologies about race, class, gender, religion and sexual orientation, through the use of autoethnography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468798411433364">Kuby, 2010</xref>). I am a Caucasian female raised in an upper-middle-class family. Like my students, I also grew up in the southern USA. Based on the parental questionnaires, many of the students seemed to be raised with conservative religious beliefs, as I was. Since leaving the South, I have had experiences in graduate school and living abroad that have expanded my perspectives.</p>
<p>Previously, I had taught for several years in the district where the programme took place and lived in the community for almost a decade. Through sales tax from popular shopping malls and higher property taxes, the district is able to support a range of extra-curricular activities and invests money in buildings and technology. At the heart of this large southern city is a history of struggle with civil rights and overt prejudices. An ingrained assumption is that religion, especially conservative evangelical interpretations of Christianity, is the ideology that governs many interactions, morality and laws.</p>
<p>While teaching, I struggled with my discourse. There are limitations to talking with children about paintings they create around racial issues, using a set of eight watercolours. The complex and socially constructed nature of race is simplified to yellow, brown and black. By not discussing race, I would have glossed over the power dynamics and systematic oppression manifested on the bus. On the other hand, by creating space for dialogue I allowed students to wrestle with history and social justice. I felt our discourse simplified the complex issues of race and equated it to biological skin colour. As early childhood literacy educators, we should not only choose carefully the texts we use (books, Internet sources, etc.) but also the language we use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1468798411433364"><title>Theoretical perspectives</title>
<p>Several theoretical perspectives informed the analysis. First is multi-modal design. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468798411433364">Kress (1997)</xref> argues that children draw on a plethora of modes as meaning makers. As Kendrick and McKay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468798411433364">2002</xref>, p. 45) write: ‘Children make metaphoric use of symbols that are available to them at any one time and endow these symbols with a variety of new meanings.’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468798411433364">Rowsell and Pahl (2007)</xref> state that multi-modality is based on Discourses; choosing a mode to represent is always choosing a Discourse, which is tied to larger ideologies. Gee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468798411433364">1996</xref>, p. 127) describes ‘Big D’ Discourses as ways of ‘saying-writing-being-doing-valuing-believing combinations’ that involve how people define themselves, interact with others and utilize texts. Discourses are always more than language. Discourses are about gestures, attitudes, beliefs and social identities. However, ‘little d’ discourses are the language or stretches of talk. Multi-modal design offers a perspective to look at the varied, complicated and situated contexts in which students design.</p>
<p>Second is the view of visual literacy and critical literacy, joined together. Visual literacy looks at images and texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468798411433364">Albers, 1999</xref>). Critical literacy focuses on the ways we read the world and words for power, position and privilege (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468798411433364">Freire, 2006</xref>). As Kendrick and McKay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468798411433364">2002</xref>, p. 47) posit: … images of literacy that children construct in their drawings provide insights into their personal experiences of literacy, that is, what sense they have made of the complex world of literacy in their lives both inside and outside of school. This connects to D/discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468798411433364">Gee, 1996</xref>), as children draw upon these ways of being and uses of language when illustrating. The art children create gives educators a window into their thinking, in this case specifically related to social injustices. Albers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468798411433364">1999</xref>, p. 6) says: ‘Through students’ artworks, educators are more able to identify how students see their world and how their visual constructions of meaning reveal their own beliefs about social locations such as gender, race, class, and sexual orientation.’ The class book gave a glimpse into how my students were processing racial segregation. However, each person’s reading of the images is culturally shaped by previous experiences, ideologies and histories in the viewer’s life.</p>
<p>Scholars argue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468798411433364">Pahl and Rowsell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468798411433364">Siegel and Panofsky, 2009</xref>) for the need to use a hybrid of theories when researching multi-modality specifically to embrace a critical perspective. As Siegel and Panofsky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468798411433364">2009</xref>, p. 109) state:
<list id="list5-1468798411433364" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>If studies of multi-modality are to contribute to the reimagining and redesign of literacy education in schools, it needs to be located within contemporary discourses about literacies, diversities, and power so as to offer a full account of meaning-making. Just as multi-modality involves the generative juxtapositioning of different sign systems that “contradict and balance one another,” we think it may be similarly fruitful to approach the analysis of multi-modality with a hybrid of different theories and analytic tools. A social semiotic theory of multi-modality is a valuable resource, but it does not stand alone.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Blending multi-modal, critical and visual literacy together is an attempt to broaden the theoretical perspectives used to look at students’ art.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1468798411433364"><title>Synaesthesia and sedimentation: Unlikely analytical methods</title>
<p>Initially, I was not sure what would be the best analytical tool to unpack the illustrations in <italic>Voices on the Bus</italic>. I wanted a method that moved beyond visual grammar analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1468798411433364">van Leeuwen and Jewitt, 2001</xref>), because the images were so emotionally charged and full of traces of students’ understanding of social injustices. Traditionally, a grammar of visual design focuses on the syntax or grammar of an image. I wanted to explore more than aspects such as lines, image placement and size. I had a desire to understand how my students were processing the social injustices emotionally, and how their images pulled the viewer into the shoes of the characters. I wanted to explore how the histories they brought to the design process shaped the illustrations. The notions of synaesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468798411433364">Berman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1468798411433364">Steen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1468798411433364">Ternaux, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1468798411433364">van Campen and Froger, 2003</xref>) and sedimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468798411433364">Rowsell and Pahl, 2007</xref>) helped to do that.</p>
<sec id="sec7-1468798411433364"><title>Synaesthesia</title>
<p>Visual anthropologist Sarah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468798411433364">Pink (2006)</xref> focuses on sensory experiences. She draws upon a rich tradition of anthropologists who have wrestled with defining what an ‘experience’ is and how to go about researching and representing sensory experiences. Synaesthesia is a concept that helped to articulate the sensory experience I had with the students’ art. By definition, ‘synesthesia is an involuntary joining of senses in which the real information of one sense is accompanied by a perception in another sense’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468798411433364">Ione, 2009</xref>, p. 267). Synaesthesia literally means ‘join’ and ‘senses’. By nature, the sensory perceptions of a viewer should arrive involuntarily and must be an emotional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468798411433364">Boston, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Traditionally, we think of synaesthesia as a term to describe an artist who experiences the world using more than one sense at a time. A musician that sees particular colours when they hear a certain note is an example of someone who we would call synaesthetic. However, synaesthetic art can refer to either art created by synaesthetes or art that attempts to convey the synaesthetic experience. It is an attempt to understand the relation between the experiences of born synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes, and an appreciation of such art by both groups. I am using the concept of synaesthesia to refer to the emotional responses evoked in the viewer and the ‘stirring up’ of multiple senses. As I encountered each image, I had synaesthetic experiences; the images evoked emotional responses in me, the viewer. This concept relates to a post-structuralist view of art as an experience. I do not see synaesthesia from purely a psychological perspective, but as a social interaction between viewer, artist and illustration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1468798411433364"><title>Sedimentation</title>
<p>The notion of sedimented texts helped me understand the prior experiences students drew upon as they illustrated. Histories, prior learning experiences and D/discourses are sedimented in the texts that children design. Sedimentation helps to unpack the embedded histories or identities that are brought forward in a text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468798411433364">Rowsell and Pahl, 2007</xref>). Drawing upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468798411433364">Floriani’s (1994)</xref> work, Rowsell and Pahl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468798411433364">2007</xref>, p. 392) argue that texts have histories that can be traced: ‘Texts come into being through observable interactions, as these interactions produce complex relationships between the text and its contexts, the genesis of which can be observed in interaction.’ By exploring student-made artefacts (writings, drawings, paintings, etc.) educators are able to perceive how a student’s background, home experiences and ideologies influenced the design of a text. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468798411433364">Kress (1997)</xref> notes, when children make meaning, they develop both their identities and the text. The creation of our book did not occur in a vacuum. Not only did children bring with them beliefs learned at home, at religious institutions and in their communities, but we also spent several weeks researching Rosa and racial segregation. These experiences influenced how the students painted and allowed me to view their illustrations as artefactual literacies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468798411433364">Pahl and Rowsell, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>

<sec id="sec9-1468798411433364"><title>Analytical process</title>
<p>Drawing upon the notion of synaesthesia and sedimentation, I created an analytical framework (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1468798411433364">Table 4</xref>) to analyse not only the images but also other data sources (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1468798411433364">Table 5</xref>) related to creating the class book, <italic>Voices on the Bus.</italic>

<p>The three questions in the first column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1468798411433364">Table 4</xref> are not hierarchical but overlapping, recursive and fluid. For example, histories and knowledge of students’ prior experiences shaped how I interpreted the synaesthetic response and the possible awareness of political knowledge. The analysis was based on my interpretation or experience of the illustrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468798411433364">Kind, 2010</xref>). From a teacher’s perspective, I analysed the drawings as a way to help understand what my students might have been thinking in relation to our curriculum. Each viewer of the images will interpret them in a different way. We each evoke a different poem, if you will, when we interact with art. The focus of analysis was on the interaction between the viewer and art, not the child’s intention.</p>
<p>The process of analysis was first to look only at the images. Reading the images, I focused on analysis question 1, then question 2 and finally question 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1468798411433364">Table 4</xref>). I repeated this whole process a second and third time. In addition, I read the words of the book and thought about how they informed my understanding of the images. Did they help to clarify parts of the images that were unclear to me? I then read over parental questionnaire responses to questions such as: Do you have conversations with your child about people of different ethnicities and races or conversations about issues related to fairness? The questionnaires helped to see if children might be bringing prior experiences into their current understandings of bus segregation.</p>
<p>Finally, I revisited video data from class conversations that led up to our authoring of <italic>Voices on the Bus</italic>. I listened for the ways students talked about bus segregation and civil rights issues. I looked for the ways previous conversations showed up in either the images or written texts. I also analysed the audio conversations of the small groups writing text for the book, listening specifically for the ways children used picture-book images and role-play to process what happened to Rosa and the other people involved the day she was arrested. I analysed all 20 illustrations in <italic>Voices on the Bus</italic>. Each image had some aspect of the three areas of analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1468798411433364">Table 4</xref>), although some paintings contained more instances.</p>
<p>This article focuses on two students’ illustrations, representative of the 20 images – Hunter’s and Carson’s. These were chosen because of the depth of interaction I had with the images; each provoked an array of responses. Hunter was part of the group that wrote from the perspective of the white bus driver. The text for the page he illustrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468798411433364">Figure 3</xref>) said: ‘I looked around and saw that other Black people had sad faces because Rosa was getting arrested.’ In this illustration, Hunter drew four people with what appear to be streams of tears falling to the ground. Each of the four people is coloured brown. The fifth person, much smaller in size, is coloured yellow with a blue hat, which is assumed to be the bus driver. Hunter also used speech bubbles to capture the voices of the African American people such as ‘sad’ and ‘waaay’ (sound of crying).
<fig id="fig3-1468798411433364" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Hunter’s Painting.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1468798411433364-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Carson was in the group that wrote from the perspective of the other African Americans. The page he illustrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468798411433364">Figure 4</xref>) said: ‘We noticed that Rosa wouldn’t look at the bus driver because she knew she’d get arrested for not giving up her seat.’ In his illustration, he painted three people. On the left side a woman, presumed to be Rosa, stands looking straight at the viewer. Her body is coloured brown with blue arms. Carson used yellow to highlight the area around the pupil of her eye. The middle person is assumed to be the policeman with a large hat and yellow arms and legs. His arms are pointing to Rosa. The third person, on the far right, is sitting in a seat, presumably the bus driver. The skin is painted yellow with purple clothing.

<sec id="sec10-1468798411433364"><title>Experiencing the images</title>
<sec id="sec11-1468798411433364"><title>In what ways do these illustrations evoke a synaesthetic response?</title>
<p>Several aspects from Hunter’s illustration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468798411433364">Figure 3</xref>) evoke synaesthetic responses. I was drawn to the large numerous tears falling to the ground. I was also struck by his use of brown and yellow to identify the people in his image. There were distinct frowns on the faces of the African Americans. The combination of the frowns pointing down and the tears streaming to the ground took my eyes to the bottom of the image. This evoked a heavy sadness and stirred up my anger. It was hard to read the facial expression of the bus driver, but it was interesting that Hunter appeared to paint him with tears (or is that just the driver’s arms?). The use of speech bubbles with words such as ‘sad’ and ‘waaay’, combined with the tears, evoked emotions and empathy for these people. I could smell the saltiness and moisture from the tears. I could feel the tears rolling down their faces and hear shouts of frustration.</p>
<p>Carson’s illustration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468798411433364">Figure 4</xref>) also evoked a synaesthetic response. The first thing my eyes were drawn to was the large eyes of Rosa, which were not facing the driver or the policeman. Instead, Carson drew them looking straight at the viewer, almost inviting you into the soul of Rosa. Rosa had a flat affect, not a smile or a frown. The space in-between Rosa and the other people was clearly delineated by gaps of white paper. This evoked feelings of loneliness and I felt drawn to Rosa’s experience. Carson drew the driver looking back over his shoulder at what was unfolding between Rosa and the policeman. It appeared Carson understood the range of feelings among the three people involved in this situation. Carson used size to indicate power relations. The middle person, the policeman, is the tallest with a large hat. Carson used lines, for the arm, to indicate pointing at Rosa as if reprimanding her for her decision. The bus driver, the smallest in the image, almost appears to be hiding behind the wheel.</p>
<p>Both Hunter and Carson’s images demanded interaction from the viewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468798411433364">Hopperstad, 2010</xref>). The way they drew the characters caused them to look directly at us, so to speak. Direct gaze has an impact on the way we come to engage with the content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468798411433364">Hopperstad, 2010</xref>) and moves the viewer to have a synaesthetic response.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1468798411433364"><title>How are these images agentic?</title>
<p>Hunter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468798411433364">Figure 3</xref>) demonstrated an understanding of a collective political movement. He gave voice to people who were oppressed through the use of speech bubbles. It seems he showed the effects of oppressive power and laws on people through the large tears and words of frustration expressed. His image had a communal feel, possibly metaphoric, of the collective struggle of African Americans. His picture was less organized than others; the people did not appear to be sitting on bus seats. Perhaps this unsettling feel is symbolic of the civil rights movement, people’s lives filled with fear and frustration. Hunter used specific colours and large exaggerated tears, possibly to demonstrate his understanding of the grief and injustice of segregation laws. Hunter seemed to be resisting a dominant Discourse of schooling. He was in the group assigned to the white bus driver’s voice. However, he focused on African Americans in his image, indicated by the amount of room on the paper given to their bodies and their sheer number. Perhaps he was more interested in the perspective of the African Americans and was resisting being put in the bus driver group.</p>
<p>Carson demonstrated a sense of agency and knowledge of politics in his illustration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1468798411433364">Figure 4</xref>). Perhaps most obvious was Rosa resisting the bus driver and policeman. She was not looking them in the eyes and seems to have distanced herself from them. This demonstrated Carson’s understanding of the peaceful non-violent means of resistance prevalent during the struggle for civil rights. He was politically aware of Rosa’s choice to boycott the bus law and appears to understand the hierarchical power among these three people.</p>

<sec id="sec13-1468798411433364"><title>What are the sedimented meanings from the images?</title>
<p>To consider the sedimented meanings in the images of our book, I looked back at the previous conversations about segregation. From the first day, I used language to describe the sad faces of my students on the playground when they were told they could not sit on the benches. This connected to later conversations about faces seen in the picture books we read about segregation and the civil rights movement. For example, we read a biography about Rosa and words like ‘sad’, ‘happy’, ‘hatred’ and ‘fair’ surfaced in the conversations (class conversation, 11 June). Students also indicated that they were politically aware of rules and consequences. For example, one girl talked about ‘playground laws’. This led to a discussion on who makes the rules for playgrounds and eventually to conversations about laws related to segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468798411433364">Kuby, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Focusing specifically on Hunter’s page, I thought about how he illustrated the large tears and considered that he may have experienced hurt or injustice before and cried as a way to show frustration. It seemed he could relate at some level to the feelings on the bus. It was interesting that none of the book images we looked at prior to creating our illustrations had images of African Americans crying. Hunter added this layer of understanding by painting this performance of emotion. The bus driver in Hunter’s picture also appeared to have tears, although it was hard to determine. If that was the case, Hunter seemed to indicate that the driver might have been aware of his demand to Rosa and how it made her (and other African Americans) sad. This perhaps showed Hunter’s awareness of a collective struggle of humanity.</p>
<p>During the small-group conversation to write the text for the white bus driver section of the book, Hunter shared his insight about the driver (class conversation, 24 June): ‘So, so because, maybe, he, he would like um Black people sitting in the front, front, but, but, he, but he might just get put in jail and lose his job.’ This demonstrated Hunter’s understanding of choices and consequences and perhaps his political awareness of this complex issue.</p>
<p>During class conversations before authoring our book, Hunter expressed empathy for how others are treated and seemed to have a heart for fairness. For example, Hunter expressed that he and Sam share seats on his school bus and they let ‘Brown and White people’ sit together (class conversation, 16 June). While reading <italic>Richard Wright’s Library Card</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1468798411433364">Miller and Christie, 1999</xref>), a book about Richard’s experiences as a young African American navigating the segregation system at public libraries, Hunter picked up on clues about why Richard was not able to borrow library books. He empathized with Richard lying about whom the books were for, and saw that as a good thing in order for Richard to learn to read (class conversation, 16 June).</p>
<p>In Hunter’s mother’s response on the parental questionnaire, she stated that they had conversations about race and ethnic differences:
<list id="list6-1468798411433364" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Yes, religion only. Usually only about different religions to teach tolerance. Hunter is White, but surrounded by others, Black, Indian, Asian, especially at school we usually do not talk about <italic>race</italic> or differentiate. No need to categorize based on race. (original emphasis)</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>At home, it appeared Hunter was taught to be ‘colour blind’ or to view people as the same instead of seeing how differences are not a deficit. This perspective does not focus on how people have been (and still are) treated unequally and the consequences of prejudices. It also privileges the position of those with dominant power and does not interrogate how actions, possibly viewed as harmless, do have negative consequences for those marginalized by their race. I tried to create an environment that gave space for students to question inequities. As Paley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468798411433364">2000</xref>, p. 53) writes: ‘Homogeneity is fine in a bottle of milk, but in the classroom it diminishes the curiosity that ignites discovery.’ Interestingly, in our conversations at school Hunter was able to think in sophisticated ways. For example, he stated that preachers might want to change the law (on bus segregation) but the police did not want that (class conversation, 25 June). In this statement, it seems that there are sedimented layers from religious teachings, to conversations with parents, to Hunter’s current grappling with texts and questions that surfaced in our curriculum.</p>
<p>One word sums up Carson’s discourse: fairness. Carson was that student who always reminded me (and his peers) of what is fair (or not). In response to the question of whether Carson talks at home about issues of fairness, his mother wrote that a typical statement from Carson is: ‘He got ___ and I didn’t, that’s not fair.’</p>
<p>An example of sedimentation in his image was how he represented Rosa’s eyes. Carson had past experiences of reading books where he noticed where Rosa’s eyes were looking; this history and experience was embedded in his painting. In photographs, Carson carefully examined whom Rosa looked at on the bus, specifically that she did not look at the driver directly. The following excerpt from working in a group with the assistant teacher is an example of Carson paying close attention to details in photographs (Appendix B for transcription markings):<disp-quote>
<p>Carson: [This is where Rosa Parks doesn’t even care (1) about] (<italic>referring to book picture</italic>)</p>
<p>Sandy: [OK]</p>
<p>Carson: [um, when the bus driver said get up.</p>
<p>Sandy: OK. So you are saying she didn’t care?↑</p>
<p>Carson: [Yea.]</p>
<p>Sandy: [OK, they, they]</p>
<p>Carson: [She’s not even looking at him. (<italic>referring to book picture</italic>)</p>
<p>Sandy: OK, wait a minute. They’re afraid if they sat in another seat, you said they would get in trouble? (<italic>writing on chart</italic>)</p>
<p>Carson: Yea.</p>
<p>Sandy: What kind of trouble would they get into?</p>
<p>Carson: Lots and lots.</p>
<p>Sandy: OK.</p>
<p>Carson: Rosa Parks is not even paying attention to the bus driver. And the bus driver, look how mad the bus driver is. (<italic>referring to bus picture</italic>)</p>
<p>Sandy: OK.]</p>
<p>Carson: [He’s like, “Rosa Parks, look at me” (stern voice). And she won’t.</p>
<p>Sandy: And she won’t look at him?]</p>
<p>Carson: [No.] (trails off inaudible)</p>
<p>Sandy: [Why do you think Rosa Parks won’t look at the bus driver?</p>
<p>Carson: She wants to stay where she is but she’s going to get arrested.</p>
<p>Sandy: OK.</p>
<p>Carson: Look in this book. Where she gets arrested.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This excerpt demonstrates that Carson was aware of Rosa’s purpose in not moving from her seat; how her actions showed peaceful resistance. Carson’s previous experiences, reading books with photographs of Rosa not getting up and class discussions about the bus arrest, appeared to be sedimented in his painting as he drew her eyes not meeting those of the driver or the policeman.</p>
<p>While working with peers to author the words for his section of the book, Carson focused on how parents might have felt about their children sitting together on the bus. This notion can be traced back to a previous reading of <italic>The Other Side</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1468798411433364">Woodson, 2001</xref>). In Woodson’s book, children talk about the rules their parents had made about which side of the fence they could play on, if they were white or African American. We discussed the fears parents had in allowing their children to play together. After this reading, Carson was adamant about being nice to each other and that police have changed the law now (class conversation, 19 June). Several days later, Carson made a connection with the people riding the bus and the book, <italic>The Other Side</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>Sandy: [OK, but what I’m saying is why do you think that other African Americans didn’t sit in the front of the bus?</p>
<p>Carson: Cause they um don’t want to sitting by the African Americans.</p>
<p>Sandy: But Rosa Parks knew]</p>
<p>Carson: [They could be kids of their own and they didn’t want um, they didn’t want the Black people around them.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, it appeared Carson was making a text-to-text connection from the Rosa Parks biography books he was browsing to what happened to the children in <italic>The Other Side.</italic> He was inferring that the reason for the children being separated on the bus with Rosa was similar to the rationale given by the parents in <italic>The Other Side.</italic></p>

<sec id="sec14-1468798411433364"><title>Hybrid of theories and tools: Moving literacy research forward</title>
<p>This research demonstrates a way of analysing illustrations with a focus on synaesthesia and sedimentation rather than the grammar of visual design. While a grammar of visual design is a useful tool to build upon in analysis, I needed additional perspectives to unpack the emotional responses and sedimented histories evoked. Echoing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468798411433364">Siegel and Panofsky’s (2009)</xref> call, I urge educators to draw upon a range of theoretical and analytical perspectives as we continue to explore critical and visual literacy with children. A hybrid mix of theories and a merging of viewpoints was helpful in stretching what I noticed in my students’ paintings beyond a strictly visual grammar analysis. By merging the theoretical perspectives of critical visual literacy and multi-modality with the analytical tools of synaesthesia and sedimentation, I was able to create a method to help address the research questions.</p>
<p>This research also demonstrates a post-structural perspective to art as an experience or an encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468798411433364">Kind, 2010</xref>). I encourage early childhood educators not only to talk with children about their intentions in designing artefacts but also to consider the experience evoked in the viewer. Perhaps this is another way to value multiple meanings and interpretations from encountering art. A post-structural perspective embraces multiple subjectivities and situated contexts. More research is needed to explore how art as an experience can be researched and to consider what post-structural art experiences mean for teaching.</p>
<p>Children make decisions when creating artefacts that provide insights into their understandings and feelings towards injustices. As Hopperstad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468798411433364">2010</xref>, p. 431) reminds us:
<list id="list9-1468798411433364" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Children bring with them a range of skills for visual meaning-making as they enter school… these skills need to be seen and that they represent a valuable starting point and resources for the educational task of supporting and promoting the children’s visual literacy.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>As a caution though, educators should remember that children’s artefacts are a window into their thinking and that, quite possibly, ‘a child’s interest towards a given phenomenon may be more complex than the child is able to render visually’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468798411433364">Hopperstad, 2010</xref>, p. 448). In addition, drawing upon the notion of sedimentation, children’s images can be a window into their experiences and ways of being that inform our understandings of how they are processing social injustices. Therefore, we should use the multi-modal ways in which children share their knowledge as a springboard for deeper conversations around critical issues and questions.</p>
<p>An insight from analysis is that young children can create synaesthetic images to convey empathy towards and understanding of social injustices. The children in my class appeared to use colour, size, lines and positionality to demonstrate further issues of power, position and privilege. While some children may not be able to verbalize their thinking related to social concerns, this research demonstrates that children are able to role-play various perspectives and communicate their understanding through multi-modal means. Exploration through art affords children space in classrooms to wrestle with larger social issues and encourages educators to view illustrations as a form of embodied social action.</p>
<p>Critical literacy calls for social action. Early on, I understood social action to mean a tangible visible product or outcome of a critical investigation, such as a petition, drama, an art gallery and/or public speech. While I acknowledge that tangible social action through various types of projects is powerful and an effective part of critical literacy, based on my experiences of teaching, I wonder if it is always necessary. I am reconsidering what counts as action and believe that a lot of change took place, not only during the programme, but possibly even after our time together. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468798411433364">Sahni (2001)</xref> writes, social action takes place in the imagined possibilities of students’ writing and new ways of being in relationship to others. As Lewis, Enciso and Moje (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468798411433364">2007</xref>, p. 7) posit, social action ‘is about kids performing their identities moment-to-moment, shifting and destabilizing classroom power relations… social action is performative’. Social action does not always have to be a class petition or a survey. As people, we live out our feelings and learning in such a way that they have the potential to influence future interactions and beliefs. Painting and role-play both serve as spaces for embodied social action. This is action; it is a powerful and valid aspect of critical literacy.</p>
<p>The article began with a quote from my teaching journal on how hard it was for students to take on perspectives of various groups of people related to Rosa’s arrest on the bus. The following excerpt demonstrates the result of taking time to explore multiple perspectives:
<list id="list10-1468798411433364" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Today we read our Rosa Parks book and read from the different voices to see how different people would feel… from four different perspectives. I think some of the kids were starting to understand now that the whole book is [about] how different people maybe felt differently on the bus that day. (notes, 30 June)</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The conversations around writing <italic>Voices on the Bus</italic> and painting the illustrations for each page seemed to help the students explore how other people might have felt and experienced the bus ride the day Rosa was arrested. Blending visual, critical and multi-modal literacies was helpful, as a teacher and researcher, in analysing and encountering my students’ art. Experiencing the emotions evoked and layered histories through artefacts broadens how educators understand students.</p>
