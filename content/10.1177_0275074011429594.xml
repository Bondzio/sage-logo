<p>The current political, economic, and social conditions of any country today have been dramatically affected and shaped by the transformative structural and institutional changes over the last decades, especially by paradigmatic changes that occurred at the end of the 20th century. Western democracies, however, face significant challenges that have never been as evident and devastating as they are today. The current financial crisis of Continental Europe, in particular, coincides with several inherent problems of the post-industrial age, namely, declining economic growth, higher rates of unemployment, rising income inequality, demographic shifts, and sociocultural issues. Specific attention is placed on welfare states that have long been deemed and presented as exemplary regimes—they, too, are struggling with the economic downturn and its social and political consequences, and the commonly asked and fancy question today is whether welfare states are on the verge of “death.” Or, are they in the state of impasse (stagnant condition), as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0275074011429594">Myles (1988)</xref> puts it, which needs certain transformations to revive?</p>
<p><italic>The Politics of Welfare State Reform in Continental Europe: Modernization in Hard Times</italic> by Silja Häusermann is an outstanding work that analyzes continental welfare states and their respective reform capacity. Häusermann states that the main crisis of welfare states is the policy deficiency reflected by the fact that “welfare states may spend too many scarce resources on old risks while not addressing the most pressing problems of post-industrial society” (p. 1). Her main argument is that the welfare state regimes can and should be reformed and modernized, provided certain conditions for policy change are met. Accordingly, those reforms should be in the form of institutional adjustments to fit the economic and social context of the post-industrial age. These adjustments should be directed toward balancing two major trends—the need for retrenchment in the forms of cutbacks and cost containment, and the demands for expansive policies. Such an approach, for sure, is practically difficult, especially because political parties generally avoid restrictive policies and support expansive policies on the basis of electoral dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0275074011429594">Vis, 2009</xref>). Perhaps the most important question that lies at the heart of welfare state reforms is “How to achieve liberalization without retrenchment?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0275074011429594">Bergh &amp; Erlingsson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Häusermann structures her discussion around social policy schemes with specific focus on pension policy as the subject of the case. She enlists several modernization reforms around the issue, during last 2-3 decades, in light of three continental welfare states, namely, France, Germany, and Switzerland, and proposes an analytical model seeking explanation to the politics of respective reforms, the surprisingly stronger support through these reforms is to regime outsiders (comparatively disadvantaged social groups), and their unexpected political relevance—a set of contradictory trends. In doing so, Häusermann refuses to rely on a single explanatory theory, reform dimension, or institutional/political explanation, thus, presenting a multidimensional approach of its own.</p>
<p>The multidimensional approach to the social policy scheme in general, and pension policy in particular is structured on the interplay of structural, institutional and actor-related factors. Accordingly, the structural pressures (declining economic growth, demographic aging, etc.) are expected to result in institutional misfits that, in turn, produce potential reform dimensions based on the interests of different social groups. In the case of pension reforms, Häusermann identifies four dimensions which are retrenchment (constraining benefits), financing (individualized rather than pooled), targeting (certain group oriented), and recalibration (adaptation to new social realities). By nature, retrenchment favors regime insiders (predominantly male-breadwinner labor), whereas capitalization, targeting, and recalibration favors regime outsiders (weak, socially disadvantaged, and marginal groups). These dimensions, of course, are to have their own advantageous and disadvantageous actors, thus, presenting an opportunity for what Häusermann calls “coalitional engineering” (p. 28)—a stage for negotiation and coalition building along conflict lines. The success of this very stage, though, is dependent on how flexible the negotiating parties are in terms of forming coalitions with others, and sometimes even opposite-value actors, as well as power fragmentation (or probability of veto by reform opponents) in government. The first five chapters of the book are dedicated to the explanation of the analytical model as well as its components mentioned above.</p>
<p>The following three chapters separately analyze the three welfare states in detail, testing the model in the context of each country’s modernization reforms. In light of these analyses focused on France, Germany, and Switzerland, Häusermann presents several findings. First of all, she argues that pension policy reforms in these countries have been multidimensional in the post-industrialist period stretching beyond the retrenchment agenda, with less concern for recalibration in France due to already high rates of women employment, and less concern for capitalization in Switzerland due to earlier related practice. Second, Häusermann finds that inter-actor alliances in multidimensional policy reform space emerged gradually, producing a shift from positive-sum game to zero-sum game in terms of actors’ preferences. Finally, she finds that the coalitional engineering strategies in these countries have resulted in hybrid reform packages combining restrictive and expansive policies—an attempt to compensate retrenchment policies with such benefit schemes as capitalization, targeting, and recalibration. Specifically, the regimes in France, Germany, and Switzerland have been transformed to “more egalitarian at the bottom of the income distribution and more inegalitarian for the middle and higher income levels” (p. 217).</p>
<p>In summary, Häusermann points to the importance of sociostructural aspects as well as the strategy of actors when designing policy adjustments, which would result in successful modernization reforms only under viable coalitional flexibility and/or low levels of power fragmentation. However, she cautions readers in terms of modernization success criteria and states that continental welfare states have always been concerned with poverty alleviation rather than equality issues, thus, creating a more universally acceptable measure of success. The author concludes by suggesting the use of a developed analytical model in the context of other continental welfare states as well as in the analysis of other policy fields, pointing to the universality of multidimensional policy reform space across different spectrums.</p>
<p>The book is unique in several aspects. Methodologically it combines spatial and temporal elements using a triangulation technique—a combination of quantitative and qualitative analytical tools. By doing so, Häusermann sets an example of comparative analysis not so much usual in the field of politics and/or policy analysis. The book also presents and analyzes the welfare state cases with universally applicable implications and analytical model, setting a goal for those interested in analyzing similar policy issues in different welfare regimes. Finally, despite comparatively loaded content, I find the flow of the book intriguing and the subject quite informative and self-explanatory, especially for non-field readers.</p>
<p>Häusermann’s work is definitely a groundbreaking study exploring and explaining the politics and dynamics of reform/change/modernization in today’s welfare states, thus contributing to the discussion that welfare regimes can and should be modernized to respond to the ongoing financial crisis and sociocultural demands in this ever-changing world. It is a must-read book for every policy maker seeking a comprehensive and all-encompassing model to successfully implement strategic reforms to solve complex social policy problems in post-industrial democracies. It is also a book that every politician should peruse to understand the complex and multidimensional nature of social policy issues so as to avoid single-window perspectives and engage in negotiation-based policy making with the ultimate reconciliation of restrictive and progressive policy implementation tools.</p>
