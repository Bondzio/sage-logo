<title>Is There a Future for the PLC?</title>
<p>Mitsubishi Electric Europe says that automation is changing, and the suggestion is that the role of control technology will change (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mitsubishi-automation.com">http://www.mitsubishi-automation.com</ext-link>); it claims that total solutions, in which tasks are distributed according to free capacity, are growing in importance, and individual components are irrelevant to customers.</p>
<p>There is a debate in the usage of programmable logic controller (PLC) against programmable controller (PC). Mitsubishi’s experts believe in the coexistence of both systems. Automation suppliers are supplying fewer and fewer individual components (PLCs, inverters, motion controllers, etc.) but instead are providing solutions developed especially to suit customers’ tasks.</p>
<p>Harald Voigt, PLC/HMI/Software Product Manager at Mitsubishi Electric Europe explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>What counts is the overall performance of the system, not the individual performance of the components.</p>
<p>The processors built into the system have to take on a wide variety of tasks flexibly, so the PLC will no longer exist in its familiar form in the future.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<p>Harald Voigt continued,
<disp-quote>
<p>Customers will simply be able to describe a problem via software and define a solution. It is not important to customers which processor is used to execute the task, whether it’s a PLC, motion controller, robot or inverter. This decision is made autonomously by the increasingly intelligent automation environment and according to free capacity, regardless of the nature of the task. All relevant components, from the redundant high-performance controller to the sensor, communicate in real time with one another according to the principle of distributed intelligence.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A Windows-based system may have high speed and capacity, but it is not a real-time operating system. The PLC is also comparatively secure, because it has much greater protection against unauthorised access from outside. It also supports the longer life cycles of systems and is able to execute different tasks. This flexible capability is increasingly important because strategic standards such as IEC61499, which covers function blocks for industrial control systems and guidelines for distributed intelligence in control systems, are becoming ever more important.</p>
<p>Harald Voigt said that both system types will continue to exist and be used depending on the user requirement, but that ‘In a combination of intelligent systems, the PLC assumes responsibility for all sequences that have to be particularly safeguarded’.</p>

<title>NAMUR Sensor with ATEX Approval</title>
<p>Turck Banner (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.turckbanner.co.uk">http://www.turckbanner.co.uk</ext-link>) (Companion Company) has launched Namur sensors having safety integrity level 2 (SIL2) certification and <italic>Appareils destinés à être utilisés en atmosphères explosives</italic> (ATEX) approval for use in Ex areas. The entire sensor with terminal chamber is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) compliant.</p>
<p>These inductive proximity switches feature a terminal chamber that provides a vibration-proof connection using removable screw or cage clamp terminals – this greatly simplifies exchange during servicing.</p>
<p>The wash-down version also offers maximum freedom and switching distances. Users can select between a straight and 90° angled cable outlet by simply rotating the cover. The cable is fed into the terminal chamber cover via a standard M16 cable gland.</p>
<p>Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in the terminal chamber indicate the switching state of the sensors to the user at the device. The V4A steel sensor housing can withstand very harsh media, and with protection to IP68 and IP69K, as well as a temperature range from −40 °C to +100 °C, these sensors are suitable for use in extremely harsh environments.</p>

<title>Brushless DC Motor Controller Is Programmable</title>
<p>Roboteq (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.roboteq.com">http://www.roboteq.com</ext-link>) has introduced an intelligent controller that can directly drive a Hall-sensor-equipped brushless direct current (DC) motor to 30 A at up to 60 V. The SBL1360, as it is called, is targeted at designers of industrial automation systems, mobile robots, mechatronics and medium power motor control applications.</p>
<p>The controller accepts commands from either analogue pedal/joystick, standard R/C radio, universal serial bus (USB), CAN or RS232 interface. Using the serial port, the device can be used to design fully or semi-autonomous robots by connecting it to single board computers, wireless modems or WiFi adapters. Using CAN bus, up to 127 controllers can be networked on a single twisted-pair network.</p>
<p>The SBL1360 incorporates a Basic Language Interpreter capable of executing more than 50,000 Basic instructions/second. This allows powerful scripts to be written for adding custom functions, or for developing automated systems without the need for an external PLC or microcomputer.</p>

<title>Industrial Analogue I/O Server for Process Automation</title>
<p>Lantronix (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lantronix.com">http://www.lantronix.com</ext-link>), a leading global provider of smart machine-to-machine (M2M) connectivity solutions, has launched its Lantronix xSenso controller, designed for use in harsh environments, including industrial automation, process control, manufacturing, chemicals, oil and gas industries and many more. Analogue and relay outputs allow instant control of industrial processes and equipment based on the sensor readings and predefined thresholds to solve real-time problems.</p>
<p>This controller is a compact <italic>Deutsches Institut für Normung</italic> (DIN) rail or wall-mount solution that enables analogue sensors (voltage or current) to easily and transparently send real-time data to any node on the Internet or to a cloud-based application. It can take action when a condition is met (e.g. temperature threshold, pressure level, etc.), triggering its internal relays or outputting voltage or current to control an event in real time.</p>
<p>In an existing control system, the device can also be placed in between the sensor and the controller to mirror the analogue data from its input to its output, while simultaneously presenting the data through a web browser to computers or mobile devices.</p>

<title>New CEO for Endress+Hauser</title>
<p>With effect from 1 January 2014, Matthias Altendorf will be the new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Endress+Hauser Group (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uk.endress.com">http://www.uk.endress.com</ext-link>). Klaus Endress, who has led the Group since 1995, will at the same time take his seat in the Supervisory Board.</p>
<p>Klaus Endress (64 years) has in recent years repeatedly announced his plans to withdraw from operative business. It was also known that, for reasons of age, no other member of the shareholder family would follow him right now. Klaus Riemenschneider, President of the Supervisory Board, explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>We want to avoid speculations and discussions.</p>
<p>Announcing the succession at an early stage will provide clarity and smooth the transition.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The new CEO will be Matthias Altendorf, until now Managing Director (MD) of Endress+Hauser’s largest plant in Maulburg, Germany, and since 2009 also a member of the Group’s Executive Board. Beginning with a mechanic’s apprenticeship at the Maulburg plant followed by advanced training and further education, 45-year-old Altendorf has spent his entire working life at Endress+Hauser. Working for Endress+Hauser Flowtec in Reinach, Switzerland, Altendorf took on more and more responsibilities in various positions until moving up into management as Marketing Director in 2000. In 2005, Altendorf finally returned to Maulburg as MD.</p>

<title>Tape Extension Sensor for Cost-Sensitive Jobs</title>
<p>ASM Sensor Specialists has introduced its NEW WB61 Tape Extension Sensor. This provides up to 4000 mm measuring length in a compact housing. All of these sensors have been designed to operate in harsh conditions, so they are suitable for the mobile working machine market, as well as other harsh demanding applications.</p>
<p>Because of the design of the sensor and the inherent strengths of the stainless steel tape, the type can be found in environments and areas where other sensors struggle to survive. These include hard-to-reach areas where directional changing pulleys are used, or where temperature extremes cause problems such as icing.</p>
<p>The life of the sensors is totally unaffected by the use of pulleys, which means that they are, says the company, ‘the perfect choice’ for safety-critical areas often found in crane operation, among many others, including excavators, forklift trucks, hoists and access platforms.</p>

<title>Measuring Gases in Beer Headspace</title>
<p>The OMA Process Analyser by Applied Analytics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.a-a-inc.com">http://www.a-a-inc.com</ext-link>) is used to continuously measure concentrations of hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub>S) and dimethyl sulphide (DMS) in the fermentation by-product gas involved in the beer bottle filling process. Using the OMA system, a brewery enables intelligent CO<sub>2</sub> reclamation, which continuously prevents sulphide contamination of the beer product.</p>
<p>Prior to filling, beer bottles are purged with CO<sub>2</sub> to remove air and protect the taste against oxidation. In the fermentation process, yeast consumes sugar and expels a large amount of CO<sub>2</sub>, which can be ‘reclaimed’ and used for this bottle purging purpose. Unfortunately, fermentation often also produces toxic, odorous sulphides, which can foam up into the piping and contaminate the reclaimed CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>In order to continue using the great resource of CO<sub>2</sub> by-product, yet avoid contaminating the bottled beer with foul-smelling toxins, the reclaimed gas is run through sulphide removal skids. However, sulphide breakthrough can occur if the gas does not spend enough time in the scrubber. Employees are sometimes tasked with sniff-testing the reclaimed CO<sub>2</sub>, but this is an unhealthy practice and is too discrete to vigilantly prevent product contamination. An automatic, continuous analysis solution is required in order to immediately divert contaminated CO<sub>2</sub> from use in bottling, as well as provide feedback control for the sulphur removal processing time.</p>
<p>The OMA Process Analyser uses a full-spectrum ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer to detect the absorbance of sulphides in the reclaimed CO<sub>2</sub> stream – an ideal method as CO<sub>2</sub> has zero absorbance in the UV spectrum. The OMA provides fast-response alarms to high-concentration threshold, which allows immediate diversion of contaminated CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0020294013491666-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In this beer bottle application, the OMA is typically multiplexed to automatically cycle analysis between multiple sampling points. This maximises system value by allowing one unit to monitor the raw fermentation gas entering the reclamation system, gas coming off the acid aldehyde scrubbers and the bottling gas coming off of the sulphur removal beds – all with sample stream switching at user-defined intervals.</p>

<title>COWIN Helps Certify Biomedical Sensor</title>
<p>Sensaris (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sensaris.com">http://www.sensaris.com</ext-link>) has developed an innovative multi-sensor device for monitoring vital signs. Called the ZAO, it is currently being certified and will be available by mid 2013. An organisation called COWIN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cowin4u.eu">http://www.cowin4u.eu</ext-link>) has been helping this small company through the daunting certification process.</p>
<p>About the size of a thick paperback book, the ZAO provides professional-level diagnostic data so that it can be used by medical professionals; yet, its low target volume price point of around €550 means that it can also be used by the home health market.</p>
<p>This compact, wireless battery-powered device measures glucose level, body temperature, oximetry (saturation level of a patient’s haemoglobin) and blood pressure. It uses WiFi to deliver the information to Android or iOS devices, such as smartphone, tablets and computers. Data can also be sent to a remote server for centralised processing and monitoring.</p>
<p>The ZAO weighs 310 g and measures 129 × 44 × 135 mm<sup>3</sup>, with a built-in rechargeable 3.7-V lithium battery and a microchip processor.</p>
<p>The Sensaris CEO, Michael Setton explained
<disp-quote>
<p>“As a small company, it is very challenging to find your way through all certification processes necessary to bring a medical device to market.”</p>
<p>“In late 2012, we came across COWIN, which is a European initiative to help facilitate the take-up of advanced technologies. Part of the remit is to provide advice, coaching and consultancy to European companies especially start-ups. As this is funded by the EU, it does not cost us anything, and it also means that we can be confident that the advice is impartial from people who really understand our industry and are not driven by having to meet sales targets.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Michael Setton continued
<disp-quote>
<p>“I’ve found that people who are experts in the biomedical field rarely have the breadth of experience that encompasses designing and bringing a product to market. I am very impressed with the mentor that COWIN has provided us with, as he has actual experience of all this and going through the approvals and certification processes which will really cut down the time to market.”</p>

<title>Instrument Protection Company Expands Manufacturing Capacity</title>
<p>Outdoor instrument protection specialist, Intertec (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.intertec.info">http://www.intertec.info</ext-link>), which in the United Kingdom is based in Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex, has opened an advanced new production facility, greatly expanding its ability to fabricate shelters, cabinets and enclosures for protecting process instrumentation.</p>
<p>Representing an investment of nearly £2 million, the expansion project provides the company with its second build-to-demand computer numerical control (CNC) machining line. This advanced automation eliminates many previous manual tasks, substantially shortening manufacturing times – and will help the company meet the exceptional worldwide demand for glass fibre–reinforced polyester (GRP) enclosures.</p>
<p>Patrick van Winckel, Director of Business Development for Intertec, commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>This investment allows us to shave around 25% from the production cycles of many of our specialist GRP-based outdoor instrument enclosures and shelters, giving us much greater flexibility to meet the fast-changing demand from our processing customers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Intertec has two main production centres located in Sarnia, Canada, and Neustadt, Germany, plus two smaller assembly and system building centres located in Houston, Texas, and Saint Petersburg, Russia. The new production line is housed in a purpose-built 1400 m<sup>2</sup> building extension at Sarnia. The new building increases the size of the Sarnia factory by more than a third, and expands Intertec’s total worldwide footprint by around 10%.</p>

<title>Smart Lighting Sensing in Smart Cities Saves Energy</title>
<p>From Libelium (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.libelium.com">http://www.libelium.com</ext-link>) comes a new Smart Lighting solution designed for use in so-called Smart City deployments. Based on the modular Waspmote Plug &amp; Sense! wireless sensor network platform, this device measures ambient light (luminosity) with a set of sensor probes that can be pointed in any direction. It also includes temperature and humidity sensors. The Smart Lighting solution can, therefore, monitor conditions inside buildings, in tunnels and in streets in order to save energy.</p>
<p>This sensor can measure precise light intensity information ranging from 0.1 to 40,000 lx, so that it can detect sunrise, sunset or small variations in cloud cover. It can then trigger actions for the smart control of lighting. A directional sensor probe is easily adjusted to the desired direction, even pointing directly to the sky if required, for the most accurate results.</p>
<p>Not only that, this device also combines a broadband photo-diode to detect visible and infrared (IR) light, and an IR-responding photo-diode on a single complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-integrated circuit provides a near photopic response over an effective 20-bit dynamic range, all with 16-bit resolution. This solution is, therefore, suitable for use in smart cities, in intelligent buildings and with security systems.</p>

<p>Turck (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.turck.com">http://www.turck.com</ext-link>) (Companion Company) has introduced its Diagnostic Power Conditioner (DPC) backplane for FOUNDATION Fieldbus H1 segments. This provides up to four segments with redundant power and 800 mA/segment – claimed to be the highest power in the industry.</p>
<p>In addition, the backplane communicates diagnostic data back to an asset management system via high-speed Ethernet to alert operators of any communication challenges.</p>
<p>John Vu, Product Specialist at Turck, said,
<disp-quote>
<p>Most manufacturers use a diagnostic device connected to the fieldbus segment to diagnose communication issues. However, this not only introduces noise in the network but also requires users to install software to view the fieldbus communication.</p>
<p>With Turck’s high-speed Ethernet web-server, operators can simply connect the DPC backplane to the field device and access live H1 diagnostic data from any LAN-based computer. This saves a significant amount of time and provides our customers with a more streamlined monitoring solution.</p>

<title>Booklet on How to Produce Clean Steam</title>
<p>Bürkert has published a new booklet, entitled <italic>Steam: Products &amp; Systems for Clean Steam</italic>, covering its extensive range of products used in the production of clean steam.</p>
<p>The pictorial information highlights a range that meets all steam user needs – from large-scale bespoke projects, to smaller original equipment manufacturer (OEM) solutions. This enables designers to determine the most effective clean steam control and measurement solution for their needs.</p>
<p>Moreover, being able to use custom-designed stainless steel manifolds means that existing complex assemblies of valves and pipework can be avoided or replaced, saving valuable installation time and footprint space. This strategy can also reduce the numbers of fittings, seals and pipework required – and so minimise potential leak paths.</p>
<p>The company says that this free information is extremely easy for readers to understand and take in, adopting a pictorial representation of a typical steam producing plant with arrows depicting where each steam product fits into the overall arrangement. Free copies can be obtained by emailing <email>helen.christopher@burkert.com</email>.</p>

<title>IR Windows for Better Thermal Process Inspections</title>
<p>New plastic IR inspection windows are now available from AXU to lower the costs of making routine thermal imaging inspections of electrical equipment. Many readers will be familiar with the advantages of using thermal imagers or IR thermometers to routinely check temperatures in plants, and locate hotspots that may lead to a premature failure or fire. In most cases, making a thermal inspection of, for example, an electrical cabinet requires opening doors and modifying the temperatures that exist in its normal operating state. Furthermore, internal inspections of equipment cabinets that are operating can expose operators to live circuitry and create a safety risk.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it might be possible to switch off a cabinet before making a measurement, but again this influences the process temperature, and therefore, the resulting images will not be accurate. In addition, the return to routine operation might not be instant.</p>
<p>The LookIR model xlk011 IR window panels allow accurate temperature measurements to be taken during normal operation, without opening cabinet doors or interfering with the process. The window panels are square, allowing them to be fitted easily on the front of virtually any electrical cabinet. Made from a special 2-mm-thick plastic, these IR windows are much more economic than the crystal window panels that are used on high-voltage switchgear circuitry that has the potential to flashover.</p>
