<p>This project was originally suggested by Ian Lubek at a European Society for the History of the Human Sciences conference dinner in Budapest in 2009. There had been a session on ‘Parapsychology, occultism and spiritualism’ and it became apparent that a number of scholars were working in what might at first appear to be a ‘fringe’ area. The plan was to convene a symposium on the relations between psychical research and mainstream psychology during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, comparing the situation in different countries. In particular, we wanted to address imbalances in previous research. First, post-Kuhnian developments in the philosophy of science have led to explorations of the role of social factors in the demarcation of science from pseudo-science, resulting in an emphasis on socio-cultural rather than specifically scientific ones. Second, more attention has been devoted to the role of physicists (such as William Barrett, Oliver Lodge and Lord Rayleigh) than that of psychologists in the early days of psychical research, whereas, prima facie, psychology is as relevant as if not more relevant than physics to psychical research. Finally, work in the sociology of science has focused on the role of ‘boundary-work’ in the demarcation process, thus leading to an emphasis on the rejection rather than the acceptance of psychical research by orthodox scientists.</p>
<p>I was delighted that all eight scholars whom I approached accepted my invitation to take part and that our proposal came to fruition at the ESHHS conference the following year in Utrecht – a highly appropriate venue given that the first professor of parapsychology (Wilhelm Taenheff) was appointed there, in 1953. The proposal to publish the papers resulting from this unique occasion as a Special Issue, was welcomed by the editor of <italic>History of the Human Sciences</italic> – an appropriate outlet given the journal’s long-standing commitment to the exploration of foundational and boundary issues in the history of the human sciences. I should like to take this opportunity to thank all the contributors for bringing the project to completion. I am particularly grateful to Andreas Sommer and Annette Mülberger for their encouragement and support in the early stages, and to Jim Good and Sarah Thompson for their work in shepherding the articles through the publication process. I should like to pay particular tribute to the authors for their efforts and persistence in revising their articles to meet the standards of publication. They faced numerous difficulties and setbacks, ranging from the competing demands of employment and a trans-national job move to experiencing the Japanese earthquake on the 18th floor of a building in Tokyo and its extensive aftermath. We hope the resulting collection will stimulate work in this exciting and provocative research area.</p>
