<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Healthy community-dwelling adults move from a sitting position to a standing position 40–60 times each day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511427323">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511427323">2</xref></sup> Successful performance of the sit-to-stand task involves the coordination of multiple muscle groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511427323">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Use of the upper limbs to assist in standing up (by pushing on the chair) makes the task easier and reduces the force generated at the hip joint by 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511427323">4</xref></sup> Thus, the need to use one’s hands to assist probably reflects underlying leg muscle weakness. The inability to stand up without using one’s hands to assist has been associated with falls in older people<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511427323">5</xref></sup> and is a component of the Short Physical Performance Battery, which has been associated with institutionalization, disability and mortality in large prospective studies of community-dwelling older people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511427323">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Greater muscle force is required to stand up from a lower chair height<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511427323">4</xref></sup> so older people are often encouraged to avoid attempting to stand up from low surfaces such as couches and toilets and even standard dining chairs. However, lower surfaces are often encountered in community settings and the inability to stand from low surfaces is likely to limit the person’s participation in the community. For example, most toilets are between 38 and 43 cm high.</p>
<p>For many individuals a goal of physical rehabilitation is to be able to stand up from a range of commonly occurring heights without assistance. Therefore there is a need for a reliable and responsive outcome measure to assess the impact of intervention on sit-to-stand ability in both clinical and research settings. Currently, tools which assess the ability to move from sitting to standing assess the ability to stand from particular heights (e.g. 43 cm with equal weight distribution in the Motor Assessment Scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511427323">7</xref></sup>) or the time taken to stand up from a standard height (five times in the Short Physical Performance Battery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511427323">8</xref></sup> ten times in the test developed by Csuka and McCarty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511427323">9</xref></sup>). These tools are not suitable to assess the rehabilitation goal of being able to stand without using the hands from a lower height.</p>
<p>To address this gap in available measurement tools, we developed a standardized protocol for the determination of the lowest possible height from which a person can rise from sitting-to-standing without the use of the upper limbs: the minimum sit-to-stand height test. We have previously published reports of two clinical trials which used the minimum sit-to-stand height test as an outcome measure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511427323">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511427323">11</xref></sup> In the present study, we sought to establish the reliability of the measurement procedure using repeated measures by different assessors. As we hoped the measure could be used to detect improvement in both clinical and research contexts we sought to establish its ‘internal responsiveness’ (i.e. its ability to detect change) in both inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation settings. As it has previously been suggested that a chair stand test can be a proxy measure for leg strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511427323">9</xref></sup> we also sought to establish the relationship between minimum sit-to-stand height and knee extensor muscle strength in both inpatient and outpatient settings. In summary, we aimed to assess the reliability of minimum sit-to-stand height test, its responsiveness and its relationship with leg muscle strength.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0269215511427323">
<title>Minimum sit-to-stand height test</title>
<p>For the minimum sit-to-stand height test (see supplementary material on-line), participants sat on an electric height-adjustable plinth. Participants were asked to fold their arms, keep their forearms in contact with their chests and to position their feet beneath their knees at hip width apart. The desired foot position was marked by electrical tape on the floor or wooden block on which the participant placed his or her feet. Participants were asked by a physiotherapist to attempt to stand up from the lowest height they could without using their hands to assist.</p>
<p>The plinth was progressively lowered until participants were unable to stand up without their elbows moving from their chests or other ‘compensations’ such as pushing back against the bed with the backs of their legs or widening their foot position. If the person was able to stand up from the lowest height of the plinth (47 cm), the plinth was raised and a wooden block was placed under the participant’s feet (i.e. to further lower the overall seated height) and the plinth was progressively lowered until the participant was unable to stand up without ‘compensations’. The physiotherapist ensured the participants’ safety throughout the testing. The height of the plinth was measured using a ruler with a metal retractable tape measure attached to the end of it. The ruler was placed on top of the plinth and the tape measure was used to quantify the perpendicular distance from the ruler to the floor or the wooden block for those who could stand up from lower than 47 cm height.</p>
<p>Prior to measurement, five practice trials at an easily achievable height were attempted and feedback given on how to improve performance. The full protocol is available as supplementary material on-line.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269215511427323">
<title>Reliability study</title>
<p>In order to assess the reliability of the minimum sit-to-stand height test procedure, two measurers assessed performance in 23 participants. The participants included 18 hospital patients (15 inpatients, 3 outpatients) and a convenience sample of 5 people of similar age available at the time of the study who were relatives of or visitors to the patients. Participants were included if they were over the age of 55 years, able to stand up from any height without assistance, give informed consent and follow the instructions necessary to complete the task appropriately.</p>
<p>Six physiotherapists conducted the measures. Physiotherapists included three senior and three junior staff members of the inpatient rehabilitation and aged care service at Bankstown-Lidcombe Hospital, Sydney, Australia. Four of the therapists were involved in the development of the procedure and the other two staff members were taught the procedure on the day of the study. Each participant was assessed on the same day by two testers randomly chosen from the pool of six testers. Each assessment was conducted without knowledge of the results of other assessments.</p>

<title>Responsiveness and relationship to leg muscle strength</title>
<p>In order to assess responsiveness of the minimum sit-to-stand height test and its relationship with leg muscle strength we undertook secondary analysis of data from two clinical trials. Full methods and results for these trials have been published elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511427323">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511427323">11</xref></sup> In brief, one<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511427323">10</xref></sup> compared the effects of two different approaches to strength training in an inpatient rehabilitation setting. Participants were included if they were over the age of 60, unable to stand up from a 35 cm stool without using their hands, able to give informed written consent and follow instructions necessary to complete the programme, and able to actively extend the knee and abduct the hip. The strength-training interventions were provided to 88 participants over a two-week period in addition to usual rehabilitation care. Minimum sit-to-stand height test performance improved in both groups over the two-week trial period and the improvement in the weight-bearing strength training was greater than in the non-weight-bearing group by 5.3 cm (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7 to 9.8). We suggest that this difference is clinically as well as statistically significant. Data from both intervention groups were used in the present analysis.</p>
<p>The second trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511427323">11</xref></sup> was conducted among 173 outpatients and compared the effects of five weeks of weekly group exercise classes with a waiting list control group. Participants had mobility impairment, were unsuitable for available community exercise options due to this impairment and had no contraindication to exercise. Exercise group participants improved significantly more than control group participants on measures of stepping, sit to stand and gait. No between-group differences were seen for measures of strength (knee extension and flexion), balance while standing or minimal sit-to-stand height. For the present analysis, data from the intervention group were used.</p>
<p>Both trials were conducted at Bankstown-Lidcombe and War Memorial Hospitals in Sydney, Australia and the inpatient trial was also conducted at Calvary Hospital, Sydney, Australia. The relevant ethics committee approved each study and written informed consent was obtained from each participant.</p>
<p>Knee extensor muscle strength was measured using a hand-held dynamometer. A ‘make test’ approach was used and the dynamometer was positioned at the level of the malleoli with participants sitting with hips and knees at 90 degrees of flexion. A high chair was used so the participants’ feet were free of the floor. The strength measure was taken after one practice contraction. The best of three attempts was recorded. Strength was measured in this way for both legs and the average of these values was used in the analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269215511427323">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Analyses were conducted using SPSS version 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and Stata version 11 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) statistical computing software. Paired <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to assess differences in performance on the first and second tests for individual subjects. The reliability of the measurement tool was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (1,1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511427323">12</xref></sup> We considered values greater than 0.75 to indicate excellent reliability, 0.40 to 0.75 to indicate fair to good reliability and values of less than 0.40 to indicate poor reliability.</p>
<p>In order to assess the agreement between the two measures, a plot of the difference between the two measures against the average of the two methods was created and visually inspected to assess whether there was a difference in agreement of the measure for different values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511427323">13</xref></sup> The standard error of measurement (SEM) was estimated by dividing the standard deviation of the difference between the two observations by the square root of 2 as outlined by de Vet et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511427323">14</xref></sup> The smallest detectable change was calculated as the SEM multiplied by 1.96 multiplied by the square root of 2.</p>
<p>Responsiveness was assessed in three ways. First, we used the paired <italic>t</italic>-test. Second, we calculated Cohen’s effect size (also known as effect size I, the difference between the mean baseline scores and follow-up scores divided by the standard deviation of baseline scores). Third, we calculated the standardized response mean (also known as effect size II, the responsiveness-treatment coefficient or efficiency index,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511427323">15</xref></sup> which is the ratio of observed change and its standard deviation, which therefore reflects the variability of the change). For Cohen’s effect size we considered a value of 0.20–0.50 to indicate a small effect size, a value of 0.50–0.80 to indicate a moderate effect size and a value of greater than 0.8 to indicate a large effect size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511427323">16</xref></sup> For the standardized response mean, this interpretation was adjusted for the correlation between pre and post values as suggested by Middel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511427323">17</xref></sup> The relationship between minimum sit-to-stand height and leg muscle strength was assessed by obtaining correlation coefficients and their statistical significance. The proportion of variability (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>) explained by linear regression models in which minimum sit-to-stand height was the outcome variable and leg muscle strength was the predictor variable was also obtained.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The 23 participants in the reliability study had a variety of conditions including stroke (<italic>n</italic> = 6), hip or pelvic fracture (<italic>n</italic> = 4), frailty/falls (<italic>n</italic> = 4), other medical conditions (<italic>n</italic> = 4). The mean age of all participants was 72.5 years (SD 9.5, range 58–92). Fifteen women and 8 men participated in the study.</p>
<p>Data for the minimum sit-to-stand height test and knee extensor muscle strength were available at both time points for 72 intervention group participants from the inpatient trial and 80 intervention group participants from the outpatient trial. The 72 participants from the inpatient trial had an average age of 81.5 years (SD 6.4), 39 were women and 17 had survived a stroke, 11 an orthopaedic problem and 24 were admitted to rehabilitation due to falls or decreased mobility. The 80 participants from the outpatient trial had an average age of 73.8 years (SD 10.4), 44 were women, 13 had survived a stroke and 42 reported arthritis.</p>
<p>One adverse event occurred during the reliability study. A visitor who had a cardiac stent inserted two weeks prior to testing experienced chest pain during the test and was taken to the emergency department for monitoring. No adverse events occurred during the measurement procedures in the other two studies.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215511427323">Table 1</xref> shows the average values for minimum sit-to-stand height test in the three different study samples. For the reliability study, minimum sit-to-stand height test scores were not significantly different between the first and second test occasions (mean on first test 428, SD 125; mean on second test 423, SD 107, <italic>t</italic> = 0.548, df = 22, <italic>P</italic> = 0.589). The reliability of the minimum sit-to-stand height procedure was excellent (ICC (1,1) 0.91, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96). The standard error of measurement (SEM) was 34 mm. The smallest detectable change was 95 mm. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511427323">Figure 1</xref> shows the difference between the first and second tests by the average values of the two tests by a Bland and Altman plot.</p>

<p>Performance on the minimum sit-to-stand height test changed significantly over the two weeks of inpatient rehabilitation intervention (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>t</italic> = 5.119, df = 71). The mean score on baseline was 610 mm (SD 151) and at follow-up was 531 mm (SD 113). The SD of the change was 132 mm. Cohen’s effect size was 0.53 and the standardized response mean was 0.60. These values indicate a moderate effect size. The correlation between pre- and post-intervention measures was 0.53 so the effect size would still be considered moderate after adjustment of Cohen’s effect size cut-offs.</p>
<p>After five weeks of the outpatient group exercise class there was a smaller improvement in minimum sit-to-stand height test performance, which did not reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.059, <italic>t</italic> = 1.919, df = 79). Here the mean score on baseline was 445 mm (SD 98) and the mean score after five weeks of intervention was 429 mm (SD 92). The SD of the change was 74 mm. Therefore Cohen’s effect size was 0.16 and the standardized response mean was 0.23. The latter value indicates a small effect size and former is lower than the 0.2 cut-off for a small effect size so could be considered ‘trivial’. The correlation between pre- and post-intervention measures was 0.70 so the adjusted standardized response mean was 0.30, which would still be considered a small effect.</p>
<p>In the inpatient sample there was a significant but relatively low correlation between average knee extensor muscle strength and lowest chair height at baseline (<italic>r</italic> = 0.30, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and only 8% of the variability in the sit-to-stand performance was explained by knee extensor strength. This relationship was stronger after two weeks of intervention (<italic>r</italic> = 0.42, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 17%). In the outpatient sample, there was also a significant but relatively low correlation between average knee extensor leg muscle strength and lowest chair height at baseline (<italic>r</italic> = 0.32, <italic>P</italic> = 0.004) and only 9% of the variability in the sit-to-stand performance was explained by knee extensor strength. This relationship was similar after five weeks of intervention (<italic>r</italic> = 0.30, <italic>P</italic> = 0.006, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 8%).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The procedure developed to assess the lowest possible height from which a person can stand was found to have excellent reliability. This protocol involves attention to a number of factors shown to influence a person’s sit-to-stand performance such as the use of hands to assist, using the momentum of arm swing to assist and the position of the feet.</p>
<p>The minimum sit-to-stand height test showed reasonable internal responsiveness in this setting with a moderate effect size after two weeks of inpatient rehabilitation intervention and a small effect size after five weeks of intervention in the outpatient rehabilitation setting. Responsiveness of a measurement tool must be assessed in the context of the intervention given and the population in which it is used. The lower responsiveness in the outpatient setting may indicate a ‘floor’ effect of the measure or simply smaller effects of the intervention on the ability to stand up from a low height when delivered to these participants. We recommend the measure for use in inpatient rehabilitation settings but suggest further investigation of its responsiveness in outpatient settings.</p>
<p>Sit-to-stand performance has been suggested to be a proxy measure for leg extensor strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511427323">9</xref></sup> We found the minimum sit-to-stand height test to be related to knee extensor muscle strength, but this relationship was not as strong as we expected as only 8–17% of the variance in minimum sit-to-stand height test performance was explained by muscle strength. We may have found a different relationship had we controlled for body weight as has been done by Bohannon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511427323">18</xref></sup> or shank height. It is also likely that factors other than muscle strength influence sit-to-stand performance. A study of sit-to-stand ability in performance in 669 community-dwelling adults found that quadriceps strength was the single most important determinant of sit-to-stand time but that factors such as sensation, speed of movement and psychological aspects also influenced performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511427323">19</xref></sup> Sit-to-stand performance is also likely to be influenced by an individual’s motor skill at that task (i.e. the ability to activate and coordinate the correct muscles at the correct time with the correct amount of force to meet the demands of the environment).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511427323">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>While we have not sought to formally investigate the validity of the minimum sit-to-stand height test, it has a high degree of face validity. In a rehabilitation setting, the lowest height from which patients are able to stand up is directly relevant to their rehabilitation goals and to their ability to return to pre-admission accommodation. A patient’s progress towards being able to stand-up from their lounge chair or toilet can be measured using this tool. This allows for communication of meaningful information to the patient, carers and other rehabilitation staff.</p>
<p>This work is not without its limitations. We acknowledge that the reliance of the minimum sit-to-stand height test on an electric height-adjustable plinth will limit its applicability to resource-poor settings. A similar test could be developed using a manual approach to incremental height adjustment. A larger sample size in the reliability study may have led to different results. Similarly, a representative rather than a convenience sample may have also led to different results. It would be useful to compare the responsiveness of the minimum sit-to-stand height test to that of other tests using the same sample and interventions. External responsiveness of the minimum sit-to-stand height test could also be evaluated but the selection of a ‘gold standard’ tool to use as a comparator would be difficult.</p>
<p>This protocol developed for assessment of the lowest possible height from which a person can stand up appears to be a useful clinical measurement tool, particularly in inpatient rehabilitation settings.</p>
