<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>Retrospective review of 134 consecutive patients undergoing transtemporal cerebellopontine angle surgery for nonmalignant disease from 2009 to 2011.

<title>Results</title>
<p>One hundred thirty-four patients were analyzed with a mean preoperative body mass index of 28.58. Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant difference in body mass index between patients with a postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak and those without (<italic>P</italic> = .04), as well as a similar significant difference between those experiencing postoperative brachial plexopathy and those with no such complication (<italic>P</italic> = .03). Logistical regression analysis confirmed that body mass index is significant in predicting both postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leak (<italic>P =</italic> .004; odds ratio, 1.10) and brachial plexopathy (<italic>P</italic> = .04; odds ratio, 1.07). Elevated body mass index was not significant in predicting wound complications or increased hospital stay beyond postoperative day 3.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Risk of cerebrospinal fluid leak and brachial plexopathy is increased in patients with elevated body mass index undergoing surgery of the cerebellopontine angle.

<p>Tumors of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) constitute 10% of intracranial masses, with vestibular schwannoma comprising the main pathology in this group. Surgery for vestibular schwannoma was initially developed in the 19th century, but the significant morbidity of these early techniques greatly limited their utility, with early published mortality rates as high as 40%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812471518">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812471518">2</xref></sup> The development of various imaging modalities, anesthetic techniques, and surgical techniques and the expansion of surgical approaches have made microsurgery of this region a well-tolerated and commonly performed procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812471518">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812471518"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812471518"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812471518"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812471518"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812471518">8</xref></sup> However, potentially life-threatening complications still occur, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, meningitis, intracranial hemorrhage, cranial nerve injury, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. The specific etiology of many of these complications remains in question.</p>
<p>Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the United States, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) finding that more than 35% of US adults were classified as obese in 2009-2010. In addition, no individual US state was found to have an obesity prevalence of less than 20%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812471518">9</xref></sup> Aside from the numerous potential metabolic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and endocrine risks associated with an elevated body mass index (BMI) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812471518"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>), it is well established that obesity represents an independent risk factor for surgical complications and perioperative morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812471518">10</xref></sup> Previous studies from our institution have focused on technical factors such as surgical approach and method for reconstruction of the dural defect that may influence the incidence of complications such as CSF leak.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812471518">11</xref></sup> More recent series have focused on obesity and have noted a correlation with CSF leakage at the anterior skull base; however, such a relationship has not been established with those originating in the lateral skull base or cerebellopontine angle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812471518">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812471518">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812471518">13</xref></sup> Brachial plexus injury due to intraoperative positioning represents another significant complication during lateral skull base surgery.

<p>Positioning of the obese patient. Large body habitus presents a challenge in surgical exposure and positioning. The patient is at risk for upper extremity nerve injury due to tucking of the arms (asterisk), and exposure of the lateral skull base requires that the head be turned to the contralateral side (long arrow) and the ipsilateral shoulder be pulled down (short arrow), which may strain the ipsilateral brachial plexus. In addition, the incision is placed more posterior in obese patients due to the thick neck and excess subcutaneous tissue.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between body mass index and specific complications from transtemporal cerebellopontine angle surgery. The relationship between obesity and the development of postoperative CSF leak, wound complications, brachial plexopathy, and extended hospital stay is examined. By examining elevated BMI as an independent risk factor for complications, this study is intended to better identify which patients would benefit from delayed surgical intervention, alterations in patient positioning or operative technique, or nonsurgical management options.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599812471518" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Loyola University Health System. A retrospective review was conducted examining all patients undergoing transtemporal surgery at our institution from March 2009 to July 2011. All patients with nonmalignant pathology originating in the CPA or extending to the CPA undergoing a single-stage procedure with complete preoperative demographic and postoperative data were included. A total of 134 patients were identified for inclusion (56 male, 78 female; mean age 50.9 years [range, 15-78 years]).</p>
<p>Preoperative BMI was calculated from clinic height and weight data as kilograms divided by meters squared. Clinic assessment included detailed history and physical examination as well as review of audiometric data and magnetic resonance imaging of the cerebellopontine angle. Patient charts were retrospectively reviewed and data collected regarding demographics, presenting signs and symptoms, surgical approach, pathology, and postoperative complications.</p>
<p>The surgical approach chosen was dictated by tumor size, type, and location, as well as preoperative imaging and the hearing status of the involved ear. Translabyrinthine, retrosigmoid, and middle fossa approaches were employed either alone or in combination for tumor access. All patients were placed in 2-point pin fixation with the head turned to the contralateral side. After exposure was achieved, various methods were employed for tumor extirpation, ranging from en bloc dissection to the use of the ultrasonic aspirator. An abdominal fat graft was harvested in the standard fashion for augmentation of the dural repair in retrosigmoid approaches and was placed in layered strips to serve as dural closure and for mastoid obliteration in translabyrinthine approaches. At the conclusion of each case, an occlusive (mastoid) pressure dressing was placed. On the morning of postoperative day 3, the dressing was removed and the wound was monitored for 8 hours. If the patient showed no evidence of CSF leak or fluid collection beneath the incision, and if concurrent medical conditions were well controlled, the patient was discharged home in the afternoon of postoperative day 3.</p>
<p>Each patient’s postoperative course, complications, and hospital stay were also examined in detail. The major complications specifically investigated in this study were CSF leak, wound complications (including incisional breakdown, seroma, and local/superficial wound infection), brachial plexopathy (defined as numbness or weakness in any upper extremity distribution of any duration with onset immediately postoperatively), and prolonged hospital stay (defined as &gt;3 postoperative days).</p>
<p>Data were analyzed statistically using SAS software version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina). The significance of BMI between groups experiencing complications and those without was analyzed using the 2-sample <italic>t</italic> test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine if BMI was a significant predictor of complications from transtemporal CPA surgery. Additional patient factors were analyzed in a similar fashion to determine their effect on postoperative complications.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Mean preoperative BMI in this series was 28.58 (range, 17.35-57.91). Reasons for presentation varied widely, from the major presenting symptoms of hearing loss, imbalance/vertigo, and tinnitus to facial twitching and numbness, headache, otorrhea, and the sensation of neck fullness. Additional clinical characteristics, including details of surgical approach and pathology, are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812471518"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>. The average tumor size measured radiographically was 2.69 cm (range, 1.0-9.0 cm). Of note, no patients in this series were found to have radiographic findings consistent with empty sella.</p>

<p>Body mass index was also found to be significant in predicting postoperative brachial plexopathy related to positioning (<italic>P</italic> = .04), with an odds ratio of 1.07 (95% CI, 1.002-1.148).

<p>Further analysis showed that BMI is not significant in predicting wound complications (<italic>P</italic> = 0.08; odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99-1.13), although analysis indicated that for every 1-unit increase in BMI, the odds of wound complications increase by 6%.

<title>Additional Contributing Factors</title>
<p>Data were analyzed to investigate whether additional factors may influence the development of postoperative complications. Surgical approach groups were divided into those with a translabyrinthine component and those without (including retrosigmoid and middle fossa approaches). Fisher’s exact testing revealed no significant relationship between the type of approach and the development of brachial plexopathy (<italic>P</italic> = .7511), CSF leak (<italic>P</italic> = 1.000), increased hospital stay (<italic>P</italic> = .1888), or wound complications (<italic>P</italic> = .5601).</p>
<p>The effect of sex was also investigated in this series. Fisher’s exact testing revealed a significant relationship between male sex and the development of postoperative CSF leak (<italic>P</italic> = .0118). Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed male sex as an independent predictor of CSF leak, such that the risk of postoperative leak in a male patient is 5.5 times greater than in a female patient (<italic>P</italic> = .0095; odds ratio, 5.52; 95% CI, 1.52-20.05).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Previous studies have found technical factors to be primarily responsible for complications such as CSF leakage after transtemporal skull base surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812471518">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812471518">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812471518">14</xref></sup> That there still exist a significant number of postoperative CSF fistulae despite increased experience among lateral skull base surgeons led us to postulate that additional patient factors may be contributing. Patient obesity has been linked to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH; pseudotumor cerebri) and the development of spontaneous CSF leaks occurring in the anterior cranial fossa. A series by Woodworth et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812471518">12</xref></sup> demonstrated an elevated BMI in the obese range (&gt;30) in patients with spontaneous CSF leaks and evidence of intracranial hypertension. Daniels et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812471518">13</xref></sup> showed a similar relationship between obesity, as well as weight increases in nonobese patients, and IIH. The role of obesity, however, has yet to be firmly established in the etiology of surgical complications following <italic>posterior or lateral</italic> skull base surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812471518">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Idiopathic intracranial hypertension has been found to affect obese females of childbearing age; however, the cause for this association continues to be investigated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812471518">15</xref></sup> Some have postulated that obesity resulting in increased intra-abdominal and venous pressure causes increased pleural pressure due to diaphragmatic elevation, and therefore decreased venous return from the brain, culminating in increased intracranial pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812471518">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812471518">16</xref></sup> An endocrine etiology has also been theorized, with increased adipose tissue producing increased levels of estrogen, which may contribute to IIH. Studies have noted a markedly elevated concentration of estrogen in the CSF of obese females with IIH compared with normal subjects, further supporting the hypothesis that obesity may contribute to elevated intracranial pressure via an endocrine mechanism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812471518">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812471518">17</xref></sup> Finally, the well-established association of elevated BMI and obstructive sleep apnea indicates that obesity may further contribute to elevations in intracranial pressure by nature of hypoxia and hypercapnia episodes that may result in cerebral vasodilation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812471518">18</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>It is of note that no patients in this study were found to have empty sella and that male, rather than female, sex was found to predict an increased risk for CSF leak. Elevated BMI was found to be significant in predicting postoperative leaks in this context, indicating that the development of this complication is likely multifactorial and cannot be attributed entirely to IIH. Obesity is well established as a risk factor adversely affecting wound healing by nature of its effects on microcirculation, tissue oxygenation, and collagen structure and function, among others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812471518">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812471518">20</xref></sup> All patients in this study who experienced a postoperative CSF leak were found to have evidence of a leak during the immediate inpatient postoperative period, signified by fluid collection under the postauricular wound. We therefore suspect that impaired wound healing caused by the excess subcutaneous fat in these patients likely plays a significant role in preventing an adequate seal of the dural defect with the free fat graft, resulting in CSF leaks detected early (on removal of the occlusive dressing). Contributions from obesity-associated conditions such as elevated intracranial pressure due to obstructive sleep apnea, elevated circulating estrogen levels, and increased intra-abdominal pressure are likely involved as well.</p>
<p>Because of variations in the method of tumor extirpation, with many tumors removed with the aid of the ultrasonic aspirator, pathologic tumor size was not analyzed as an independent risk factor in this study.</p>
<p>Although subarachnoid lumbar drain placement may be effective in the treatment of postoperative CSF leaks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812471518">21</xref></sup> it is important to note that no data support the routine placement of preoperative lumbar drains prior to surgery for vestibular schwannoma. However, the results of this study indicate that consideration may be given to preoperative lumbar drain placement in obese or very obese patients, as those in the group experiencing CSF leaks were found to have a mean BMI &gt;34 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Adequate exposure is of paramount importance in lateral skull base surgery. Jackler and Pitts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812471518">22</xref></sup> have noted the particular exposure and positioning challenges presented by obese patients, including the increased size of the shoulder and neck thickness, which limit the amount with which the head may be turned to the contralateral side. Our experience has been similar, with limitation in neck rotation and difficulty pulling the ipsilateral shoulder downward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812471518"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). We have also found the need to place the incision more posteriorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812471518"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>) in obese patients due to excess subcutaneous tissue, creating a greater distance from the skin externally to the cerebellopontine angle internally and therefore further increasing the difficulty in exposure. Finally, we have found it challenging to maintain an adequate seal between the mastoid pressure dressing and skin in patients with large heads and thick necks.</p>
<p>Jellish et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599812471518">23</xref></sup> have described the significant complication of peripheral nerve injury that may arise due to patient positioning resulting in brachial plexus stretch injury. The brachial plexus is at particular risk for this type of injury due to its anchoring both proximally at the vertebral and prevertebral fascia, as well as distally at the axillary sheath.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599812471518">24</xref></sup> Ample exposure is achieved without significant strain on the ipsilateral brachial plexus in the vast majority of patients. However, in obese patients with thick necks, limited neck range of motion, and large shoulders, surgical exposure is often suboptimal, and measures to improve access may result in excessive strain on the ipsilateral brachial plexus with resulting nerve injury.</p>
<p>Brachial plexopathy may have devastating consequences on a patient’s quality of life as numbness or weakness of the upper extremity may interfere with activities of daily living and occupational capacity. In this study, 12 patients experienced purely sensory symptoms, with paresthesia, dysesthesia, or pain in the distribution of the median nerve or its branches, localizing primarily to the palmar surface of the hand, thumb, and first 2 fingers on the same side as the surgical approach. Symptoms resolved entirely in 10 of 12 patients (83%) within 1 month postoperatively (range, 5-30 days). Two patients (BMI 35.91 and 57.91, respectively) experienced persistent pain and numbness past 2 postoperative years. The natural course of postoperative brachial plexus stretch injuries has been studied primarily in the setting of cardiac surgery; however, Ben-David and Stahl<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599812471518">25</xref></sup> found the prognosis of injuries occurring during both cardiac and non–cardiac surgery to be excellent, with the vast majority of non–cardiac surgery patients recovering fully between 8 and 50 weeks postoperatively.</p>
<p>By establishing a relationship between elevated BMI and an increased risk for brachial plexopathy, this study has potential to identify at-risk individuals and allow for perioperative interventions to decrease their risk. Our institution has investigated the use of intraoperative somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) monitoring during lateral skull base surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0194599812471518">26</xref></sup> After induction of general anesthesia, electrodes are placed to test the bilateral ulnar, median, axillary, and musculocutaneous nerves, and baseline potentials are recorded prior to final patient positioning. After the arms are tucked and the head is turned, potentials are again recorded and compared with baseline to ensure that no significant changes have occurred. The patient may be repositioned at this time if needed, and continuous SSEP monitoring throughout the duration of the surgery allows for repositioning at a later time should amplitudes be noted to decrease. The results of this study along with our past experience with SSEP monitoring suggest that consideration may be given for continuous SSEP monitoring in obese patients, as those patients experiencing postoperative brachial plexopathy were found to have a mean BMI &gt;32.57 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that only those patients undergoing surgery for nonmalignant disease processes of the cerebellopontine angle were included. In many cases, this represents surgery for benign, usually slow-growing tumors. The results of this study indicate that in the case of nonemergent, elective surgery, consideration may be given to deferring treatment in lieu of a preoperative dietary and exercise program to decrease BMI and therefore risk of complications of surgery to be performed at a later time. This may be challenging, however, and at the very least this study does highlight the importance of extensive preoperative counseling regarding the obese patient’s elevated risk for complications, including CSF leak and upper extremity nerve injury due to positioning.</p>
<p>By establishing BMI as a predictor for increased risk for complications following lateral skull base surgery, this study provides the opportunity to preoperatively identify high-risk individuals. The potential to intervene perioperatively to decrease these risks is a valuable adjunct for the patient’s overall success. As the rate of obesity continues to rise worldwide and the incidence of CPA pathology remains stable, it is essential to take measures to mitigate the potential negative impact of increased BMI on patient outcomes.</p>
