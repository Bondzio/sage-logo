<abstract>
<p>Homeless persons tend to die younger than the housed population and have complex, often unmet, end-of-life care needs. High levels of illicit drug use among this population are a particular challenge for health and social services professionals involved in end-of-life care services delivery. This article explores the challenges of end-of-life care services to homeless illicit drug users based on data collected during a national study on end-of-life care services delivery to homeless persons in Canada. The authors conducted qualitative interviews with 50 health and social services professionals involved in health services delivery to homeless persons in five cities. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Themes were organised into two domains. First, barriers preventing homeless illicit drug users from accessing end-of-life care services, such as competing priorities (e.g. withdrawal management), lack of trust in healthcare providers and discrimination. Second, challenges to end-of-life care services delivery to this population in health and social care settings, including non-disclosure of illicit drug use, pain and symptom management, interruptions in care, and lack of experience with addictions. The authors identify a need for increased research on the role of harm reduction in end-of-life care settings to address these challenges.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many thousands of people living in Canada experience homelessness every year. High levels of illicit drug use among this population are a growing public health concern. Although the prevalence of illicit drug use and drug of choice vary by city, this population consistently reports rates many times higher than the housed population, particularly crack cocaine and injection drug use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311402713">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311402713">5</xref></sup> For example, a recent study of the drug use trends of homeless persons living in Toronto reported that 27% had recently smoked crack cocaine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311402713">1</xref></sup> Another study reported that 38% of street-involved youth in Vancouver regularly inject drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311402713">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, recent estimates suggest that 44% to 60% of homeless persons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311402713">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311402713">5</xref></sup> have used illicit drugs during their lifetime.</p>
<p>Homeless persons experience adverse health outcomes and high mortality rates due in part to illicit drug use and associated risk behaviours,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311402713">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311402713">9</xref></sup> which heighten the risk of overdose and HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) transmission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311402713">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311402713">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311402713">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311402713">13</xref></sup> Crack cocaine and injection drug use are independent risk factors for HIV and HCV transmission,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311402713">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311402713">13</xref></sup> leading to HIV and HCV rates among homeless persons many times higher than the housed population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311402713">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311402713">18</xref></sup> Furthermore, homeless persons who use illicit drugs report an array of physical health problems, including but not limited to oral blisters,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311402713">19</xref></sup> abscesses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311402713">20</xref></sup> dental problems,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311402713">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311402713">21</xref></sup> malnutrition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311402713">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311402713">23</xref></sup> and traumatic brain injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216311402713">24</xref></sup> They also face an increased risk of physical and sexual violence, particularly women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216311402713">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269216311402713">28</xref></sup> These health challenges are often exacerbated by lack of access to health services and difficulties adhering to treatment for reasons such as geographic isolation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216311402713">29</xref></sup> lack of insurance or identification cards,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216311402713">29</xref></sup> feelings of unwelcomeness in healthcare settings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216311402713">30</xref></sup> stigmatisation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216311402713">31</xref></sup> and the daily struggle to manage withdrawal symptoms and subsistence needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216311402713">32</xref></sup></p>

For example, what barriers prevent this population from accessing end-of-life care services? What are the unique challenges of end-of-life care services delivery to this population? And also, what strategies may be used to engage this population in end-of-life care settings?</p>
<p>Although the end-of-life care needs of homeless persons who use illicit drugs have been largely overlooked by researchers, some preliminary insights may be gathered from the literature on the delivery of end-of-life care services to persons with substance abuse challenges. A small but growing body of literature has looked at the challenges of end-of-life care services delivery to persons who abuse legal and illegal substances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269216311402713">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269216311402713">46</xref></sup> Although the majority of this literature is narrow in scope, focusing on pain management and clinical case studies, it has identified several key concerns regarding pain management. First, persons with histories of substance abuse experience distress and residual pain more frequently than persons without substance abuse histories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269216311402713">40</xref></sup> Second, regulatory requirements regarding opioid use might complicate the pain management of persons with histories of substance abuse, who might require higher dosages due to higher opioid tolerance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269216311402713">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269216311402713">45</xref></sup> Lastly, it stresses the need to account for the social context of substance use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269216311402713">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269216311402713">46</xref></sup> With that said, this social context too has not been systematically explored and little attention has been paid to the ways in which the challenges posed by substance use may be compounded by homelessness.</p>
<p>The capacity of health and end-of-life care providers to develop services responsive to the needs of homeless persons who use illicit drugs is thereby limited due to these gaps in the literature. To this end, this article aims to identify challenges health and social services providers face to facilitating and delivering end-of-life care services to this population. It draws on fieldwork conducted as part of a national study of the end-of-life care needs of homeless persons in Canada, during which special attention was paid to unique challenges of homeless persons who use illicit drugs. Although fieldwork was limited to Canada, the authors feel that, as previous research on the health needs of homeless persons suggests, findings may be applicable to other jurisdictions.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="sectiontion3-0269216311402713">
<title>Study design and participants</title>
<p>This work is based on data collected between April 2007 and June 2008 as part of a study on the end-of-life care needs of homeless persons. One of the objectives of this study was to identify challenges in the delivery of end-of-life care services to homeless persons who use illicit drugs. A qualitative case study design was used to study the complexities of the delivery of end-of-life care services to this population due to its capacity to support the analysis of personal, social and structural factors affecting this population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269216311402713">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>Health and social services professionals involved in the delivery of health and end-of-life care services to homeless persons who use illicit drugs in Halifax, Ottawa, Toronto, Thunder Bay, and Winnipeg were recruited to participate in this study. Existing relationships with health and homeless service providers in Ottawa and Toronto facilitated recruitment in those cities. An annotated directory of organisations providing health and end-of-life care services to homeless persons in Halifax, Thunder Bay, and Winnipeg was developed and used to identify key informants in those cities. All potential participants were sent a letter or email introducing the study and inviting them to participate.</p>
<p>Fifty individuals agreed to participate in this study, including physicians, health administrators, nurses, shelter directors, harm reduction specialists, outreach workers and personal support workers. All participants were involved in the delivery of health and social services to homeless persons in a range of settings, including hospices, hospitals, emergency shelters, supportive housing, residential harm reduction programmes and via street outreach. Their clients included homeless persons who use illicit drugs and who had been referred to or deemed to be in need of end of life care.</p>
<p>This study was approved by research ethics committees at Saint Paul University and the University of British Columbia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion4-0269216311402713">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Semi-structured interviews were conducted at participants’ place of employment or an alternate location of their choosing. Informed consent was obtained prior to the interviews and participants retained a duplicate copy of the informed consent protocol for their records. Participants were invited to discuss: (a) the end-of-life care needs of homeless persons who use illicit drugs; (b) barriers to accessing end-of-life care services for this population; and (c) challenges delivering end-of-life care services to homeless persons who use illicit drugs. Marijuana was excluded from the list of illicit drugs considered in light of the fact that it can be medically prescribed in Canada and participants reported that it was frequently used by clients to alleviate symptoms.</p>
<p>Although the use of legal substances (e.g. alcohol, cough syrups, solvents, etc.) might pose challenges for end-of-life care services delivery to homeless persons, they were not identified as significant barriers by participants in this study and were therefore excluded from the analysis. A couple of factors might have contributed to this. First, the majority of participants indicated that one or more service providers in their communities had the capacity to deliver end-of-life care services to homeless persons addicted to alcohol by borrowing strategies used by managed alcohol programmes (MAPs), which dispense alcohol to clients on an hourly basis in order to avoid symptoms of withdrawal, discourage use of alcohol substitutes, and facilitate health services delivery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269216311402713">48</xref></sup> An in-depth discussion of the application of this model to end-of-life care settings is needed but lies outside of the scope of this article. Second, low levels of inhalant use (e.g. household cleaners, nail polish remover, etc.) have been reported among Canada’s homeless population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311402713">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interviews were audio recorded with the consent of participants and ranged in length from 45 to 120 minutes, although the vast majority of interviews were approximately 60 minutes in length. Interviews were transcribed verbatim in separate files by research assistants. Line numbers were added to facilitate line-by-line coding. A data fidelity check was conducted by reviewing transcripts while listening to the audio files.</p>

<sec id="sectiontion5-0269216311402713">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The goal of analysis for this article was to identify barriers and challenges to delivering end-of-life care services to homeless persons who use illicit drugs. Data were imported into NVivo qualitative analysis software (version 7) to facilitate coding. A preliminary set of three categories extracted from the interview guide (e.g. barriers to end-of-life care services, clinical challenges and clinical approaches) was used by the authors to lend focus to the analysis. The authors concurrently coded the data drawing upon constant comparative methods, whereby emerging sub-categories were recorded and explicated by means of constant comparison to the data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269216311402713">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269216311402713">50</xref></sup> These emerging sub-categories were discussed and revised during regular meetings between the authors and the final categories and sub-categories established based on consensus. The third category (clinical approaches) was collapsed into the second category (clinical challenges) due to the fact that the key strategy offered by participants (i.e. requiring clients to leave the premises to use illicit drugs) was itself identified as problematic. Once the final categories were established, the authors independently recoded sections of the data to verify the validity of these categories.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Several challenges to delivering end-of-life care services to homeless persons who use illicit drugs were articulated by participants. Although an overall lack of end-of-life care services was identified as a barrier, this article focuses on those that may differentiate this population from the housed, non-illicit drug using population. Seven major themes identified during analysis are grouped into two domains to explicate these challenges (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311402713">Table 1</xref>): first, barriers to end-of-life care services for homeless persons who use illicit drugs; and, second, challenges to end-of-life care services delivery to homeless persons who use illicit drugs. Where participants are quoted, the authors identify their professional designation to provide insight into the context of services delivery.</p>

<title>Barriers to end-of-life care services for homeless persons who use illicit drugs</title>
<sec id="sectiontion8-0269216311402713">
<title>Competing priorities</title>
<p>Participants identified competing priorities among homeless persons, including illicit drug use and its supporting income-generating strategies, to be a barrier to access to end-of-life care services. They believed that homeless persons who use illicit drugs de-prioritised their health needs, leading to decreased contact with healthcare providers:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>If you are worried about where your next fix is going to come from or where your next meal is going to come from and you don’t know where you are going to sleep that night, healthcare falls to the bottom of the list. (Nurse Practitioner)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As a consequence of this lack of contact with healthcare providers, participants felt that homeless persons who use illicit drugs were less likely to receive and/or adhere to treatment and, therefore, more likely to experience adverse health outcomes, resulting in emergency room visits or death. Participants felt that many homeless persons who may have benefitted from end-of-life care services were not referred to these services because their competing priorities caused them to lack the most basic level of access to health services. For example, one participant noted:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Those folks die younger and actually die suddenly. The population that I serve often doesn’t make use of [palliative care] facilities. Unfortunately, they die because they have had such poor access they drop dead like at the age of 40. I’ve lost two people in their early 50s to sudden death. (Physician)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion9-0269216311402713">
<title>Lack of trust in healthcare providers</title>
<p>Participants noted that one of the key barriers to end-of-life care services for homeless persons who use illicit drugs was their lack of trust in healthcare providers, which they attributed to the cumulative impact of the discrimination by this population in healthcare settings. Participants reported that many homeless persons who use illicit drugs were unwilling to be referred to end-of-life care services due to this lack of trust:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>The very first barrier is that the individual may really just not want to go through the process…They meet attitudes and judgment. Healthcare professionals may not see them as individuals because they just see a poor person or someone who has a drinking problem or has been using drugs. (Street Nurse)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>But also, participants believed that many homeless persons who use illicit drugs internalised discrimination encountered in healthcare settings and, therefore, did not feel worthy of receiving services. For example, one participant observed:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>There is a lot of shame. My experience has been that many of those I see in the shelter carry a lot of shame. Low self-esteem, horrific histories of trauma and abuse, mistrust of caregivers. They’ve lived very independent lives. At the end of life, when their needs increase, it’s distressing to them because they need to trust when they’ve never learned to trust. They bring with them experiences that are negative from healthcare providers. It’s a challenge. (Physician)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion10-0269216311402713">
<title>Exclusion from traditional end-of-life care services</title>
<p>Participants strongly believed that this population was excluded from mainstream end-of-life care services, such as community hospices and hospitals, on account of illicit drug use. Many participants noted that end-of-life care services providers in their community had zero-tolerance policies toward illicit drug use that automatically excluded this population. In the event that formal zero-tolerance policies did not exist, participants noted that accompanying behavioural problems were cited as a justification for excluding this population. For example:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>The clients are still on drugs. They go out, pick up some crack cocaine and they’re using it. In main stream settings, you’re not going to get that. That’s not going to happen. Traditional hospices are very rigid with their rules. There’s no flexibility around behaviours. If someone gets angry or says something wrong, they’re asked to leave. (Nurse Practitioner)</p>
<p>Many of them are substance users. About 16% (of my older clients) are crack users. One of my clients through the hospital was rejected by every long-term care facility in the city despite the fact that he was followed by an intensive case management team that would continue to follow him. They find any excuse that they can. I think he told them he only eats restaurant food because he’s delusional. We told them that he eats in hospital. He eats everything that you put in front of him. They said, “Well, we think he won’t eat our food and it will be a problem so he’s rejected from here”. (Physician)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Several participants also remarked that mainstream end-of-life care settings were not appropriate for this population due to their structure and incompatibility with lifestyles associated with illicit drug use. Mainstream end-of-life care settings were perceived to be serene, sterile places far removed from the circumstances that this population was accustomed to:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>There are barriers at the individual level in the sense of individual clients not being oriented towards connecting with services because of the types priorities [illicit drug use] we talked about already. Traditional palliative care services aren’t necessarily set up to serve the homeless. Hospital-based palliative care wards may not be able to deal very well with the chaotic type of situations that homeless clients find themselves in. Palliative care wards tend to be very quiet, calm, serene places that work in a fairly structured way. Outside of hospital there are hospices that have similar constraints. They are not used to dealing with these unorthodox clients. (Physician)</p>
<p>We did what we could. It wasn’t like the (Hospice Name). Have you been to it? It’s beautiful. Our guys would eat the swans, but it is still very lovely. (Agency Director)</p></disp-quote></p>

<title>Challenges to end-of-life care services delivery</title>
<sec id="sectiontion12-0269216311402713">
<title>Non-disclosure of illicit drug use</title>
<p>A significant challenge to the delivery of end-of-life care services to homeless persons who use illicit drugs was their non-disclosure of active illicit drug use. Participants remarked that punitive approaches to illicit drug use discouraged many clients from disclosing active illicit drug use. Participants identified several challenges that might result due to the non-disclosure of illicit drug use by clients, including but not limited to: (a) increased likelihood that clients would experience adverse drug reactions; (b) challenges in determining the cause of changes in client behaviour; and (c) difficulty in determining whether changes in health status were attributable to illicit drug use or illness progression. These challenges frequently occurred at the same time and negatively impacted client health and workplace safety. For example:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>One person had a terrible reaction. We didn’t know whether it was the disease or the drugs we had given him. Thank goodness we called 9-1-1. They came and took him because he was getting more and more violent. Thank goodness the nurse that was one was a real street fighter. She knew and just said that it was her gut sense. He was just kind of going off. I said, “Alright, we’re going with your gut and we’ll get him to the hospital”…They had to restrain him. He was off the wall and they said, “We don’t know what he’s taken. We just don’t know. Obviously, he’s had some street drugs”. He died in two days. (Nurse)</p>
<p>What has happened in the past is people have come back and they have taken something that we aren’t aware of. That happened in one particular case and the nurses were really concerned with what was going on with the person. They were unresponsive. (Nurse)</p></disp-quote></p>

<title>Pain and symptom management</title>
<p>Many participants acknowledged that they faced difficulties in addressing the pain and symptom management needs of homeless persons who use illicit drugs due to the cumulative effects of drug use on their overall health and opioid tolerance. Participants frequently referenced high levels of opioid tolerance as a concern when administering pain medication, fearing that delivering the level of medication necessary to alleviate symptoms would result in overdose. For example:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>When we first started, we were terrified that, if we prescribed too much, we’d cause them to overdose and kill them. We’re certainly learned that, with the clients we deal with, most have such a high tolerance for drug and alcohol use that it is just about impossible for us to achieve the limits of that. (Nurse/Health Administrator)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Although this served as a significant everyday challenge for many participants, it was also identified as a barrier to specialist care. Several participants reported that specialists were unable, or unwilling, to offer support to this population due to fears that they would be liable for adverse reactions. For example:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>People that are actively using drugs in palliative care is just something that they were never able to deal with. They just didn’t think they could deal with it. I talked to doctors who said they would not have anything to do with it because they knew they would be liable. How were they going to give pain medication to someone who had already self-medicated? Were they going to kill them with the pain medication? They didn’t know how to do this. (Agency Director)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion14-0269216311402713">
<title>Need for end-of-life care and addictions training</title>
<p>Many participants acknowledged that they required addictions training or, if they had worked primarily in this field, further education on end-of-life care. Participants indicated that these areas of study seldom overlapped to the detriment of their clients. For example, participants experienced in end-of-life care services delivery reported feeling unprepared to cope with illicit drug use because they had not received training in that field. Furthermore, a lack of available research on providing end-of-life care services to persons using illicit drugs was identified as a major barrier. For example:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>We’ve been really fortunate. We’ve had access to all the training and the supports and education. We’ve had incredibly good teachers on those kinds of things, but there have been lots of things we’ve had to learn ourselves. How do you provide palliative care to injection drug users? Nobody had done a lot of that before, the whole issue of prescribing to people that are using something. We kind of had to figure that out ourselves. (Health Administrator)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>But also, because this population receives end-of-life care in multiple settings, such as emergency shelters, drop-in shelters and harm reduction programmes, multiple participants reported that people providing end-of-life care had not received any formal training. For example:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>You have people that are not trained in palliative care. As a shelter environment, staff come with backgrounds but certainly not backgrounds that reflect this particular need. (Physician)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sectiontion15-0269216311402713">
<title>Interruptions in care as a result of illicit drug use policies</title>
<p>Participants identified low barrier community and shelter-based health and end-of-life care services as having an increased capacity to deliver end-of-life care services to this population due to their abandonment of zero-tolerance, abstinence-only service delivery models. Participants acknowledged that these facilities, which have been developed in several cities with the intention of providing services to homeless, hard-to-serve clients, were better able to engage homeless persons who used illicit drugs by not excluding them from services on the basis of continued drug use. However, they believed that policies requiring clients to leave the premises in order to use illicit drugs themselves posed several challenges, including but not limited to interruptions in care, risk of injury, and risk of accidental overdose. For example:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>They could still be using hard drugs, such as crack cocaine. They could be injecting cocaine or heroin. They are not using at our site, but they are free to move in and out. They can leave the property and they can use. Very seldom do I see them coming back high. I think they sort of calculate how long it would be before they can return because they know they shouldn’t return. (Nurse)</p>
<p>The people who are addicted to drugs and well enough to go out, we don’t know what they’re going to be like. We ask them not to come back until they’re straight. (Nurse Manager)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Several participants felt that expanding harm reduction policies to include onsite, supervised drug use had the potential to minimise risks and, thereby, improve the quality of care. They believed that, although existing illicit drug use policies were intended to maintain order in the facilities, they had a tendency to penalise clients for continued illicit drug use at end-of-life even as they acknowledged that it was unrealistic to expect changes in behaviour. For example:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>The guys are always doing something they shouldn’t be doing. For example, if you’re injecting cocaine in your room, that’s not good in a facility where they have to set out a series of standards for everyone. Yet, you have got somebody who’s terminal and dying within weeks. How should you then penalise that person in the dying weeks of their life, for injecting cocaine, something they’ve done for their whole life? (Nurse)</p></disp-quote></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Over the course of this study, participants identified many challenges to delivering end-of-life care services to homeless persons who use illicit drugs. Participants outlined concerns regarding the pain and symptom management needs of this population, such as high levels of opioid tolerance, echoing findings of previous studies on the delivery of end-of-life care to persons with substance abuse histories.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269216311402713">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269216311402713">45</xref></sup> There continues to be a need for research on the pain and symptom management of persons actively using illicit drugs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269216311402713">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269216311402713">45</xref></sup> which might benefit from consideration of social and structural factors impacting healthcare encounters between pain and symptom management specialists and homeless persons (e.g. lack of trust in healthcare providers, non-disclosure of illicit drug use, etc.). This has the potential to increase the effectiveness of any interventions by increasing their suitability for this client population.</p>
<p>Participants drew particular attention to social and structural barriers that significantly impacted this population’s ability to access end-of-life care services. For example, they noted that homeless persons who use illicit drugs were less likely to access health services as a result of real or perceived discrimination and lack of trust in healthcare providers. This finding is consistent with previous research on access to care for this population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216311402713">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269216311402713">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269216311402713">53</xref></sup> suggesting that this pattern continues even as the urgency and severity of health and social care needs increases. Action to increase the level of trust between homeless persons who use illicit drugs and health services providers across the continuum of health services might therefore be needed in order to minimise barriers to end-of-life care services. Researchers have identified a range of strategies to improve the delivery of nursing and primary care services to this population, including but not limited to flexible, individualised outreach services,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269216311402713">54</xref></sup> non-judgmental client-focused care models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269216311402713">55</xref></sup> and culturally sensitive health mentors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269216311402713">56</xref></sup> Evaluations of these approaches in end-of-life care settings could determine whether these benefits can be extended to this practice environment. At the very least, end-of-life care services providers might want to review these strategies to determine whether they are appropriate for their settings.</p>
<p>Participants pointed out structural barriers to traditional end-of-life care services (e.g. lack of available end-of-life care services, zero-tolerance policies regarding illicit drug use, etc.) that resulted in denial of services to this population. Participants also acknowledged that traditional end-of-life care settings (e.g. hospitals, hospices, etc.) might not be appropriate for this population due to a lack of training and experience working with this population and policies incompatible with active illicit drug use. Mandatory addictions training in end-of-life care settings and increased sensitivity to the needs of homeless persons who use illicit drugs are strategies that have the potential to improve the capacity to work with this population.</p>
<p>Concerns that the institutional culture of mainstream palliative care services is incompatible with street culture, however, suggest the need for alternatives. Podymow et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269216311402713">39</xref></sup> have shown that low barrier, shelter-based palliative care based on a harm reduction model (i.e. permitting onsite prescribed alcohol use, providing safe syringes and permitting offsite drug use) is an effective model for delivering end-of-life care to homeless persons. They demonstrated that this model results in substantial cost savings versus hospital-based palliative care, while increasing the capacity to provide culturally competent care and address the needs of a population with a high burden of illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269216311402713">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our findings suggest that, although low-barrier, community and shelter-based health services have an increased capacity to deliver end-of-life care services to this population, there are several limitations to existing approaches. For example, policies requiring clients to leave the premises to use illicit drugs, spurred on by punitive approaches to illicit drugs, have the potential to increase the risk of accidental overdose or other complications. Furthermore, such policies may render this population reluctant to disclose continued illicit drug use, thereby exacerbating health needs and clinical challenges. These findings suggest that it is both impractical and unrealistic to expect this population to abstain from illicit drug use at end-of-life. Further research is, therefore, needed to determine how to optimise low-barrier end-of-life care services for homeless persons who are actively using illicit drugs.</p>
<p>Research exploring the integration of more comprehensive harm reduction services (e.g. medically supervised drug use) into end-of-life care settings represents one potential way forward. For example, a recent study of the integration of medically supervised drug injection into a Canadian HIV-focused care facility highlighted many of the benefits of this model of care, including but not limited to the development of trusting relationships between staff and clients, improvements in client knowledge of safer injection practices, and increased engagement with health services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0269216311402713">57</xref></sup> Whether similar findings might be found in end-of-life care settings is presently unknown, but it is nonetheless one of a range of harm reduction strategies worth investigating in end-of-life care settings.</p>
<p>The authors acknowledge that harm reduction programming has proven controversial and historically faced opposition that has the potential to restrict its implementation in end-of-life care settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0269216311402713">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269216311402713">61</xref></sup> Buchanan et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0269216311402713">61</xref></sup> have argued that this opposition tends to coalesce around moral values (e.g. harm reduction sends mixed messages to youth about illicit drug use, undermines anti-drug policies, etc.) not easily swayed by scientific evidence. Scientific arguments alone will, therefore, likely not be enough to prompt the implementation of harm reduction programming in end-of-life care settings and service providers will also have to allay ethical concerns. As a consequence, end-of-life care service providers too might have the opportunity to raise their own ethical concerns, namely that new approaches are needed to improve health equity and promote dignity for homeless persons who use illicit drugs at end of life.</p>

<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>This article aimed to provide preliminary insights into the challenges of end-of-life care services delivery to homeless persons who use illicit drugs with the goal of improving services. By drawing on the experiences of health and social care professionals involved in services delivery to homeless persons who use illicit drugs at end of life, this study generated insights that might have been overlooked by focusing only on mainstream or community-based health and end-of-life care settings. Also, although subject to moral, ethical and legal debate, an important field of future research identified in this article concerns the application of harm reduction models to end-of-life care settings. To this end, the authors are presently exploring the integration of harm reduction services into Canadian end-of-life care settings, including managed alcohol programmes and supervised drug injection.</p>
<p>There are several limitations of this work. First, the authors acknowledge that there are limits to the generalisability of this work, although it is hoped that preliminary findings contained herein are of benefit to policymakers, health administrators, health and social care professionals, and researchers. Second, although drawing on the experiences of a range of health and social care professionals, this article does not include the voices of homeless persons who use illicit drugs at end of life. Preliminary interviews were conducted with homeless persons who use illicit drugs accessing end-of-life care services at an emergency shelter-based hospice, but recruitment challenges prevented the authors from generating enough data to achieve theoretical saturation.</p>
