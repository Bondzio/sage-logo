<sec id="section1-0363546512457587">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>The structural failure rate of rotator cuff repair can exceed 50%. Important predictors for repair failure are preoperative fatty muscle infiltration and myotendinous retraction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512457587">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To quantitatively assess the prognostic value of preoperative retraction of both the supraspinatus muscle and tendon for the outcome of supraspinatus repair.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512457587">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512457587">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>In 33 shoulders with complete supraspinatus tendon ruptures subjected to arthroscopic repair, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans taken preoperatively and after a mean follow-up of 24 months were studied. The exact position of the lateral extension of the supraspinatus muscle and of the tendon end was evaluated and correlated with the preoperative stage of fatty infiltration (Goutallier) and the failure rate of tendon repair.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512457587">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The mean lengthening of the muscle and tendon end was −3 mm and 4 mm in the failed repairs (n = 19) and 14 mm and 8 mm in the successful repairs (n = 14). If the supraspinatus had preoperative Goutallier stages 2 to 3 and a tendon length of less than 15 mm, the failure rate was 92%, but if the tendon length was greater than 15 mm, the failure rate was only 33%. With Goutallier stages 0 to 1, the corresponding failure rates were 57% and 25%, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512457587">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Rotator cuff repair lengthens the tendon, even if the repair fails. The possibility to lengthen the myotendinous unit is related to the preoperative length of the tendon. The combination of Goutallier grading and preoperative tendon length appears to be a more powerful predictor for the reparability of a tendon tear than Goutallier grading alone.</p>

<body>
<p>The preferred surgical treatment of symptomatic rotator cuff tears that do not respond to nonoperative management is direct repair of the tendon to the anatomic insertion site. Open and arthroscopic repairs of chronic, large tears, however, have a high mean failure rate. However, for an individual patient, the probability of the repair to fail is poorly predictable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512457587">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512457587">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512457587">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512457587">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512457587"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512457587">18</xref></sup> Musculotendinous retraction is widely accepted as the most important pathophysiological consequence of chronic tendon tearing and as a major limitation for successful operative tendon-to-bone repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512457587">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512457587">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512457587">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512457587">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512457587">21</xref></sup> Tendon and muscle shortening are, however, not synchronous after tendon tear. A previous investigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512457587">14</xref></sup> has shown that up to Goutallier stage 3 (as much fat in the muscle as muscle substance), musculotendinous retraction occurs mostly through shortening of the muscle fibers. After some tendon loss in the initial stage, tendon shortening remains remarkably unaltered until stages 1 to 3 and increases between Goutallier stages 3 and 4. Conversely, muscle fiber length remains almost unaltered in these advanced stages. The quantitative findings on myotendinous retraction imply that the necessary muscle fiber lengthening during repair of large rotator cuff tears is approximately 100%. This is physiologically not possible and would demand disruption of the muscle fibers. We therefore hypothesized that the individual contribution of muscle and/or tendon shortening might be better predictors for the elasticity of the musculotendinous unit, which is considered an important factor for the success of tendon repair.</p>
<p>Therefore, we set out to investigate the effect of the previously described analysis of muscle and tendon retraction on failure or success of operative supraspinatus repair.</p>
<sec id="section7-0363546512457587" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Patients with either a full-thickness supraspinatus or a multitendon rotator cuff tear who had undergone standardized pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance scanning were identified from 2 previous investigations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512457587">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512457587">22</xref></sup> which were, however, not related to the current research question.</p>
<p>Complete clinical and imaging data of 33 patients (12 women and 21 men, with a mean age of 58 years [range, 39-82 years]) with documented supraspinatus tendon tears and standardized pre- and postoperative (mean follow-up: 24 months; range, 6-50 months) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans could be identified and were included in the investigation.</p>
<p>All operative notes were reviewed for exact description of tear size and involved tendons.</p>
<p>Magnetic resonance arthrography protocols included oblique coronal proton density–weighted and T2-weighted fat-saturated spin-echo images, oblique coronal T1-weighted fat-saturated spin-echo images, oblique sagittal T1-weighted spin-echo images, and transverse T1-weighted spin-echo images.</p>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging data were stored on a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) workstation, and image analysis software (AGFA-Orhtopaedic-Tools, Greenville, South Carolina) was used for review and measurement of images.</p>
<p>Fatty infiltration of all rotator cuff muscles was assessed on MRI according to Fuchs et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512457587">3</xref></sup> a grading system that is based on and adapted to the Goutallier classification,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512457587">9</xref></sup> which has been established for computed tomography. Grading was on the most lateral parasagittal T1-weighted image on which the scapular spine was in contact with the scapular body. The stages identified were as follows: stage 0, normal muscle; stage 1, some fatty streaks; stage 2, manifest fatty infiltration but less fat than muscle; stage 3, as much fat as muscle; and stage 4, more fat than muscle.</p>
<p>As previously described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512457587">14</xref></sup> the retraction of the supraspinatus myotendinous unit was assessed on oblique coronal (perpendicular to the plane of the glenoid fossa) sections through the center of the supraspinatus tendon. Tendon retraction was measured as the distance from the lateral edge of the humeral articular cartilage to the lateral end of the tendon stump (retraction of free tendon end), and the retraction of the myotendinous junction (muscle retraction) was measured as the distance from the lateral edge of the humeral articular cartilage to the most lateral insertion of the muscle into the tendon. Transition areas with markedly increased signal intensity compared with normal cuff tissue were included in the tear size. Adjacent images were used to clarify the anatomic relationships if required. By subtracting the measured tendon retraction from the myotendinous retraction, the length of the supraspinatus tendon stump was defined as the <italic>tendon length</italic>. For all measurements, the articular-sided junctions were used, as these showed an excellent interobserver reliability in a previous investigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512457587">14</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512457587">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Postoperative MRI scans were taken at an average of 24 months (range, 6-50 months) after surgery for reasons not related to this study. The same measurements were performed. A defect with a distance from tendon end to the greater tuberosity of more than 5 mm was interpreted as a failure of repair. All postoperative magnetic resonance arthrographies were performed for scientific reasons after receiving informed consent from the responsible local authority. Therefore, no bias due to postoperative pain or impairment of function influences the reported outcome data.</p>
<p>All MRI studies were randomly mixed and interpreted by consensus readout of 2 observers familiar with the measurement technique from a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512457587">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In accordance with previous reports,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512457587">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512457587">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512457587">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512457587">20</xref></sup> a minimum 6-month follow-up was defined as appropriate to assess secure tendon healing, and therefore patients with postoperative MRI scans taken earlier than 6 months after the repair were not included in the study.</p>
<p>On the basis of a general permit issued by the responsible state agency, our institutional review board allows retrospective analysis of patient data relating to standard diagnostic or therapeutic procedures without individual informed consent.</p>
<sec id="section8-0363546512457587">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>The surgical technique evolved from open (n = 15 patients) to arthroscopic (n = 18 patients) rotator cuff repair over time.</p>
<p>Open rotator cuff repair was performed with use of a transosseous tendon reinsertion and augmentation technique using a superolateral approach. Musculotendinous units were mobilized to allow repair to their original insertion site with use of a transosseous technique with No. 2 or 3 braided sutures and modified Mason-Allen stitches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512457587">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512457587">8</xref></sup> In all shoulders, a small titanium plate (Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland) was used as a cortical augmentation device to increase transosseous cut-out strength.</p>
<p>Arthroscopic repair was performed with the patient in the beach-chair position under general hypotensive anesthesia. An interscalene block was typically administered before surgery. The number of fixation points to screw-in anchors was according to the size of the tear and the retraction of the tendon.</p>
<p>Postoperatively, an abduction splint was worn for 6 weeks in both groups. Strictly passive exercises were performed under the supervision of a physical therapist. Active exercises were not allowed earlier than 6 weeks postoperatively, and strengthening exercises were begun after 12 weeks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363546512457587">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed with the Prism software package, version 4 for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California). Student <italic>t</italic> test was performed for intergroup comparison of successful and failed repairs. Odds ratios were calculated as crude odds ratio and stratified by subgroup to allow identification of interacting factors. Fisher exact test was used where appropriate for differences in proportion. Level of significance was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The mean time between the 33 preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) arthrographies and the respective operations was 2.8 months (range, 0-17 months). Postoperative MR scans were performed at a mean of 24 months (range, 6-50 months) after surgery. The open technique was used in 15 patients, and 18 patients were treated arthroscopically.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the surgical protocols of the study group revealed full-thickness supraspinatus tears in all cases. In 3 shoulders, only the supraspinatus (SSP) tendon was affected. The supraspinatus tear extended into the infraspinatus tendon in 7 cases and into the subscapularis tendon in 13 cases, and all 3 tendons were involved in 10 cases.</p>
<p>There was fatty supraspinatus muscle infiltration of Goutallier stage 0 in 1 shoulder, stage 1 in 14 shoulders, stage 2 in 15 shoulders, and stage 3 in 3 shoulders.</p>
<p>As expected, the tear size and the muscle retraction increased proportionally with the Goutallier stages. Simultaneously, the length of the visible tendon stump (tendon length) decreased with increased fatty infiltration (and presumably time) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512457587">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Postoperative MR scans revealed failures of the SSP repair in 19 of the 33 shoulders (57.6%). Eight of 15 (53%) failed in the open group, whereas 11 of 18 (61%) failed in the arthroscopic group (<italic>P</italic> = .25).</p>
<p>Retrospective analysis of the preoperative tendon length and myotendinous retraction revealed some significant differences between the groups with successful and failed repairs. The myotendinous retraction from the footprint was 41.5 mm in the failed group and 37 mm in the successful group. The respective values for the tendon retraction were 29.1 mm and 20.1 mm, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .008 [tendon] and <italic>P</italic> = .2 [myotendinous junction]). The calculated preoperative tendon length was 16.9 mm in successful repairs and 12.4 mm in failed repairs (<italic>P</italic> = .002).</p>
<p>Postoperative MRI analysis showed that the position of the tendon end (measured as distance from glenoid to tendon) changed from 18 mm to 39 mm after successful repair but stayed at 10 mm in failed repairs. The retraction of the myotendinous junction changed from 1 mm to 14 mm in successful repairs. However, if the repair failed, the muscle retraction was even more pronounced than before the repair (−3 to −6 mm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512457587">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The amount of preoperative retraction of the myotendinous junction did not influence the outcome of repair (<italic>P</italic> = .207). Conversely, the length of the tendon stump (<italic>P</italic> = .002) and the amount of retraction of the tendon end (<italic>P</italic> = .08) did show a relation to failure rate after repair. The mean Goutallier stage in the whole study group increased from a mean preoperative stage of 1.6 to a mean postoperative stage of 2.4. Interestingly, successful repairs increased almost equally to failed repairs (0.7 vs 0.9; <italic>P</italic> = .462).</p>
<p>Although the patients in the group in which repairs failed were slightly older (56 vs 59 years; <italic>P</italic> = .316), this factor as well as sex (female:male, 1:1.3 vs 1:2.2) did not significantly influence the success of repair. A higher Goutallier stage (1.3 vs 1.8; <italic>P</italic> = .022) and a higher number of involved tendons (1.9 vs 2.5; <italic>P</italic> = .002) negatively influenced the success of repair.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The failure rate of repairs of longstanding rotator tears has been reported to be high and to potentially exceed 50%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512457587">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512457587">22</xref></sup> Whether a tendon can be successfully repaired seems to primarily depend on whether the musculotendinous unit is elastic enough to allow lateralizing the tendon to the intended healing site with low tension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512457587">11</xref></sup> With increasing time after tendon tear, the musculotendinous unit continuously retracts and atrophies, and fatty infiltration increases. All of these factors are closely related to the reparability of tendon tears and seem to be entirely recalcitrant to reversion, clinically and experimentally.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512457587">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512457587">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512457587">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512457587">22</xref></sup> It appears reasonable to assume that with the repair of a moderately retracted musculotendinous unit, the needed lengthening during surgery occurs mainly through elastic elongation of the muscle-tendon unit. But later, simultaneously with tendon healing, also an unknown amount of permanent muscle or tendon lengthening would be expected. However, the individual contribution of muscle and tendon to surgical lengthening has not been investigated yet in humans. There are 3 main findings of this study: first, the visible length of the tendon end in the preoperative MRI is an important predictor for repair success. Second, the position of the myotendinous junction—against our expectation—is not. Third, in successful and failed repairs, an unexpected but very significant lengthening of the tendon appears postoperatively on MRI.</p>
<p>We are aware that this study has some potential drawbacks, such as the number of patients (n = 33), which is rather limited. Because of the sample size limitation, a multivariate analysis could not be performed adequately, and a larger number is needed to illuminate the strength of influence of interacting or confounding factors. However, for several findings, such as the association of tendon length to failure rate, the sample size did show a clear relation.</p>
<p>The anatomic failure rate of 58% in our current investigation is relatively high. However, with a mean of 2.2 tendons involved and predominantly massive ruptures included, this rate is comparable with those of previous published reports on open, mini-open, or arthroscopic repairs of massive rotator cuff tears.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512457587">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512457587">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512457587">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512457587">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512457587"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512457587">18</xref></sup> With musculotendinous retraction, tendon and muscle do not retract simultaneously, and not only the muscle fibers but also the tendon tissue itself have the potential for shortening over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512457587">15</xref></sup> Therefore, we wanted to investigate which part of the combined myotendinous retraction most influences or represents the conditions for the success of repairs.</p>
<p>An advanced preoperative Goutallier stage of 2 or 3 and a shortened tendon (less than 15 mm) revealed a failure rate of 92%, but only 33% of the repairs failed if the tendon was longer than 15 mm. These findings suggest that taking the length of the tendon end into consideration may strongly help in preoperative decision making.</p>
<p>When we surgically close the hole between tendon end and bone, intuitively one would expect that the tendon length remains the same before and after repair and that the muscle is stretched. However, we found that the retracted and degenerated muscle only contributes 13 mm to the closing of a 25-mm gap; the rest seems to be tendon lengthening. This may be explained with results from a former study that indicate a length of an intact SSP muscle fiber of approximately 57 ± 10 mm and accordingly less (33 ± 6.5 mm) in a retracted SSP muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512457587">19</xref></sup> If we assume a maximally possible lengthening of a resting muscle fiber of 50%, then 17 mm would be the expected amount of the possible muscle fiber stretch, which a retracted muscle might be able to achieve. But it seems likely that a chronically retracted and fatty degenerated muscle has an even lower potential for lengthening.</p>
<p>Considering the apparent strong influence of the length of the tendon itself, the interposition of a biological or artificial graft to enlarge this length may be an option worthwhile considering, but this needs further evaluation.</p>
<p>The filling of the gap between tendon end and bone occurred also through an apparent lengthening of the tendon. Although there might be some 3-dimensional effect and variability of the shape of the tears, this increase of tendon length, which measured in some cases up to 2 cm, appears physiologically not explainable with tendon elasticity. We therefore hypothesize that this tendon expansion may be explained by pullout of the retracted tendon from the muscle belly during surgical repair. Another explanation may be an apposition of scar tissue on the tendon end, enlarging the tendon during partial failing of the repair. A further possible explanation for this “pseudo”-lengthening of the tendon stump might be a kind of “unpacking” of the central tendon due to degeneration and subsequent absorption of the most distal part of the retracted and atrophied muscle fibers.</p>
<p>Of course, the changes described here in tendon length occurred simultaneously with other, in part hidden, macroscopic and pathophysiological changes in the entire musculotendinous unit. To what degree the tendon retraction is a measurable surrogate for these other changes or of biomechancial importance itself cannot be quantified at this time but may be of interest in future prospective or experimental evaluations.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The evaluation of the visible length of the tendon stump combined with Goutallier staging appears to dramatically improve the preoperative prediction of whether a tendon repair will be successful. The relengthening of the myotendinous unit following a tendon repair appears to occur equally in the muscle and tendon, which may help in understanding this dynamic process.</p>
