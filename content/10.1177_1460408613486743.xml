<p>Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov will forever be remembered within the surgical speciality of trauma and orthopaedics as a pioneer in the salvation of severely injured or infected limbs. He defined new techniques, using previously undiscovered physiological properties, to encourage new tissue growth and bone regeneration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1460408613486743"><title>Ilizarov – The man</title>
<p>Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov (In Russian, Гавриил Абрамович Илизаров) is the man who gave his name to the technique currently known as distraction histiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1460408613486743">Figure 1</xref>). Born on 15 June 1921, in Belovezh, Belarus to a Jewish family, he grew up in Azerbaijan, within the Caucasus region of the Soviet Union. He had a poor upbringing, working as a young boy driving cattle, and as a result did not start his formal schooling until the age of 11 years. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408613486743">Paley, 2009</xref>)

</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408613486743">Mostofi (2005)</xref> informs us that Ilizarov continued his education and went on to gain his medical degree at the Crimean Medical Institute in Simferopel during the Second World War, graduating in 1944. Following qualification, he was sent to the town of Dolgovka, in the Kurgan region of Western Siberia, to work as a general practitioner, where he encountered many wounded people returning from the war in the West. By 1946, he had set about aiding the injured through his tool workshop designing medical instruments and equipment. His tireless solitary work (he is quoted as saying “<italic>I have worked for five years, all of them at once</italic>”) saw him promoted to a post at Kurgan Regional Hospital. In this rudimentary institution his exposure to those with limb threatening injuries, through fracture, deformity or infection, led him to seek new methods of treatment. The theory he pioneered, that bone could be regenerated, and thus lengthened, by distraction, was born of years of practical application.
</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408613486743">Paley (2009)</xref> attributes Ilizarov’s inspiration to the wheel of a horse cart, where the axle is pierced by spokes supported by the wheel rim. Although he was not the first to use a circular fixator, he devised a frame apparatus which could be used to reduce fractures and correct bone deformities during the early years of the 1950s. He refined the system and in June 1952 was granted a patent for his circular external fixator (patent authorisation certificate no. 98471).
</p>
<p>In 1955, he was appointed chief surgeon at Kurgan Regional Hospital where he continued his research on the understanding of bone regeneration. Despite his successes in Western Siberia, the theory he held was contrary to the orthodox teachings in orthopaedics at the time and he was widely opposed. It was not until the latter half of the 1960s that Ilizarov’s methods became widely known within the USSR and his revolutionary techniques were put under the spotlight after he successfully treated a Soviet hero.
</p>
<p>Valeriy Nikolayevich Brumel was a famous Russian athlete, high jump world record holder from 1961 to 1963 and gold medallist at the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan. Unfortunately, Brumel suffered multiple severe fractures of his right leg in a motorcycle accident in 1965. He underwent many operations carried out by eminent surgeons in Moscow, but was left with a chronically infected non-union of his tibia. Vladimir Golyachovsky, a surgeon in Moscow had secretly visited Ilizarov at Kurgan and learnt of his work. Golyachovsky advised Brumel go to Ilizarov before considering amputation. Ilizarov’s pioneering work on similar injuries after the war now stood him in good stead. Ilizarov treated Brumel using a series of 15 further operations starting in 1967, the outcome was a success and Brumel returned to high jumping in 1970.</p>
<p>Italy plays a significant role in bringing Ilizarov’s method to the attention of the Western world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408613486743">Catagni (2007)</xref> chronicles the story of Italian journalist Carlo Mauri, who sustained an open fracture of tibia in a skiing accident in 1961, which despite treatment became an infected non-union. Mauri was left with a stiff pseudoarthrosis, equino-varus deformity and a short leg. He struggled on using an orthopaedic brace and managed to complete three expeditions with the Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl. It was on the third of these expeditions, to Tigris on the Arabian Peninsula in 1977, that a companion and fellow journalist, Russian Yuri Senkevich recommended that Mauri visit Ilizarov. On 4 April 1980 Ilizarov treated Mauri’s leg, by distraction osteogenesis, gaining 2 cm of leg length, healing the non-united pseudoarthrosis and correcting the deformity. This operation coincided with the visit of a fellow Italian, a young surgeon by the name of Dr. Renato Spinelli. Spinelli had been researching the topic of distraction osteogenesis for Professor Monticelli of the University of Rome since 1972, following the media storm which hailed Ilizarov’s success with Brumel and his work at Kurgan.</p>
<p>On Mauri’s and Spinelli’s return to Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408613486743">Catagni, 2007</xref>), the news of Ilizarov’s methods reached the ears of the heads of the Italian AO and this led to an invitation to Ilizarov to visit Italy. Under the chairmanship of Professor Roberto Cattaneo, Chief of Orthopaedics and Traumatology of the Lecco General Hospital, he was a sponsored guest speaker at the 22nd AO Italy club conference in Bellagio, in June 1981, where he presented a series of three lectures. The lectures (“<italic>The Treatment of Open Fractures.”,</italic> “<italic>The Treatment of Post-Traumatic Osteomyelitis</italic>”. &amp;“<italic>Bone Lengthening</italic>”) were given to over 200 attendees, including surgeons from Italy, Switzerland and Austria. Ilizarov also performed a limb lengthening procedure at Lecco Hospital. Cattaneo and colleagues continued to develop and research osteosynthesis using a complete instrument set donated to their institution by Ilizarov. The Italian group reciprocated with a visit to Kurgan in April 1982.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408613486743">Paley (2009)</xref> describes the centralisation of Russian scientific research which led to the formation of the Central Institution of Traumatology and Orthopaedics in Moscow and Leningrad, headed by Mstislav Volkov a prominent orthopaedic surgeon and co-inventor of the Volkov-Oganesyan fixator, a K-wire-based hinged external fixator. Ilizarov’s affiliation with the Leningrad CITO dissolved and led to Ilizarov forming his own research facility, the Kurgan Research Institute for Experimental and Clinical Orthopedics and Traumatology (KNIEKOT).</p>
<p>In 1982, the KNIEKOT was expanded, becoming the Pan-Soviet Scientific Center for Traumatology and Rehabilitation Orthopedics of Kurgan (VKNC-VTO) with over 1000 beds and 12 operating theatres.</p>
<p>September 1983 saw the first international symposium on Trans-osseous Osteosynthesis, held by the Russian department for health, in Kurgan. The second symposium was held in Bergamo, Italy in June 1984, where a far larger contingent of western delegates participated in the instructional course. This period, between 1983 and 1985, sparked the spread of Ilizarov’s methods throughout Europe and the western world. It was during this period, that other prominent orthopaedic surgeons, such as Sarmiento and MacEwen, were exposed to Ilizarov’s methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408613486743">Paley, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>North American exposure soon followed: although there had been Americans in Russia during the 1970s they were limited to the centre in Moscow. It was not until 1985, when a surgical resident, Dr. Paley, visited the Italian centre at Lecco that North America truly became aware of Ilizarov’s methods. Paley went on to visit Kurgan and learn from Ilizarov. On his return to North America, he went on to practice these new techniques both in Toronto and Baltimore. Paley, along with Dr. Victor H. Frankel, president of the Hospital for Joint Diseases, helped to organise the first international conferences in North America on Ilizarov’s methods in 1987 and 1988. Ilizarov was in attendance, and presented his basic science and clinical lectures to an audience of many prominent North American orthopaedic surgeons.</p>
<p>Ilizarov’s seminal publications in English came in 1989 and 1990 in the journal of Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, with a series of three articles describing the “<italic>tension–stress effect</italic>” and its applications for genesis and growth of tissues.</p>
<p>Ilizarov was awarded numerous prestigious Russian awards, including the Lenin Prize in 1979, the honorary title of “Hero of Socialist Labour” and he was named to the Russian Academy of Science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408613486743">Haines, 2007</xref>). Professor Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov died aged 71, in Kurgan, Siberia.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1460408613486743"><title>Ilizarov – The frame</title>
<p>The Ilizarov apparatus is a type of circular external fixator, utilising a modular composition of circular metal or composite rings, which are attached to the bone by tensioned wires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1460408613486743">Figure 2</xref>). These wires pierce the bone fragments to hold them in relation to the frame rings. The rings above and below the injury(ies) are connected by threaded rods, together with adjustable nuts and act to transfer the passage of force from the injured bone to the metal frame construction. The most proximal and distal rings are fixed into healthy bone above and below the area of fracture or deformity. Other rings act to improve stability of the construction and immobilise the fracture or corticotomy sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408613486743">Aronson, 1991</xref>).

<sec id="sec4-1460408613486743"><title>Ilizarov – The method</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408613486743">Ilizarov (1989a)</xref> described the “<italic>law of tension–stress</italic>”, referred to in modern orthopaedics as distraction osteogenesis, following the observation of the induction of new-bone formation between vascular osseous surfaces that were separated gradually. The biological principles Ilizarov described include: minimal bony disturbance, established delay prior to distraction, rate controlled and rhythmical distraction, sites of osteotomy and the number of sites for lengthening (unifocal or bifocal).</p>
<p>It is this theory which underpins Ilizarov’s methods, and allows for the correction of bone deformity and lengthening of shortened bone. The gradual separation of the bone ends at a fracture site, manipulates the innate physiology of the bone to regenerate bone and gain bone length or correct alignment. Ilizarov observed that within a controlled setting, collagen produced would be orientated in alignment with the direction of forces applied to tissue structures. The subsequent regenerated bone would then consolidate proximally and distally, into columns of bone lying parallel to the distraction force.</p>
<p>The tension–stress effect promotes intense angiogenesis, which stimulates the growth of muscle, fascia, nerves and skin tissues, similar in structure to that observed in embryological and foetal growth.</p>
<p>The Italian group who visited Kurgan in 1982 chronicled the discovery of distraction osteogenesis by Ilizarov following a mistake in turning the adjustable nuts in the wrong direction, thus applying distraction rather than compression to a patient’s external ring fixator; despite this, bone was regenerated in the distraction gap.</p>
<p>Ilizarov discovered that because of the ability to manipulate this innate property of bone, it is possible to lengthen bone. He was able to outline the optimum conditions needed to achieve limb lengthening. Preservation of the soft tissue envelope was a key principle for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408613486743">Ilizarov (1989a)</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408613486743">b</xref> and his techniques. Periosteal and endosteal blood supplies were crucial in order to allow the significant amount of bone regeneration required. Ilizarov also charted the relationship between healing and rate and frequency of distraction, understanding the balance required to gain satisfactory results. The rate and rhythm of distraction has a profound effect upon osteogenesis. Ilizarov established that the optimum rate was 1 mm per day. A greater rate slowed the osteogenic potential, a slower rate allowed for premature bony consolidation. The rhythm of distraction also contributes to the success of bone formation, increasing the regularity and reducing the distance of a single distraction. Continuous gradual distraction is preferred; however, 0.25 mm every 6 h is often utilized.</p>
<p>Ilizarov also redefined the technique of osteotomy, to be used in distraction osteogenesis. A corticotomy is a low-energy osteotomy of the cortex alone, with preservation of the local blood supply to both the periosteum and the medullary canal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408613486743">Ilizarov, 1989b</xref>). Ilizarov used this instead of a traditional osteotomy. He was also able to describe the variation in success dependent upon the site of lengthening. Metaphyseal sites lengthen more successfully than diaphyseal sites. Bifocal limb lengthening, elongating the bone at two sites, is a technique which has been used to achieve greater length; however, evidence regarding both the success and complication rates of this procedure is mixed.</p>
<p>Complications of this technique are a significant issue, which Ilizarov became aware of during his work with external fixation. Excessive movement at the fracture or corticotomy site, where distraction is occurring, results in haematoma formation. The subsequent failure in consolidation leads to the formation of islands of cystic or cartilaginous areas, non-union generally then follows. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408613486743">Hamdy et al. (1999)</xref> outline the disposition of the bone to osteoporosis and the limb to disuse atrophy, which must be counteracted by regular physiotherapy and early weight bearing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1460408613486743">Figure 3</xref>).

</fig>
</p>
<p>Soft tissue contractures are a common complication, especially Achilles’ tendon contracture with tibial lengthening and knee flexion contracture with femoral lengthening. Joint subluxation or dislocation can also occur, for which it may be necessary to extend the frame over the joint.</p>
<p>The psychological impact of the external frame must not be disregarded, especially in childhood and adolescence. Complications inherent to all external fixators include: pain, pin track infection, septic arthritis, neurovascular injury and joint stiffness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408613486743">Aronson, 1997</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1460408613486743" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Gavril Abramovich Ilizarov had a profound impact upon the world of trauma and orthopaedics during the second half of the 20th century. Ilizarov’s work is continued by many who pursue his methods and further the understanding of his apparatus and techniques. His humble beginnings belie the man who strived to bring treatment to the victims of trauma in the Siberian region of the Soviet Union. His driven efforts, through scientific experimentation allowed him to define his radical theories and novel techniques. These were fortuitously brought to international attention by the collaborative work between Ilizarov and the Italian Orthopaedic Association. His seminal works were presented and published in the 1970s and 1980s, as his methods spread to Western Europe and North America. Ilizarov sadly died in 1992, but he is immortalised by his eponymous methods and apparatus, as well as at the newly renamed Russian Ilizarov Scientific Centre for Restorative Traumatology and Orthopaedics.</p>
