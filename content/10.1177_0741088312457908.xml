<p>Recent scholarship in genre studies has extended its focus from studying single genres to multiple genres, as well as how these genres interact with one another. This trend is evidenced by the multiplicity of terms that refer to collections of genres, such as <italic>genre set</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741088312457908">Devitt, 1991</xref>), <italic>genre system</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741088312457908">Bazerman, 1994</xref>), and <italic>genre ecology</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741088312457908">Spinuzzi &amp; Zachry, 2000</xref>). This trend inspired empirical studies and further theoretical developments that are increasingly concerned with multiple genres: how they work together (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741088312457908">Devitt, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741088312457908">Smart, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741088312457908">Spinuzzi &amp; Zachry, 2000</xref>), how they concatenate (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741088312457908">Bazerman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0741088312457908">Swales, 2004</xref>), and what exactly connects these genres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741088312457908">Emmons, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741088312457908">Freadman, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>This essay seeks to contribute to this growing scholarship by adding a new concept, <italic>intermediary genre</italic>. That is a genre that facilitates the “uptake” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741088312457908">Freadman, 2002</xref>) of a genre by another genre. This concept is designed to reveal a particular aspect of multiple genres: that one genre can be used to connect and mobilize two otherwise unconnected genres to make uptake possible.</p>
<p>This essay begins with a literature review of the rhetorical genre studies to show the need for the concept of intermediary genre. This section also reviews selected literature from the rhetoric of science that inspired the concept. A formal definition of intermediary genre is followed by a case study of knowledge mobilization, an instance in which scientific research was used in the judicial system to inform public policies on eyewitness handling and police lineup procedures. The case study is meant to illustrate how intermediary genres emerge, how they connect other genres, and how knowledge circulates as a result of such connections and affects policy decisions.</p>
<sec id="section1-0741088312457908">
<title>Rhetorical Genre Studies</title>
<p>In her seminal essay “Genre as Social Action,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741088312457908">Miller (1984</xref>/1994a) reconceptualized the notion of genre from primarily a classification of textual features to a typified response to a recurring rhetorical situation. Her reconceptualization foregrounded the social and pragmatic dimensions of language. It extended the application of the concept of genre beyond literary texts to any utterance and to any human activity (e.g., Artemeva &amp; Freedman, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741088312457908">Russell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741088312457908">Smart, 2006</xref>). This development allowed genre researchers to examine how individual genres afford and constrain individuals to act in certain ways (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741088312457908">Paré, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741088312457908">Segal, 1993</xref>) and how individuals effect changes by resisting and exploiting genres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741088312457908">Artemeva, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741088312457908">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>While earlier research often focused on the effects of single genres, more recent studies tend to focus on interactions among multiple genres. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741088312457908">Devitt (1991)</xref> was one of the first to observe the importance of multiple genres in a single setting. Analyzing 13 genres used by tax accountants (e.g., transmittal letters, tax reports, proposals), she proposed the concept <italic>genre set</italic> to refer to a collection of genres that interact “to accomplish the work of the tax department” (p. 340).</p>
<p>Other major theoretical breakthroughs include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741088312457908">Bazerman’s (1994)</xref> <italic>genre system</italic>, which expands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741088312457908">Devitt’s (1991)</xref> genre set to include all “interrelated genres that interact with each other in specific settings” (p. 97) and <bold><underline>are</underline></bold> not limited by a particular vantage point. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741088312457908">Spinuzzi and Zachry (2000)</xref> extended this terminology of <italic>genre assemblages</italic> (Spinuzzi’s term; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741088312457908">2003</xref>). by introducing <italic>genre ecology</italic>, which includes unofficial and improvised genres into the group.</p>
<p>These theoretical breakthroughs have encouraged studies that examine the ways in which knowledge circulates among genres and how the representation of knowledge changes as a result of such circulation. For example, Sauer (2003) studied what she calls “the cycle of technical communication” in mines and traced the circulation and transformation of knowledge from the tacit, experiential knowledge of miners to the accident reports to the safety manuals. Meanwhile, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741088312457908">Lähdesmäki (2009)</xref> focused on recontextualization and noted the changes in attitudes and genderedness as a result of reproducing teenage dating stories in an English-as-a-foreign-language textbook. These and others studies show a clear scholarly interest in this area. However, theoretical developments within genre studies to examine the mechanisms of knowledge circulation through multiple interacting genres remain relatively scarce.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most relevant concept comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741088312457908">Freadman (1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741088312457908">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741088312457908">2002</xref>), who proposed the notion of “uptake” to analyze how a death sentence was transformed into an execution for Ronald Ryan, the last prisoner executed in Australia. Ryan was hanged, despite the fact that in the Australian judicial environment of the 1960s, death penalties were often pronounced by courts but never carried out, as the premier of Australia routinely commuted all death sentences. Freadman finds that the crucial moment in the transformation from the words of the sentence into the act of the hanging occurred on the eve of the execution, when the premier (from the executive branch) summoned the sentencing judge (from the legal branch) and asked if he agreed with the original verdict. The meeting was irregular, and it carried no legal standing. The judge agreed with the death sentence, and the premier allowed it to be carried out instead of commuting it. Freadman analyzes this event as a pastiche genre, an imitation genre that superficially resembles a court trial. In this pastiche genre, the premier occupied the role of a judge, and the sentencing judge was forced to play the role of a witness, <italic>repeat</italic> the death sentence, and support the prosecution. In classic speech act theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741088312457908">Austin, 1962</xref>), such repetition would not perform a speech act, since it does not meet the felicity condition; only a real trial would. But Freadman argues that this repetition of the death sentence, which crossed the generic boundary between the judicial and executive branches, was the uptake that transformed the death sentence into an execution in this case.</p>
<p>The significance of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741088312457908">Freadman’s (2002)</xref> case study lies in her characterization of uptake, which mediates genres when it “crosses the boundary between ceremonies and <italic>a fortiori</italic> between jurisdictions” (p. 44). Freadman’s uptake is used, for example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741088312457908">Smart (2006)</xref> even though he relies on an activity-based genre theory as an overall framework in analyzing various genres in the Bank of Canada. Through his ethnographic study, he described the ways in which economists used these genres to generate knowledge and how that knowledge was received, discussed, reshaped, and finally disseminated as the monetary policy through transformations in the bank’s system of genres.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741088312457908">Emmons’s (2009)</xref> study is much smaller, but her essay contains a more theoretical discussion on uptake. In response, Emmons brings back subjectivity and redefines uptake as “the <bold><underline>disposition(s)</underline></bold> assumed through the use of genres”; it “encompasses the effect <bold><underline>of</underline></bold> those generic choices to individuals” (p. 139). Emmons’s objection echoes the broader criticism that genre scholars in general tend to focus on the normalizing, constraining force of genres at the expense of their agentive, affording force (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0741088312457908">Winsor, 1999</xref>). However, many genre scholars are at least aware of the duality of potential in genre, as carefully articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741088312457908">Miller (1984</xref>/1994a, 1994b), even though they do not agree on the precise nature of the duality and the respective roles that the forces play. Even in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741088312457908">Freadman’s (2002)</xref> account of the Ryan case, one can see the role of subjectivity and rhetorical agency as the premier mobilized the generic resources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741088312457908">Smart (2006)</xref> is more explicit in documenting agentive disagreements at the points of uptake afforded by the bank’s genre system.</p>
<p>I would like to approach this problem by offering a theoretical concept and a methodological tool for studying what makes uptake more likely. This approach should contribute to our understanding of how multiple genres relate and interact through uptake; at the same time, it should also help us understand what constellation of strategies is at one’s disposal in influencing uptake, thus shedding light to the nature of rhetorical agency.</p>

<title>Rhetoric of Science</title>
<p>While our focus remains genre studies, certain developments from the rhetoric of science must be mentioned, as they relate to the problem of knowledge mobilization in the following case study and they influenced my thinking on intermediary genre. In her classic study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741088312457908">Fahnestock (1986)</xref> used stasis theory to compare statements in scientific articles and the comparable statements in the popularized versions. She found that the rhetorical transformation in the popular versions necessarily changed the knowledge claims, making them more certain and unique. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741088312457908">Latour (1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741088312457908">1988)</xref> and Latour and Woolgar (1986) studied the rhetorical transformation of statements in scientific texts across generations and argued that such transformations are not merely indicative but constitutive of knowledge making.</p>
<p>These arguments accord with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741088312457908">Freadman (2002)</xref>, when she notes the importance of repetition across texts and genres, but these studies and those that followed (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0741088312457908">Winsor, 1993</xref>) lead us to pay attention to the manner in which the repeated statements are framed and transformed. It is not enough that certain statements are repeated across genre boundaries; we need to know (to the extent possible) how and why these statements are repeated as well as whether these statements will continue to be repeated in the future. These insights from genre studies and the rhetoric of science are the genesis of what I propose as <italic>intermediary genre</italic>.</p>

<title>Intermediary Genre</title>
<p>An intermediary genre is defined as one that facilitates an uptake of another genre by yet another genre whether the uptake is of form or content. To put it another way, Genre A is an intermediary genre if it contributes to the uptake of Genre B by Genre C (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741088312457908">Figure 1</xref>). For example, the genre of press release<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0741088312457908">1</xref></sup> (Genre A) takes the contents from various corporate genres (Genre B) and increases the likelihood of uptake by news reports (Genre C). Similarly, composition textbooks and sample essays<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0741088312457908">2</xref></sup> (Genre A) often incorporate forms from scholarly genres (Genre B) so that the uptake of these features is more likely in student essays (Genre C).</p>
<fig id="fig1-0741088312457908" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0741088312457908-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>It is worth mentioning that this process is unrelated to “mediation” in activity theory, in which a subject uses a genre as a “mediational tool” to achieve an objective (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741088312457908">Cole &amp; Engeström, 1993</xref>, for a description of activity theory). Most genres that may serve as intermediaries have other primary functions for which they serve as mediational tools. For example, the ostensive functions of the news reports include informing the public and guarding against the government’s abuse of power. However, these news reports, which contain statements by politicians, can be used by late-night comedians to create satires, thus serving as an intermediary. In this case, the intermediary function is incidental and secondary (thus, one may call this a <italic>secondary intermediary genre</italic>). For the same reason, the idea that an intermediary genre facilitates uptake of another genre is not the same as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741088312457908">Latour’s (1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741088312457908">1988)</xref> <italic>translation</italic>, which involves aligning people’s (and objects’) interests. News reports facilitate the uptake of politicians’ statements by satirists without coaxing the politicians’ consent that it is in their best interest to be made fun of.</p>
<p>Thus, we can distinguish primary and secondary intermediary genres. A primary intermediary genre is one in which the intermediary function is its defining characteristic and thus relatively stable, as in press releases—whose function is specifically and intentionally to facilitate uptake of discourse from genres of some organization by the press, through its standard genres (e.g., news reports). However, any genre can be used as an intermediary between other genres, whether it was created or intended to be used in that way. For example, news reports can be used as an intermediary genre in facilitating the uptake of political campaign speeches by late-night comedy monologues, even though that is not the primary intermediary function of the genre of news reports. News reports in this sense I term a <italic>secondary intermediary genre</italic> because some genres are widely recognized as being intermediary (what I call <italic>primary intermediary</italic>), but any genre can be used as an intermediary even if it is not primarily recognized as such (what I call <italic>secondary intermediary</italic>). It is necessary to specify which genre is the source and which is the target of uptake for an intermediary genre. It is not enough to say, “News reports constitute an intermediary genre.” One must make an addition—for example, “News reports constitute an intermediary genre in facilitating the uptake of political campaign speeches by late-night comedy monologues.”</p>
<p>For this reason, intermediary genre is an analytical tool. The source and target of an intermediary genre change depending on the researcher’s interests. Thus, Genre A may mediate Genres B and C (e.g., news reports facilitate the uptake of research article by environmentalist posters) in addition to mediating Genres D and E. Similarly, if there is a chain of linear uptake among Genres A, B, C, and D (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0741088312457908">Figure 2</xref>), an analyst may focus on the uptake of Genre A by Genre C (making Genre B an intermediary genre), or one may focus on the uptake of Genre B by Genre D (making Genre C an intermediary genre). Therefore, there is a duality in intermediary genre: a relatively stable ontological category and a very plastic methodological unit of analysis.</p>

<title>Case Study: The Sophonow Inquiry</title>
<p>The Sophonow Inquiry is a Canadian public inquiry in response to the wrongful conviction of Thomas Sophonow, who spent 4 years in prison. But what is important for our purpose is that the inquiry served as a catalyst for certain judicial reforms, reforms mainly based on psychological research originally published in scientific journal articles. In other words, the inquiry served as an intermediary genre for knowledge mobilization.</p>
<p>Another reason that the Sophonow Inquiry is particularly appropriate is that certain psychology research (police lineup procedures, handling of eyewitnesses, etc.) is cited by social scientists as the area in which the influence of scholarly research is most visible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741088312457908">National Research Council, 2002</xref>). The case will reveal the generic pathways by which scholarly research influenced public policy, using the concept of intermediary genre to guide the analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0741088312457908">
<title>Public Inquiry</title>
<p>A public inquiry is a government-initiated ad hoc commission in Canada with a vague triggering condition: that it respond to an event of “public significance.” The commission is granted with the authority to summon and subpoena witnesses to a trial-like preliminary hearing, in which witnesses are examined and cross-examined by counsels that represent different parties. The commissioner presides the preliminary hearing like a judge and uses it as the official fact-gathering venue. The commission produces a report, which typically contains policy recommendations, but these recommendations are not legally binding. Many public inquiries use expert witnesses, but they are not required.</p>
<p>The specific mandates of the Sophonow Inquiry were to discover the causes that led to the wrongful conviction of Thomas Sophonow and to suggest ways of preventing future miscarriages of justice. The Sophonow Inquiry also invited researchers from various disciplines (psychology, law, forensic psychiatry), and the recommendations had a wide impact on law enforcement policies across Canada.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0741088312457908" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>To examine uptake paths in the genre system of the inquiry and their relation to knowledge mobilization, I took the commission report from the inquiry as the starting point and identified all instances of explicit citations. Each citation was coded per the scheme described below, based on Swales’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741088312457908">1986</xref>) but modified to describe knowledge mobilization:</p>
<list id="list1-0741088312457908" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Is the citation accompanied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741088312457908">Latour’s (1987)</xref> positive or negative modality? Or not at all (neutral)?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0741088312457908">3</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is the cited information used to build an argument (evolutionary), dismissed by the citer to build another argument (juxtapositional), or used to provide information that is unrelated to making an argument (zero)?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Does the cited information occur in one sentence or less (short) or more (extended)?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is the cited information accompanied by a formal citation?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is the cited information a direct quote?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The coding was partly conducted by two independent coders (108 items) to ensure reliability (kappa = .865, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and a statistical analysis<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0741088312457908">4</xref></sup> was used to map the citation patterns. Once the quantitative analysis was concluded, I went back to the discourse data for a close textual analysis, paying particular attention to the ways in which research knowledge migrated from one text to another. In doing so, I was not always able to trace specific research knowledge to its origin, because oral genres and nonacademic written genres do not always document their sources rigorously. Therefore, I sometimes noted specific concepts and terminologies to search the relevant research literature to locate the original research and trace it forward in the uptake path. I am aware that such a method of searching is not perfectly precise, but sufficient details (e.g., names of the researchers, details of particular studies, specific terms, approximate dates) matched the descriptions in the citing texts to provide a reasonable assurance of the intertextual links and uptake.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0741088312457908" sec-type="results|discussion">
<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Detailed discussions of quantitative data are interesting in their own rights, but they contribute less to the theoretical discussion of the intermediary genre than the qualitative counterparts do. Therefore, the current essay limits the presentation of the quantitative data to a truncated form and focuses more on the qualitative textual analysis.</p>
<p>The quantitative analysis revealed that research knowledge was more privileged than nonresearch knowledge in that the cited information was more likely to be accompanied by positive modalities in the report, more likely incorporated to build an argument (evolutionary), and more likely to be discussed in two or more sentences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0741088312457908">5</xref></sup> However, the quantitative data also revealed that only a fraction of academic citation came from research articles (9 of 62); the remainder was attributed to the testimony of the academics at the preliminary hearing. This citation pattern suggests that the influence of research articles was indirect and that knowledge mobilization was obviously mediated by the preliminary hearing.</p>
<sec id="section8-0741088312457908">
<title>Preliminary Hearing</title>
<p>With or without the quantitative data, the preliminary hearing is the most obvious and most important intermediary genre. Designed as the official avenue for fact gathering, the preliminary hearing is intertextually best situated to facilitate the uptake of knowledge from other sources, and the commission was legally required to use this genre (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0741088312457908">Figure 3</xref> for the intertextual map of the Sophonow Inquiry). The quantitative data support the importance of the preliminary hearing, as 26.4% (109 of 413) of all explicit citations in the commission report refer to the preliminary hearing. This convergence between the official designation and the citation pattern suggests that a fairly simple frequency count can identify some important intermediary genres (though not all, as shown later).</p>

<p>However, the preliminary hearing is not simply a conduit that facilitates the uptake of research knowledge, because the genre of preliminary hearings simultaneously functions as a gatekeeper that limits the uptake of knowledge that is generated outside the judicial system. This gatekeeping function is most clearly seen in the formal structure of the preliminary hearing, which places legal professionals in the center (as commissioner and commission counsels) and outsiders, such as academic researchers, in the periphery. For academic researchers to be even heard, the commission counsels must first invite them. Even then, their role as expert witnesses is quite constrained.</p>
<p>First, the procedural rules dictate the “conversation” (turn taking), only allowing the experts to answer the questions by the counsels for the inquiry and the parties involved. As questioners, the counsels determine the content, scope, and sequence of the questions; as such, the manner of their questions<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0741088312457908">6</xref></sup> constrains and influences the experts’ answers. While this arrangement is often frustrating for experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741088312457908">National Research Council, 2002</xref>), both the commissioner and the lead counsel articulated that these constraints are important in preserving judicial independence and the integrity of the judicial system (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741088312457908">Golan, 2004</xref>, for a historical perspective).</p>
<p>But what it means for us is that the preliminary hearing as an intermediary genre displays paradoxical characteristics: On one hand, it limits the uptake of research knowledge; on the other, the knowledge that withstands this process gains greater legitimacy within the legal system, thus facilitating further uptake. In addition, the preliminary hearing serves as an example of a relatively stable genre that recurs within the Canadian legal system to bring knowledge from other domains into law.</p>
<p>This mediation is made possible through gradual ownership of the research knowledge by the legal system. As noted earlier, the “reproduced” research knowledge in the preliminary hearing is partly constructed by counsels through direct examination and cross-examination. Then, this co-opted knowledge soon loses its attribution to the research communities<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0741088312457908">7</xref></sup> and is reattributed to the legal authority that validated it.</p>
<p>This process is most prominent in one of the recommendation sections of the commission report, in which the commissioner suggests ways of improving eyewitness handling and police lineup procedures. As seen in the following analysis, the knowledge in this section largely comes from experimental psychology research in the United States, mediated by several U.S. government publications. However, neither the original research articles nor the mediating U.S. government publications are mentioned in this section. When this section of the report was cited in another report by the heads of federal, provincial, and territorial prosecutors 4 years later, the report attributed this knowledge as arising out of Canadian legal context, losing any indication that much of this knowledge had been originally generated by research psychologists in the United States.</p>
<p>In short, the preliminary hearing was a relatively stable site of negotiations between the research knowledge that originated elsewhere and the judicial knowledge that is inscribed in the rules and regulations embodied by the commissioner and the counsels. This simultaneous filtering and validation of research knowledge, as well as the preliminary hearing’s intertextual position, make the preliminary hearing an important intermediary genre.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0741088312457908">
<title>Other Public Inquiries</title>
<p>If the preliminary hearing represents the “official” and most stable intermediary genre in the case, other public inquiries form an unofficial, less stable intermediary genre. But before going any further, let me note the relational aspect of intermediary genre implied in the word <italic>other</italic> in <italic>other public inquiries</italic>. Ordinarily, all public inquiries would form a single genre, including the Sophonow Inquiry. But because we are singling out the Sophonow Inquiry as the focus of the case study and the target of uptake, all <italic>other</italic> public inquiries form an intermediary genre.</p>
<p>But unlike case law, results from public inquiries in Canada do not bind subsequent inquiries; yet, the commissioners and the counsels ordinarily live in the world of case laws, in which prior decisions are relevant and somewhat binding. Therefore, it should not surprise us if these actors behaved in a similar manner, using trials as what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741088312457908">Devitt (2004)</xref> calls an antecedent genre and reenacting it in the public inquiry.</p>
<p>Other public inquiries as an intermediary genre did not emerge from the frequency count but from an anomaly in the citation pattern. As noted earlier, in the commission report, most academic sources were attributed to the expert witnesses in the preliminary hearing, and the original research articles were seldom cited. However, a few exceptions exist, and one scholarly article in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741088312457908">Kaiser, 1989</xref>) figured quite prominently in the commission report, with formal citations and direct quotes. Furthermore, the report was written in such a way to give an impression that the prominence of the Kaiser article was the commissioner’s personal choice rather than that of an expert, as was the case.</p>
<p>The transcript of the preliminary hearing reveals that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741088312457908">Kaiser (1989)</xref> was used in a similar public inquiry on a wrongful murder conviction (Marshall Inquiry) to determine the compensation amount, and the Sophonow Inquiry shared some expert witnesses with the Marshall Inquiry. For the record, the commissioner of the Sophonow Inquiry denied prior knowledge of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741088312457908">Kaiser (1989)</xref> or the influence of the Marshall Inquiry (P. Cory, personal communication, May 10, 2007), although Kaiser was certainly known to commission counsel members before the hearing.</p>
<p>But unlike the preliminary hearing—the function of which was specifically to facilitate knowledge uptake from other sources into the commission report—other public inquiries were less stable as an intermediary genre. These inquiries had their own primary purposes, and their function as an intermediary genre was incidental. But these inquiries became an intermediary genre because the existing generic relationship (i.e., use of precedents) encouraged a parallel relationship, and certain actors in the system encouraged their use as an intermediary genre in this case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0741088312457908">
<title>U.S. Government Publications</title>
<p>If the preliminary hearings and public inquiries are relatively stable genres, the “U.S. government publications” on eyewitness handling and police lineup procedures are not even a genre. They are of many genres—policy documents, research reports, instructional materials for law enforcement officers. Outside the context of the inquiry report, the “U.S. government publications” cited (using this phrase) do not have a shared rhetorical purpose or perform the same recurring act. But when put in the intertextual context of the Sophonow Inquiry, the U.S. government publications start to have a shared function as an intermediary genre. In that sense, the U.S. government publications represent an intermediary genre as more or less a purely methodological unit without a stable ontology independent of the context of this specific research. As the following analysis shows, the U.S. government publications’ influence is quite prominent.</p>
<p>A clue that the U.S. government publications are important occurs not so much in the commission report but in a section of the preliminary hearing in which the counsel and Loftus as an expert witness (labeled as both “A” and “THE WITNESS”) seem to be collaborating on the phrasing of recommendations, using <italic>Eyewitness Evidence: A Guide for Law Enforcement</italic>, a handbook published by the U.S. National Institute of Justice.</p>

<p>A: Well, I think it would probably be worth getting some—particularly that’s the proposal that’s been made in a recent article by a number of experts in this field, that you can get some expression of confidence right at the time so that you can see if it changes later on.</p>
<p>Q. And that issue is raised and dealt with in the U.S. Federal Department of Justice Guidelines and they ask as well that there be a record of the expression of confidence immediately after the procedures?</p>
<p>A. I remember it from – I remember it from the Wells’ article on human behaviour, and I just have to refresh my memory about exactly what their wording is in the Federal Guidelines.</p>
<p>Q. Let me just see if I can find this for you. This is the very last question, Mr. Commissioner, that I wanted to deal with Dr. Loftus with, and if I could just find that for her. Thank you, take a peek at page 32.6 and 35.6.</p>
<p>A. Okay, yeah there is – ask the witness to state in his own words how certain.</p>
<p>Q. And I take it that is in accord with the general understanding of capturing at this moment the confidence level to see whether it changes as time passes?</p>
<p>A. Correct. (pp. 8980-8981, 9010-9011)</p>
<p><italic>Eyewitness Evidence</italic> itself is linked to a National Institute of Justice research paper, <italic>Convicted by Juries, Exonerated by Science</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741088312457908">Connors, Lundregan, Miller, &amp; McEwan, 1996</xref>); both documents have a forward by attorney general Janet Reno, and the former explicitly acknowledges the latter as the impetus for creating the practical handbook. The research paper, in turn, is related to the psychological research on eyewitness testimony since the 1970s (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741088312457908">Loftus, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741088312457908">Wells &amp; Loftus, 1984</xref>), and <italic>Convicted by Juries</italic> was put together with extensive collaboration from these research psychologists.</p>
<p>These U.S. government publications were responding to a different legal problem (a growing number of exonerations as a result of the DNA evidence), and they were not anticipating (at least in the usual sense of the word) the Sophonow Inquiry. The commission report never cites <italic>Eyewitness Evidence</italic>, and it acknowledges <italic>Convicted by Juries</italic> only once in an unrelated section. However, the following juxtapositions make it clear that <italic>Eyewitness Evidence</italic> had a significant influence on the commission’s report, and the U.S. government publications as a whole acted as an intermediary genre.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(2a) [Eyewitness Evidence] Instruct the witness that the suspect may or may not be present in the group of individuals. (p. 32)</p>
<p>(2b) [Commission Report] <bold>The officer should emphasize to the witness that the suspect may not be in the line-up</bold>. (p. 31; emphasis in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This instruction can be traced back to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741088312457908">Malpass and Devine (1981)</xref>, who noted that witnesses are less likely to force an identification when this instruction is present. This implication from the study is included in <italic>Eyewitness Evidence</italic>, and the transcript from Loftus’s direct examination makes it clear that the counsel was working from <italic>Eyewitness Evidence</italic> when she examined Loftus:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(3a) [Eyewitness Evidence] Select fillers who generally fit the witness’ description of the perpetrator. When there is a limited/inadequate description of the perpetrator provided by the witness, or when the description of the perpetrator differs significantly from the appearance of the suspect, fillers should resemble the suspect in significant features. (p. 30)</p>
<p>(3b) [Commission Report] <bold>The filler in the line-up should match as closely as possible the description given by the witnesses at the time of the event. It is only if that is impossible, that the filler should resemble the suspect as closely as possible</bold>. (p. 31; emphasis in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The recommendation to select fillers that resemble the eyewitness’s descriptions comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741088312457908">Lindsay and Wells (1985)</xref>, who noted the changes in the witness’s willingness to identify a suspect and the confidence level of that identification based on the fillers’ appearance. Again, the transcript from Loftus’s direct examination makes it clear that the recommendation is based on <italic>Eyewitness Evidence</italic>:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(4a) [Eyewitness Evidence] Instruct the witness that the procedure requires the investigator to ask the witness to state, in his/her own words, how certain he/she is of any identification. (p. 32)</p>
<p>(4b) [Commission Report] <bold>At the conclusion of the line-up, if there has been any identification, there should be a question posed to the witness as to the degree of certainty of identification</bold>. (p. 32; emphasis in original)</p>
<p>(5a) [Eyewitness Evidence] Record both identification and nonidentification results in writing, including the witness’ words regarding how sure he/she is. . . . Ensure results are signed and dated by the witness. (p. 38)</p>
<p>(5b) [Commission Report] <bold>The question and answer must be both noted and recorded</bold>. (p. 32; emphasis in original)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, the verbatim recording of the witness’s expression of confidence comes from many studies that demonstrated that the witness’s expressions of confidence can be easily manipulated by events after identification (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741088312457908">Hall, Loftus, &amp; Tousignant, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741088312457908">Wells, Ferguson, &amp; Lindsay, 1981</xref>). Therefore, the literature in psychology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741088312457908">Wells et al., 1998</xref>) recommends that the confidence level be recorded at the initial identification. This recommendation was incorporated in <italic>Eyewitness Evidence</italic>, and Loftus explained during her direct examination that the initial confidence level is used to detect inflated confidence when the witness expresses a higher confidence level at later times.</p>
<p>These juxtapositions show that the U.S. government publications, especially <italic>Eyewitness Evidence</italic>, played an important role in facilitating the uptake of research articles. They thus formed a secondary intermediary genre in the Sophonow Inquiry.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>The three examples of intermediary genres in this case illustrate the theoretical and methodological usefulness intermediary genre as a concept. The intermediary function may coincide with the genre’s primary function (as in the case of preliminary hearings), or it may not (as in the cases of other public inquiries and the U.S. government publications). As a methodological unit, an intermediary genre may group what may otherwise not be a “genre,” such as the U.S. government publications, which do not share rhetorical purposes or actions, or “other” public inquiries, which specifically exclude the Sophonow Inquiry from the genre. Thus, the concept of intermediary genre contributes to the ongoing discussion on how genres relate and interact with one another.</p>
<p>In addition, the concept of intermediary genre raises the theoretical question of genre’s secondary functions. We often think of genres in terms of their primary functions (advertisements sell goods; contracts enact business transactions), but these genres have other functions (advertisements as art, contracts as evidence in civil lawsuits, sacred texts as literary works) and <italic>can be</italic> used to perform other functions (most clearly through “repurposing”; e.g., as sample texts in a composition textbook). This article analyzed one repurposing and how different genres can relate to one another through such repurposing. There is no doubt that different genres can interact through some other secondary functions, and such functions remain to be explored.</p>
<p>Another implication is methodological. As discussed earlier, what emerges as an intermediary genre in an analysis of a genres system depends on the focus of the analyst to a certain extent. However, intermediary genres are empirically real, and this study has shown some ways of discovering and documenting them. Some of those methods are easily replicable (e.g., citation frequency) while others require “detective work” and judgments (e.g., juxtaposing content and language). But either way, the concept of intermediary genre and its application in this case study enable greater depth and breadth in empirical studies of the ways in which knowledge circulates as a result of interactions among genres.</p>
<p>Finally, the study has implications for knowledge mobilization as well. Regardless of the genres that mediated research knowledge, mediation often resulted in deattribution and reattribution. For example, <italic>Convicted by Juries, Exonerated by Science</italic> contains interviews with and position papers by psychologists who conducted the original studies, but neither refers specifically to them. This deattribution of knowledge is accelerated in <italic>Eyewitness Evidence</italic> because this manual is meant to be a practical manual for the law enforcement, and it would be absurd for such a manual to be filled with citations. The knowledge is further mediated by the preliminary hearing and the commission report itself, to be further received by newspapers, law journal articles, future public inquiries, Canadian government publications, and Canadian law enforcement across the nation, as knowledge that belongs to the Canadian legal system.</p>
<p>From this study, it is not clear the extent to which this transformation occurs in other cases of knowledge mobilization or that such transformation contributes to knowledge mobilization. But the findings suggest that a more extensive study for generalization is a worthwhile effort.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article offers the concept of intermediary genre as a theoretical and methodological framework for understanding the ways in which genres interact and knowledge circulates among those genres. To support the viability and usefulness of the concept, this essay provides findings from a case study to show how intermediary genres manifested in this case and how they facilitated knowledge mobilization.</p>
<p>However, the true test of theoretical and methodological robustness of any concept depends on how much theoretical discussion it generates and how many studies it inspires in the future. I hope my modest proposal in this paper is sufficiently generative and useful to be able to serve both ends.</p>

<label>5.</label>
<p>The following table shows an example of the chi-square test of independence. In this example, all citations were divided into academic and nonacademic sources to see if the citations from one group are more likely to be used to make the same argument as the source. The chi-square value of 31.28 comes out as statistically significant at the <italic>p</italic> value of less than .001. This means that this distribution could not have occurred by chance with higher than 99.9% confidence level. The expected values in the table signify what we would expect if the “evolutionary,” “zero,” and “juxtapositional” were evenly distributed between academic and nonacademic sources. For example, given the overall distribution of 263, 83, and 67 for all the sources and that there was a total of 62 academic citations, we would expect the evolutionary use of academic sources to be (62 × 263)/413 = 39.5. In reality, there are 59 evolutionary uses of academic sources, which is higher. The adjusted residual describes the extent to which the actual frequency deviates from the expected frequency. Thus, by examining the adjusted residuals, we can conclude that academic sources are much more likely to be incorporated into arguments in the commission report to make the same arguments and much less likely to be used to make the opposite arguments.</p>
