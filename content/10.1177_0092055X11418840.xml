<abstract>
<p>The authors explore the challenges inherent in traversing the multiple boundaries between sociology and social work, and the academy and the community, by examining a service learning course on hunger and homelessness taught by two sociology professors and two social workers on the staff of a community service organization. The authors draw on instructional team meetings and correspondence, observation of class sessions, and formal and informal course evaluations to analyze three “moments”: the planning process, a pivotal class session, and students’ final presentations. They found that both their teaching and students’ learning were enriched by disciplinary differences in knowledge claims, the design and utility of qualitative research, and the process of drawing conclusions from, and making arguments using, qualitative data. The authors conclude that experiential learning has value beyond providing students hands-on experiences. It can also provide a laboratory in which students and instructors can explore the similarities and differences between sociology, social work, and other disciplines.</p>

<p>The literature on experiential learning argues that service learning can, and does, serve a multitude of purposes in higher education. First, service learning can make theory and research more “real” to students by placing them inside organizations responding to social problems. Second, service learning exposes students to the lived experience of individuals struggling with pressing social problems, such as domestic violence, incarceration, homelessness, and food scarcity. Third, service learning can be “an instrument of civic pedagogy” (Barber 1997, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0092055X11418840">Karlberg 2005</xref>:19), helping students learn principles of solidarity and social citizenship. Fourth, service learning engages students in discussions about the promise and limitations of public policy, by exposing them to the real-world impact of policies. Finally, service learning enables students to explore careers inside nonprofit organizations, social service agencies, and the public sector more generally. In this article, we explore another potential contribution of service learning: its ability to articulate the differences and similarities in disciplinary approaches to social problems.</p>
<p>To explore the interdisciplinary potential of service learning, we analyze the process of designing and teaching an interdisciplinary undergraduate service learning course on hunger and homelessness. The course under examination was team-taught by two sociology professors and two staff members of a community service organization (CSO) at which students engaged in service during the semester. Given the composition of the instructional team, this class provided an ideal opportunity to examine the interdisciplinary potential of service learning. We analyze the design and implementation of the course to answer the following question: In a multidimensional service learning course, what are the challenges in traversing the multiple boundaries between sociology and social work and between the academy and the CSO?</p>
<sec id="section1-0092055X11418840">
<title>Interdisciplinarity and Service Learning</title>
<p>Interdisciplinarity and service learning add elements to postsecondary pedagogy that are not available in the normal seats-in-chairs learning atmosphere. When we think about interdisciplinarity, we generally imagine working across academic disciplinary borders, but interdisciplinarity can also be seen as a learning process that crosses other boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092055X11418840">Klein and Newell 1997</xref>). These include boundaries between academic disciplines, between university and community, and between faculty members and students, in a rich pedagogical environment with faculty members, students, service providers, and clients all learning from one another. Service learning can, but does not always, involve this sort of multidimensional interdisciplinarity.</p>
<p>Among the advantages of multidimensional interdisciplinarity are that students learn that knowledge is not compartmentalized and that in the real world, knowledge is transferable and cumulative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092055X11418840">Garkovich 1982</xref>). Furthermore, it allows students to understand how to marshal a wide range of skills and knowledge bases to solve pressing social, economic, and technological problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092055X11418840">Klein and Newell 1997</xref>). Other advantages of interdisciplinarity are that it encourages different ways of learning, specifically more collaborative approaches that “promote dialogue and community, problem-posing and problem-solving capacities, and an integrative habit of mind . . . Because collaborative inquiry alters the strict hierarchy of teacher and student, traditional roles are redefined in the process” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092055X11418840">Klein and Newell 1997</xref>:407). Bringing to bear diverse disciplines allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the problems that beset a community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0092055X11418840">Suarez-Balcazar et al. 2006</xref>). The best sort of interdisciplinary work is “driven by people who realize they cannot answer their own questions without engaging in some deep way with another discipline and another culture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0092055X11418840">Schoenberger 2001</xref>:373).</p>
<p>There are challenges to interdisciplinary work, however. The cooperating disciplines may not share tacit values and assumptions, theories, epistemologies, notions of adequate proof, methodologies, and the ways the disciplines interact with society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092055X11418840">Lélé and Norgaard 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0092055X11418840">Schoenberger 2001</xref>). They may generally strive for different audiences and have different standards for judging success. They may use different presentation models for results. Not only may their assumptions about the world that they study be different, but they may have different assumptions about the world they do not study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092055X11418840">Lélé and Norgaard 2005</xref>). There are also practical problems, such as time scheduling, keeping all team members up to speed on project developments, changes in personnel, and building trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0092055X11418840">Suarez-Balcazar et al. 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond the difficulties common to all interdisciplinary efforts, instructors who cross disciplinary boundaries may encounter other discipline specific challenges. For example, in the course described in this article, we both worked with staff members of a local CSO who had earned master’s degrees in social work. As we describe below, this collaboration presented many challenges, as well as many opportunities for interdisciplinary learning among students and instructors alike.</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary teaching presents two challenges: differences in academic approach and in perceived purpose of the learning. At first blush, it would appear that there would not be significant differences between a social work and a sociological approach to homelessness. After all, social work and sociology share common historical roots. One of the “founding mothers” of social work, Jane Addams, was in fact a sociologist, a member of the faculty of the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago, a charter member of the American Sociological Association, and a frequent contributor to the <italic>American Journal of Sociology</italic>. Like Addams, many early sociologists had an applied bent to their work, including the founder of the Chicago sociology department, Albion Small, and the first president of the American Sociological Association, Lester Frank Ward.</p>
<p>In the first decades of the twentieth century, U.S. sociology became increasingly “scientific” and “value free,” rejecting its early connection to applied research and activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0092055X11418840">Lengermann and Niebrugge-Brantley 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0092055X11418840">Steiner 1921</xref>). The progressive inclination of sociology, dedicated to ameliorating hunger and inequality and marked by the involvement of the sociologist with the life of the community, was replaced by professional distance. In the early twentieth century, “sociologists were occupied so largely with debates about method, that their work seemed very remote from the problems in which social workers were interested” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0092055X11418840">Steiner 1921</xref>:493).</p>
<p>Around the same time that sociology was becoming more scientistic, social work was also developing as a profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092055X11418840">Bromley and Weed 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0092055X11418840">Lubove 1965</xref>). There was intentionality in this. Without professional status, social workers would be no different than the nonprofessional “charity workers” who administered charitable donations to the poor, relying on preconceived notions of “suitability” when determining who would be fit to receive the largesse of the donating classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092055X11418840">Gordon 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0092055X11418840">Michel 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0092055X11418840">Steiner 1921</xref>).</p>
<p>Professionalization offers numerous advantages. One of those advantages is that the professional can gain “social recognition and collective prestige which, in turn, are implicitly used by the individual to assert his authority and demand respect in the context of everyday transactions within specific role-sets” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092055X11418840">Larson 1977</xref>:180). By professionalizing their discipline, social workers gained a scientific knowledge base and skills that were ostensibly unavailable to the untrained layman and justified increasing membership requirements in professional associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0092055X11418840">Lubove 1965</xref>). This transformed the discipline from a voluntary, charitable, often religious service into a form of “social control based on formalized methods and justified by professional expertise” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0092055X11418840">Larson 1977</xref>:182).</p>
<p>Because of the early twentieth century “scientific” enterprise of sociology and the professionalization of social work, the two disciplines took on markedly different missions, although they both shared a strong commitment to positivist social research. The social work agenda was a little contradictory, in that it combined three incompatible elements: “a value-free positivist science heritage, an idealistic or humanistic value system and a pragmatic existential problem orientation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0092055X11418840">Haworth 1984</xref>:344).</p>
<p>In recent years, however, in response to the liberation movements of the 1960s and 1970s and the influence of feminism and postmodernism in the 1980s, sociology and social work have challenged both scientism and professionalism by calling into question the traditional power relations of researcher/subject and social worker/client. One modality shared by both disciplines is “participatory action research” (PAR), which uses a team approach to social research. The team consists of the researchers and “stakeholders”: the members of the community whose situation is intended to be improved by the research being conducted. Thus does PAR deviate strongly from both traditional sociological and social work practice in its admitted value orientation (to “improve” the situation of the stakeholders) and to rely on community members to both direct and perform the research themselves.</p>
<p>PAR is not new; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0092055X11418840">Whyte (1991)</xref> used elements of it in his research as early as 1943, when members of the organization under study became actively involved in the research. This active involvement of factory employees facilitated entrée, establishment and maintenance of relationships, and data gathering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092055X11418840">Gardner and Whyte 1946</xref>). Over time, Whyte and other researchers developed PAR in response to concerns that the “professional expert” model of both abstract and applied research was failing to uncover the processes that inhibited organizational development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0092055X11418840">Whyte 1991</xref>). What sets PAR apart from the standard research model is the participation of the stakeholders. For their participation in the research to be meaningful, it is necessary for the researchers to reflect and adapt their thinking about their proper role and the location of power, in the research process; this determines “how, by and for whom research is conceptualized and conducted” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092055X11418840">Cornwall and Jewkes 1995</xref>:1667; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X11418840">Greenwood and Levin 2006</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092055X11418840">Cornwall and Jewkes (1995)</xref> cautioned that PAR is easily co-opted, with only lip service given to the active involvement of the stakeholders. Several issues related to the research arise: “What is the research for? Who is the research for? Whose knowledge counts? Who takes part in what stages of research process? Who owns the results?” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092055X11418840">Cornwall and Jewkes 1995</xref>:1669).</p>
<p>The advantages of PAR are obvious: The research is useful to the stakeholders, has liberatory potential, and has greater validity because of the iterative construction of the research process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092055X11418840">Feagin and Vera 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X11418840">Greenwood and Levin 2006</xref>). However, the process of PAR contains many challenges to researchers that are similar to the challenges presented by interdisciplinary instruction: It is time-consuming, the researchers lack control over the process and the product, and frequently the researchers must adjust their thinking to understand and respond to the issues raised by the stakeholders. As much as these are challenges, PAR advocates argue that they are also improvements over the traditional research process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X11418840">Greenwood and Levin 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>PAR is especially suited for service learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0092055X11418840">Nyden 2003</xref>). The best service learning courses, it has been argued, advance critical understanding of the social world through the dialogic process of praxis and reflection, learning and experiencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0092055X11418840">Huisman 2010</xref>), and this is precisely what PAR aims to accomplish. PAR in a service learning class can promote the sociological imagination by understanding private troubles in their historical context. A service learning course in which students engage in PAR has the potential to enhance critical thinking and understanding of the social world and to do some good at the same time. A service learning course co-led by sociologists and social workers may also explore the differences and similarities between disciplinary approaches to the study and teaching of social problems.</p>

<sec id="section2-0092055X11418840">
<title>Background</title>
<p>In this paper, we examine the design and implementation of an experimental undergraduate service learning course on hunger and homelessness. The authors of this article, two sociology professors, were members of a four-person team that collaborated closely on the conceptualization, design, and instruction of a service learning course from April 2009 through May 2010. The idea for the course emerged from a meeting in which the CSO staff members asked one of the sociology professors for help conducting interviews with clients. When the sociology professor suggested that students conduct interviews in the context of a service learning course, CSO staff members agreed enthusiastically.</p>
<p>The sociologists taught this experimental course as an overload, because the department was unable to spare the equivalent of two courses for such a low-enrollment undergraduate course. The other team members (CSO staff members) were recent graduates of a master’s of social work program and employees of the CSO at which students volunteered during the semester. Although the CSO staff members had limited experience teaching at the college level, their knowledge of, and enthusiasm about, PAR was much greater than that of either of the sociologists. The CSO staff members had taken graduate-level courses in PAR during their master’s program, and one social worker had been a research assistant on a PAR study during her master’s program.</p>
<p>The instructional team spent 10 months negotiating the terms of the collaboration, the learning and service objectives of the course, the syllabus, and the instructional techniques that would be used in the course. Just before the course was about to begin, one of the CSO staff members changed jobs and was unable to participate in the actual teaching of the course. A third social worker joined the instructional team shortly before the course started and took over some of the original team member’s planned instructional duties.</p>
<p>The service learning course had 10 students: 9 undergraduates and 1 graduate student. The course was advertised in undergraduate sociology and social work courses, and interested students were required to apply for the course by answering several questions about their interest in and experience with volunteer work, poverty and homelessness, and research methods. The instructional team reviewed the applications together, giving priority to juniors and seniors who had sufficient sociology courses, in particular research methods; coursework in race, class, and gender; stratification; and sociology of poverty. All of the students who were selected had methods backgrounds, but only a few had grounding in the sociological study of poverty. Although instructors hoped for a mixture of sociology and social work students, only sociology majors applied, because of the rigors of the social work program requirements, and therefore the course was composed entirely of sociology students. The selected students had interests in criminology, social justice, and the environment, but only 2 or 3 planned to pursue careers in some sort of public service at the beginning of the course.</p>
<p>The course had three core learning objectives: increased understanding of the causes of poverty, hunger, and homelessness; exposure to the experience of poverty and homelessness; and the acquisition of qualitative research skills. Each course session was composed of a lecture or presentation, as well as discussion and/or hands-on exercise in which students would “try out” the ideas or skills that they were learning that week.</p>
<p>During the semester, the class met as a group once a week for three hours in the conference room at the CSO, which was a 10-minute drive from campus. In addition, students were required to volunteer for two hours per week at one of the CSO’s four sites: the homeless shelter, a drop-in center open to intoxicated individuals, and two transitional housing facilities, one for families and one for veterans. They were also required to meet with a client advisory board (CAB), composed of client “stakeholders” in the PAR, and conduct interviews with two clients from their volunteer sites.</p>
<p>During the semester, students conducted research in stages. First, the students engaged in participant observation at their volunteer sites, writing weekly field notes that were reviewed by all members of the instructional team. Seven weeks into the course, the students met with the CAB for the first time, and again in week 13. In week 12, the students began conducting in-depth interviews with clients with whom they were volunteering. Each student completed and transcribed two interviews. In groups of two or three, students planned and executed two presentations that analyzed their experience volunteering at the CSO. In these presentations, students used their field notes and interview transcripts to make claims about clients’ experiences, both as homeless individuals and receiving services from the CSO.</p>

<sec id="section3-0092055X11418840" sec-type="methods">
<title>Data and Methods</title>
<p>To examine how service learning, and interdisciplinary service learning in particular, interrogates disciplinary boundaries and similarities, we drew on diverse types of data. First, we gained insight into the students’ experiences by reviewing standard departmental course evaluations. Although these provided important information, even more helpful were notes from the informal focus group–style evaluation sessions that students participated in at the course midpoint and at the end of the course. We also used students’ field notes written in weeks 3 through 14. The field notes, in particular, were useful in gauging students’ progress achieving the learning objectives of the course.</p>
<p>To capture CSO staff members’ perspectives on the planning and implementation of the course, we analyzed two types of data. We drew on written assessments of each student’s service work provided during the semester by CSO staff members who were not involved with the course. In addition, one of the instructors solicited verbal feedback from CSO staff members about the course and the students at the end of the semester, and we analyzed her copious notes from these conversations.</p>
<p>We also analyzed meeting notes and correspondence between instructors during the course planning process, to understand how the instructors’ perceptions of learning objectives, course design, and selection and value of course materials changed over time through interdisciplinary interaction. Copious notes taken during class sessions captured both the general flow of class discussions and specific comments and questions from students and instructors during lectures, discussions, and exercises.</p>
<p>Careful analysis of these data made it possible to make claims about what interdisciplinary teaching reveals about disciplinary boundaries and similarities. It also made it possible to make claims about how interdisciplinary teaching shapes students’ learning and CSOs’ experiences with service learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0092055X11418840">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>To demonstrate the potentialities of interdisciplinarity, we present our findings in two sections. The first section explores the promises and challenges of interdisciplinary teaching by examining three “moments” in the design and execution of this course. The first moment concerned the planning process undertaken by the instructional team, which involved discussions about course topics, class sessions, and assigned texts. The second moment was the class session during which students received guidance from the CAB. Although students met with the CAB two times during the semester, we focus on the first of these sessions, because it was the longer and more revealing of the two. The third moment was the design and implementation of students’ final presentations.</p>
<p>The second section explores the class from the perspective of the students, with particular attention to the pedagogical benefits of interdisciplinary service learning. This section uses excerpts from students’ field notes to show how their understanding of the causes of poverty and homelessness, the lived experience of homelessness, and qualitative research deepened as a result of the course. Finally, we include a brief discussion of three additional pedagogical benefits: developing interdisciplinary solutions to poverty and homelessness, exposure to professional ethics and norms, and becoming an authority.</p>

<title>Promises and Challenges of Interdisciplinary Teaching</title>
<sec id="section6-0092055X11418840">
<title>The first moment: Navigating course content and syllabi</title>
<p>During a meeting in mid-May, about nine months before the course was to begin, the instructional team identified three core learning objectives. First, the course should “start with several class sessions about the structural causes of poverty,” with one of the sociology instructors taking the lead in these discussions. Next, the course would cover experiences of poverty, which could include “psychological problems and behaviors commonly found in the homeless population” and debates among social workers about the most appropriate “model of service provision for the homeless individuals.” It was agreed that the CSO staff members in the instructional team, in conjunction with CSO staff members not involved in the course, would lead this portion of the course. The third learning objective would be hands-on experience in qualitative research methods, on which sociologists would take the lead.</p>
<p>As course planning proceeded, tensions emerged about the size and scope of each of these learning objectives. Although the sociologists and CSO staff members on the instructional team agreed about the three core learning objectives of the course—understanding the causes of poverty, learning the experiences of poverty, and honing research skills—there was considerable disciplinary divergence about the relative size, scope, and focus of each learning objective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0092055X11418840">
<title>Learning objective 1: Causes of poverty</title>
<p>From the first course planning meeting, sociologists on the instructional team were adamant that the course must focus on the destruction of the social safety net in the United States, the actors and institutions responsible for this, and the failure of resistance to these actions. By early September, the instructional team had tentative agreement on these three topics under the “causes of poverty” rubric. The third topic, powerlessness, became a topic of some debate later in the course planning process, a dynamic that will be explored later in this section.</p>
<p>A disagreement emerged related to the materials that the instructors would use to teach students about the causes of poverty. At several points in the course planning process, CSO staff members on the instructional team suggested reports about the housing crisis and social services that had been created by social service agencies. Although the sociologists agreed that these reports offered useful statistics about the scope of various social problems, they questioned their ability to provide theoretical and structural explanations for the destruction of the social safety net. After several discussions about this topic, the instructional team agreed to adopt several chapters of <italic>Poverty</italic>, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0092055X11418840">Lister (2004)</xref>, a text that offers theoretically informed discussions of both the causes and consequences of the destruction of the social safety net.</p>
<p>Related to causes and consequences of poverty are societal and individual responses to poverty. During the many conversations about course content, the instructional team debated about this topic and how it should be understood. Should we be talking about collective and societal responses or individual responses? Although the CSO staff members tended to treat structural factors as implied, the sociologists wanted to make the structural aspects more explicit. The sociologists proposed a class session on “antipoverty action.” Although the CSO staff members agreed that the course should have a section on responses to poverty, they countered with a more individual-level perspective investigating posttraumatic growth, strength, and collective self-determination. The sociologists reintroduced a more collective or institutional framework. They suggested two class sessions under the rubric of “responding to poverty.” One session, “nonprofits and social workers,” would focus on funding for and innovations in services for the homeless. The other session, “collective action,” would focus on collective forms of antipoverty action. The individual perspectives were moved to the second learning objective, experience of poverty, discussed below.</p>
<p>CSO staff members suggested that the rubric of “responding to poverty” be changed to “solutions to poverty,” to which the sociologists agreed. For the class sessions on “collective action,” the CSO staff members suggested an emphasis on “awareness” about homelessness and the “dissemination” of new information and new attitudes about the poor. Fearing that these topics would take the course too far away from an examination of collective responses to poverty, the sociologists argued again that this class session focus on antipoverty action and promoted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0092055X11418840">Piven and Cloward (1978)</xref> as the best way to do so. The CSO staff members on the instructional team agreed to this configuration, and the final version of the syllabus included these topics under the “solutions to poverty” rubric.</p>
<p>As for the rubric of “causes,” there was considerable debate within the instructional team about which texts to include in the “responding to poverty” section of the class. The CSO staff members proposed a number of reports detailing the activities of a “systemic change and civic action group” undertaken by a homeless shelter and organization in another city. In the end, the instructional team agreed to use the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0092055X11418840">Lister (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0092055X11418840">Piven and Cloward (1978)</xref> texts to achieve these goals and relegate the Web sites, policy papers, and reports to the “supplemental readings” section of the course Web site.</p>

<title>Learning objective 2: Experiences of poverty and homelessness</title>
<p>In addition to the causes of poverty, all members of the instructional team agreed that the course must examine individuals’ and groups’ experiences of poverty and homelessness. Instructors hoped that this section of the course would personalize and humanize poverty for students who had not experienced it themselves as well as explain the consequences of some of the actions and policies described in the “causes” section of the course. They adopted a theme of precariousness that they hoped would “hold together” the various class sessions on individuals’ and groups’ experience of poverty.</p>
<p>In late summer, the CSO staff members suggested that the course spend less time on precariousness and adopt a “strength-based approach” to understanding poverty and homelessness. They presented the following description of this approach for the sociologists’ consideration:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When we say “strength based” we mean very broadly to always consider first a person’s abilities, potential, and progress before considering other aspects of their performance or personality. A strength based perspective also recognizes that everyone has challenges and episodes of failure, however those negative aspects do not define a person and they should not be the only source of information when deciding next steps or a direction for progress. Further, the theory provides that when you look for or ask for the broken/damaged/problematic components of a person or issue, then you will only find those negative components. On the other hand, if you look for and focus on strengths, potential, and positive progress, you will find those components.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If adopted, this strength-based approach would necessitate a reframing of the “experiences” section of the course. During that meeting, the CSO staff members offered several proposals about how to reframe the course around strengths, with emphases on “choice and peoples’ right to be alcoholics,” substituting “trauma” for “deinstitutionalization” and “co-occurring disorders” in place of “mental health.”</p>
<p>For the sociologists, it made sense for the CSO staff members to take the lead on the “experience” component of the course, because that was their area of expertise. The sociologists, however, were concerned that the structural context for individuals’ experience with poverty and homelessness was being pushed farther into the margins of the course, but they believed that it could be dealt with in the selection of reading materials.</p>
<p>Once again, however, tensions emerged about what materials to include. The CSO staff members submitted several articles for consideration, including one describing an individual’s experience with mental illness and another about commonly held biases and assumptions about the poor called “Conceptual Foundations for Social Justice Courses” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0092055X11418840">Hardiman and Jackson 1997</xref>). The sociologists, in their turn, submitted several readings, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0092055X11418840">Snow and Anderson (1993)</xref>, a classic sociological text describing the experience of homelessness.</p>
<p>After much debate and discussion about the relative merit, appropriateness, and timeliness of the various texts, in mid-September, the instructional team adopted CSO staff members’ suggestion to assign <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0092055X11418840">Morrell (2007)</xref>. Although the book did not use sociological research methods per se, the fact that it attempted to identify patterns and themes from the more than 100 interviews that researchers conducted with homeless individuals made it acceptable to the sociologists. The social workers on the instructional team approved of the book’s emphasis on individual experiences, its use of PAR, and its attempt to develop solutions to homelessness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0092055X11418840">
<title>Learning objective 3: Research skills</title>
<p>The third learning objective of the course was the introduction to qualitative research skills, with an emphasis on the analysis and presentation of qualitative data, specifically interviews and participant observation, with attention to the requirements of PAR. Sociologists on the instructional team proposed several class sessions to provide students with the basic skills that they would need to conduct participant observation and in-depth interviews with clients of the CSO. To this end, sociologists proposed sessions on writing ethnographic field notes, conducting interviews, and analyzing qualitative data. Concerned about the protection of their clients, CSO staff members proposed a series of class sessions on ethical issues, power dynamics, listening skills, generational communication and cultural interviewing, research relationships, inequality in the research relationship, and respectful research</p>
<p>The sociologists had some hesitation about including “cultural interviewing” and “generational communication” in a sociology course about research methods, because those terms and concepts are not used in sociological research. Instead, they proposed drawing on a classic sociological treatment of research ethics, including Humphreys’s <italic>Tearoom Trade</italic> (1967) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092055X11418840">Erikson’s (1967)</xref> response in <italic>Social Problems</italic>. During this meeting, the sociologists also proposed class sessions on “gaining access” and “securing consent,” two topics of great importance to ethnographic researchers. In response to these suggestions, CSO staff members asked, “Why are we spending so much time on ethnography when the students aren’t going to be conducting ethnographies?” CSO staff members reminded the sociologists that PAR was conducted with the full collaboration and participation of research subjects, negating the need for gaining access or securing consent in a traditional sense.</p>
<p>The sociologists on the instructional team conceded this point and agreed to replace the session on “gaining access” with a session that dealt with the differences between PAR and traditional sociological research methods. The instructional team also agreed to refocus the “securing consent” session around the institutional review board and procedures for securing informed consent from interviewees, before commencing the interview.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0092055X11418840">
<title>The second moment: Engaging clients in PAR</title>
<p>The second moment was the class session in week 7, during which students met with the CAB to discuss potential questions for the interviews that they would be conducting as part of the course. The CAB is a core feature of PAR; CAB members assist the research by serving as experts by virtue of their lived experiences. In large-scale PAR, the CAB is an integral part of the research, coming in early and staying with the research throughout its duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092055X11418840">Greenwood and Levin 2006</xref>). CAB members help formulate the research problem and the interview questions, help recruit participants and negotiate problems of access, and provide insights in the analysis of the data. If the research is about a group’s experiences, needs, and solutions, there is no better assistance in the research than from someone who is familiar with that life.</p>
<p>Given the constraints of a semester-long class, the students had just 15 weeks in which to do participant observation, interviews, transcribing, coding, and analysis. Before students embarked on their research, they had to learn research skills and fill in the gaps of their knowledge and understanding about poverty and homelessness. As a result, students were not able to begin conducting interviews until the 12th week of class. The instructional team decided to engage the CAB for our class two times: once in week 7 to help students develop interview questions and once in week 13 to provide students with feedback on their preliminary research findings.</p>
<p>Prior to the first CAB meeting, the instructional team had several spirited discussions about the questions that we would pose to the CAB. CSO staff members proposed that board members be asked, “How can we make these facilities better?” referring to the CSO site at which the students were volunteering. The sociologists were interested in different questions, with a focus on exploring the causes and consequences of homelessness, and in particular the failure of outside institutions, such as welfare agencies, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and educational systems. To this end, the sociologists proposed that students should ask CAB members open-ended questions about their experiences being homeless and accessing services.</p>
<p>Ten clients of the CSO were recruited several days prior to the CAB meeting by staff members at the CSO sites and offered a small stipend for their participation in the CAB, made possible by a small grant from the university. Although recruiters tried to explain the purpose of the CAB, when clients arrived for the CAB, many were unclear about why they were there. The CAB met for an hour and a half, and as such, students did not have adequate time to probe the board’s expertise in an undirected way. Given these time constraints, one of the instructors undertook to provide direction to get the most out of the time with the board.</p>
<p>The CAB session started with a brief overview of the purpose of the board by the CSO staff. CSO staff members explained that “the purpose of this research is to make things better” and that in the session, the students and instructors were “looking for solutions and actions to take, to make things better” at the CSO. When the CAB members sat down in small groups with the students, CSO staff members introduced the first discussion question: “What is working [at the CSO] and what is not?” After some discussion, CSO staff members encouraged CAB members to discuss “what needs to happen and what are the barriers to making it happen.” After posing this question, CSO staff members reminded CAB members to “focus on what you’d like to see, possible solutions, and what you’d need to know, to make it happen” in their comments.</p>
<p>In this way, the questions posed by the CSO staff members ensured that the meeting between students and CAB members focused almost exclusively on the internal workings of the CSO itself. As a result, in all of the small groups of students and CAB members, the early focus of the discussion was on problems at the CSO, particularly the unpleasantness of the surroundings, different groups having to live in close proximity, complaints about the staff members and volunteers, and possible danger from violent clients. The students heard that there was frequently a disjuncture between the services offered by the organization and what the clients really needed. CAB members also revealed that they frequently did not seek help because of the fear of being judged: “People with the most power to help, don’t care. They’re the ones that judge the most.”</p>
<p>As the class session progressed, the interactions between students and CAB members became more organic and unstructured. Students latched onto specific comments made by CAB members and began asking probing follow-up questions. Students also asked CAB members to look at the interview questions that they had drafted and provide them feedback on the wording and purpose of the questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0092055X11418840">
<title>The third moment: Final projects</title>
<p>The third moment was the process of developing students’ final presentations. While designing the course, the instructional team had many discussions about how to develop a final project that would require students to reflect on their service, integrate the course readings with what they learned in class and during volunteering, and analyze their interview transcripts and field notes. Despite shared commitment to these learning objectives, it became clear that sociologists and CSO staff members had distinct notions about what the students should learn from the presentation experience and how best to balance the students’ learning objectives with the needs of the CSO. Once the instructional team decided that students would do presentations for their final projects, a conflict emerged between pedagogical outcomes and benefits to the CSO.</p>
<p>CSO staff members in the instructional team envisioned the final presentations as an avenue for developing interventions that could alleviate problems that emerged in client interviews. In contrast, the sociologists, in their roles as both instructors and researchers, conceived of the final presentations as a forum for students to present their analysis of the qualitative data that they collected throughout the semester.</p>
<p>In early summer, when CSO staff members proposed that the course use PAR methods, they explained that a core component of the PAR approach was developing a “theory of change.” In this approach, researchers use the data that they have collected to identify solutions to the social problems that their study explores. After developing a “theory of change,” PAR researchers “develop an intervention” capable of solving some of the problems that they witnessed during their service learning. According to the CSO staff members on the instructional team, the student presentations would be most useful to the CSO if they detailed the students’ “theory of change,” pointing out the limitations of the CSO site at which they volunteered, and identifying potential improvements. By presenting this “theory of change,” students would provide a needed benefit to the CSO.</p>
<p>The sociologists did not share this enthusiasm for critical and/or evaluative student presentations. One reason for the sociologists’ hesitation was their concern that critical presentations would be poorly received by staff members of the organization. A second concern was the potential to do irreparable damage to the relationship between the university and CSO, which had been carefully and time-intensively cultivated during the course planning process. Sociologists noted that one way to “deal with the potential fall-out from the presentations” would be to “cut out inappropriate content from presentations before the students present their findings.” However, neither they, nor the CSO staff members, were supportive of this option.</p>
<p>For the CSO staff members, the central issue was for the students and the instructional team to learn “how to talk to organizations in a way that they will listen and understand the possible pitfalls of the presentations.” Discussing the “intent of the course and the presentations” with the organization’s management team ahead of time, it was argued, would eliminate the possibility that staff members would be offended by the presentations.</p>
<p>The sociologists, on the other hand, wanted students to receive instruction in and experience with formal sociological analysis of qualitative data. This would require a more traditional research direction, analysis, and presentation of data than the “theory of change” model. During a fall meeting, the sociologists shared these concerns with the CSO staff members. A crucial step of qualitative sociological research, the sociologists explained, is identifying themes in interview transcripts. This is a time-intensive process, and to be accurate and sound, students must wait until data analysis is completed before reaching conclusions about their findings. Therefore, it was possible that the CSO staff’s emphasis on developing “theories of change” and interventions would encourage students to skip this crucial analytical step, which was required to meet the academic and sociological requirements of the course. In response to these concerns, the CSO staff members suggested that students focus their research on clients’ “needs and experiences getting services” at the CSO. The sociologists considered this proposal, opining that such a focus might facilitate a more sociological analysis of trends in clients’ experiences of hunger and homelessness.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, the sociologists proposed that students prepare and deliver two separate presentations, one at a campus undergraduate research conference and one at the CSO at the end of the semester. While the campus presentation would require students to conduct a more formal sociological analysis of clients’ experiences, the presentation at the organization could focus on solutions, or next steps, for the organization. After some discussion, this solution was enthusiastically embraced by the instructional team. It enabled the team to overcome the growing tensions about the presentation goals, the organizational benefits of the course, and the methods that students would use to analyze their data.</p>

<title>The Pedagogical Benefits of Interdisciplinarity</title>
<p>The previous section has demonstrated both the promises and challenges of interdisciplinarity by examining social workers’ and sociologists’ experiences planning and implementing an interdisciplinary service learning course. Equally, if not more, striking were the pedagogical benefits for the students enrolled in the service learning course. As discussed above, there were three primary learning objectives for students in the course: (1) increasing the students’ understanding of the causes of poverty, (2) personalizing and humanizing the experience of poverty, and (3) developing and refining students’ research skills.</p>
<p>Careful examination of students’ course evaluations, field notes, and presentations provides rich evidence of the pedagogical benefits of interdisciplinary service learning. This section is organized less chronologically than the previous section, because the pedagogical benefits of interdisciplinary service learning are intertwined and reflexive. Simply put, none of the pedagogical benefits were achievable without development of the others.</p>
<sec id="section13-0092055X11418840">
<title>In the beginning: Thin description, a multitude of assumptions</title>
<p>The first set of students’ field notes demonstrated how underdeveloped their qualitative research skills and understandings of poverty were in week 3 of the course. At this point in the course, students’ descriptions of the CSO and their experiences there were rather thin. One student noted that “the center is intimidating when first walking in,” without explaining how or why he found it intimidating. Another student explained that “Monday morning I went in for my first section of time. I came in the morning to help set up for lunch, and to help serve lunch,” without including any detail about what he did or with whom he interacted.</p>
<p>Students’ descriptions of their interactions with clients were similarly lacking. One student summarized his interaction with a client this way: “Met a cool guy that fought in some war. Very knowledgeable, only guy I really talked to that day.” Although slightly more two-dimensional, the following field note is marked by a student’s assumptions about clients and her thin descriptions of interactions:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He told me of his past . . . and talked longingly about returning to a place where he knew people. While his story was sad and it was clear he had dealt with a lot of hardship in his life, I was surprised how quick he was to joke and smile. We talked about his desire to work with kids but how his past criminal activity would cause problems for him. [He] is a very friendly and open man.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although another student focused on his own reactions to a tenant meeting at the CSO’s transitional housing center, he did pay some attention to the “sense” of community that he observed before the meeting:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One thing that I think surprised me more than anything was how much of a community they have going at the center. We sat in on a tenants meeting, but beforehand I merely sat and watched some of the mothers interact with each other. I was shocked because they all looked so worn-out, but were so energetic and good-humored with each other. They collectively joked about work, the children, and other small details. There were a number of small conversations going on, but for the most part there was just an overwhelming feeling of belonging.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although this student’s field notes were more substantial than most at this stage of the course, they still included many assumptions and unsubstantiated claims.</p>
<p>A third limitation of students’ field notes at this stage in the course was their tendency to be self-centered without being very detailed or self-reflective. One student explained that “it was almost a little uncomfortable in the beginning, I felt as though I was intruding into an already smooth running system. Though I soon felt very comfortable, and actually really enjoyed myself.” Another student described his time at the CSO this way:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is easy to not act or feel judgmental and stereotypical but it is hard not to think that I have to censor myself and maybe even be myself around a lot of the people stopping into the [CSO]. . . . Goal—try to interact and engage more with some of the clients coming into the Center. I felt nervous around a lot of the clients.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because their field notes tended to focus on their own feelings, assumptions, and impressions of the CSO, during the first weeks of the course, few students delved into the experience of poverty. Their field notes were much more likely to contain their own assessments of the clients than attempts to understand clients’ lives.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0092055X11418840">
<title>Gaining insights into the experience of homelessness</title>
<p>Two class sessions deepened students’ appreciation of the experience of poverty and homelessness: a guest lecture that touched on the concept of “resiliency” and the first meeting with the CAB. Below, we use selections from field notes written after these two class sessions to demonstrate how the interdisciplinarity of the course enabled students to delve deeper into the experiences and causes of poverty and homelessness.</p>
<p>Resiliency was marginal to the original course design, relegated to a subtopic of one guest lecture during the semester. For 45 minutes in week 8, a CSO staff member not involved in the course regaled the students with stories of clients who had persevered in the face of tremendous odds, sometimes for just a few weeks in their lives. After this lecture, students began evincing special interest in the “resiliency” aspect of the experience of poverty and homelessness. After this guest lecture, students started to direct their attention toward such questions as “who makes it” out of homelessness and “who doesn’t.” During one class session, spirited debate and discussion was sparked by the following question, raised by a student who had been homeless briefly during childhood: What are the characteristics of people who leave homelessness permanently?</p>
<p>Some students focused on resiliency at an individual level, trying to identify characteristics of resilient individuals among the clients at their site. Other students started thinking about resiliency in relation to the CSO. This was especially true of students who volunteered at the drop-in center, where clients who struggled with mental health issues and substance abuse could find daytime shelter even while intoxicated. In their final presentation, these students identified specific services offered by the drop-in center, and argued that some of these services provided social and emotional interaction that bolstered clients’ resiliency.</p>
<p>But it was the class session in which the students first met with the CAB that offered a defining moment in the course. Many students exclaimed that it was the “coolest class period I’ve had in college.” One reason for this was that their conversations with clients during the CAB in week 7 exposed them to new perspectives about homelessness, poverty, and the CSO. This was surprising to many students. Their volunteer experience had led them to believe that they were fairly familiar with the CSO, but according to one student, CAB members exposed them to “lots of ideas that I never ever thought about” prior to the class session.</p>
<p>During the CAB meeting one student learned a great deal about “the atmosphere, what it’s like to live” at the CSO, in particular “the difficulties of communal living.” According to another student, the CAB “made it clear to me how hard it is to recover” from substance abuse, if you are living “in a population with users.” Still other students learned that clients use the CSO’s services for different reasons than he had assumed. He explained that he initially “assumed that the freedom and vulgarity was the appeal of the” CSO’s drop-in center. Conversations with clients during the CAB convinced him that “it’s not the case,” and in fact, for many clients, the vulgarity and intoxication at the drop-in center were “a real problem.” The CAB meeting also disabused students of the notion, common in public thinking about poverty, that clients were grateful for anything, no matter how dingy or smelly.</p>
<p>The “light bulb moments” that students experienced during the CAB shaped their approach to the research that they were conducting in the course. First, the students became noticeably more focused and enthusiastic about their research projects. As a result of the conversations with clients, some students simply added more questions to their interview outlines or changed the tenor and tone of their questions. Other students, though, were inspired to radically reconfigure their research projects. As one student explained, “our original research question was about treatment options for substance use, but at the CAB we learned that that’s not an issue” for clients. As a result, this student focused her research on why, and how, clients used the drop-in center run by the CSO. Finally, the depth and quality of their discussions with CAB members convinced many students of the importance of open-ended questions. The more they encouraged the CAB members to talk, the more they learned.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0092055X11418840">
<title>A deeper understanding of the homeless</title>
<p>Another benefit of the CAB was that it inspired students to make fewer generalizations about homelessness and homeless individuals. By the eighth week of the course, the students were developing a richer understanding of who is homeless, and their findings were often surprising:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One of these clients was an older man, Tom, with a very gentle, calm voice. He was telling the staff member what they would need to get the computers up and running in this new location. . . . He was making lists of supplies that were needed, testing computers for internet readiness in a way that I could not really understand and talking with [the staff person] about what they would need to make these new arrangements work. . . . The staff members told me about how they had an IT person who had been there for the last three days who was not at all as helpful as this client was.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This was not the only student who became aware of the diversity of skills and abilities found among CSO clients. One student’s field notes in week 9 described his interactions with a Native American woman from one of the Montana tribal nations. Although currently a client at the CSO, she had been a leader in her tribal community:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I myself was surprised at how quickly she discounted herself, because under the Education section she merely listed high school. I asked if she had any college education, and when she replied yes, I suggested she add the courses she’d take as well. She seemed baffled that an employer would care, and I explained that all certified education is relevant. [She asked] if there was any way to incorporate her involvement in her tribal community. . . . By the time we had finished, she had a résumé that any employer would be awed by. Her leadership and communication skills alone would make her a great asset to any public service department, and her knowledge of grant writing, governmental bureaucratic process, and accounting qualifies her for many positions within a non-profit entity. . . . Despite all my knowledge of poverty and the systemic causes, I was shocked and horrified to find such a nice, qualified lady homeless. In all reality, she is more qualified to pursue the career path that I myself have chosen, but may never have that chance.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to a growing awareness of diversity of skills and abilities, students also learned about the differences and hierarchies that existed among homeless individuals at the CSO. Another student’s field notes from week 9 described a client he talked to, who claimed that</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>there are three kinds of homeless people: Those who don’t want help and want to leech, those who want help but need the assistance of others and can’t do it on their own, and those who just need a job, place to stay, and some food for the time being. One major complaint about [the CSO] was that all three groups are lumped together and not treated/dealt with according to what their specific needs. A client explained that he utilizes the Sal to use the internet to look for a job and sit down and rest and eat when he needs. He says that he does this, as opposed to the drunks who come in and take up all the couch space to sleep or be loud and belligerent, or the video gamers that just sit on the computer for 8 hours playing video games.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A more complicated snapshot of CSO clients, such as this man offered, provided this student and others with more information about how clients viewed and used the services of the CSO.</p>
<p>As the students developed a more nuanced understanding of the homeless community at the CSO, their understanding about the lived experience of homelessness grew as well. For example, many students became increasingly aware of the stigma experienced by people in poverty, how it affects them, and how they coped with it. In week 8, one student became particularly disturbed by the humiliation apparently felt by some teenagers at the CSO, who were only a few years younger than she:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>One family came in . . . [who] seemed to be a mother, daughter, son and grandmother. The mother and grandmother seemed pleasant and happy, but the younger people (they both seemed to be about high school aged) seemed very uncomfortable. Neither seemed to want to look the servers in the eyes, and the boy wore headphones while moving through the line. . . . Another family that was surprising to see come through the line was a mother and her high school aged daughter. Both were very well dressed, and again the daughter seemed to feel uncomfortable. She too wore headphones while coming through the food line.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This budding outward-directedness of the students’ attention further enabled them to understand how and why clients were poor, another core learning objective of the course.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0092055X11418840">
<title>Confronting the causes of poverty and homelessness</title>
<p>Although the semester began with reading and lectures on the structural causes of poverty, early class discussions still reverted to problems related to substance abuse or lack of education. It was not until students had spent several weeks volunteering at the CSO and reflecting on their experiences in their field notes that they appreciated the complexity of the problem. After the guest lecture on resiliency and the CAB meeting, alternative explanations for homelessness began to emerge in students’ field notes.</p>
<p>For example, several students discovered that many of the clients of the CSO had faced discrimination or disadvantage on account of race or country of origin. In week 9, a student was surprised to learn that although a CSO client had significant postsecondary education, it had not prevented her from becoming homeless. An immigrant from Russia, she was unable to parlay her education into employment, because the certification did not transfer to Montana:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When discussing education, she had only placed high school diploma and minor medical training in this section. I asked her if she could think of anything else, and she replied no. Being used to this response, I started quizzing her about anything she had a certificate for. She listed off a number of small items, such as CPR training, and then touched upon something that truly shocked me. She mentioned something she simply called “music school.” The word school sounded promising to me, so I asked what her certification from it was. Her response was a diploma. I then asked how many years it took to reach this level and her response shocked me to the bone. Eight years. After further questioning I managed to learn that she had spent eight years in Russia attending what would be the equivalent of a music specialized university here in the US. She learned to write music simply by listening, to compose, to play many varied instruments, and the algebra of music. I asked her why she had failed to mention this earlier, and her response was that someone, in the process of immigrating here, had informed her that her degree was essentially worthless here, so she simply discounted it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By encouraging the client about the relevancy and importance of her educational experience, this student hoped to help her compete in the local labor market.</p>
<p>At the same time, other students discovered that health issues can contribute to a person’s homelessness. In week 9, one student described a conversation she had with a client at the CSO:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He then started to tell me about the circumstances that had caused him to be in his current homeless situation. . . . He told me repeatedly that he had never had any sort of health problems before experiencing an accident at work in which he had fallen off of railing as an iron worker. He said that after he had fallen into a pile of iron the majority of the impact from the fall had been taken by his face and side of his head. This had led him to have severe nerve damage that caused almost constant pain. He told me about his brain surgery again and described the process of the doctors going in to repair the nerve damage. He said that he felt like he would not be homeless if he hadn’t had this accident, because it left him unable to work at the only job he had ever known.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By week 9, students’ curiosity was strong, motivating them to learn even more about homelessness and poverty. Their field notes showed a heightened interest in the lived experience of homelessness, as well as the many entry points into homelessness. As students’ knowledge base grew, so did their interest in eradicating poverty and homelessness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0092055X11418840">
<title>Developing interdisciplinary solutions</title>
<p>After the CAB meeting, one student explained, “I realized that the problems are much larger and deeper than I thought.” As a result, he continued, to really understand poverty and homelessness, “I really had to dig deeper” into the issue. Another student explained that the class gave him a “new appreciation for the complexity of homeless vets’ experience and how to attempt to address this” problem. Many students grappled with their sociological desire to understand clients’ experiences, and their budding interest in identifying concrete solutions to poverty and homelessness. After the CAB meeting, many students chose to pursue a middle way between the service-focused emphasis of the social workers on the instructional team and the more structural and experiential line of inquiry adopted by the sociologists.</p>
<p>Several students bridged the interdisciplinary “divide” on the instructional team, by focusing on the challenges that the CSO encountered day to day. As one student explained, “before the CAB [meeting], our questions were general questions about poverty. Now they’re ‘what does the [CSO] need?’” In identifying solutions, students struggled to reconcile the conflicting views of clients. According to one student, although some CAB participants believed that “it all sucks” at the CSO, “different clients don’t agree that it all sucks.” Weekly interactions with clients became fact-finding missions for some students. They encouraged clients to identify problems with the CSO, to develop their own solutions.</p>

<title>Learning professionalism</title>
<p>Another significant pedagogical benefit of the course was the exposure that students gained to professional ethics and norms. Throughout the course, students often expressed confusion about the contradictory statuses that they occupied at the CSO: Were they researchers, teachers, social workers, or friends? When encouraged, by a social worker on the instructional team, to establish a more professional relationship with CSO clients, one student sighed, “I have more experience being a friend than a professional.”</p>
<p>In the ensuring conversation, the social workers on the instruction team assured students that these were the types of issues that are typically raised in social work courses. They also explained how social workers deal with the many roles they adopt in the course of a typical work day. They explained the importance of maintaining professional boundaries with clients and offered some examples of how to do this from their own social work careers. Finally, they explained the importance of preparing clients for the “termination of the relationship” that would come at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>This exposure to professional norms and ethics was an outgrowth of the interdisciplinary nature of the instructional team. Although one sociologist had considerable experience with direct service provision, it was more than a decade old. The social workers on the instructional team had a wealth of experience maintaining professional relationships and managing “dual roles” at the CSO. By recounting their experiences and linking them to core concepts in the field of social work, these instructors provided students with valuable information about professionalism, in social work and beyond.</p>

<title>Learning to become an authority</title>
<p>The final pedagogical benefit of this interdisciplinary service learning course was a crash course in how to become an authority in both academic and applied settings. Students presented their findings in two very different venues, on campus at the undergraduate research conference and at the CSO. In the weeks leading up to their presentations, students were fearful both about speaking in front of a crowd and about presenting evidence from their field notes. The instructional team offered students a great deal of freedom in structuring their presentations. Although this was initially frustrating for students, they came to appreciate it. In their course evaluations students expressed that they liked “that we had lots of leeway in structuring our presentations” and that they “loved the independence we were given, along with responsibility.”</p>
<p>Despite this freedom, the instructional team required students to substantiate all claims with evidence from their field notes, as well as give several mock presentations, after which they would receive critiques and suggestions from students and instructors. As a result of their careful preparation and practice, students’ presentations at the undergraduate research conference were well attended and well received. The campus presentations attracted an audience of over 75 individuals, and the question-and-answer session following the presentations was spirited and enthusiastic. Even though the presentations were “scary because there were so many people there,” several students reported that the experience helped “me get over my fear of public speaking.” By making claims using their own data, students became authorities on their own experiences at, and research on, the CSO.</p>
<p>The student presentations at the CSO were also well attended. In the end, most student presentations contained suggestions about how to improve services at the CSO but did not critique the organization at all. In their written assessments of student service work, CSO staff members who were not involved with the course lamented that the students had not been more critical in their presentations. One staff member explained to an instructor that “students tried hard to be positive, but they were too positive.” Others said they “wanted more critiques” and were “surprised at the lack of negative stuff in the presentations.” They wanted the students to be more analytical about the limitations of the CSO and what it would take to fix them.</p>
<p>Although the student presentations were not, in the end, greatly useful to the CSO, CSO staff members agreed that the students’ service was a genuine benefit to the organization. Although there was variation in students’ consistency, initiative, and communicativeness, several of the students’ service projects were extremely helpful to the organization. In the year-end assessments, one CSO staff member wrote that “the interviewees were very happy with their experiences and felt that the students were helpful and really listened.” Another CSO staff member concurred, saying that “clients really enjoyed the CAB [meeting] and felt that the students were open and respectful. They felt their input was heard and acknowledged” by the students.</p>
<p>Although the campus presentations were the more successful of the two, both experiences helped the students learn how to speak authoritatively about their own experiences and research. Students’ confidence fielding questions during the second presentations was especially striking. Although still nervous, they answered questions clearly and confidently, and substantiated the claims that audience members questioned.</p>
<p>At the end of the semester, the class met together for a potluck dinner in the backyard of one of the instructors, and in that informal environment, much like a pleasant focus group, the students gave their impressions of the course: what was good and should be kept, and what could be improved. Although some of the students focused on their academic learning in the course, others remarked about how much they had grown personally and professionally during their service learning experience. The overall sentiment of the discussion is best captured by the student who proclaimed that the course was “one of the best, most practical, and necessary courses I ever took!”</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In this article, we have focused on the experiences of students and instructors in an interdisciplinary service learning course on hunger and homelessness, taught by an instructional team composed of sociologists and social workers who were employed by the CSO at which students volunteered. The students’ and instructors’ experience traversing the disciplinary boundaries between social work and sociology in a pedagogical setting provided several interesting surprises.</p>
<p>At the start of the course planning process, we both anticipated that the disciplinary differences in the instructional team would revolve around structural versus individualistic explanations for poverty or macro versus micro levels of analysis. Although important disciplinary differences emerged over time, they were not always what we had anticipated. The sociologists were more interested in hearing about homeless individuals’ experiences, and the social workers were most interested in identifying limitations of the CSO and developing solutions for them.</p>
<p>The other surprise was the notion that what counts as “knowledge” is not the same for sociologists and social workers. The sociologists tended to value abstract knowledge in the social and political structures that cause poverty, as well as phenomenological knowledge in the texture and stories of the lives of the individuals served by the CSO. In contrast, the CSO staff members had both a strong emphasis on instrumental knowledge and different priorities in making knowledge claims.</p>
<p>As discussed above, these disciplinary differences created tensions about how and why students should conduct social research during the class. They also complicated discussions about the purpose and focus of students’ final presentations. However, these disciplinary differences were a significant benefit to the course and the instructional team, as well. First, social workers’ disciplinary training and professional experience was a tremendous asset as students struggled to navigate the multiple roles that they inhabited during their service learning experience. Social workers’ emphasis on solutions helped ground the sociologists in real-world concerns about poverty and homelessness. In turn, sociologists’ more theoretical and abstract approach reminded the social workers of the necessity to look beyond the everyday and provided them with an intellectual respite from the daily grind of service provision.</p>
<p>Although the students saw these differences as interesting, for them the distinction between sociological inquiry and hands-on direct service was less clear and less important. They seemed to come out of the class thinking, “Once you know about the causes of all these social problems (as they had learned in their sociology classes), the natural course of action is to get involved with direct service.” For students, the opportunity to “do something” about all the social problems that they had learned about, was of critical importance.</p>
<p>In these ways, the course capitalized on some of the advantages of interdisciplinary inquiry. The different perspectives about what knowledge is, and what its purpose is, demonstrated that knowledge is not compartmentalized but is transferable and cumulative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092055X11418840">Garkovich 1982</xref>). The close collaboration between the instructional team for this course also promoted “dialogue and community” and strengthened the “problem-posing and problem-solving capacities” of the instructional team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092055X11418840">Klein and Newell 1997</xref>:407). The course would have been impossible without the active participation of the CSO staff members. Their involvement in the nuts and bolts of the course was critical, and their knowledge about the lives and relationships of people who are served by poverty CSOs enriched the sociologists’ understanding of poverty and homelessness.</p>
<p>The one advantage of interdisciplinary inquiry that this course did not realize is the ability to redefine “traditional roles” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0092055X11418840">Klein and Newell 1997</xref>:407). Because of limited time, clients were less integrated into the CAB and research design than PAR enthusiasts would recommend. As a result, the course did not significantly challenge the traditional power relationship of researcher/subject and service provider/client. By the end of the course it was clear that the “participants” in the PAR project were the social workers on the instructional team. The CSO staff members set the research question, provided entrée, defined the issues, and took ownership of the results, in collaboration with the sociologists. We would recommend that other sociologists engaged in PAR and/or interdisciplinary service learning correct this shortcoming in their courses.</p>
<p>This article also provides insight into the challenges of interdisciplinary inquiry. The course planning process clearly demonstrated that instructional team members may not share tacit values and assumptions, theories and methodologies, epistemologies, and notions of adequate proof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0092055X11418840">Lélé and Norgaard 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0092055X11418840">Schoenberger 2001</xref>). The instructional team spent many hours devising a common vocabulary of sociological and social work terms, concepts, and concerns. In the end, the course sessions on research skills represented a compromise between the two disciplinary perspectives. We would encourage other interdisciplinary instructional teams to take the time to identify the tactic values, theories, and methodologies of both disciplines. Although the process was taxing, it was also a great benefit to members of the instructional team. At the conclusion of the course, sociologists on the instructional team knew a great deal more about social work than they had before the course, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The instructional team contended with an additional set of challenges of interdisciplinary inquiry: practical problems, such as time scheduling, keeping all team members up to speed on project developments, changes in personnel, and building trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0092055X11418840">Suarez-Balcazar et al. 2006</xref>). Interdisciplinary teaching, like all good teaching, takes work. It also requires that all members of the instructional team share a common vision, set realistic goals, set aside insignificant differences, and celebrate success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0092055X11418840">Long 2001</xref>). During the 14 months that it worked together, the instructional team developed several elements of a productive working relationship, including open, honest, and frequent communication. This was a time-consuming process, and not one that is generally available to instructors in liberal arts colleges; we had four instructors, community partners who gave us free reign to conduct research, a small grant from the university that offset research costs, a highly motivated group of students, and the ability to teach as an overload. Although time and resource intensive, the long and regular communication among the members of the instructional team ensured the development of honest, trusting, and productive relationships.</p>
<p>By examining the experiences of the instructors, students, and CSO staff members in an interdisciplinary service learning course, we demonstrate that experiential learning has value beyond providing students hands-on experiences with populations and policies. We argue that service learning courses can also provide a laboratory for exploring the similarities and differences between sociology, social work, and other disciplines. Most important, we learned to our delight that defining “interdisciplinary” as including students and community members as research and instructional colleagues enhances the collaborative relationship between academic disciplines. The students themselves reshaped the course through their active participation and emerged with benefits beyond those they could get in the traditional seats-in-chairs disciplinary schoolroom: They learned to “do something” about social problems, explore postcollege careers, and experience professional roles. Several continue to volunteer their time as undergraduates and plan to explore professional work in community service. They have gained maturity, resilience, and an ability to see the world with wider eyes.</p>

<ack><p>Neither this article nor the course it analyzes would have been possible without the insight, support, and help of several colleagues. We extend our warm thanks and appreciation to our collaborators in the class: Tessa Johnson, Niraja Golightly, and Nathan Hoyme. We learned a great deal from them, not only about social work and PAR but about collaboration, generosity, and collegiality. We also owe a great debt to Andrea Vernon, director of the Office for Civic Engagement at the University of Montana, for her wise counsel about the design of service learning courses, her financial assistance for the research conducted by our students, and her ongoing enthusiasm and support for our course. Finally, we want to thank the students, whose energy and enthusiasm, brilliant insights, and fearlessness continue to be an inspiration to us.</p></ack>
