<abstract>
<p>The Mekong Delta is the agricultural heart of Vietnam and home to nearly 20 million people. Its contributions to the entire country and global food consumers are enormous. The Delta’s delicate ecosystem, however, is distressed by several domestic and regional forces, including rural development, resource mismanagement, upstream damming, climate change, and failure to implement policies to link several systems. The authors examine trends and forces affecting the Delta and offer plausible adjustments to enhance the watershed’s well-being. Solutions will come from scale economies; higher value crops and branding; improvements to marketing channels, technologies to improve data collection and analysis, crop yields, and communication; foreign and domestic investment; and integrative policies to sustain Vietnam’s southern Delta and the entire Mekong Basin.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The Mekong Delta is the center for agriculture in Vietnam, which, despite ambitious development plans and numerous successes to date, still has half of its workforce in agriculture and fisheries. The Delta, with a fifth of national population, provides half the rice and three-quarters or more of the fish, shrimp, and fruit produced in Vietnam. It is a largely rural area with low levels of education. Most land is barely above sea level. Its soils include acid sulfate and saline soils that benefit from the washing effects of monsoon floods, allowing high yields of rice. While there is a continuing transition out of agriculture, more than half of the labor force was still engaged in agriculture in 2007. Rice area has declined slightly in the last decade though increasing yields have allowed slow increases in rice output. Fish and shrimp production has grown rapidly, partly at the expense of rapidly shrinking coastal mangrove forest. Both dry season rice and fish/shrimp use fresh water supplies and these are typically provided from groundwater—and river water when it is not too salty. Improving infrastructure is allowing an expansion of manufacturing south from Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), but agriculture will remain a major part of the economy for the foreseeable future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0276146711426433">General Statistics Office of Vietnam 2009</xref>)<sup>

<title>Three Threats to Agriculture in the Mekong Delta</title>
<p>The Delta faces a number of environmental challenges that threaten its agriculture, regional stability in the South, and the food security of Vietnam. Taken with challenges to other rice and food growing areas in South and Southeast Asia, there could even be an impact on the world rice price.</p>
<p>The first environmental threat is home grown: groundwater from a million wells is being pumped at the rate of 1 million cubic meters a day. This is well above the recharge rate and as a result the groundwater levels have already fallen twelve to fifteen meters. One expert predicted in 2009 that Can Tho’s water supply would dry up entirely by 2014.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0276146711426433">2</xref>
</sup> In any case, saline intrusion (salty water seeping into fresh water wells) and sinking ground levels are occurring now. Without regulation and reduction in the extraction of groundwater, dry season crops and much aquaculture will be either more expensive or impossible, at least using current technology.</p>
<p>A second and external threat comes from changes in river flows from upstream dams. While the Chinese dams are the most immediate concern, significant planned building of dams in Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia are also likely to be troublesome. The number, size, and management of these dams will determine their impact on the Mekong river and Delta. Beneficial flooding and silt deposition will likely be curtailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0276146711426433">Osborne 2009</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0276146711426433">3</xref>
</sup> It is possible that dry season flows would be increased, though this also depends on whether water from the reservoirs will be diverted for irrigation and other uses. Reduced flooding and silt deposition will hurt the productivity of acid sulfate and saline soils that account for over half the area of the Delta. When there is drought, as is the case in 2010, the role of dams is not clear. The Chinese claim that their dams have a negligible or even positive impact, but they have released too little data to confirm or refute this assertion. If dry season flows are reduced due to water storage or diversion, then saline intrusion will be greater as has been observed in 2010, when salty water made its way more than 70 km upriver, 40 percent of the total distance from the sea to Cambodia. This creates major pressures on both rice and fish production.</p>
<p>The third challenge is a global one: climate change. This has several aspects. The most obvious is increasing carbon dioxide levels, which actually improve rice yields, and rising temperature levels which reduce yields.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0276146711426433">4</xref>
</sup> Global sea levels are eventually expected to rise as well, by one-half to one meter by the end of this century, although subsiding ground levels may make the Delta sea level intrusion higher and faster. A one meter sea level rise would flood half of all rice land in the Delta. Weather patterns are already becoming more erratic, with more frequent intense flooding, longer dry seasons, and the appearance of typhoons in areas that had not experienced them. One analysis predicts that 14 million people in the Delta will be subject to intense flooding. These extreme floods are different from the normal and beneficial seasonal floods. There will also be less rain overall and hotter and more variable temperatures and rainfall—all hurting rice output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0276146711426433">Asian Disaster Preparedness Center 2003</xref>). Irregular rainfall and extreme temperatures will complicate rice growing and even rice/shrimp systems that tolerate only limited seasonal salinity.</p>
<p>The interaction of depleted groundwater, disrupted river flows, and global warming could combine to present major shocks to the rice and fish production system in the Delta. More work is needed to define the pace and scope of these threats and then further analysis to determine the degree to which they interact and reinforce each other. It is possible that major problems will emerge within a few years.</p>
<p>The droughts of 2002 and 2010 were sufficiently severe to produce salinity intrusions of 70 km from the coast, hitting hundreds of thousands of hectares and costing hundreds of millions of dollars in reduced output. These droughts, as well as destructive sporadic floods and storms, are likely to become more common. Combined with reduced soil productivity due to lower normal yearly floods, this would depress average output per hectare—farming would become both less profitable and more risky. This would normally mean that farm sizes would increase in order to maintain income per farmer. In addition, larger farmers are typically better capitalized and able to endure the higher volatility in returns. There may also be an increase in small vegetable and fruit farms run by part-time farmers who also find other (nonfarm) sources of income. Smaller fruit and vegetable farms could use drip irrigation and raised beds to avoid some of the water and salinity problems that field crops would face. If marketing were improved, the earnings per hectare would also be much higher than with rice.</p>
<p>The impact of these three shocks on fish and shrimp raising and fish capture are also likely to be of economic importance. It is not generally appreciated that capture fisheries account for two-third of the Mekong Basin’s fish production, with reservoir fish accounting for a tenth and fish and shrimp ponds less than a quarter of the total output by weight. The total value of all fish production in the entire basin has been estimated to be $1.4 to $3 billion. Fishery specialists fear that dams will destroy the habitat of many migratory species and reduce overall fish production, while also reducing nutritional intake of protein for tens of millions of river inhabitants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0276146711426433">Baran and Myschowoda 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0276146711426433">World Wildlife Fund 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0276146711426433">
<title>Implications and Responses</title>
<p>The potential for both short- and medium-term disruption of the Mekong Delta economy is clear, though more research is needed to understand the speed and extent of any damage. A major question for policy analysts and leaders is if much can be done to minimize the economic impact and/or help people adjust if the impacts cannot be avoided. The menu of possible responses is complex. Some efforts would focus on reestablishing mangrove and melaleuca forests, as these would protect against typhoon damage and reduce acid sulfate leaching. Others advocate the building of reservoirs to store water and recharge groundwater, though the flat topography of the Delta makes large water storage expensive. Some officials prefer building dykes to keep out salt water, but these same barriers may keep in acid water and interfere with normal and beneficial flooding, and the construction costs would be very high. Developing better rice varieties, including higher yielding floating rice, shorter season rice, and salt-tolerant rice varieties would give farmers more flexibility in responding to more challenging conditions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, as much as 5 percent to 10 percent of <italic>all</italic> Vietnamese may be forced to move from or within the Mekong Delta due to these pressures—that would be a quarter to a half of the total Delta population! There has already been an increasing level of net outmigration from the Delta in the last decade, with net outmigration in 2007 amounting to 80,000 people or nearly ½ of 1 percent of total population, double the ratio of 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0276146711426433">Duong 2009</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0276146711426433">5</xref>
</sup> In the same time period, the share of labor in agriculture in the Delta fell from 62 percent to 52 percent. This is a very fast rate of structural change and is faster than the national average. Most migrants move to HCMC or nearby provinces. However, a movement of 80,000 a year is one thing. A movement of hundreds of thousands a year would be quite another. Even if migration <italic>tripled</italic> to a quarter million a year, it would take twenty years to decrease population by five million, or roughly a quarter of total Delta population. It is by no means clear that HCMC could absorb nearly so many people, but if agricultural productivity plunged in the next five years, then twenty years might be too long a period for farmers to switch.</p>
<p>If typhoons begin to strike the Delta more often, as some experts expect, then there also may need to be a shift in the quality of housing for many people. The relatively benign climate has allowed the construction of cheap but not sturdy housing for many families. This is a smart adaptation to the flooding often experienced, as repair is quick and easy. However, if there were a combination of extreme floods and strong winds, then homes would either have to be relocated to higher ground or built on raised pillars or logs—<italic>and</italic> also be built more solidly so as to withstand strong winds. This would impose a considerable additional expense on families, especially poorer ones.</p>
<p>Another implication of these threats is a <italic>global</italic> shortage of rice. It may seem strange that a major world crop would be very much influenced by one part of one river’s troubles. After all, annual rice output exceeds 440 million tons; however, world trade in rice is only 30 million tons and the two largest exporters are Thailand and Vietnam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0276146711426433">Economic Research Service 2011</xref>, 29-30). Together they account for half of global rice exports. Thailand also has troubles with overexploitation of groundwater in its Delta and Myanmar, a potentially large exporter, is having dams built in areas that will also cause harmful changes in river flows. Myanmar typically exports 1 million tons a year or less but has been viewed as an alternative supplier. In any case, if there were a sharp decline in rice exports from both Thailand and Vietnam, it would take some time for other suppliers to develop a supply response. In the meantime, the world rice price could again (as in 2008) exceed $1,000 a ton. This sharp jump in price can cause political problems in many importing nations. Recent floods in Pakistan and China and droughts elsewhere, if repeated, could depress wheat output as well, creating a general shortage of food over a period of several years.</p>
<p>One difficulty in managing an efficient response is that the problem is Delta wide, covering a large area. However, the administrative regions are provincial. It is not easy to develop a unified authority that could establish a single policy on extracting groundwater, recycling waste water from fish ponds, or coordinating cropping decisions or controls on fishing. Without this ability to coordinate or even overrule individual provinces, it will prove almost impossible to develop an effective set of responses.</p>
<p>At the very least, more research could focus on three important opportunities to mitigate many of the aforementioned challenges: salt-tolerant rice and other crop varieties; farming systems and fish/shrimp–rice systems; and ways to reuse waste water from fish ponds so that groundwater pumping is not necessary, or at least reduced. Such research could be funded centrally and as practical techniques are developed or uncovered from surveying current best practices, they can be spread or promoted (easier credit for “doing the right thing,” for example) by local governments. However, it is not clear that these steps will be available or put in place as rapidly as the ecological situation in the Delta is changing. It may also be necessary to speed up the consolidation of farms and the transfer of workers from rural to nonfarm if not urban jobs.</p>
<p>Worker-transfer, however beneficial it may be, also potentially creates a problem, because the educational levels in the Mekong Delta are among the lowest of any region in Vietnam. The availability (until recently) of land and adequate semi-skilled work opportunities made it less urgent to continue schooling—which in any case is weaker in quality than in more urban regions or even along the Central Coast. In 2004, out of 9.3 million economically active people, nearly 8 million or 86 percent were considered unskilled. The ratio for Vietnam less the Delta was 74 percent. The Delta has a relative shortage of those who went to high school (10 percent for the Delta; 23 percent for the rest of Vietnam) and might have difficulty rapidly transforming and shifting its work force. Developing training and apprentice programs to develop skills for adult workers would be necessary if a rapid transfer of workers became necessary. If industry and services require higher skill levels, it might normally be the case that the Delta would have to import rather than export skilled workers, if their own growth rate accelerated outside of agriculture. Or, it might be more likely that such jobs would be created elsewhere.<sup>

<title>The Research Imperative</title>
<p>The University of Can Tho (UCT) is the major research university in the Delta and it has recently been supported by a number of external donors. This has helped UCT develop a group of skilled researchers who are studying aspects of the problems discussed in this note. However, donor money drives the research topics more than do the actual problems. Right now, donor money is focused on climate change, so that is the focus of research. It would be desirable to integrate systemically all three problems and see how they interact, rather than excluding or minimizing two of them. Again, if the Delta had a local voice that represented the general interest of the region, this desirable outcome might be more likely to happen. The Vietnam Chamber of Commerce (VCCI) is one possibility, but some regional group—such as a water management authority—might be more focused and cohesive. Without problem-based research, it is likely that events will outrun knowledge of them.</p>
<p>Without better research, the likelihood of local conflict over cropping/fish raising patterns and water use are likely to increase. Local knowledge about adaptation strategies is limited, and community irrigation capability is not well developed. Most adjustments are at the farm level rather than at the village level or some higher administrative authority. However, these farm level adjustments often include using groundwater—a strategy that is now under threat as the quality, availability, and cost of water becomes less favorable. Improvements in research must be matched by better extension, credit, and even subsidies to farmers who have to adjust to a variety of external shocks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0276146711426433">
<title>Possible Adjustments</title>
<p>Looking forward, it is likely that there will be two types of agriculture/agribusiness that will develop in response to these environmental challenges. Large rice/shrimp or fish farms will be larger than the current average farm, better capitalized, and more like a business than a way of life. The owners will be able to use—and demand to have—technical information about the best investments and techniques to deal with changing ecological conditions. This will mean that the small family farm will shrink in importance, especially the rice farm. However, current land use and ownership rules will have to be modified to allow needed consolidation of farms. While this topic is covered elsewhere in the volume, it would be counterproductive to prohibit uneconomic farmers from voluntarily selling their land use rights so they can get a new start elsewhere.</p>
<p>The other type of farm will be a smaller one, perhaps part-time, that focuses more on higher value crops such as fruits or vegetables. These farms may use raised beds, drip irrigation, and other techniques to coax a cash crop out of small plots and a moderate amount of labor. These farms would respond to growing domestic and potentially global demand and should not be discouraged due to a “rice first” policy. They would also be more labor intensive and provide jobs for those in the workforce without urban skills who might be displaced from the larger farms that can be expected to mechanize to a greater degree. Both types of farms would contribute to social stability, national food security, and help buy time for a further transition in a generation or two to a large nonagricultural economy.</p>
<p>However, smaller producers of fruits and vegetables will need proactive agricultural and agribusiness policies stepped up from current levels. Better selection and distribution of varieties, keyed to market demand, is required. Knowledge of limitations on the use of pesticides to be in conformity with rich market regulations is critical. Larger buyers and wholesalers will have to gather and then distribute this information, working in cooperation with research centers and extension services. Brands of fruits and vegetables that ensure good quality would help penetration of lucrative markets. Such larger and better capitalized buyers could also help to develop post-harvest handling, transport, processing, and shipping that would preserve product freshness and quality. These important steps will not happen spontaneously with small producers who tend to sell to whomsoever comes to their farm or local market and offers a fair price. They will require foreign and/or domestic private investment working with government.</p>
<p>The dramatic progress that Vietnam has made in reducing poverty is real, but it is also fragile. Many of the poor are located just above the poverty level and environmental shocks could push many back down below the poverty level. Unless there is a concerted effort to understand what is happening in the Delta and help farmers and others to adjust, it is likely that the Delta would be viewed as a problem instead of one of the world’s great food baskets and region of plenty.</p>

<p>It is not generally appreciated just how inexpensive desalination is for household and commercial/industrial—though not agricultural use. It costs $0.25 to $0.50 a ton (= 1,000 liters) to desalt water, within the budget of most households in Vietnam who use only about 100–140 liters per capita per day with water piped to the house.</p>

<p>Acid sulfate soils produce harmful chemicals if not kept moist. During the dry season, the soils often dry out and need a normal monsoon flood to flush out harmful chemicals and deposit beneficial silt. The saline soils become salty during the dry season and also need to be washed. Together these soils account for over half of Delta area.</p>

<p>“Coping with Climate Change” in Rice Today, July-September 2007, pp. 11-15. The article states that an increase of CO<sub>2</sub> of 75 ppm will increase rice yields by 0.5 tons/hectare, but an increase of 1 degree Celsius will decrease rice yields by 0.6 tons/hectare. It is actually a bit more complicated since extreme temperatures are also an issue.</p>

<p>However, the Delta has an income level higher than any region except the greater HCMC area and the Red River Delta region. Thus, any migration will either be within the Delta or to HCMC, as very few move north. The Delta is still only 20 percent to 25 percent urban, even though agriculture has fallen to about half of the work force.</p>
