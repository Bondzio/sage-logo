<p>Differences have been the center point in many a discussion. In the musical <italic>Oklahoma</italic>, the “farmers and the cowboys should be friends” was a song and dance routine, in which each side chides the other over the insignificance of their role. The farmers only “push a plow,” whereas the cowboy just “chases a cow!” They receive a scolding from “Aunt Eller” after she shoots her Colt 45 in the air to get their attention! Using the image of a cow, she admonishes them to find common ground. The cowboy chases and ropes the cow, whereas the farmer milks the cow for butter and cheese. Each has a different focus, yet each still contributes to the well-being of all the “folks” living in the Oklahoma territory.</p>
<p>So how does this apply to our organization? As we observe ourselves and our growing membership, we find we are growing more diverse. Our perspectives on a given subject may be in conflict with others. Their interpretation may represent a totally different viewpoint. In the musical, the “farmers” and the “cowboys” realize that while both bring a unique perspective to the table, they find common ground. Together we can find common ground too.</p>
<p>In our community, the Transcultural Nursing Society, we have scholars, inquisitive and knowledgeable academics, and imaginative and innovative clinicians. Each presents a voice, a narrative that is reflective of their lived experience. Visualize a round table, if you will, with representation from each group. Listen to the interchange that ensues. What do you hear? Is there some common theme that weaves throughout this discussion? Are you surprised by the new considerations you hear, new methods of teaching, or new designs for implementing cultural competence in the health care setting? In just that moment we realize we too are on the very brink of something wonderfully new and energizing. What an opportunity to learn and grow!</p>
<p>Suppose we offer just such a venue in which clinicians, scholars, and academics sit together at a round table and have a dialogue about their concerns, challenges, benefits, and victories. At our annual conference we feast on a banquet of diverse knowledge and wisdom. Perhaps then for dessert, we will provide an experience for members to literally sit down for a “round table” discussion, to share their narratives, express their needs, and dream their dream together, envisioning that cultural humility, sensitivity, and competence will be front and center to all those in health care. And only then will the cowgirls and cowboys really dance.</p>
