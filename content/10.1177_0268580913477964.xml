<p>Do we need another book on development? There have been as many dominant theories of development (and post-development and anti-development) as there have been decades since the Second World War, and many more competing, critical and radical theories. In a world in which 2 billion people may lack secure access to food, water, shelter and sanitation, no one can doubt the importance of development. Nonetheless, from an academic standpoint development has been ‘done’ so much and so often that it is difficult to say anything new. We can do little more than recycle old ideas and repackage them for a new generation. Old wine in new bottles.</p> <p>Sometimes, however, the bottle makes all the difference. Samuel Cohn’s <italic>Employment and Development under Globalization</italic> self-consciously recycles James O’Connor’s 1973 classic <italic>The Fiscal Crisis of the State</italic> and repackages it as a theory of development. O’Connor challenged orthodox Marxian views of the role of the state in capitalism, construing the capitalist state as a (somewhat) independent actor that mediates between the demands of the monopoly and competitive sectors of the economy. Writing mainly with regard to the United States, he presciently predicted that monopoly capitalists would avoid taxation by inserting loopholes into the tax code that they could then exploit. The competitive sector would eventually revolt against paying the full burden of taxation, demanding cuts in tax rates. The resulting fiscal crisis of the state would ultimately force the state to cut back on the provision of infrastructure, education and social services.</p> <p>O’Connor’s model of capitalism has understandably come into vogue in the post-2008 era of low taxes on the wealthy combined with austerity for everyone else, but it has mainly been applied to the developed late-capitalist countries of Western Europe and North America. Cohn’s genius is to realize that O’Connorian arguments apply equally well to middle-income countries like Brazil. In a series of studies that long predate the 2008 global financial crisis he shows how O’Connor’s basic premise – that the state is indispensable for capitalist development – applies in a large middle-income country.</p> <p>Interestingly, Cohn does not follow the usual path of showing how the state is important for development in the monopoly sector. Cohn largely ignores the large-scale, attention-grabbing success stories of the Brazilian steel, automobile and soybean industries. He focuses instead on examples from Brazil’s competitive sector: hotels, restaurants, barber shops and beauty salons. Cohn reasons along O’Connorian lines that for a developmental state to avoid fiscal crisis, it must avoid debt financing and concludes that states should make many small, low-risk investments that are almost certain to generate jobs, whether or not they generate national income growth. In taking this approach Cohn turns development thinking on its head: instead of seeking a rising tide to lift all boats, the state should use its limited resources to help fix up and float as many boats as possible.</p> <p>Cohn distinguishes between ‘palliative’ development, by which he means interventions that create jobs and reduce poverty, and ‘transformative’ development, by which he means large-scale economic growth in association with societal transformation and technological change. In a series of case studies he first shows that expensive, large-scale infrastructure – in particular, airports – can promote secondary job creation in a wide variety of service sectors. He also shows that cheap, small-scale infrastructure projects like sewer-building, road improvements and the refurbishment of bus terminals have similar effects. If the goal of government intervention is palliative (poverty alleviation and job creation), projects that promote the generation of large numbers of low-wage hotel and restaurant jobs may be preferable to high-stakes investments in large-scale industry.</p> <p>Especially provocative is Cohn’s analysis of the Brazilian barber and beauty sector. Few development specialists would advocate for vocational education in hair cutting as a strategic investment in a country’s future. Nonetheless, Cohn demonstrates that very modest government investments in teaching hair styling can lift hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty. Importantly, he shows that in most cases such vocational training results in an absolute expansion of the employed workforce, not in the displacement of less-trained workers by more-trained workers. Vocational training also increases the capital utilization of the economy as a whole as otherwise non-productive spaces such as awkward retail locations, private living rooms and building fronts in shantytowns are put to productive use.</p> <p>While Cohn is certainly right to emphasize the importance of job-focused development strategies, he sells short his own advice when he calls the focus of his book ‘palliative’ development. Palliative care in medicine is the treatment of pain and provision of comfort without addressing the root causes of illness. Palliative treatments alleviate; they do not heal. By implication palliative development is in some sense not real improvement but some kind of stopgap measure: while we wait for the factories and the mines we may as well have a few barber shops.</p> <p>Why should the provision of valued services to other people be considered any less important than the production of commodities for sale on the world market? Neoclassical economics long ago embraced the subjective theory of value: things have value if people are willing to pay for them. Cohn’s results show that government investments in barber training can expand the market for hair styling services, leading to more people purchasing more hair services than before the government intervention. From a neoclassical perspective this is value creation. If consumers value hair styling more than some other physical product, who are we to question them? The world and its environment would be much better off if people everywhere shifted from the consumption of things to the consumption of services.</p> <p>To call hair styling ‘palliative’ and steel production ‘transformative’ is to implicitly demean the former and elevate the latter. Cohn clearly means no disrespect to hair styling. Quite the contrary: his work is pathbreaking in highlighting (and quantifying) the importance of small-scale, low-skill industry and the ease with which states can expand employment by supporting it. The problem is that he has not gone far enough. He has not pushed his perspective to the logical conclusion that what he calls palliative development is in fact every bit as transformative in the lives of ordinary people as any other form of development, and perhaps more so. After all, very few Europeans work in high-technology manufacturing. Europe is, nonetheless, for most people a very pleasant place to live.</p> <p>For such a short, expensive book, <italic>Employment and Development under Globalization</italic> is poorly copy-edited. While the ideas expressed in the book are well-developed, there are many indications that the manuscript was not professionally proofread. Considering the high profit margin implicit in a book priced as aggressively as this is, Palgrave should have done a better job in bringing a fully-polished product to market.</p> <p>That said, the ideas expressed and the analyses presented in the book are sufficiently novel to warrant careful study. Cohn is an important development sociologist who has distilled over a decade of fieldwork and statistical analyses into a single programmatic statement. His 10 concluding lessons are a practical, easily applied recipe for sound government policy. If the book doesn’t go far enough in articulating a better way to think about development, it at least goes so far that the broader implications are clear. A major theoretical contribution backed up by a dozen or so empirical case studies, <italic>Employment and Development under Globalization</italic> will certainly be required reading for all future students of development in Brazil. It will also pose provocative challenges to scholars working on problems of development in other middle-income countries around the world.</p>
