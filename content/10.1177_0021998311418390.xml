<abstract>
<p>The objective of this work is to investigate the mechanical properties of [0]<sub>8</sub> woven glass fiber reinforced polyester (GFRP) composites under monotonic and combined tension/bending loading. The results show that the failure of combined test specimen was at its ends, which have zero deflection and maximum bending moment and stress. This behavior agrees with the analytical stress distribution along the specimen length. Adding a tensile load at the ends of woven composite beams that designed to carry pure bending loads, such as bridge decks, can duplicate bending capacity of the beam. The relationship between combined bending moment and tensile load was constructed.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311418390" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Woven carbon fiber is being extensively used in aerospace, automotive, and civil applications, owing to their high specific strength, high fracture toughness, lower production costs, and better control over the thermo–mechanical properties as compared to unidirectional composites. The study of the mechanical properties of such composites is an extremely important area from the scientific and industrial point of view and a better understanding of their behavior under combined loads will ensure the long life of the products.</p>
<p>In many engineering applications, structural members such as shafts, beams, and plates are subjected not only to uniaxial loading but also to multiaxial loading. Flexbeam is a good example that experienced four combined loads. Flexbeam is the link between the helicopter rotor-hub and the blade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311418390">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311418390">4</xref></sup> During flight, the rotor-hub and flexbeam are subjected to constant axial tension load from the centrifugal forces, bending out of the plane of rotation (flap), and bending in the plane of rotation attributable to the lead–lag motion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311418390">2</xref></sup> In addition, the pitching moment applied to the blades result in twisting the flexbeam, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311418390">Figure 1</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311418390">1</xref></sup>

<p>Specimens with non-uniform cross-section, in simple tension test, result in combined tension and bending loads. The deflection and moment distribution can be estimated from beam theory. Single lap joint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311418390">5</xref></sup> and single-strap joint<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311418390">6</xref></sup> in tension are other examples, which exhibit a combined tension and bending loads. The latter is due to the eccentric load path through the joint, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311418390">Figure 2</xref>.
<fig id="fig2-0021998311418390" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Single-strap joint in tension.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311418390-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Krueger et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311418390">7</xref></sup> performed the combined tension/bending tests in axial tension and bending using servohydraulic load frame. The specimens were initially preloaded in load control to an axial tension load of 85% the average damage initiation load determined for the tension test. While maintaining this preload, a transverse bending load was then applied in displacement control until flange debonding occurred. Maximum specimen deflections at the top grip contact point were recorded using a spring loaded linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). Lee and Knauss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311418390">8</xref></sup> carried-out their combined tension/bending tests using two different devices. One of these devices was designed to draw on the tension/torsion capability of a MTS testing machine. The tension is provided by the test machine in the standard fashion, but the torsional mode was translated through an appropriate linkage system into a lateral force for providing the lateral deflection. The accompanying lateral force was recorded by a compression load cell. This device allowed 3-point as well as 4-point bending. In the second technique the tension/bending loads were provided through mounting the specimen eccentrically and subjecting the grips to tension only. The range of the eccentricity ‘e’ varied from −2.5 to 13 mm. By adjusting the off-set, a range of tension/bending combinations is achieved. Similarly, Palmer et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311418390">9</xref></sup> implement the combined tension/bending tests using special test fixture through it the axial loads not only implement the tensile stresses (strains) but also implement the bending stresses (strains) through using offset shims placed between the plane of the specimen and the loading axis to give various eccentricities ‘e’. The latter technique was used in the present work.</p>
<p>Several researchers found that bending strength was greater than tensile strength in polymeric composite materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311418390">9</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311418390">12</xref></sup> Wisnom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311418390">10</xref></sup> reported in his review that the ratios between 3-point bending strength and tensile strength of different composite materials were in the range of 1.3–1.49. Khashaba and Seif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311418390">12</xref></sup> reported that the ratios between the 3-point/tension and 4-point/tension were 1.27 and 1.62, respectively.</p>
<p>The current paper is a continuation of the author's work on the mechanical behavior of woven composites under combined tension/bending loading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311418390">11</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311418390">13</xref></sup> The main objective of the present work is to investigate the mechanical properties of woven glass fiber reinforced polyester (GFRP) composites under monotonic and combined loads. The monotonic loads will be tension, 3-point bending, and 4-point bending, while the combined loads will be tension/bending. The woven composites were manfactured using hand lay-up technique with [0]<sub>8</sub> stacking sequence.</p>

<p>Tension, 3-point bending, 4-point bending, and combined tension/bending tests were carried out on woven GFRP specimens using a universal testing machine (Testometric 200 kN). The crosshead speed of the loading member was 2 mm/min. Twenty-four specimens were used in this work. Twelve of them were tested in tension and bending tests (four specimens for each test). Twelve specimens were tested under combined tension/bending loads (three specimens for each eccentric value). The strength values were determined based on the average values. The load displacement diagrams were printed through the PC of the testing machine.

The results in this table indicate that the actual modulus is about 3.1 times higher than the apparent modulus of elasticity of woven GFRP specimen. The lower value of apparent modulus was due to the compliance (deformation) of the testing machine. In addition, the shear deformation of the adhesive material between the tabs and the specimens, and the micro slip between the tabs and the test specimen may contribute in decreasing the apparent modulus.</p>

The first at the same load level of the knee in the load–deflection diagram of [0/ ± 45/90]<sub>s</sub> specimen (0.35 kN) that owing to the initiation and propagation of matrix cracks in the woven composite (independent to the fiber configuration). The second knee was observed at 0.7 kN that may be owing to the weft fiber–matrix debonding and progressive breaks in the warp fibers. Further increase in the load–deflection curve up to the final failure was observed due to the redistribution of the load between the warp fiber and the matrix. The final failure was nearly catastrophic.

<p>The results show that the [0]<sub>8</sub> composites have higher tensile strength and stiffness than [0/ ± 45/90]<sub>s</sub> composites and vice versa for bending. The value bending strength determined from 4-point bending test is higher than that from the 3-point bending test. Increasing the initial eccentricity leads to increasing the initial displacement in the load–displacement diagram at the start of loading process, decreasing the tensile load at fracture, and increasing the combined bending moment at fracture. At the start of the combined test the bending strains (stress) is more dominant at the specimen midpoint than the tensile stress. Increasing the applied load result in zero bending strains and the tensile stress becomes more dominant. The failure of combined test specimen was at its ends, which have zero deflection and consequently maximum bending moment and stress. This behavior agrees with the analytical stress distribution along the specimen length. The experimental results show that the ratio of the maximum bending moments under combined and 3-point loading ranged from 1.85 to 1.97 for the initial eccentricity ranged from 11.75 to 31.75, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that adding a tensile load at the ends of woven composite beams that is designed to carry pure bending loads, such as bridge decks, will improve the bending capacity of the beam. The initial eccentricity has more significant effect on decreasing the ultimate combined tensile load for [0]<sub>8</sub> specimens than the quasi-isotropic woven GFRP laminate [0/ ± 45/90]<sub>s</sub>. The constructed relationship between combined bending moment and tensile load of [0]<sub>8</sub> specimen tested at different eccentricity values is very important for the designer with woven composite materials subjected to combined loads.</p>
