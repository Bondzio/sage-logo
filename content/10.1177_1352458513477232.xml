<p>Both MS experts have stood by the view that any differences between primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and relapsing remitting - secondary progressive sclerosis (RRMS-SPMS) are attributable to variations in degrees of inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. Accepting that the cause[s] of MS is [are] unknown, it would have been surprising had either neuropathologist adopted a view contrary to classic teaching on MS pathology i.e. an orderly sequence of events beginning with inflammation which results in demyelination and which in some individuals leads to unusually early axonal degeneration with clinical disease progression – so called PPMS.</p>
<p>Had the editor challenged the experts neuropathologists to account for differences between <bold>progressive-onset</bold> and <bold>relapsing-onset</bold> MS the task might have been a little more difficult. Progressive-onset MS with little evidence of blood-brain barrier disruption and scanty evidence of active hemispheric white matter demyelination, but in which critically located spinal pathology is frequently encountered, defies many of the explanations for progression in MS. Such patients are difficult to diagnose as MS and of course in a few instances may have aquaporin-4 related disease.</p>
<p>Both experts agree that these patients may have ongoing diffuse white matter inflammation occurring inside an intact blood-brain barrier i.e. so called compartmentalised inflammation. The problem with compartmentalised inflammation is that it is difficult to demonstrate both radiologically and pathologically. Nevertheless it remains an attractive explanation for tract specific neurodegeneration that may well underpin PPMS. It also provides an escape mechanism for the supporters of inflammation driven neurodegeneration who will argue that the occurrence of inflammation behind the closed blood-brain barrier is reason enough to explain the poor response of PPMS patients to immunomodulatory therapy i.e. the inflammatory process is hidden and inaccessible. But perhaps inflammation behind closed doors has a different trigger - it ought to have if the blood brain barrier is firmly closed!.</p>
<p>There is increasing recognition that low-grade on-going inflammation in NAWM is a major contributor to axonal loss. So-called NAWM may in fact be diffusely abnormal [DAWM] and there is emerging evidence that DAWM may underpin significant neurodegeneration in MS. Some have gone further to suggest that DAWM represents ongoing white matter inflammation which has been triggered by the presence of a primary lipid abnormality in normal white matter i.e. the myelin was never completely normal!.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458513477232">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Any additional role played by ageing in MS related neurodegeneration and progression remains to be determined but it is notable SPMS and PPMS tend to occur at roughly the same older age and thereafter to run the same clinical course. If both SPMS and PPMS have the same pathologic basis then it must be argued that PPMS patients have had ongoing chronic “below the radar” subclinical inflammation occurring diffusely throughout white matter prior to onset of progressive symptoms. But as indicated this type of inflammation may be different to the classical inflammation in MS.</p>
<p>It is the view of this non-expert neuropathologist that progression in MS may occur independently of radiologically visible lesion load and independently of classic peripheral T-cell dependent - macrophage mediated demyelination developing instead as a consequence of central microglial mediated axonal destruction that may in part be triggered by diffuse white matter lipid abnormalities. Over time this alternative pathway in MS pathology may be recognised as separate from and different to the classic MS inflammatory pathway and perhaps more akin to that seen in a progressive neurodegenerative disorder such as PPMS!</p>
