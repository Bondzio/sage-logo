<abstract>
<p>This article describes a case of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency in a 3-year-old boy who presented generalized hypotonia, severe psychomotor development delay, and generalized and partial seizures and was refractory to antiepileptic drugs. After the diagnosis, the patient was put on a ketogenic diet. Six months later, seizure frequency was reduced and psychomotor development had improved. At the same time he presented some side effects, such as 2 episodes of significant increases in cholesterol and triglycerides associated with viral respiratory infections. The latter decreased with a supplementation of ω-3 fatty acids and an increase in caloric intake.</p>

<p>Pyruvate dehydrogenase is a multienzymatic complex that plays a key role in energy metabolism, linking glycolysis to the Krebs cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812436424">1</xref></sup> Indeed, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, located within the mitochondrial matrix, catalyzes the reaction of decarboxylases and the activation of pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A. The latter, combined with oxaloacetate, forms citrate, the primary reactant in the Krebs cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812436424">1</xref></sup> Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency is one of the most common metabolic disorders of lactic acidosis, and it manifests in different neurological phenotypes regarding different age and sex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812436424">2</xref></sup> Most cases of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency are due to mutations in an X-linked PDHA1 gene encoding the E1α subunit of the complex. In a lower percentage of cases, mutations take place in the E1β subunit, inherited as an autosomal-recessive trait.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812436424">1</xref></sup> Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency is a clinically heterogeneous disorder. The main presentations include hypotonia, episodic apnea, convulsions, weak suck, dysmorphic features, lethargy, low birth weight, failure to thrive, psychomotor retardation, ataxia, pyramidal tract and extrapyramidal signs, optic atrophy, peripheral neuropathy, ptosis, dysphagia, deceleration of somatic growth, and cranial nerve palsies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812436424">1</xref></sup> There is a male predominance. The patients usually die before age 8 months, and the neuropathological status includes destructive lesions of the subcortical white matter, basal ganglia, and brainstem. Dismyelination, optic atrophy, hydrocephalus, agenesis of corpus callosum, ectopic olivary nuclei, reactive gliosis, spongy degeneration of the neuropil, neuronal loss, and vascular proliferation represent associated pathological findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812436424">3</xref></sup> Epileptogenesis in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency is linked to energy failure, development of structural brain anomalies, and abnormal neurotransmitter metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812436424">2</xref></sup> A high-fat diet has been recommended as an alternative source of the acetyl coenzyme A since it can provide energy while decreasing intracellular pyruvate and lactate in patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency. Thiamine, lipoic acid, and <sc>l</sc>-carnitine supplementation may be helpful in selected cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812436424">4</xref></sup> The use of ketogenic diet bypasses the metabolic block by providing a direct source of acetyl coenzyme A, leading to amelioration of some symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812436424">2</xref></sup> The ketogenic diet is composed of 80% fat, 15% protein, and 5% carbohydrate, and the ratio of fats to carbohydrates and proteins combined ranges from 2:1 to 4:1. Most of the fat in a classic ketogenic diet is provided as long-chain triglycerides, and the calories constitute about 80% of the estimated dietary requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812436424">5</xref></sup> After the initiation of the ketogenic diet, the calories and ratio are adjusted to maintain the ideal body weight and maximal urinary ketosis for seizure control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812436424">6</xref></sup> Several studies report a reduction in seizure frequency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812436424">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812436424">6</xref></sup> as well as developmental progress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812436424">7</xref></sup> Most of the side effects from ketogenic diet are related to energy and nutrient deficiencies. Lack of proteins, carbohydrates, and other nutrients can result in a lack of weight gain and growth inhibition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812436424">6</xref></sup> In addition, dyslipidemia is reported in many cases—in particular, slight and temporary hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812436424">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812436424">8</xref>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>This case study regards a 3-year-old boy who was born full term by vaginal delivery after a pregnancy threatened by a preterm delivery. Generalized seizures—characterized by spasms in clusters of limbs and trunk, followed by crying—were observed at the age of 3 months. A few days after the onset of infantile spasms, partial seizures appeared, starting in the left hemisphere. The epileptic seizures were treated with various antiepileptic drugs, such as vigabatrin, valproic acid, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, corticotropin, and lamotrigine, but none led to seizure control. The electroencephalogram showed the typical pattern of hypsarrhythmia.</p>
<p>Neurological examination showed generalized hypotonia and a severe psychomotor delay. Until the age of 2 years, the child was unable to control his head, sit, or grasp objects.</p>
<p>Metabolic investigations showed only lactic acidosis and a slight increase of the lactate–pyruvate ratio and urinary amino acids, in particular alanine and lysine.</p>
<p>The first neuroimaging, performed at the age of 2 years, did not show any abnormalities of cortical development and myelination. Four months later, follow-up brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with spectroscopic study, showed a pattern characterized by a poor progression of myelination of subcortical and periventricular white matter and a mild axonal injury. A moderate accumulation of lactate was present around the lateral ventricles.</p>
<p>Muscle and skin biopsies for respiratory chain and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex study evidenced a decreased activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme. Genetic analyses were performed but did not reveal any known mutations of the gene for pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency on the X chromosome.</p>
<p>At the time of diagnosis, the patient was 2½ years old. He started the classic ketogenic diet (3:1) for the treatment of epilepsy in association with other antiepileptic drugs (topiramate, oxcarbazepine, vigabatrin). The child became seizure-free 6 months after the introduction of the diet without any further antiepileptic drugs change. The electroencephalogram did not show a pattern of hypsarrhythmia, only a general slowdown. Moreover, the usual neurological examination, following the introduction of the ketogenic diet, showed improvements in generalized hypotonia and motor development (control of head and trunk, attempt to grasp objects, and ability to roll over) as well as progress in his relationship with the environment (smiling, visual tracking, and vocalizing).</p>
<p>The patient has been on diet therapy for almost 3 years and has presented a poor weight gain (only 5 kg in 3 years). In the same time, an increase of cholesterol and triglycerides levels has been detected. In particular, we marked 2 significant peaks of triglycerides (up to 3907 mg/dL initially and up to 4429 mg/dL later [normal value &lt;180 mg/dL]) and cholesterol (458 mg/dL and 482 mg/dL [normal value &lt; 200 mg/dL]), both episodes occurring during viral respiratory infections. We decided to increase the caloric intake and to administer a supplement of ω-3 fatty acids (500 mg of polyunsaturated fatty acids), which was stopped between the 2 peaks and then administered in the chronic treatment. After a very short period of time (7-10 days), values of triglycerides and cholesterol significantly decreased, although they were still above the normal range. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812436424">Figure 1</xref>, we show the trend of the values of triglycerides and cholesterol from the beginning of the ketogenic diet until November 2011.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is a mitochondrial disease due to mutations of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, defined as a multienzymatic complex that catalyzes the key reaction of aerobic oxidation of glucose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812436424">1</xref></sup> Deficiencies of this latter complex are a common cause of lactic acidemia. The clinical presentation is extremely variable and includes severe neonatal or infantile onset. The ketogenic diet is a suitable option for children with intractable epilepsy who use multiple antiepileptic drugs. The diet should be considered a first-line therapy for pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812436424">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812436424">6</xref></sup> Indeed, a ketogenic diet is able to bypass the metabolic block by providing a direct source of acetyl coenzyme A, leading to amelioration of some symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812436424">2</xref></sup> As literature reports,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812436424">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812436424">6</xref></sup> the ketogenic diet is considered an add-on treatment for children affected by severe epileptic syndrome who are refractory to multiple drug therapy; in most cases, the ketogenic diet can lead to an early and significant seizure reduction. However, the ketogenic diet can induce some side effects, particularly related to energy and nutrient deficiencies, which can result in lack of weight gain and growth; moreover, plasma levels of lipids tend to increase slightly and temporarily.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812436424">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812436424">10</xref></sup> In our case, despite literature data, a very significant increase of triglycerides and cholesterol levels during viral respiratory infections was a notable side effect of the ketogenic diet. The values significantly decreased immediately after the administration of ω-3 fatty acids and an increase of caloric intake. No more peaks of fats have occurred since the patient has been in chronic treatment with fatty acids, keeping a correct caloric intake. This effect might be explained by the fact that during acute infections, it is necessary to increase the energy metabolism. This could be more complex in patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency given the specific deficits associated with the disease. In addition, the low-calorie ketogenic diet might worsen the clinical course in the presence of an increased requirement for energy with an excessive mobilization of fat. Therefore, with this case report, we underline the efficacy of ketogenic diet in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency. Moreover, in patients on the ketogenic diet—with or without pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency—we recommend periodically monitoring triglycerides and cholesterol values, especially during acute illness. We emphasize the importance of sufficient caloric intake for patients on the ketogenic diet in order to avoid inhibition of growth and the risk of energy shortfall. Finally, in cases of excessive plasma levels of lipids, we suggest supplementing with ω-3 fatty acids and increasing the quantity and/or portions of meals to increase the total daily calories.</p>
