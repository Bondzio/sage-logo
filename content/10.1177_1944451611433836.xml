<p><italic>Background</italic>. Endotracheal intubation frequently causes laryngeal injury, including edema, ulceration, and vocal cord immobility. These problems can complicate the immediate postextubation course. <italic>Methods</italic>. The authors measured the cuff leak and made bedside assessment of the voice in 51 patients requiring mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure. <italic>Results</italic>. The median tidal volume was 450 mL (range = 300-600 mL). The median duration of ventilation was 3 days (range = 0-19 days). The median cuff leak was 180 mL (range = −33 to 460 mL); the median percentage cuff leak was 40.9% (range = −7.75% to 99.2%). Women had significantly smaller cuff leaks (18.6% of tidal volume vs 50.3% in men, <italic>P</italic> = .01). Patients with hoarseness frequently had smaller cuff leaks (median 24.1% vs. 46.7% in nonhoarse patients). Eleven patients (84.6%, 11/13) with a cuff leak &lt;15% had hoarseness; 14 patients (14/38) with a cuff leak &gt;15% had hoarseness (<italic>P</italic> = .01).

</p>
<p>Endotracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation causes laryngeal injuries in 70% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451611433836">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451611433836">2</xref></sup> These injuries include edema, ulceration, granulation tissue formation, and vocal cord immobility and can lead to alterations in voice, deglutition, and upper airway dimensions. The latter situation has the potential to cause acute upper airway obstruction after extubation. These laryngeal problems usually resolve over time but can lead to important short-term postextubation difficulties, such as poor communication, dysphagia and poor oral intake, and persistent respiratory distress. Cuff leak tests have been used to predict postextubation stridor and reintubation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451611433836">3</xref></sup> However, these events occur relatively infrequently, and the overall utility of this test is uncertain. Abnormal cuff leak tests also predict laryngeal edema, which may interfere with upper airway functions, such as voice and swallowing, even if there is no respiratory distress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451611433836">4</xref></sup> We studied adult patients in a medical ICU who were recovering from acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation to determine whether or not there was an association between an altered voice postextubation and an abnormal cuff leak test.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-1944451611433836">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>We conducted a prospective study of patients admitted to the medical ICU with acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Most patients in this unit are managed with assist control ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy. Standard protocols include daily sedation withdrawal and measurement of the cuff pressure every 12 hours. The cuff pressure goals are 20 mm Hg or less. Patients with consistently higher pressures are discussed with the ICU team. Patients were enrolled in the study when they were being evaluated for extubation and one of the investigators was available. This study was approved by the institutional review board at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock, Texas, and patients or family members gave written and informed consent. We collected demographic information (age, gender), medical information (diagnosis and use of steroids for underlying diagnosis), and information related to weaning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1944451611433836">
<title>Measurements</title>
<p>The usual approach to extubation in our medical ICU involves a spontaneous breathing trial using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP; 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) with pressure support (5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O above the CPAP level) for 30 to 120 minutes. Weaning parameters (maximum negative inspiratory force, forced vital capacity, and rapid shallow breathing index) are obtained before extubation. Cuff leak measurements for this study were made by the respiratory therapist on duty with the patient on an assist/control mode of ventilation with a tidal volume in the ranges of 6 to 8 mL/kg ideal body weight. The inspired tidal volume was measured for 6 breaths with the cuff inflated, and the mean was calculated. The expired tidal volume was measured for 6 breaths with the cuff deflated, and the lowest 3 values were used to calculate the mean. The investigators did not supervise the respiratory therapy staff during these measurements. The absolute cuff leak difference was calculated as the difference between the mean inspired and mean expired tidal volume. The cuff leak percentage was calculated using the difference between mean inspired and mean expired tidal volumes divided by the inspired tidal volume. We defined the presence of cuff leak (negative test) as a leak more than15% based on previous studies which identified cuff leaks in the range of 10% to 18% as a cutoff value from clinical studies evaluating the utility of cuff leak measurements for safe extubation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451611433836">2</xref></sup> The patients were assessed for stridor and the voice quality between 30 and 60 minutes postextubation. Stridor was defined as an audible high-pitched inspiratory wheeze best heard over the larynx. These patients were treated with racemic epinephrine. Hoarseness was defined as a breathy, husky, rough, or raspy voice. A weak voice was defined as a voice with a low volume or amplitude but a normal pitch. Extubation failure was defined as reintubation within 24 hours of extubation. The investigators had access to the weaning data during this assessment if requested.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>This study included 51 patients (31 men, 20 women) with a median age of 56 years (range = 18-84 years). The indications for intubation and mechanical ventilation included angioedema (n = 2), pulmonary disease with respiratory failure (n = 27), and others (n = 22). The median tidal volume was 450 mL (range = 300 to 600 mL). The median tidal volume per kg ideal body weight was 6.4 mL (range = 4.1-9.1 mL). The median endotracheal tube size was 7.5 mm (range = 6.5 to 8 mm). Five patients (9.8%) had had a prior extubation. The median duration of ventilation was 3 days (range = 0-19 days). The median cuff leak was 180 mL (range = −33 to 460 mL); the median percent cuff leak was 40.9% (range = −7.75% to 99.2%). Cuff leak measurements calculated as percentage of tidal volumes in the various subgroups are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1944451611433836">Table 1</xref>. Women more frequently had low cuff leak volumes but age, duration of ventilation, and steroid use did not influence cuff leak percentage.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that patients with hoarseness following extubation for mechanical ventilation have lower cuff leak volumes and a lower cuff leak percentage. These patients are more likely to be classified as abnormal using the 15% cutoff. This observation provides important information to the clinicians, since hoarseness likely reflects laryngeal edema and/or other laryngeal injuries associated with endotracheal tubes. These patients are at risk for acute postextubation problems related to the larynx and pharynx, including hoarseness and poor communication, dysphagia and poor oral intake, and stridor and upper airway obstruction after extubation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451611433836">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451611433836">7</xref></sup> These laryngeal injuries typically heal without intervention. However, some patients are at risk for severe injury resulting in glottic stenosis and upper airway obstruction. Consequently, the simple assessment of voice following extubation provides useful classification for these patients. We used bedside assessment in this study to evaluate voice. Hoarseness can also be characterized by acoustical methods, which provide objective criteria and potentially more detail about laryngeal injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451611433836">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451611433836">9</xref></sup> Patients with hoarseness need more frequent observation and attention to possible complications. Patients with normal voices usually communicate better and swallow safely. The development of chronic dyspnea in patients with normal voices likely represents tracheal stenosis rather than persistent laryngeal injury.</p>
<p>Voice production requires coordination between the respiratory system and the neuromuscular system. The pulmonary system provides the energy necessary for voice production through exhalation and influences voice quality. Vibration of vocal folds creates audible sounds and consequently speech units. Important vocal parameters include pitch, intensity, and cycle variations. Changes in these parameters change voice quality and often cause hoarseness. Intubation with general anesthesia can alter both laryngeal structures and extralaryngeal structures. Maruyama et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451611433836">10</xref></sup> prospectively studied 418 surgical patients who were managed with endotracheal intubation and intravenous anesthesia only. These patients reported sore throat (50%) and hoarseness (55%) immediately after surgery. These symptoms were more frequent in women and were resolved within 24 hours. Hamdan et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451611433836">11</xref></sup> studied 35 patients following tracheal intubation for surgical procedures. Patients noted hoarseness, vocal fatigue, loss of voice, and throat pain immediately following surgery. These patients also had acoustical analysis of voice with the following maneuvers: Fundamental frequency and related measurements were determined by asking the patients to say “ah” for 2 seconds; the habitual pitch was determined by asking the patient to count to 10; and the maximum phonation time was determined by asking the patient to take a deep breath and sustain phonation as long as possible. Maximum phonation time decreased following extubation and habitual pitch increased following extubation. They concluded that these changes reflected both laryngeal and extralaryngeal factors. The most important endotracheal tube parameters were the cuff pressure and volume. Sellery et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451611433836">12</xref></sup> studied late complications of prolonged tracheal intubation using questionnaires. They found that most patients who required intubation for 7 or more days had difficulty talking (9 out of 17). Three of these patients also had difficulty swallowing. Colice et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451611433836">13</xref></sup> performed direct laryngoscopy on 82 patients who required intubation for more than 4 days. In all, 94% of these patients had laryngeal damage which included mucosal ulcerations along the posterior media aspects of both vocal cords and varying degrees of laryngeal edema. Significant improvement in the laryngoscopic findings occurred within four weeks. Tadié et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451611433836">1</xref></sup> also noted significant postintubation laryngeal injury in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Samuelson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451611433836">14</xref></sup> did a perspective study of 250 intubated mechanically ventilated adults. These patients were interviewed 5 days and 2 months following discharge from the ICU. In all, 46% of the patients noted moderate to severe discomfort 5 days postdischarge from the ICU. These symptoms include hoarseness, sore throat, and voice change. A total of 23% of these patients had persistent symptoms at 2 months. These studies all demonstrate that both short- and long-term endotracheal intubation can cause laryngeal dysfunction. Long-term intubation causes laryngeal injury, which in turn causes changes in voice quality; patients with reduced cuff leaks in our study had more frequent hoarseness. This likely causes some distress in some patients since they may not understand the origin of their voice change and they have reduced the quality of communication. These outcomes, even if short-lived, may have important consequences during the early post-ICU rehabilitation process. These concerns need more study in the ICU patient. For example, would voice education and rehabilitation improve the overall rehabilitation process?</p>
<p>This study also provides information about typical cuff leak results in patients who were ventilated with smaller tidal volumes. The tidal volumes in this study were in the range of 6 to 7 mL/kg ideal body weight and are lower than the volumes used in earlier studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451611433836">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451611433836">3</xref></sup> Women were more likely to have small cuff leak volumes. The number of days of intubation and steroid use for underlying lung disease did not influence cuff leak volumes. Only 4 patients in this study had postextubation stridor, and these patients all had normal cuff leak percentages. These patients may have had laryngospasm secondary to manipulation of the larynx at the time of extubation rather than laryngeal edema and responded to racemic epinephrine. Only 1 patient required reintubation, and consequently the cuff leak information did not allow any conclusions about reintubation in this cohort. However, this study involved a relatively small number of patients, which limits its power to detect postextubation problems. For example, a larger study could provide more information about the use of corticosteroids and cuff leak volumes during episodes of respiratory failure.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We suggest that the management of patients with scheduled extubation should include cuff leak measurements. Patients with small cuff leak percentages (≤15% of tidal volume) should be evaluated carefully for postextubation stridor and the need for urgent reintubation. Our study demonstrates that patients with low cuff leak volumes often have hoarseness. They need attention to the quality of their voice and communication and possibly to the safety of their swallowing and adequacy of overall oral intake.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1944451611433836">15</xref></sup> These factors can influence recovery from acute respiratory failure and need attention to facilitate the patient’s transition to general medical floors and/or outpatient care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1944451611433836">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1944451611433836">17</xref></sup></p>
