<p>With the publication of <italic>The Fugitive in Flight: Faith Liberalism, and Law in a Classic TV Show</italic>, literary theorist Stanley Fish provides a template for how to analyze a film or television program and how to engage readers unfamiliar with the text.</p>
<p>The story of Dr. Richard Kimble enjoys universal significance, appealing to anyone who has been falsely accused of wrongdoing. Convicted of murder, Kimble sets out on a pilgrimage to prove his innocence, and as he flees from law enforcement officials, he meets a series of strangers. With attentive engagement and quiet wisdom, he transforms their lives.</p>
<p><italic>The Fugitive</italic> (1963-1967, ABC) became an iconic text for a younger generation when the film starring Harrison Ford was released in 1993. Fish distinguishes the television series from the film by the same name, and although he appreciates each of them for different reasons, he considers the television program one of the most compelling and intelligent texts in American media history.</p>
<p>Well known as a <italic>New York Times</italic> contributor, Fish polarizes readers with opinions about everything from the role of the American university, to the contributions of George Herbert and John Milton, to the place of theory in legal, literary, and political studies. The Davidson-Kahn Distinguished University Professor of Humanities and Law at Florida International University in Miami, Fish also is dean emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and a former visiting professor at The John Marshall Law School. These roles in the American academy highlight Fish’s dual interest in legal issues and literary study and help to account for his devotion to the 1960s saga of a man without a place to call home. Often described as a reader-response critic, Fish here turns his gaze to popular culture; instead of addressing interpretive communities and reading norms, he introduces <italic>The Fugitive</italic> as a seminal text that provides a self-reflexive experience for the reader.</p>
<p>Dedicated to creator Roy Huggins and actor David Janssen, who played Kimble, <italic>The Fugitive in Flight</italic> is composed of three chapters and an index of episodes. An exercise in aesthetic criticism, Part 1 is entitled “Why <italic>The Fugitive?</italic>” Part 2, “The Fugitive Stands Alone: Morality in Black and White,” provides analysis of some of the most representative episodes. Part 3, “Fugitive Variations,” introduces the reader to the television show’s creative and historical context. Extended tributes in both the introduction and conclusion reveal Fish’s admiration for Huggins, whom he describes as an ardent intellectual fascinated by the American “preoccupation with guilt and salvation.”</p>
<p>Fish acknowledges his own appreciation for popular culture and makes it clear that he both admires the series and enjoys television in general; in fact, he confesses that he often writes while listening to television programming: “I don’t use television as background noise,” he states. “I pay a certain low level of attention all the time, and I pay undiluted attention some of the time.”</p>
<p>In the 1990s when the Arts and Entertainment Network aired reruns of <italic>The Fugitive</italic> twice a day, Fish became enthralled with the series, partly because of what he calls the “film noir style—black-and-white images of bleak, usually interior scenes populated by men, women, and children with anxious and furtive looks on their faces,” and partly because of the “combination of nonstop tension with the (relative) absence of slam-bang action.”</p>
<p>Often an intellectual provocateur, Fish pushes the boundaries of textual criticism and educational process in much of his earlier research. Here, however, he is drawn to a television text and simply wants to explain its appeal to himself and to his readers. He suggests in <italic>The Fugitive in Flight</italic> that Kimble is a moral force, a catalyst in the lives of those whom he encounters; that he does not evolve (or devolve) as a character; and that he functions as a catalyst, making it possible for others to change. Fish writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is Kimble’s steadfastness—his capacity for enduring the dangers and trials of a life on the run without undergoing any transformation, positive or negative—that anchors the series, and provides the still center around which various forces of disorder swirl.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The television series succeeds because of its reliance upon a moral center, its celebration of authentic liberalism, and its focus upon internal crises of conscience. First, like the great works of literature that Fish has studied for forty-five years, <italic>The Fugitive</italic> has a “moral structure” that imitates “theology’s preoccupation with primary values and the awful consequences of falling away from them,” he argues. Many of the plots that Fish summarizes in the second section of <italic>The Fugitive in Flight</italic> rely upon what he describes as secular or religious faith. Fish often focuses upon Kimble’s journey as he “leads the blind to see.”</p>
<p>Second, describing true liberalism as “freedom from attachments that own you and circumscribe your will,” Fish celebrates Richard Kimble because he maintains an authentic and consistent self. Because Kimble does not change, he embodies a purity of spirit upon which other characters rely.</p>
<p>Finally, Fish’s devotion to the series is tied to its deceptively simple plot line: a detective pursues an innocent man for murder and might at any time divest that man of his freedom, and the fugitive from the law encounters people who need his help. Fish suggests that viewers are drawn to the “interplay between characters”; their conversations reveal the “psychological demons that drive people to acts of aggression and self-destruction.” The psychological tensions between characters help to explain the popularity of the television program and, according to Fish, make it impossible to stop watching: “No one in <italic>The Fugitive</italic> ever relaxes, and as you watch you can’t relax either, even though for long stretches absolutely nothing happens.”</p>
<p>At minimum, those unfamiliar with <italic>The Fugitive</italic> will appreciate Fish’s bright prose and his guide to how to write an extended study about a media text. At most, they will be drawn to provocative themes, including the illumination of faith, independence, justice, liberalism, and personal integrity. Devoted viewers of the television show already find Dr. Richard Kimble compelling and will enjoy Fish’s tribute to the iconic tale of a man on the run.</p>
