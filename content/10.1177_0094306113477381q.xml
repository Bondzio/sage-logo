<p>Sometime during the presidency of George W. Bush, a colleague approached me to ask incredulously, “Can you believe Bush thinks he talks with God?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” I replied. “I don’t have a problem with that.”</p>
<p>“You don’t?!” After a moment, it dawned on him. He remembered that in addition to my being one of the few remaining Marxists in the academy, I also happen to be a practicing, if unorthodox, Roman Catholic. “Oh,” he finally said. “Because you think you talk with God too.”</p>
<p>That’s right. I just think I’m getting the message straight.</p>
<p>Of the two self-disclosures just made, I would think that among sociologists, the second would be far more scandalous. The first might place me among the dinosaurs but still within the bounds of academic respectability. The second would relegate me to the stupid, to the upholders of oppressive tradition, or both.</p>
<p>Those of us who are religious do not experience the academy or sociology as especially hospitable to our kind. True, polls consistently show around 40 percent of scientists to be religious. But apparently not the smartest scientists. Among the elite members of the National Academy of Sciences, the religious number only 7 percent. So it is easy enough to feel disparaged, especially when the likes of Stephen Hawking and Steven Weinberg variously dismiss religious belief. Not to mention the essentialism of Richard Dawkins and the late Christopher Hitchens reducing us all to fundamentalists. In <italic>The Politics at God’s Funeral</italic>, Michael Harrington reflected that sociology was particularly prone to religious dismissal, and in the March 2012 issue of <italic>Footnotes</italic>, Christian Smith rebuked sociology on such grounds.</p>
<p>Now, however, comes <italic>Science vs. Religion: What Scientists Really Think</italic> by Elaine Howard Ecklund. Given the context just delineated, this book is important. It is a report of Ecklund’s extensive study of religious belief among leading American scientists between 2005 and 2008. All told, Ecklund surveyed some 1,700 scientists across seven academic disciplines (biology, chemistry, economics, physics, political science, psychology, and sociology). With 275 of those scientists, she conducted in-depth interviews.</p>
<p>Ecklund thus aptly uses a mixed methods approach. The statistics are not directed at the discovery of causal laws but used descriptively to address questions of count: how many believe what. The in-depth interviews on the other hand take us inside the black box to help us better understand why different scientists believe what they do and how those beliefs affect their academic lives.</p>
<p>Of particular importance is Ecklund’s focus. She confines her sample to scientists at top institutions like Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Those of us at lower ranked schools should not begrudge our omission. Ecklund’s focus, beyond examination of the National Academy, is another way of determining the religious beliefs of those who are considered our leading scientific minds.</p>
<p>The quantitative results are startling. As Ecklund observes, most of what we thought we knew is wrong. For example, the militantly anti-religious number only 15 percent. Of the scientifically leading minds, nearly 50 percent hold traditional religious beliefs (36 percent professing some form of belief in God). Another 20 percent, while non-religious, consider themselves spiritual in some way. Contrary to Harrington’s surmise, there was statistically no significant difference between natural and social scientists, and religiosity was more prevalent among the young.</p>
<p>The qualitative findings are equally fascinating if less easily summarized. Ecklund assists us by describing four ideal typical ways scientists navigate the tensions between religion and science. One, spiritual atheism, I have already mentioned. The other three are closeted faith, boundary pioneers, and environmental push. The first of these three needs no elaboration. Boundary pioneers are people like biologist Francis Collins (and, I guess, although less notably, me), who are out of the religious closet and willing to speak openly of the ways they reconcile science and religion. Under the category of environmental push, Eckland discusses scientists who, although not necessarily religious themselves, feel the need to discuss religion because of the way it has surfaced in current social and political debate.</p>
<p>Another salutary aspect of the book is its address to the non-believers’ caricatures of religion. One physicist Ecklund interviews “finds it ridiculous to think ‘there’s some person on a chair with a beard who has lightening coming out of his fingers or who makes pronouncements about how people should live’” (p. 71).</p>
<p>Whose religious views is that picture supposed to represent? As Ecklund observes (p. 29), religious scientists have an understanding of religion different from the non-religious. What the believers believe is generally not what the disbelievers disbelieve. Thus, before Ecklund’s physicist and I could even start talking seriously about God, we would first need to lose the beard and the presumptive gender—well, the entire embodiment, the chair and the lightening, even the pronouncements. Then, perhaps, we could discuss the so-called anthropic coincidences that puzzle physicists and whether some kind of teleology is any less cogent an explanation for a universe so seemingly designed for our existence than physicists’ current suggestion that ours is just a suitable member of an infinite array of existant universes—none of which is any more observable than God.</p>
<p>It is uncommon for a book to change our mind. Ecklund’s book changed mine. After reading it, I conclude that I do not belong to as small a minority as I had imagined. I will miss tweaking the discipline with my religious perspective. But perhaps I need not desist. The real issue may not be what we believe privately but the sociological discourses to which we subscribe. Of the two reigning explanations of religious belief—social constructionism and rational choice theory—one represents religion as fabrication, the other as manipulation. As Christian Smith observes in <italic>What is a Person</italic>, in sociology we seem to prefer perspectives we hardly live by.</p>
