<p><italic>President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner wants to break up her country's biggest media company. The Argentines have mixed views</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Buenos Aires is a café society and every morning workers, retired people, students and many others take their daily newspaper to their local corner confitería to enjoy a strong cortado along with the latest news on inflation, corruption, crime, football and celebrity tittle-tattle. In the Argentine capital at the end of last year I couldn't help noticing that all the headlines related to “7D” – shorthand for December 7 – the day when the federal court would rule on the ongoing dispute between the presidency and the Clarín Group, Argentina's biggest media firm. If the judges ruled in the government's favour, Clarín would have to break up its assets.</p>
<p>The story of the conflict between the Kirchner administration and Clarín has deep roots. For many, the key events took place in March 2008, when president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, elected the previous year, passed a law to tax soybean exports. There was uproar in Argentina's agricultural sector: truck-drivers blocked the roads, marchers took to the streets, strikes were organised. Soon there were food shortages and, for the first time in living memory, the supermarkets ran out of meat. Clarín backed the farmers. War was declared.</p>
<p>Clarín Group takes its name from its flagship, Argentina's biggest-selling newspaper, <italic>Clarín</italic>, which has an average Monday to Saturday circulation of more than 330,000, and a Sunday edition that sells around twice that number. It also owns four free-to-air television channels, including Canal 13, one of the country's most established broadcasters. It owns a news channel, several radio stations, a film production company and several regional newspapers.</p>
<p>This is by no means a monopoly. Argentina has a healthily competitive media sector (there are 20 newspapers in Greater Buenos Aires alone, and Clarín owns only three of these) and other Latin American conglomerates such as Organizações Globo in Brazil and Grupo Televisa in Mexico are far bigger in terms of both regional influence and revenues. Where it does have considerable clout is in cable television. In 2007, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's late husband, ex-president Néstor Kirchner, authorised the group, which already owned cable television provider Multicanal, to merge with its main competitor, Cablevisión. The merger meant that Clarín also acquired control of Fibertel, one of Argentina's biggest internet service providers.</p>
<p>This potential audience and reach was initially useful to the first president Kirchner. “When [Néstor] Kirchner came to power in 2003 he was politically very weak,” says José Crettaz, a journalist at <italic>La Nación</italic>, Argentina's second-biggest daily newspaper. “He had come second in the primaries with 22 per cent, losing to [former president] Carlos Menem, who got 25 per cent. The latter didn't come forward for the ballotage and so Néstor Kirchner was made president with just 22 per cent of the votes. From then on, he relied on the media, which, apart from a few exceptions, gave him wholehearted support until 2005. Kirchner showed himself to be open to dialogue and dealt frankly with a society that was socially, politically and economically in disarray.”</p>
<sec id="sec1-095647480813492476">
<title>Argentina became inward looking</title>
<p>But, says Crettaz, from 2005 on, Kirchner reverted to a political position similar to the one he had adopted when he had been a state governor in the oil-rich province of Santa Cruz, in Patagonia. Following legislative elections, his party, the Front for Victory (a faction of the left-leaning Justicialist Party) had consolidated its power, and Kirchner realized he no longer depended on the media. “He eliminated plurality in the media through distributing government advertising unfairly, and by threats, and also by using supporters to attack the media directly.”</p>
<p>Argentina became more inward-looking. After reducing the foreign debt, Kirchner campaigned for closer economic ties with Latin American countries, withdrew from free-trade agreements with the United States, rejected IMF advice and took loans from Venezuela's Hugo Chávez. If this seems short-sighted, it has to be put in the context of Argentina's recent history: dictatorships and de facto military governments, a bloody “dirty war” from 1976–83, hyperinflation in the late 1980s, president Carlos Menem's wholesale sell-off of national assets in the 1990s, decades of disputes with the IMF. Kirchner was reverting to an established type: the populist caudillo, appealing to the masses with promises of social justice while adopting a quasi-authoritarian stance. Nonetheless, Clarín Group continued to give the government support, and, says Crettaz, “the Kirchners and Clarín had an excellent relationship up until 2008”.</p>
<p>Despite enjoying 60 per cent support in polls, Néstor Kirchner stepped down and on October 28, 2007 his wife, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, was elected with 45.3 per cent of the national vote. The Front for Victory also consolidated its position in a general election.</p>
<p>In March 2008, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner introduced a new sliding-scale taxation system for agricultural exports, effectively raising levies on soybean exports from 35 per cent to 44 per cent. The farming unions and allied associations revolted and blocked the roads. On March 25 thousands of demonstrators banged pots in the centre of Buenos Aires. There were protests in other cities across Argentina. Fernández de Kirchner stepped up her rhetoric, attacking the farmers for profiteering and, on April 1, organized a counter-rally.</p>
<p>Grupo Clarín, led by its CEO Hector Magnetto, chose to support the farmers. Argentina is a nation built on farming and one in which the gaucho – the historic cowboy-figure of the pampas – is cherished as a sort of national hero. Argentina's economy relies on farming – agricultural output amounts to more than a third of all exports – and millions of people are employed in related industries. As it turned out, the bill to increase export taxes, resolution 125, was repealed in July 2008. But by then the positions of Clarín and the presidency had been established.</p>
<p>While farmers enjoyed support among the elite and upper middle-classes, Clarín had managed to gain a lot of new enemies. “<italic>Clarín</italic> has traditionally been very good at reading the national feeling,” says Andrew Graham Yooll, former editor and president of the <italic>Buenos Aires Herald</italic> and former editor of <italic>Index on Censorship</italic> magazine. “It [<italic>Clarín</italic>] had something of Beaverbrook's <italic>Express</italic> about it, a certain quality for sniffing out the way public feeling was going. At times you felt the newspaper was like another government ministry, and that endured right up to Néstor Kirchner's regime.</p>
<p>“Then <italic>Clarín</italic> supported the farmers, thinking public opinion would go in the same direction. For the past 50 or 60 years the daily [founded in 1945] has always pandered to the country's romantic idea of the gaucho.” But Clarín seemed to have misjudged public feeling, at least that portion of the public that backed the government. Fernández de Kirchner was able to exploit other aspects of the image of the agricultural sector, portraying it as old money and the reserve of oligarchs, and, at the same time, a sector managed by powerful corporations. The president intensified some of the measures initiated by her husband. As well as buying up media operations, the government placed allies and friends in positions of influence within media firms and ensured that state advertising was placed in newspapers that supported the government.</p>
<p>The Fernández de Kirchner government has close relations with several unions. During 2011 and 2012, workers delayed the printing and distribution of several editions of <italic>Clarín</italic> and <italic>La Nación</italic>. The printers said they were protesting at the ongoing conflict between their employer, which they accused of harassing the union membership, and the government. When the Saturday editions of both papers were delayed for several hours, the Argentine Association of Journalistic Entities called the action “one of the most serious attacks on press freedom in Argentina in recent times”.</p>

<title>Children spat on photos of journalists</title>
<p>“To all this you have to add the public persecution of professional journalists,” says Crettaz. “In the streets there have been poster campaigns against established journalists such as Jorge Lanata, Nelson Castro, Magdalena Ruiz Guiñazú and Santo Biasatti, showing them with dollar bills in their mouths.” Exploiting the national emotion that can be garnered by anything related to the Dirty War and the estimated 30,000 “disappeared” victims of the military governments of 1976–1983, the Fernández de Kirchner presidency has recruited the human rights organisation, the Madres de Plaza de Mayo. The Madres' leader, Hebe de Bonafini, organised “political trials” in the plaza in which she played the roles of judge, prosecutor and jury to condemn the activity of several journalists. At another pro-government rally, children were incited by militants to spit on photographs of journalists.</p>
<p>Other changes in the media industry have played in the government's favour. Just as <italic>Clarín</italic> and other non-aligned newspapers, including the two other leading dailies <italic>La Nación</italic> and <italic>Perfil</italic>, have lost circulation to the web, the presidency has embraced Twitter and other social media to disseminate its message. Join the almost two million followers of @CFKArgentina and you can read Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's sarcastic remarks about Clarín (e.g, April 18, 2013: “Guess who has the monopoly on cable; yep, you were right: Clarín”), and her gushing daily gracias to friends and allies. It might seem undignified to outsiders, but is effective in feeding the propaganda network she has built. The impact of all these measures has been felt across Argentine media. <italic>La Nación</italic> and <italic>Perfil</italic> and Clarín's outlets claim their advertising revenues have bombed. “The objective is to asphyxiate the press financially. It's a form of silent censorship,” Ricardo Kirschbaum, <italic>Clarín's</italic> editor-in-chief, told Reuters. If it persists, he said, “the consequences will be that the independent press in Argentina ceases to exist”.</p>
<p>According to a report at a March 2013 gathering of the Inter American Press Association in Mexico, private media in Argentina face predicted losses of $70 million over the year. The Argentine delegation said that the advertisement revenues of the three major outlets had sunk by 15–20 per cent in February. Within <italic>Clarín</italic> alone, advertising pages have dropped from 264 to 61.</p>
<p>In October 2009, the national congress approved a media law (Ley 26.522 de Servicios de Comunicación Audiovisual) which sought to deregulate the press, ostensibly with the intention of encouraging a wider range of opinion and stimulating competition. The law set a limit on the number of broadcast licences that a company may own, and established a new state-controlled media watchdog, the Federal Authority for Audiovisual Communication Services. The government claims Clarín Group has 237 cable television licences, while the firm admits to 158. The new law would set a maximum of 24 cable licences and 10 free-to-air licences for radio and TV, and a limit of no more than 35 per cent of the pay-per-view population.</p>
<p>A series of judicial appeals in 2009–10 prevented the law from coming into force, and the government had to be content with having Clarín Group cautioned and the ruling delayed by an injunction for three years. In effect, the corporation was being given time to sort out its books and disinvest. In March 2011, <italic>Perfíl's</italic> owner brought the government before the Supreme Court over its advertising policies, and won the case. In October the same year Fernández de Kirchner was re-elected as president. In September, 2012, a deadline for Clarín's injunction was set: December 7.</p>
<p>In the same month, a government ad was aired on its television channel during the Saturday football programme attacking Clarín for “refusing to comply with the law” and subverting the democratic process. But on December 6, the federal civil and commercial court in Buenos Aires extended the cautionary measure on the grounds of unconstitutionality. Clarín was given a reprieve. A few days later, federal judge Horacio Alfonso declared the law constitutional and so began a three-way tango between the courts, the government and Clarín Group. Several articles of the media law, including the period allowed to shed licences, the manner in which they are to be transferred and the number of licences permitted, are now being disputed.</p>
<p>Reports suggest that the Argentine government already controls, directly or indirectly, as much as 80 per cent of the national media. If 7D proves Argentines still respect the law, it doesn't seem to have done much at all for democracy; with every delay and every new ruling, the government can focus on strengthening its control of information.</p>
<p>The fight with Clarín, rather like the Falklands dispute with the UK, increasingly looks like it might be serving the government as a powerful diversionary tactic. If Clarín's opposition is an issue for the Kirchner camp, there are far bigger headaches. In the week I wrote this article (May 6–12, 2013) the black market dollar hit 9.8 pesos (official rate 5.1 pesos), bus and coach firms went on strike, a report claimed a third of all business in Buenos Aires province – Argentina's breadbasket – weren't paying any tax, and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's popularity rating registered a new low of 29 per cent (compared with 65 per cent at her election) as inflation hit a new high of 25 per cent.</p>

<title>She associates her attitude with Evita Perón</title>
<p>A tangible outcome of 10 years of government by the Kirchners is a new divisiveness in politics and society. There is no disputing that Cristina Fernández de Kirchner has her followers and allies, and some of her policies have improved the lot of the very poor and led to a revival of manufacturing and other industries. Her (and her husband's) record on human rights have been applauded even by those outside of her circle of allegiance. But there seems to be no grey area in society at large. Andrew Graham-Yooll points to origins that pre-date the farming and media skirmishes by some 50 years.</p>
<p>“The Kirchners are Perónists after all. Her Justicialist party is Perónist. She associates her attitude to the working classes with Evita, and let's not forget how her husband engineered Fernández de Kirchner's career, moving her from the relatively low-profile position of senator for Santa Cruz to one of the three powerful senator positions in Buenos Aires Province.”</p>
<p>But, says Graham-Yooll, it is in Perón the man that Cristina founds her principles: “Juan Perón, during his last stint in government in 1973–4, famously said: ‘To our friends everything, to our enemies not even justice.’ The Peróns never liked the press and they certainly didn't like the free press. Néstor Kirchner took a lot of his ideas from Perón without ever acknowledging it. The Kirchners are, in effect, bribing the press with advertising and cutting funds from their foes. The opposition is the enemy.”</p>
<p>Argentina has long been an odd mix of developed and developing world. Buenos Aires has a café society that London should envy, but it also has huge slums around its periphery. On a recent travel writing assignment for <italic>The Daily Telegraph</italic>, I had to drive through some of the most remote corners of Patagonia. I saw the impressive work in progress on the “Argentina Conectada” plan – an 80,000km fibre-optic network aimed at getting everyone online. But you have to wonder what information the connected will be able to access if pressure on the free press continues.</p>
