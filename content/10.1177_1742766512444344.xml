<p><italic>Negotiating Communication Rights: Case Studies from India</italic>, a recently published book authored by Pradip Ninan Thomas, addresses the linkages between the realm of media, existing social realities in India and various grassroots movements in this field. Gradual encroachment on the territory of democratic institutions by private players, critical stresses on the entire democratic apparatus, and the need to define the role of the state vis-à-vis defending people’s rights are emergent issues that call for proper study by social scientists with aspirations of course correction. In the post-globalized Indian context, people’s democratic rights are increasingly taking the shape of RTI (Right to Information) and the intensifying global transparency movement. Citizens are witnessing the constricting of the role of state institutions in various sectors, including communication, thereby according greater leverage to powerful private players, especially in the corporate world. Thus, while people at large seek greater empowerment in numerous areas that impact their lives, they are becoming victims of the diminishing role of the governing apparatus.</p>
<p>Thomas’ book examines critical issues related to the democratization of communication in the Indian context and compares them with the ongoing global movement for communication as a fundamental right of the people. In simpler terms, this would mean not only the right to be informed, but also the right to be heard. The book thus suggests that communication rights also involve the government acting upon the grievances articulated by the people to redress them. The book strongly argues for moulding the move for communication rights into a mass movement, particularly in India. Thomas argues that five ongoing movements in India – the Right to Information (RTI), Community Radio, Women and Media, Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and Citizen Journalism – ought to be collated and shaped into a more comprehensive and focused civil society movement in the area of communication rights.</p>
<p>The issue of universalizing communication as a fundamental right has been widely debated since the late 1970s in various world bodies and international organizations, such as UNESCO. Students of social science are aware of the contours of the New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO), as well as its continuum, through bodies such as the World Association for Christian Communication (WACC) and the Communication Rights in the Information Society (CRIS) campaign, which have examined these issues since the early 1990s. Thomas has been an active participant in these movements and, therefore, has formidable credentials to take the reader deeper into the realm of communication rights in a comprehensive manner. Earlier, while working as the research director of WACC, Thomas was closely associated with the CRIS campaign and is thus well equipped to share with readers the difficulties that movements in this field are facing.</p>
<p>Keeping these points in view, a careful reading of Thomas’ diagnosis and prescriptions is advisable. This is even more so because of the various ramifications of the emergence of social media in recent years.</p>
<p>While seeking to highlight the communication deficits in specific areas, the book also seeks to provide a framework for their resolution. No movement can gather the required dynamism, credibility and penetration in the public mind unless it is backed by a sound philosophical basis and argumentation. It is for this reason that Thomas deals with the philosophy of communication rights, pointing out the contributions made by European thinkers such as Gadamer, Buber, Levinas and Habermas. The chapter on communication rights campaigns within the Indian peninsula includes a diverse range of figures, from the father of the nation, Mahatma Gandhi, to more recent names such as Baba Amte, Medha Patkar, Shekhar Singh, Aruna Roy and Nikhil Dey, who are active in the cause of distributive justice and in the struggle for RTI as one of the larger communication rights-based movements.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that debates revolving around communication rights campaigns have so far mainly pertained to media and communications. Thomas should be credited for bringing the importance of larger components, such as the significance of local realities and culture-based practices, into sharper focus in the context of these campaigns, especially in India.</p>
<p>Thomas has dedicated a chapter to each of the five movements discussed. In each case, he provides a detailed account of the history of these movements in India, the important institutions and personalities leading these movements, relevant examples, the barriers facing these movements, and the critical issues and key challenges around them. Four of the five movements are prominent in Indian public debate, but not many voices have talked about the importance of free and open source software (FOSS). Thomas deserves credit for delving into this previously neglected area.</p>
<p><italic>Negotiating Communication Rights</italic> offers significant discussion in defence of more intense and public-spirited mass initiatives, in order to move from the stage of RTI (Right to Information) to that of RTH (Right to be Heard). The latter assumes enormous significance in the context of current civil society movements, particularly in parts of the Arab region (the Jasmine revolution followed by the Arab Spring), India (the Anna Hazare-led India against Corruption movement) and the economically ailing Euro-Atlantic region (the Occupy Wall Street movement). All of these movements seek a greater role for common citizens in determining their destinies and the resolution of demands such as poverty alleviation, opportunities for employment, and adequate health care.</p>
<p>The book would have benefited from more attentive editing and proofreading, which would have ironed out some rather noticeable errors in the layout. Nonetheless, it is an accomplished work, likely to attract the attention of informed scholars and researchers in the fields of global media, communication rights and society.</p>
