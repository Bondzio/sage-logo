Its objective was to establish the effectiveness of MAPPA in ‘reducing the potential risk of harm to others presented by identified offenders in the community through joint working and the exchange of relevant information’. </p><p>Six areas were inspected and were selected in order to represent a range of socio-economic and demographic profiles. The inspection focused on five specific areas of practice: leadership and management; identification of MAPPA offenders; assessment of the level of risk of harm to others presented by the offender; managing the individual’s risk of harm to others; and victim safety. In conjunction with these areas of assessment, the inspectors also undertook a detailed evaluation of the operation of the ViSOR database.</p><p>The inspectors were generally complimentary about the operation of the MAPPA process and its ability to effectively manage those offenders who pose the greatest risk of harm to others. They recognized that in spite of the range of difficulties faced in dealing with this challenging group of offenders, practitioners had developed a positive culture of openness, trust and information sharing. They also recognized much good practice in the abilities of staff to balance the often conflicting needs of offenders, their victims and the wider community. That being said, it was found that these high standards were not consistent in all aspects of work and improvements were required across a number of key areas to ensure that all reasonable action is taken to manage risk of harm.</p><p>The first of these areas relates to the lack of clarity as to who the lead agency is in managing individual offenders. The inspection found that whilst the practice of establishing a lead agency was well understood by staff, in operation this had little impact on the management of cases and in particular did not support a coordinated approach. A worrying finding was the lack of comprehensive risk management plans being compiled by the MAPPA process, despite this being required under the national guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0264550512447221">NOMS, 2009</xref>). Individual agencies would create their own plans but these did not always encompass those actions identified at meetings. Positives were highlighted about the frequency of meetings and attendance levels were recognized to be high. However, the inspectors identified that the emphasis of these meetings was too often on exchanging information about the offender as opposed to the active management of their risk. This was closely linked to concerns that MAPPA was not balancing the (necessary) restrictive interventions with the development of protective factors and a clear focus on preparing for the eventual completion of supervision. Improvements in the quality of minutes was deemed to be very important in order to evidence defensible decision making. Too often minutes were found to be out-of-date, inaccurate and poorly written. </p><p>The audit of the ViSOR records highlighted a range of areas for improvement and the use of this system was found to be inconsistent across both the police and probation, not least because of difficulties in accessing the system by probation practitioners. Information recorded was not always of the requisite standard and these were assessed as damaging to the possibility of ViSOR being adopted as a national system to effectively manage those offenders posing a risk of harm. A raft of proposals were highlighted to improve the operation of this system, with particular attention paid to the need for agencies to establish appropriate monitoring of the use of ViSOR and adherence to its standards.</p><p>Whilst the inspection report proposes a range of interventions and improvements to address the above deficits, it does offer some positive conclusion and recognizes the central and necessary role MAPPA plays in the management of those offenders posing the most serious risk of harm. It highlighted that in two thirds of cases risk of harm had been kept to a minimum, the MAPPA level had decreased in over half of cases, the majority of offenders had not reoffended and victims and potential victims had been protected in most cases. However, it was recognized that these achievements should have occurred in a higher number of cases and that much needed to be done to ensure that MAPPA reached its full potential.</p><p>Criminal Justice Joint Inspection: Thematic Inspection Report, Putting the Pieces Together: An Inspection of Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (2011) can be downloaded at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/hmi-probation" xlink:type="simple">http://www.justice.gov.uk/about/hmi-probation</ext-link></p><sig-block><sig><bold>Laura Rawlinson</bold><break/><italic>Greater Manchester Probation Trust</italic></sig></sig-block></body><back><ref-list><title>Reference</title><ref id="bibr1-0264550512447221"><citation citation-type="journal" xlink:type="simple"><collab collab-type="author" xlink:type="simple">NOMS</collab> (<year>2009</year>) <article-title>MAPPA Guidance 2009 Version 3.0</article-title></citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
