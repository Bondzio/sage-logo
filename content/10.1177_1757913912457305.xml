<p>It is generally assumed that water quality in health care settings is always safe; however this is not always the case. In May the Royal Society for Public Health ran a very successful two day conference examining the issues around water safety in healthcare, and how these can be resolved. Internationally renowned experts spoke on a range of subjects such as treatment options, risk assessments and optimising infection control practices. The conference focused upon providing water of a suitable quality depending on both its type of use and type of user. The conference was chaired by Dr John Lee and Dr Susanne Lee (formerly Surman-Lee), international authorities on the detection and control of pathogenic microorganisms in water systems.</p>
<p>On the first day Professor Kevin Kerr opened the conference by describing the wide range of waterborne opportunistic pathogens including <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic> and fungi such as <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and <italic>Fusarium</italic> species and some of the difficulties in determining the source of hospital acquired infections. He showed evidence that the problems are related not just to tap water; outlining the numerous places which have been found to be colonised in the hospital environment, but include bottled water which has resulted in <italic>P.aeruginosa</italic> and other water related infections in high risk patients.</p>
<p>Delegates were then afforded the rare opportunity to hear Professor Philippe Hartemann from Nancy, France and Professor Martin Exner from the World Health Organizations’ (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Health Promoting Water Management and Risk Communication based in Bonn. Professor Hartemann described the problems which occurred as a result of mistakes made in the design and commissioning of the famous Pompidou Hospital in France which led to an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease shortly after it opened. The hospital is now reliant on point of use filters throughout the hospital to protect patients and with five outlets in each patient room requiring filters this is a significant on-going cost which could have been prevented. As a result of such mistakes Professor Hartemann led a working party which produced Water Quality Guidelines for Healthcare Facilities which were introduced in the year 2000. Five years after their introduction and following much surveillance, the French Ministry of Health formerly published these guidelines in 2005. If hospitals fail to comply they risk prosecution and if a patient acquires an hospital acquired infection the onus is on the hospital to prove that it has put in place suitable precautions.</p>
<p>Professor Exner gave a comprehensive presentation which covered the emerging problem of antibiotic resistance in environmental bacterial populations; the isolation of antibiotic resistant <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella</italic> species from drinking water reservoirs in New Delhi was given as such an example. He reiterated the WHO belief that if action is not taken today to combat this problem then there will be no cures for tomorrow to treat microbial infections. He also presented data showing that the colonisation of a nursing home with <italic>P.aeruginosa</italic> was derived from the water utility supply and the methods used to confirm the source. He then went on to describe the hypothesis that the risk of patients being infected is a product of the concentration of microorganisms, their virulence and antibiotic resistance divided by the specific immune status of the patient or disposition of the patient to infection. In other words in hospitals with high numbers of virulent, antibiotic resistant microorganisms and high numbers of immunocompromised patients; the risk of infection is very high. He gave the example of the high rate of infection with some deaths of neonates associated with incubator reservoirs being colonised with <italic>P.aeruginosa</italic>.</p>
<p>Amongst those speaking was Caroline Willis, Unit Head at the Health Protection Agency’s Food, Water and Environmental Microbiology laboratory in Porton. She described the reasons why hospital water systems should be monitored, how samples should be taken, and when it is necessary to respond to results. She highlighted that one of the main issues with monitoring water systems was knowing when and how to react to the tests that are routinely carried out.</p>
<p>Delegates at the conference were fortunate to be able to hear two presentations from Dr Janet Stout, an internationally recognised clinical and environmental microbiologist who has been conducting authoritative research into <italic>Legionella</italic> for the last thirty years. She is currently Director of the Special Pathogens Laboratory in Pittsburgh, and Associate Research Professor at the University of Pittsburgh, and she flew to England especially to give two presentations at the conference. The first of her talks covered the very current issue of whether the use of proximity taps in healthcare institutions caused a health risk rather than being an infection control strategy, as they were designed to be. Proximity taps, or sensor faucets in the USA, are taps that are operated through a sensor and therefore reduce contact in washrooms. Various studies over the last ten years have suggested that these taps, rather than reducing the risk of infection, actually increase the risk. In one hospital 74% of non touch taps were colonised with <italic>P.aeruginosa</italic> and more recently John Hopkins University undertook a study into this proposed risk and found that 95% of the electronic taps they tested were positive for <italic>Legionella</italic> as opposed to 45% of manual taps. Dr Stout concluded that, due to the complexity of electronic taps, there are more places for disinfectant resistant bioflms to grow. She recommended that periodic monitoring for <italic>Legionella</italic> was carried out, and that removing proximity taps from high risk areas should be considered.</p>
<p>The first day of the conference was concluded by Dr John Lee, an independent consultant clinical scientist specialising in public health microbiology and joint chair of the conference. His talk built upon the issues Dr Janet Stout considered, but focused upon the effects of Thermostatic Mixing Valves (TMVs). Due to the risk of scalding from hot water, particularly to young children and the elderly, TMVs are part of new building regulations and have been installed in NHS premises since the 1990s. These valves prevent water being delivered at a higher temperature than 46°C. Dr John Lee shared information from the International Burn Injury Database for the UK from 1986 to 2012 which showed that, although bathing immersion indisputably has caused scalding injuries, the number of scalding cases from taps and showers is however very low. The effect of TMVs on <italic>Legionella</italic> risk, Dr Lee argues is far more detrimental. <italic>Legionella</italic> is usually managed by high temperature water flushing the pipes and outlets; however this is not possible when TMVs are being used in the healthcare environment. Therefore Dr Lee argues that the increased risk from <italic>Legionella</italic> and other waterborne opportunistic pathogens growing downstream of TMVSon washbasins, is greater than the risk of scalding that they have been fitted to prevent. He also outlined the little understood problem associated with fitting new components such as TMVs and proximity taps into existing systems. Such components maybe tested in the factory by non sterile water. The outcome is that unless adequate disinfectant precautions are taken such components can actually introduce opportunistic pathogens such as <italic>P.aeruginosa</italic> or legionellae into a system. Dr Lee concluded by arguing that this evidence suggests that basins should not be fitted with TMVs (except where the risk assessment determines that this is necessary for certain tyes of vulnerable patients), as the risk of Legionnaires’ disease outweighs the scalding risk. This is particularly the case in augmented care units, when only staff use the sinks.</p>
<p>Other presentations covered the importance of good design with Mr Martin Schuler from ARUP, outlining many aspects of water system design which are often not properly taken into account and issues around the importance of managing the commissioning phase and the period before building occupation. These issues were also very expertly dealt with by Mr Paul Nolan from Lend Lease Facilities Management. Dr Susanne Lee, chair for the second day and as one of the editors and authors of the WHO recent publication, Water Safety in Buildings, gave an overview of the Water Safety Plan Approach and how this can be used to identify hazards and ensure adequate protective measures are put in place. She also stressed the need for on-going verification, the importance of good communication, training and external audit to ensure that risks are adequately controlled in all systems and for all types of user.</p>
<p>A further international speaker Dr Maria Luisa Ricci from the Institute of Public Health in Rome described a well designed trial comparing the relative efficacy of chlorine dioxide and silver hydrogen peroxide in contaminated hospital water systems. She showed that in similar hospital buildings on the same site chlorine dioxide was significantly more effective than silver hydrogen peroxide. However as with everything in life, matters are rarely simple and this is also true when using disinfectants in building systems as Dr Karin Jacobson described the degradation effects within water distribution pipework that may be seen when chlorine dioxide is used as a distribution system disinfectant. These talks give just a small insight into the expert opinion shared at the conference, a particular strength of this conference was that there was plenty of time given to questions and discussion on the range of issues covered particularly around the increasing recognition that legionellae are not the only opportunistic waterborne pathogens and that we need to have suitable surveillance and strategies in place to identify and combat infections all potential hazards from water use in healthcare. The conference highlighted the complexity of problems that those managing water safety in health care face.</p>

<title>Publication of the ‘No Health without Mental Health: Implementation Framework’</title>
<p>The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) has supported and contributed to a new mental health implementation framework, which sets out what organizations can do to make the six high-level objectives of the Government’s mental health strategy, ‘No Health without Mental Health’, a reality.</p>
<p>The framework sets out: what changes are needed to turn the strategy into a reality; how progress in implementing the strategy will be measured and reported; what local organizations can do to implement the strategy; and how local action will be aided by government and other national organizations.</p>
<p>RSPH will develop a range of accessible, short training programmes and a linked accredited qualification to support the implementation of the framework. The programme will focus on increasing awareness about mental health and wellbeing within the many professions, practitioner groups and organizations in the voluntary, public and private sectors who work to improve population health and wellbeing. The framework is also cited in our Level 2 Award in Understanding Mental Health and Wellbeing which should be available in the autumn.</p>
