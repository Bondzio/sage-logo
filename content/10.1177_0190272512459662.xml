<abstract>
<p>Theoretically, the more important a role-identity is to a person, the more it should provide a sense of purpose and meaning in life. Believing one’s life to be purposeful and meaningful should yield greater mental and physical well-being. These hypotheses are tested with respect to the volunteer role, specifically, Mended Hearts visitor, in which former heart patients visit current heart patients and their families in the hospital. Analyses of survey data from Mended Hearts visitors (N = 458) confirm that a sense of meaningful, purposeful life mediates the positive influences of role-identity salience on mental and physical health. The results hint at an unfolding process: the more time spent in volunteer activities, the more important the volunteer identity. The greater the identity importance, the more one perceives one matters to other people, which in turn enhances purpose and meaning. The more life seems purposeful and meaningful, the better one’s well-being.</p>

<body>
<p>A large body of research shows that holding multiple roles reduces psychological distress and enhances physical health. The more roles individuals occupy, the better their mental and physical well-being (see reviews in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0190272512459662">Barnett and Hyde 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0190272512459662">Thoits 2003</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0190272512459662">Ahrens and Ryff 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0190272512459662">Kikuzawa 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0190272512459662">Reid and Hardy 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0190272512459662">Thoits (1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0190272512459662">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0190272512459662">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0190272512459662">2003</xref>) has argued that social roles have salutary effects on well-being because they are identities that provide individuals with purpose and meaning in life. Whether role-identities in fact supply purpose and meaning and whether a sense of purpose and meaning actually mediates the link between identities and well-being are questions that have rarely been examined in the literature. This article addresses these issues, focusing as a case in point on the role-identity of “volunteer,” specifically, Mended Hearts visitor.</p>
<sec id="section1-0190272512459662">
<title>Theoretical Background</title>
<p>In symbolic interactionist theory, role-identities are definitions of the self in terms of the social roles that one holds and enacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0190272512459662">McCall and Simmons 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0190272512459662">Mead 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0190272512459662">Stryker 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0190272512459662">Thoits 1986</xref>). Put another way, role-identities are answers to the question, “Who am I?” when answers refer to role relationships. Roles are positions in the social structure to which behavioral expectations, including reciprocal rights and obligations, are attached (e.g., spouse, parent, employee, friend). According to theory, individuals obtain classifications of themselves as social objects and evaluations of themselves as worthy and competent social actors through taking the role of the other and accepting others’ categorizations and appraisals of them as self-descriptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0190272512459662">Cooley 1902</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0190272512459662">McCall and Simmons 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0190272512459662">Mead 1934</xref>).</p>
<p>Why should holding one or more role-identities promote mental and physical health? One theoretical answer has been that role-identities provide purpose and meaning in life as well as behavioral guidance, which in turn promote emotional and bodily well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0190272512459662">Thoits 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0190272512459662">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0190272512459662">2003</xref>). Because roles indicate to individuals who they are in their own and others’ eyes and why and how they are expected to behave, roles protect against anxiety and existential despair. (Low anxiety and depression may also discourage excessive use of alcohol and drugs.) Because the behavioral expectations attached to roles such as son/daughter, parent, and employee guide everyday conduct, and these behavioral norms often include expectations of responsible health behavior (e.g., avoiding substance use, eating and exercising properly), roles can also protect physical health.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0190272512459662">1</xref></sup> Competent role-identity performances should also foster positive reflected self-appraisals (self-esteem) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0190272512459662">Cooley 1902</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0190272512459662">Rosenberg 1979</xref>) and belief in one’s ability to achieve desired goals (a sense of control or mastery over life). Individuals with high self-esteem and a strong sense of mastery should also feel happier and more satisfied with their lives in general, which are key aspects of subjective well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0190272512459662">Diener et al. 1999</xref>). Theoretically, then, the more role-identities people hold, the more purpose, meaning, behavioral guidance, and positive self-appraisals they should obtain, generating better mental and physical health, in contrast to persons with few or no roles (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0190272512459662">Burton 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0190272512459662">Marks 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0190272512459662">Sieber 1974</xref>).</p>
<p>This argument has come to be called the role accumulation hypothesis (or identity accumulation hypothesis) and stands in contrast to implications drawn from traditional role theory (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0190272512459662">Coser 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0190272512459662">Goode 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0190272512459662">Merton 1957</xref>), which suggested that the more social roles individuals possess, the more likely they would experience role conflict or overload, which should lead to greater emotional distress and ill health. The revisionist view of the beneficial effects of multiple roles has obtained substantial and consistent empirical support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0190272512459662">Ahrens and Ryff 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0190272512459662">Barnett and Hyde 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0190272512459662">Kikuzawa 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0190272512459662">Reid and Hardy 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0190272512459662">Thoits 2003</xref>), with few exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0190272512459662">Jackson 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0190272512459662">Reitzes and Mutran 1994</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0190272512459662">2</xref></sup> It should be noted that positive relationships of multiple roles with mental or physical health outcomes are stronger for “voluntary” than “obligatory” roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0190272512459662">Thoits 2003</xref>). Voluntary roles are adopted by choice and can be exited fairly easily if their costs begin to exceed their rewards, while obligatory roles, based in family and work relationships, involve strong normative demands and/or intense affective ties, making their exit more difficult and sanctioned. Obligatory roles benefit individuals only when negative events and chronic strains in each role domain are low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0190272512459662">Berbrier and Schulte 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0190272512459662">Pavalko and Woodbury 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0190272512459662">Thoits 1992</xref>). Longitudinal research shows there is a reciprocal relationship between multiple roles and health over time: role accumulation benefits individuals’ mental and physical well-being <italic>and</italic> persons with greater well-being acquire more roles over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0190272512459662">Thoits 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Role-Identity Salience and Well-Being</title>
<p>Because people typically hold multiple identities, most theorists assume that some role-identities are more salient for individuals’ self-conceptions than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0190272512459662">McCall and Simmons 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0190272512459662">Rosenberg 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0190272512459662">Stryker 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0190272512459662">Thoits 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0190272512459662">Weigert, Teitge, and Teitge 1986</xref>). In this article, salience refers to the subjective importance or value that persons attach to the various roles that they accept as self-defining, similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0190272512459662">Rosenberg’s (1979)</xref> notion of psychological centrality and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0190272512459662">McCall and Simmons’s (1978)</xref> concept of identity prominence: people view some of their identities as more central to, prominent, or important in their self-conceptions than are others. Studies confirm that individuals do differentially rank the subjective importance of the role-identities that they possess (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0190272512459662">Callero 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0190272512459662">Deaux 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0190272512459662">Thoits 1992</xref>). It should be noted that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0190272512459662">Stryker (1980)</xref> defines identity salience differently, in terms of the probability that an individual will choose to invoke or enact a particular identity when circumstances allow choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0190272512459662">Stryker and Serpe 1982</xref>). To compare and contrast the well-being effects of this conception of salience to the effects of identity importance is beyond the scope of this article, given the complex ways in which these two salience concepts are related to one another and to behavior across roles (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0190272512459662">Stryker and Serpe 1994</xref>). I confine attention in this article to salience conceived and measured as subjective importance only, with the terms <italic>salience</italic> and <italic>importance</italic> used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Theoretically, an identity exists and can become important to a person only if it is performed at least occasionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0190272512459662">McCall and Simmons 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0190272512459662">Thoits 1992</xref>). Other factors that likely influence perceptions of salience include the individual’s investment of time, effort, and material resources in the role; the extrinsic and intrinsic rewards obtained from role performance; and the amount of validation and support for the role supplied by significant others, among other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0190272512459662">Callero 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0190272512459662">McCall and Simmons 1978</xref>). Depending on such factors, individuals occupying the same role-identity will vary in their evaluations of its personal importance.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0190272512459662">Thoits’s (1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0190272512459662">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0190272512459662">2003</xref>) theoretical logic, if social roles provide purpose, meaning, and guidance in life, then important role-identities should be more potent sources of these assets than roles viewed by the person as less important. The greater the salience accorded a role-identity, the greater should be its beneficial effects on well-being, and these identity effects should be channeled through the purpose, meaning, and normative direction that persons draw from their roles. These hypotheses are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0190272512459662">Figure 1</xref>. (Because studies have not examined the degree of behavioral guidance obtained from various roles and because the present study does not measure this construct, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0190272512459662">Figure 1</xref> excludes this mediator. Hereafter I focus solely on the purpose and meaning consequences of salient identities.) I summarize the evidence for each path in the model drawing from the broader role-identity literature and turn to findings specific to the volunteer identity in a later section.</p>

</fig>
<p>The first path shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0190272512459662">Figure 1</xref>—that identity importance will be positively associated with mental and physical well-being—has had mixed support. How salience is measured appears to influence whether confirmation is found. When identity salience is assessed as the <italic>degree of subjective importance</italic> (or in some studies, as subjective commitment) that individuals attach to their roles, these ratings are positively and significantly associated with most aspects of well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0190272512459662">Greenberger and O’Neil 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0190272512459662">Marcussen, Ritter, and Safron 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0190272512459662">Martire, Stephens, and Townsend 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0190272512459662">Reitzes and Mutran 1994</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0190272512459662">Martire et al. (2000)</xref> measured the subjective importance of wife, mother, employee, and caregiver roles among women who held all four roles. The greater the salience of each of these four roles, the greater the respondent’s life satisfaction. The more salient the employee role, the lower the women’s depression.</p>
<p>In contrast, when salience is measured as the <italic>relative importance of each role compared to others that an individual holds</italic>, salience rankings are unrelated to well-being outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0190272512459662">Reitzes and Mutran 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0190272512459662">Thoits 1992</xref>) or have inconsistent effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0190272512459662">Reitzes and Mutran 2002</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0190272512459662">Thoits (1992)</xref> asked random samples of married and divorced adults whether they thought of themselves in terms of 17 different roles. Then respondents were asked to select and place up to three of their role-identities into each category of “first most important to me,” “second most important to me,” and “third most important to me,” with unranked identities classified as “not important.” The relative salience rankings of the 17 role-identities were not systematically associated with psychological distress or substance use, the study’s dependent variables.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0190272512459662">Thoits (1992)</xref> noted that rank orderings of role-identities by men and women and by married and divorced persons were almost identical to one another and suggested that these salience orderings reflected broad cultural consensus about the social value of some roles over others. This observation implies that a man could rank a role-identity such as “churchgoer” as lower in importance relative to his spouse, parent, and worker identities, in line with broader cultural views, but, when given the opportunity to <italic>rate</italic> instead of <italic>rank</italic> each identity’s importance, he might evaluate his churchgoer identity as highly important to him personally despite its relative ranking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0190272512459662">Reitzes and Mutran 2002</xref>). Personal ratings of role-identity salience are likely to be more potent determinants of emotional and bodily well-being than identity rankings that may be tempered by cultural views, and empirical work to date seems to support this possibility. Along related lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0190272512459662">Rosenberg and colleagues (1995)</xref> found that individuals’ role-specific self-esteem (academics-based self-esteem) influenced their global self-esteem only when they personally valued academic endeavors. For these reasons, personal importance ratings (not rankings) of the volunteer identity are the focus of this article.</p>
<p>Path 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0190272512459662">Figure 1</xref> indicates that higher ratings of role-identity salience should be associated with stronger perceptions of purpose and meaning in life. To my knowledge, no study has assessed the link between role-identity <italic>salience</italic> and viewing one’s life as filled with purpose and meaning. However, in a related study based on a nationally representative sample of adults, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0190272512459662">Ahrens and Ryff (2006)</xref> examined the association of <italic>multiple roles</italic> with perceived purpose and meaning, using the Purpose in Life subscale from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0190272512459662">Ryff’s (1989)</xref> multidimensional index of psychological well-being.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0190272512459662">3</xref></sup> They found that individuals holding more of eight social roles experienced a heightened sense of purpose and meaning in life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0190272512459662">Burton (1998)</xref> assessed a sense of “global integrative meaning” with items tapping beliefs that one’s life has had direction and is worthwhile in general. In his national probability sample, respondents with more adult roles (spouse, parent, and worker) reported greater global meaning in life. The findings of these studies are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0190272512459662">Thoits’s (1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0190272512459662">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0190272512459662">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0190272512459662">2003</xref>) original theoretical argument about multiple roles and thus hint that an examination of the effects of role-identity salience might produce similar findings.</p>
<p>In contrast to path 2, there is substantial evidence supporting path 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0190272512459662">Figure 1</xref>, that persons with a strong sense of purpose and meaning in life have better mental health, including greater happiness, life satisfaction, self-esteem, positive affect, and lower psychological distress, depression, and negative affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0190272512459662">Burton 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0190272512459662">Debats 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0190272512459662">Mascaro and Rosen 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0190272512459662">Ryff and Keyes 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0190272512459662">Zika and Chamberlain 1992</xref>). To illustrate, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0190272512459662">Zika and Chamberlain (1992)</xref> administered three available scales of purpose and meaning in life to two samples, stay-at-home mothers and senior citizens. Regardless of how operationalized, a sense of purpose and meaning was positively and significantly associated with life satisfaction, psychological well-being, and positive affect and inversely related to psychological distress and negative affect in both samples. The evidence is highly consistent with respect to emotional or psychological well-being. Relationships of meaning and purpose with <italic>physical</italic> health outcomes have not been explored, to my knowledge.</p>
<p>Does a strong sense that one has a meaningful, purposeful life mediate a link between role-identity salience and well-being, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0190272512459662">Figure 1</xref>? As noted previously, no study has assessesed the connection between identity <italic>salience</italic> and the belief that one’s life is purposeful and meaningful, so there have been no direct tests of this mediation hypothesis. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0190272512459662">Burton (1998)</xref> examined whether a sense of global meaning in life explained the inverse relationship between multiple role occupancy and psychological distress. He found that a stronger sense of global meaning partially to fully explained the inverse relationships of various combinations of spouse, parent, and worker roles with psychological distress for both men and women. Again, these findings are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0190272512459662">Thoits’s (1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0190272512459662">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0190272512459662">1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0190272512459662">2003</xref>) original theoretical argument.</p>
<p>In sum, the existing literature shows that ratings of the importance of role-identities and measures of a sense of purpose and meaning in life both correlate significantly and positively with psychological well-being. Whether a greater sense of purpose and meaning is derived from more salient identities and whether it mediates identity salience effects on well-being have yet to be demonstrated. This article examines these questions with respect to one role-identity, community volunteer.</p>

<title>Why the Role-Identity of Volunteer?</title>
<p>The volunteer role is acquired by choice and is relatively easily exited if its demands become greater than its satisfactions. Hence, the role is likely to be relatively low in stress, so the salutary aspects of being a volunteer will likely not be counterbalanced and obscured by ongoing difficulties in the role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0190272512459662">Thoits 1992</xref>). Examining the volunteer role also enables a clearer look at theoretical processes that can be difficult to detect when studying multiple roles simultaneously, particularly when a collection of roles involve solely obligatory roles (e.g., spouse, parent, worker) or a complex mix of voluntary and obligatory ones. Finally, longitudinal research shows that volunteer work and well-being are reciprocally related over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0190272512459662">Li and Ferraro 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0190272512459662">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0190272512459662">Thoits and Hewitt 2001</xref>): the more volunteer hours worked at one point in time the better one’s mental and physical health at a subsequent point, and individuals in better physical and mental health at one time point invest more hours in volunteer work in a future period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0190272512459662">Van Willigen 2000</xref>). Because I presume in this article that volunteer identification will have impacts on individuals’ emotional and bodily health but I have available only cross-sectional data, it helps to know that existing evidence supports the social causation direction of effects that I assume.</p>
<p>A volunteer can be defined as a person who does unpaid work with the intention of benefitting others who are not tied to him or her by legal, family, or friendship obligations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0190272512459662">Van Willigen 2000</xref>). Studies of volunteers have generally focused on their social characteristics, personality orientations, and motivations compared to nonvolunteers in general. Volunteers tend more often to be well educated, middle-class, married, parents, female, older, and white (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0190272512459662">Gottlieb and Gillespie 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0190272512459662">Rotolo 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0190272512459662">Wilson 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0190272512459662">Wilson and Musick 1997</xref>). They are generally prosocial in orientation, empathic, helpful, confident, and optimistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0190272512459662">Allen and Rushton 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0190272512459662">Mellor et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0190272512459662">Penner and Finkelstein 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0190272512459662">Penner, Midili, and Kegelmeyer 1997</xref>). And, as alluded to previously, they are generally in better physical and mental health: longer-lived, happier, more satisfied with their lives, less depressed, with higher self-esteem and a stronger sense of personal control compared to persons who do not engage in these activities, even net of prior physical health status and well-being (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0190272512459662">Gottlieb and Gillespie 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0190272512459662">Li and Ferraro 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0190272512459662">Lum and Lightfoot 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0190272512459662">Musick and Wilson 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0190272512459662">Piliavin and Siegl 2007</xref>). In contrast to these findings, investigations into volunteers’ motivations for engaging in service work have yielded few patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0190272512459662">Gottlieb and Gillespie 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0190272512459662">Thoits and Hewitt 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0190272512459662">Wilson 2000</xref>). Volunteers’ motivations are not consistently related to their social statuses, their personality traits, or the types of volunteer work in which they engage.</p>
<p>However, there are strong hints in the literature that identity processes may be important in motivating and sustaining volunteer work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0190272512459662">Finkelstein, Penner, and Brannick 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0190272512459662">Penner and Finkelstein 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0190272512459662">Videka 1979</xref>). Performing service activities leads to embracing this role as an identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0190272512459662">Callero 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0190272512459662">Charng, Piliavin, and Callero 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0190272512459662">Piliavin and Callero 1991</xref>). Once the identity has been adopted, a desire to gain role-identity validation from others prompts repeated performance of service behaviors over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0190272512459662">Finkelstein et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0190272512459662">Grube and Piliavin 2000</xref>). The more important the volunteer identity is to the individual, the more frequently he or she enacts the role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0190272512459662">Callero 1985</xref>). Although meeting the expectations of others and gaining identity validation are certainly key motivators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0190272512459662">McCall and Simmons 1978</xref>), engaging in purposeful, meaningful, goal-directed activities is likely to be rewarding and thus motivating, too (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0190272512459662">Gottlieb and Gillespie 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Because we know that performing more hours of volunteer work yields better physical and mental health over time (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0190272512459662">Musick and Wilson 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0190272512459662">Thoits and Hewitt 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0190272512459662">Van Willigen 2000</xref>), it seems theoretically plausible that investing many hours in volunteer work makes the volunteer identity more salient to the person, which in turn heightens his or her general sense of purpose and meaning in life. Greater derived meaning and purpose should in turn foster happiness and life satisfaction, guard against distress, and promote health behaviors that sustain or enhance physical well-being. In accord with the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0190272512459662">Figure 1</xref>, purpose and meaning should explain, at least in part, the positive mental and physical health consequences of a highly salient volunteer identity. This article provides a test of these hypotheses, focusing on the volunteer identity of Mended Hearts visitor.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section5-0190272512459662">
<title>The Mended Hearts Organization</title>
<p>Mended Hearts is a national, nonprofit, self-help organization that has been in existence nearly 60 years, affiliated with the American College of Cardiologists. There are roughly 250 local chapters nationwide. The primary mission of Mended Hearts is to provide peer support to cardiac patients and their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0190272512459662">Mended Hearts, Inc. 2002</xref>). Former heart patients who themselves have been through cardiac procedures in the past visit current heart patients and family members in the hospital to offer information and reassurance. Former caregivers to heart patients also give support to family members during hospital visits. In 2009, about 179,000 visits to patients and families were made by 2,740 Mended Hearts volunteers in 400 hospitals and rehabilitation programs across the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0190272512459662">Littlefield 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Patient and caregiver visitors are trained in techniques of supportive interaction by the Visiting Chair of their local Mended Hearts chapter. (Visiting Chairs also manage the hospital schedules of their volunteers and visit patients.) About 8 to 10 hours of training, including supervised visits, are required for the accreditation of new volunteers, and visiting reaccreditation is required annually. The vast majority of volunteers are former heart patients who themselves were visited in the hospital by Mended Hearts members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0190272512459662">Bond et al. 1979</xref>). Accredited visitors also interact online with current heart patients or their family members in the Mended Hearts Internet Visiting Program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0190272512459662">Mended Hearts, Inc. 2002</xref>). In addition to the visiting program, chapters hold monthly meetings for heart patients and family members to provide continued support and up-to-date information about heart disease, surgery, medications, and the recovery process.</p>

<sec id="section6-0190272512459662">
<title>Study Design and Sampling Procedures</title>
<p>The study was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, questionnaires were distributed to assess visitors’ degree of involvement in this volunteer work, their quality of life, and their physical and emotional well-being. In the second stage, those visitors who agreed to participate in a follow-up qualitative telephone interview were asked in depth about their reasons for visiting, the meanings they derive from this volunteer work, and the types of support they offer to patients and families. In this article, data come primarily from the structured questionnaires.</p>
<p>The national office of Mended Hearts, Incorporated (MHI) does not maintain a list of visitors; lists are kept by the Visiting Chairs of local Mended Hearts chapters. Because of this organizational structure, questionnaires were distributed to visitors by the Visiting Chairs of selected eligible chapters. Eligible chapters had active visiting programs, reported their numbers of visitors to the national office in early 2010, and were located in the contiguous United States. Initially, 75 chapters were randomly drawn from the list of eligible chapters, seven chapters with outstanding programs were added at the request of MHI, and two pretest chapters were also included because the pilot instruments did not change appreciably, an initial total of 84 chapters. Including the seven requested and two pretest chapters did not alter the proportional representation of chapters by region of the country or the average number of visitors per chapter.</p>
<p>Five chapters were later found to have ceased their visiting activities and so were dropped as ineligible, leaving a sample of 79 chapters. Visiting Chairs were contacted to request their assistance in distributing questionnaires; 76 (96 percent) were successfully reached and all agreed to deliver surveys to their visitors. Due to their own serious illness, cancelled chapter meetings, or unstated reasons, 6 of the 76 Visiting Chairs did not follow through. Thus, 70 chapters ultimately participated in the study. Potential respondents totaled 877 (members of 70 active chapters with an average of 12.5 visitors per chapter, ranging from 1 to 52 visitors). Using their usual mode of communication with their visitors, 78 percent of Visiting Chairs distributed paper questionnaires along with return postage-paid envelopes during chapter meetings or at the hospital, while 22 percent emailed directions to a website with an electronic version of the questionnaire.</p>
<p>Of the potential respondents, 458 returned a paper or electronic survey, a response rate of 52 percent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0190272512459662">4</xref></sup> With a 52 percent response rate, the study findings cannot be generalized statistically to describe the Mended Hearts visitor population as a whole. However, theoretical generalizations can be made from the existence, direction, and strength of relationships found among variables.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section8-0190272512459662">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>Well-being is indicated by six variables—happiness, life satisfaction, self-esteem, a sense of mastery, psychological distress, and physical health.</p>
<p>
<italic>Happiness</italic> and life satisfaction are considered measures of subjective well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0190272512459662">Diener et al. 1999</xref>) or quality of life. Respondents were asked, “When you consider everything about your present life, how would you describe yourself?” Possible responses were coded 5 = very happy, 4 = somewhat happy, 3 = neither happy nor unhappy, 2 = somewhat unhappy, and 1 = very unhappy. For <italic>life satisfaction</italic> participants were asked, “Thinking about your present life, how satisfied are you with your life in general?” Possible responses ranged from 5 = very satisfied, to 3 = neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, to 1 = very dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Self-esteem and a sense of mastery commonly are viewed as dimensions or aspects of mental health and are construed as such here. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0190272512459662">Rosenberg’s (1979)</xref> 10-item global <italic>self-esteem</italic> scale was employed. Example items include “I feel that I have a number of good qualities” and “All in all, I’m inclined to feel like a failure” (reverse coded), with responses ranging from 4 = strongly agree to 1 = strongly disagree. To reduce missing values, each participant’s responses were summed and then divided by the number items he or she answered to produce his or her average response to the scale. Thus, participants’ scores ranged from 1 to 4 in value (from low to high self-esteem). Cronbach’s alpha for the scale was .76.</p>
<p>Pearlin’s seven-item <italic>mastery</italic> scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0190272512459662">Pearlin et al. 1981</xref>) was used to assess respondents’ sense of personal control over life. Illustrative items are “I have little control over the things that happen to me” (reverse coded) and “What happens to me in the future mostly depends on me.” Answers range from 4 = strongly agree to 4 = strongly disagree. Respondents’ answers were summed and then divided by their number of answers, so scores ranged from 1 = low mastery to 4 = high mastery. The internal consistency of the scale was .71.</p>
<p><italic>Psychological distress</italic> is a state of emotional malaise consisting of symptoms of anxiety and depression. Somatic symptoms that typically accompany emotional upset are excluded, as they can be confounded with physical health status. To measure distress, the anxiety and depression subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0190272512459662">Derogatis and Spencer 1982</xref>) were used. Anxiety symptoms were assessed with the question, “In the past month, including today, how much were you distressed by: nervousness or shakiness inside, suddenly scared for no reason, feeling fearful or afraid, feeling tense or keyed up, spells of terror or panic, feeling so restless you couldn’t sit still?” Depression symptoms included “feelings of worthlessness, thoughts of death or dying, feeling lonely, feeling blue, thoughts of ending your life, feeling no interest in things, feeling hopeless about the future.” Possible responses were 0 = not at all, 1 = a little bit, 2 = moderately, 3 = quite a bit, 4 = extremely. Respondents’ answers to all items were summed and divided by the number of valid answers, so scores ranged from 0 (low psychological distress) to 4 (high psychological distress). Cronbach’s alpha was .84.</p>
<p>A <italic>physical health scale</italic> was constructed from answers to four questions. The first was self-rated health, indicated by answers to “How would you rate your health in general?” For comparable scaling with other health items, responses were coded as 4 = excellent, 3 = very good, 2 = good, 1 = fair or poor. The second item asked, “Compared to other people your age, how would you rate your health in general?” For comparable scaling, this was coded 4 = better than most people my age, 2.5 = about the same as most people my age, 1 = worse than most people my age. The third queried, “How often does your health get in the way of what you want to do?” (1 = very often to 4 = never). Finally, “How satisfied are you with the current state of your health?” (4 = very satisfied to 1 = very dissatisfied). Respondents’ responses were summed and divided by their number of valid answers. Scores ranged from 1 to 4 (poor to good physical health) with an internal consistency of .78.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0190272512459662">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>All respondents are volunteer visitors, so occupancy of the visitor role is a constant. However, the number of hours that volunteers spend visiting patients and families indicates the amount of time they spend in role enactment. As discussed earlier, salience is likely to depend partly on the time and effort individuals invest in a role-identity. Participants were asked two questions (at different points in the survey) about their degree of involvement in visiting activities, one objective, the other subjective. The objective item assessed <italic>weekly hours spent visiting</italic>: “About how many hours each week do you spend visiting, on average?”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0190272512459662">5</xref></sup> For <italic>subjective time spent visiting</italic>, respondents were asked, “How much time do you spend being a volunteer Visitor?” with responses on a 10-point scale, anchored at one end with 1 = I spend almost no time being this and at the other with 10 = I spend most of my time being this. Objective and subjective role enactment were only modestly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). <italic>Identity salience/importance</italic> was the sum of responses to three questions, each assessed on 10-point scales. The first asked, “How well does being a Mended Hearts Visitor describe who you are?'' (1 = this does not describe me at all to 10 = this describes me extremely well). This question assesses the degree to which the respondent views the visitor role as self-descriptive, namely, as a role-identity. The second asked about importance: “Among your various roles, how important to you is being a Mended Hearts Visitor?” (1 = not at all important to 10 = extremely important). Although this wording seems to request a rank ordering, participants responded overwhelmingly in terms of the personal importance of the visitor identity; 88 percent of those who gave a rating of 8, 9, or 10 (the most frequent answers to this question) responded 8, 9, or 10 to a query in the follow-up interviews (conducted weeks later) that did <italic>not</italic> refer to other roles: “On a scale of 1 to 10, how important to you is being a Mended Hearts Visitor?” Gamma for collapsed ordinal versions of the two importance questions was .70 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) for respondents who answered both questions (N = 216). The third question was, “How committed do you feel to being a volunteer Visitor?” (1 = I am not at all committed to being this to 10 = I am very committed to being this). The commitment question captures the individual’s personal investment in the role, as a corollary of its subjective importance. Commitment as defined and measured here differs from the concept of commitment in identity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0190272512459662">Stryker 1980</xref>); in identity theory, commitment refers to the degree to which a role-identity is embedded in a large and/or emotionally significant set of network ties. Rated importance was correlated .64 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) with self-descriptiveness and .60 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) with degree of commitment. Responses to the three identity salience items were summed and divided by the number of items answered, so scores ranged from 1 to 10 (low to high visitor identity salience). The internal consistency of the scale was .80.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0190272512459662">
<title>Intervening variables</title>
<p>Purpose and meaning in life are assessed in two ways. First, I employ the 14-item version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0190272512459662">Ryff’s (1989)</xref> Purpose in Life subscale. High scores on the <italic>purpose in life</italic> subscale indicate that the individual believes he or she has goals in life, a sense of direction, and his or her current and past life have meaning. Illustrative items include “I have a sense of direction and purpose in life,” “In the final analysis, I’m not so sure that my life adds up to much,” (reverse coded), and “I don’t have a good sense of what it is I’m trying to accomplish in life” (reverse coded). Responses range from 6 = strongly agree to 1 = strongly disagree. For each participant, responses were summed and divided by the number of valid responses, so scores range from a low of 1 to a high of 6 for sense of purpose in life. The internal consistency of the scale was .84.</p>
<p>As a second measure, I included a five-item <italic>mattering</italic> scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0190272512459662">Marcus 1991</xref>). Mattering refers to beliefs that one is an object of other people’s attention, one is important to those persons, and those persons depend on one for fulfillment of specific needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0190272512459662">Rosenberg and McCullough 1981</xref>). Because mattering is a belief that one is significant to other people, it seems conceptually very close to the idea of obtaining meaning from one’s role involvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0190272512459662">Gottlieb and Gillespie 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0190272512459662">Thoits 2011</xref>). Mattering seems especially pertinent for this sample, as the goal of visiting is to provide support to anxious heart patients and their families. This support-giving activity should provide evidence to volunteers that they do matter to other people and thus have purpose in life. A sense of mattering is positively related to psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0190272512459662">Rosenberg and McCullough 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0190272512459662">Taylor and Turner 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0190272512459662">Turner, Taylor, and Van Gundy 2004</xref>) and has been shown in one study to mediate the relationship between volunteering and psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0190272512459662">Piliavin and Siegl 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0190272512459662">Taylor and Turner’s (2001)</xref> slight revision of Marcus’s items and responses are used here: “How important are you to others?” “How much do others pay attention to you?” “How interested are others in what you have to say?” “How much do other people depend upon you?” and “How much would you be missed if you moved away?” (I substituted the phrase “moved away” for “went away” in the last question). Responses were 1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = somewhat, and 4 = a lot. Participants’ responses were summed and divided by their number of answers; scores thus ranged from 1 (low) to 4 (high) for a sense of mattering to other people. Cronbach’s alpha was .81. Although purpose in life and mattering are correlated .53 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), analyses confirmed that the mattering items factored separately from the purpose in life items.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0190272512459662">
<title>Control variables</title>
<p>Respondents’ social statuses and aspects of their visitor role are controlled in the analyses. <italic>Female</italic> is a dummy variable (1 = female, 0 = male). <italic>Age</italic> is in years. <italic>Minority status</italic> is based on answers to two questions, “Are you of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin?” and “What racial group or groups best describe you?—please check all that apply [from a given list].” Those who indicated that they were non-Hispanic and white were coded 0, all others were coded 1. <italic>Educational level</italic> was collapsed into 1 = high school or less, 2 = some college or associate degree, 3 = bachelor’s degree, and 4 = graduate or professional degree. Annual family income was not measured because so many respondents were retired (86 percent). As an alternative indicator of socioeconomic status, a scale of <italic>financial difficulties</italic> was constructed from three items, “At the present time, how much difficulty do you have in paying your bills?” (4 = a great deal to 1 = none at all); “At the end of the month, do you end up with: 4 = not enough money to make ends meet, 2.5 = just enough to make ends meet, 1 = some money left over”; and “Overall, how satisfied are you with your financial situation?” (4 = very dissatisfied to 1 = very satisfied). Responses were summed and divided by the number of items answered for each participant, so scores ranged from 1 to 4 (low to high financial difficulties), with a Cronbach’s alpha of .84.</p>
<p>Respondents hold other social roles in life beyond that of visitor. The more social roles that respondents occupy, the less salient they may rate the visitor identity while perhaps also reporting greater purpose in life and better well-being. To control for the potential effects of multiple roles, I summed the <italic>number of roles</italic> individuals held based on whether they were married or living with a partner (yes = spouse/partner), whether they had children (yes = parent), whether they had grandchildren (yes = grandparent), whether they were working full- or part-time for pay (yes = employee), whether they were attending religious services once a month or more often (yes = churchgoer), and whether they belonged to clubs or organizations other than Mended Hearts (yes = group member). The number of social roles (beyond visitor) ranged from 0 to 6.</p>
<p>The number of <italic>years as a volunteer visitor</italic> is held constant in the analyses as it may positively influence the importance of the visitor role-identity and/or the amount of time invested in that role. Years as a visitor is proxied by the respondent’s years of membership in Mended Hearts; most visitors begin visiting within a year of joining the organization. Years as a visitor was positively but marginally related to visitor identity salience (<italic>r</italic> = .08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) and significantly associated with weekly hours visiting (<italic>r</italic> = .14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and with subjective time spent visiting (<italic>r</italic> = .20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Finally, analyses control for whether the respondent was a <italic>patient visitor</italic> (1 = yes, 0 = no), given that former heart patients with histories of treatment for serious heart disease may have poorer physical and/or mental health compared to caregiver visitors.</p>

<title>Analytical Strategy</title>
<p>Because visitors are nested within chapters, potential cluster effects must be considered, as observations with correlated errors violate an assumption of the ordinary least squares (OLS) model. The means of the dependent variables may not only vary across individuals, they may also vary by cluster. Thus, the total variation in the dependent variables may be attributable both to within-clusters variation (i.e., individual-level variation) and between-clusters variation (i.e., chapter-level variation). To assess cluster effects, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated for each dependent variable with a random intercept model with no covariates, using Stata 11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0190272512459662">StataCorp 2009</xref>). The ICC, or <italic>rho</italic>, indicates the proportion of variation in the dependent variable that is attributable to between-clusters variation. For three of the outcome variables (happiness, life satisfaction, and physical health), the ICC was zero, indicating no cluster effects. The other three outcome variables had nonzero ICCs: .035 for self-esteem, .013 for mastery, and .028 for distress. The Breusch-Pagan test showed that between-groups variation was significantly different from zero only for self-esteem, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 6.45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, indicating that random effects estimation would be appropriate for this dependent variable. Upon further investigation, however, the results of random effects estimation of self-esteem multivariate models were virtually identical to those using OLS estimation with robust standard errors, which control for clustered design but do not model random intercepts. Therefore, the OLS estimates are presented for self-esteem in this article to be consistent with models for the other five outcomes. All models are estimated with OLS using robust standard errors, in Stata.</p>

<title>Respondents’ Characteristics</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0190272512459662">Table 1</xref> shows descriptive statistics for the study variables. Almost 60 percent of participating Mended Hearts visitors are male, the sample is overwhelmingly white in racial composition, and the average age is 73—what some might term middle-old rather than old-old. Respondents are well educated (75 percent with some college or more). They report low financial difficulties overall, suggesting middle-class socioeconomic status. They hold an average of four social roles beyond the role of visitor; specifically, 77 percent are married, 91 percent are parents, 78 percent are grandparents, 23 percent are employed, 71 percent are churchgoers, and 85 percent belong to other organizations (not shown). Seventy-one percent volunteer for one or more organizations besides Mended Hearts (not shown). Clearly, this sample values community service.</p>

<p>A large majority of participants are patient visitors, which means they are former heart patients. Respondents have been visitors for Mended Hearts an average of eight years. They spend about three hours per week in visiting activities (some have zero hours because volunteers are not allowed to visit when ill, some take trips, and some have had a surge in work obligations). Subjectively, they rate how much time they spend being a visitor midway between “no time” and “most of my time,” suggesting an overestimate of their actual time investment.</p>
<p>Respondents place very high importance on the visitor identity—a mean of 8 on a 10-point scale. With respect to purpose and meaning in life, participants on average “moderately agree” with the view that their lives have direction and import and perceive themselves as mattering “somewhat” to other people.</p>
<p>In terms of well-being, participants rate themselves as somewhat to very happy and satisfied on average. They have very high self-esteem, a moderately strong sense of mastery over their lives, markedly low psychological distress, and moderately good physical health. Overall, participants seem to enjoy good mental and physical health.</p>

<title>Time Spent in Role Enactment and Visitor Identity Salience</title>
<p>As noted earlier, coming to view a role as an identity and perceiving it as important requires performing it at least once in a while. Presumably, the more frequently the role is enacted, the more it should become a salient part of the self. To verify that time invested in volunteer activities does relate to the importance of the volunteer identity, I regressed identity salience first on weekly hours spent visiting, then on subjective time spent visiting, and finally on both the hours and subjective time variables, with control variables held constant in the equations. Results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0190272512459662">Table 2</xref>.</p>
<p>In models 1 and 2 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0190272512459662">Table 2</xref>, both actual hours invested and subjective time spent in visiting activities are positively and significantly associated with greater importance attached to the Mended Hearts visitor identity. In model 3, when both objective and subjective time involvements are controlled, the coefficient for objective hours more than halves in size, suggesting that some of the link between actual hours and visitor identity salience is channeled through individuals’ perceptions of time spent. The more hours invested in hospital visiting, the more time respondents perceive themselves as having devoted to this work, which in turn connects positively to the importance of the visitor identity for self-conception. These findings support the idea that one has to enact a role in order to view that role as self-descriptive and personally valuable.</p>

<p>The literature has shown that the more hours involved in volunteer work, the better a person’s emotional and bodily well-being. In contrast to prior findings, each model 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0190272512459662">Table 3</xref> shows the number of hours invested weekly in visiting is unrelated to all outcomes, with the exception of a marginally significant positive association with respondents’ life satisfaction. However, the greater the respondent’s <italic>perceived</italic> time spent in the volunteer role, the greater his or her reported happiness, life satisfaction, self-esteem, and sense of mastery over life, in accord with the volunteer literature. Neither time investment variable was associated with psychological distress or physical health status.</p>
<p>Each model 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0190272512459662">Table 3</xref> assesses whether visitor identity salience is related to mental and physical health benefits. Clearly it is. The importance of the identity to the respondent is significantly related to all six well-being outcomes in expected directions. Thus, perceiving the visitor identity as salient links to greater psychological and physical well-being, supporting Hypothesis 1.</p>
<p>Note that when identity salience is controlled in each model 2, the effect of subjective time spent in visiting activities becomes near zero and nonsignificant for happiness, life satisfaction, self-esteem, and mastery (as does the association of weekly hours with life satisfaction). Identity salience thus appears to mediate the effects of role enactment on these aspects of well-being: the more subjective time invested in the visitor role, the greater the salience of that role for self-conception, which in turn relates to more positive consequences for psychological well-being.</p>

<title>Identity Salience and Meaning and Purpose in Life (Hypothesis 2)</title>
<p>Hypothesis 2 posits that the more importance respondents attach to their visitor identity, the more they will view their lives as meaningful and purposeful. To test this, I regressed a sense of mattering to others and a view of life as filled with purpose and meaning on visitor identity salience, net of the role enactment measures and the control variables. The significant salience coefficients in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0190272512459662">Table 4</xref> are confirming: the more importance respondents give to the visitor identity, the more they believe they matter to other people and are living meaningful, purposeful lives.</p>

<title>Purpose and Meaning in Life and Well-Being (Hypotheses 3 and 4)</title>
<p>The third and fourth hypotheses of the article can be examined in one analysis. Hypothesis 3 is that a sense of purpose and meaning in life will benefit mental and physical health. Hypothesis 4 is that a sense of purpose and meaning will mediate the relationship between visitor identity salience and well-being. To test these predictions, well-being was regressed first on visitor identity salience, with control variables and the role enactment indicators held constant. Then in models 2 and 3, the mattering and purpose in life measures were entered sequentially. Results appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0190272512459662">Table 5</xref>.</p>

<p>The results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0190272512459662">Table 5</xref> consistently and unambiguously support prior literature: beliefs that one matters to other people (in model 2) and that one’s life has direction and import (in model 3) are significantly and positively related to all six aspects of well-being, supporting Hypothesis 3. Unexpectedly, when the mattering coefficients in models 2 and 3 are compared, it is clear that a sense of purpose in life fully mediates the links of mattering to happiness, mastery, psychological distress, and physical health and substantially mediates the connections of mattering with life satisfaction and self-esteem. (Exploratory analyses entering purpose in life in the equations before mattering revealed that mattering did <italic>not</italic> mediate the effects of purpose in life on well-being outcomes [not shown].)</p>
<p>If a sense of purpose and meaning in life explains the positive relationship between role-identity salience and well-being displayed in each model 1 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0190272512459662">Table 5</xref>, then the salience coefficient should become near zero and nonsignificant in models 2 or 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0190272512459662">Table 5</xref>. This expectation is supported for all six dependent variables, confirming Hypothesis 4. The coefficient for identity importance becomes smaller when a sense of mattering to others is controlled in each model 2 for happiness, life satisfaction, self-esteem, mastery, and physical health, and the importance coefficient becomes nonsignificant for psychological distress. When a general sense of meaning and purpose in life is added in each model 3, the coefficient for identity importance reduces virtually to zero and becomes nonsignificant for all well-being outcomes except distress, where mattering appeared to be its mediator.</p>
<p>To verify the utility of perceived purpose in life as an explanatory variable, I re-estimated all model 3 equations of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0190272512459662">Table 5</xref> with mattering omitted (not shown). Purpose in life fully mediated the effects of identity salience on happiness, self-esteem, mastery, distress, and physical health and substantially mediated its effects on life satisfaction (not shown). A general sense that one’s life is purposeful and meaningful clearly helps to explain how the salience of the visitor role-identity is associated with better mental and physical health, as argued earlier.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0190272512459662">Table 5</xref> results along with the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0190272512459662">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0190272512459662">4</xref> hint at a possible unfolding chain of effects: the more actual hours spent visiting, the more one perceives that one’s time is spent in the visitor role. The more perceived time spent in the role, the more personal importance attached to the visitor role-identity. The more important the visitor role-identity, the more respondents believe they matter to other people. Strong belief that they matter to others in turn reinforces respondents’ sense that their lives are meaningful and purposeful. And the stronger the belief that they have purpose and meaning in life, the better respondents’ physical and psychological well-being.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>The analyses provide consistent support for the main argument of this article. The more important a role-identity is to a person, the more he or she has a sense of purpose and meaning in life, and perceiving purpose and meaning in life is associated with mental and physical health advantages. A sense of meaningful, purposeful existence is a key mechanism through which a salient role-identity relates to positive well-being, consistent with earlier theoretical arguments that linked the accumulation of multiple roles to emotional and bodily health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0190272512459662">Thoits 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0190272512459662">1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0190272512459662">2003</xref>). To my knowledge, this is the first attempt to link identity <italic>salience</italic> to a sense of purpose and meaning in life and to test whether having a meaningful, purposeful existence serves as a mediator between identity salience and health-related outcomes.</p>
<p>The analyses also revealed unanticipated mediating effects. These mediation findings suggest an unfolding sequence of effects from role enactment to identity salience; from identity salience to a sense of mattering; from mattering to a sense of meaningful, purposeful existence; and from purpose and meaning in life to better emotional and physical health. The key explanatory mechanisms connecting time spent in role-related behaviors to positive psychological and physical outcomes appear to be the salience of the volunteer identity and the belief that one’s life is purposeful and meaningful.</p>
<p>However, it is important to recognize that these findings only hint at these processes because the data are cross-sectional and thus, the directions of influences presumed in this article plausibly could be reversed, a major limitation. In particular, time spent in role enactment might well be an <italic>outcome</italic> of these processes, rather than a precipitant. For example, people in good physical and mental health and those who perceive the volunteer identity as highly important may devote greater amounts of time to volunteer activities. Further, people in good physical and mental health may be more likely to view their lives as meaningful and themselves as mattering importantly to others. Individuals with such beliefs may involve themselves more intensely in a wide range of role-related activities, including volunteer work, and also view those role-identities as more personally salient. These reverse possibilities may be especially applicable to Mended Hearts members whose gratitude for their recovery from heart problems and appreciation for the support given them while ill motivated them to become volunteer visitors in the first place (as described in many telephone interviews). However, the rewards obtained from volunteer service in turn can underscore the importance of the identity and the meaningfulness of the work providing subsequent well-being benefits over time. In other words, one should not expect associations among identity salience, sense of purpose, and well-being to flow in only one causal direction but rather to influence one another dynamically over time. Indeed, as noted earlier, longitudinal studies show reciprocal effects between volunteer role enactment and identity salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0190272512459662">Charng et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0190272512459662">Grube and Piliavin 2000</xref>) and between role enactment and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0190272512459662">Li and Ferraro 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0190272512459662">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0190272512459662">Thoits 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0190272512459662">Thoits and Hewitt 2001</xref>), findings that help to sustain the line of reasoning that undergirds this article. Nevertheless, the conclusions here must remain tentative until longitudinal data are available to verify the sequence of possible effects that I have sketched out.</p>
<p>A second limitation involves the overwhelmingly white, older age, and middle-class composition of the sample and the lengthy duration of their volunteer activities. One must question whether the processes observed in these analyses would be different or similar in samples more diverse in race/ethnicity, age, stage in the life course, socioeconomic status, and years of volunteer service. Although the argument developed here should in theory apply across social groups, empirical verification will be necessary.</p>
<p>A third limitation is due to probable selection biases in the sample. There are three. First, Mended Hearts members who seem to be in good physical and emotional health are selectively recruited and trained by Visiting Chairs to become visitors, so respondents in this study may be in better mental health compared to adults in the general population with the same social backgrounds (although perhaps not in better physical condition, due to their histories of heart disease). Second, because study participation was voluntary, visitors also selected themselves into or out of the sample. It is plausible that those who viewed the visiting role as very important to them were more willing to participate. Third, participants have volunteered for Mended Hearts an average of eight years, an impressive duration of involvement. It is possible that only highly experienced and committed volunteers chose to respond to the survey. These potential selection biases may have increased the probability of observing a positive relationship between identity salience and well-being.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the highly selected nature of this sample may have curtailed variance in measures, reducing the strength of relationships among constructs. If the homogeneity in the sample worked against the discovery of relationships, the fact that the guiding hypotheses found empirical support is encouraging, suggesting that the processes examined here might be replicated and perhaps strengthened in more heterogeneous samples.</p>
<p>A final limitation of the study is that it focuses on the subjective importance of a single role-identity. Replicating these observed relationships with other voluntary role-identities (e.g., churchgoer, neighbor, political activist) and assessing whether the same patterns would hold for obligatory identities (e.g., spouse, parent, employee, and caregiver) would help to refine our understanding of the well-being implications of viewing a role-identity as personally valuable.</p>
<p>Theoretically, this article extends the identity accumulation argument to take into account the personal importance of various roles that an individual holds. A person does not necessarily value all of the roles that he or she enacts or value them equally. In theory, only those role-identities that are perceived as moderately to extremely important should contribute to a person’s sense of purpose and meaning in life and his or her well-being (although it must be kept in mind that the well-being benefits gained through greater purpose and meaning can be counterbalanced by the negative effects of stressors experienced in those roles, especially in obligatory ones such as spouse, parent, and employee). This is one avenue for further exploration. Would the process described here generalize to unconventional or even deviant identities, where the personal importance placed on the identity conflicts with its broader cultural value? This is a second direction for future theoretical development and empirical research.</p>
<p>A comparison of alternative conceptions of identity salience and their connections to well-being is yet another prospect for exploration. The personal importance people attach to the volunteer role is only one way of conceiving salience (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0190272512459662">Callero 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0190272512459662">McCall and Simmons 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0190272512459662">Stryker and Serpe 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0190272512459662">Stryker and Serpe (1994)</xref> have shown that rankings of identity importance and of readiness to invoke an identity contribute independently to the time people spend in role-related activities. These theorists have advocated including both aspects of salience in future research. How alternative conceptions of identity salience relate to one another (including rating vs. ranking measures of each concept) and how each construct functions in the dynamic associations between role enactment and health need attention.</p>
<p>Finally, this study has shown that a sense of purpose and meaning in life is a key mechanism linking the importance of the volunteer role to persons’ well-being. Assuming that this finding replicates for other social roles, new questions arise: What are the social distributions of a belief that one’s life has purpose and meaning? What types of role-identities and role experiences foster such a beneficial perspective on life? Might this belief serve as a stress buffer, protecting individuals’ well-being as effectively as other psychosocial resources do, such as optimism and social support? These are possible paths of new inquiry.</p>

<p>An unusual number of respondents (N = 39) did not fill in their number of hours spent visiting, perhaps because their hours varied from week to week. When asked the same question in the follow-up telephone interviews, many respondents did report their hours. The average hours reported by interviewees who had missing survey information was two hours per week. To retain cases in the analyses I substituted two hours per week for missing values. Analyses run with the original variable (with many missing) and with the revised variable (none missing) produced identical results, so I report analyses with the revised variable in this article.</p></fn>
