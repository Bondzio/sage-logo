<sec id="section1-0890334412440846">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>The incidence of breastfeeding of preterm infants is affected by the support provided at the hospital and in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However, policies and guidelines promoting breastfeeding vary both nationally and internationally.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0890334412440846">
<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>The aim of this survey was to describe breastfeeding support in Danish NICUs, where approximately 98% of mothers initiate lactation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0890334412440846">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A national survey of all 19 Danish NICUs was conducted in 2009. Four NICUs were at designated Baby-Friendly hospitals, and 5 had a lactation consultant. In all NICUs, it was possible for some parents to stay overnight; 2 units had short restrictions on parents’ presence. Five NICUs had integrated postpartum care for mothers. Breastfeeding policies, written guidelines, and systematic breastfeeding training for the staff were common in most NICUs. Seventeen NICUs recommended starting breast milk expression within 6 hours after birth, and mothers were encouraged to double pump. Most NICUs aimed to initiate skin-to-skin contact the first time the parents were in the NICU, and daily skin-to-skin contact was estimated to last for 2-4 hours in 63% and 4-8 hours in 37% of the units. The use of bottle-feeding was restricted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0890334412440846">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The Danish NICUs described the support of breastfeeding as a high priority, which was reflected in the recommended policies for breast milk pumping, skin-to-skin contact, and the parents’ presence in the NICU, as well as in the restricted use of bottle-feeding. However, support varied between units, and not all units supported optimal breastfeeding.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Breastfeeding provides health benefits to both infant and mother,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334412440846">1</xref></sup> and there are even more pronounced benefits for preterm infants,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334412440846">2</xref></sup> that is, those born before 37 completed weeks of gestation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334412440846">3</xref></sup></p> <p>Studies have shown that mothers of preterm infants have a lower breastfeeding initiation rate than mothers of infants born at term. In The United States, 2 different studies showed that between 48% and 74% of preterm mothers initiated breastfeeding versus 71% of the term mothers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334412440846">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334412440846"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334412440846">6</xref></sup> Corresponding figures in Australia were 80% versus 88%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334412440846">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334412440846">8</xref></sup> In Scandinavia, there are no available statistics on preterm breastfeeding initiation, but breast milk pumping for preterm infants is initiated to the same degree as breastfeeding is initiated in term infants. At discharge, compared to 97%-99% of term infants, 65%-93% of Scandinavian preterm infants are exclusively or partially breastfed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334412440846">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334412440846"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334412440846"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334412440846">12</xref></sup> In Scandinavia, the only nationwide study of breastfeeding of infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) was conducted in Norway in 1995-1996. It included both preterm and term infants, and the results showed that 64% of infants in NICUs were exclusively breastfed at discharge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412440846">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1989, the United Nations Children’s Fund and the World Health Organization designed the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) with “Ten Steps” to protect, promote, and support breastfeeding in maternity services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334412440846">14</xref></sup> The BFHI was subsequently evaluated as effective in increasing the exclusivity and duration of breastfeeding in a large randomized cluster trial in Belarus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334412440846">15</xref></sup> in which infants born at hospitals designated as Baby-Friendly were significantly more likely to be exclusively breastfed at 3 and 6 months and to be breastfed to any degree at 12 months than infants born at hospitals not designated as Baby-Friendly.</p>
<p>Modifications of the Ten Steps for neonatal intensive care and/or preterm infants have been done locally in, for example, Sweden,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412440846">16</xref></sup> Brazil,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334412440846">17</xref></sup> and the United States,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334412440846">18</xref></sup> and at a national level, in Norway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412440846">13</xref></sup> The modifications were, for example, the provision of family-centered care and a supportive physical environment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412440846">16</xref></sup> parents’ presence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412440846">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412440846">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334412440846">17</xref></sup> recommendations of breast milk pumping frequency,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412440846">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334412440846">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334412440846">18</xref></sup> use of donor milk,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412440846">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412440846">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334412440846">17</xref></sup> provision of skin-to-skin contact/kangaroo mother care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412440846">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412440846">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334412440846">18</xref></sup> and measuring of milk transfer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334412440846">18</xref></sup> The implementation of a modification of the Ten Steps in an Italian NICU included support from International Board Certified Lactation Consultants (IBCLCs), provision of a room for breast milk collection, breastfeeding training for the staff, and weekly breastfeeding meetings with the mothers, and the result was an improvement of exclusive breastfeeding rates at discharge from 21% to 51%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334412440846">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Establishing breastfeeding of preterm infants is difficult, and a number of factors have been shown to complicate the breastfeeding process. For the mother, these factors include delayed lactation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334412440846">20</xref></sup> and diminishing milk volume,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0890334412440846">21</xref></sup> and for the infant, neurological immaturity and medical fragility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334412440846">10</xref></sup> Factors supporting the establishment of breastfeeding in preterm infants are time spent skin-to-skin with the parents,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0890334412440846">22</xref></sup> as well as hospital practices (how the unit is structured, care is provided, and existing guidelines are used).</p>
<p>Studies have described the optimal conditions for breastfeeding infants in the NICU,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334412440846">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412440846">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334412440846">17</xref></sup> but to our knowledge, no studies cover a national (or regional) survey of breastfeeding support in the NICU. A national survey could provide the background for improving breastfeeding support in the NICU at a national level, for comparing NICUs, and for inspiring national and international NICUs to improve breastfeeding support. Therefore, the aim was to describe breastfeeding support in NICUs in Denmark.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section9-0890334412440846">
<title>Design</title>
<p>A national survey of breastfeeding support in all Danish NICUs was conducted from August-October 2009. The survey was developed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0890334412440846">23</xref></sup> and approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency, as by Danish law, surveys do not need to be approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0890334412440846">23</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0890334412440846">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>Denmark has 5.5 million inhabitants and about 63 000 births per year, 7% of which are premature. Most preterm infants are admitted to NICUs, except for some of the late preterm infants (34-37 weeks of gestation) who are assessed not to be in need of neonatal intensive care.</p>
<p>The classification of NICUs varies internationally. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0890334412440846">24</xref></sup> the classification is by gestational age and weight and by grade: II (low intensive care), IIIa (medium intensive care), or IIIb-IIIc (both high intensive care). By “international practice,” as described by Finström,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0890334412440846">25</xref></sup> the classification is according to hospital services and grade: IIb (low intensive care), IIa (medium intensive care), or III (high intensive care). One of the NICUs in Denmark includes infants from 32 weeks of gestation (low intensive care); 14 NICUs include infants from 26 to 28 weeks of gestation (medium intensive care), and 4 NICUs have no lower limits of gestational age (high intensive care). Of these 4 NICUs, 3 provide surgery as well. In this article they are all called NICUs, as they all provide at least continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment for preterm infants. Because of the Scandinavian minimally invasive approach, ventilator treatment is used less often than nasal CPAP treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0890334412440846">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>All Danish citizens have access to treatment in public hospitals free of charge. Parents in Denmark are entitled, in connection with the birth, to paid parental leave. Mothers have paid leave for a minimum of 4 weeks before birth and up to 10.5 months after birth, of which 7.5 can be shared with the partner. Maternal leave is extended with the length of the hospital stay to a maximum of 3 months if the infant is born preterm or stays at hospital because of illness. Partners have 2 weeks’ leave following birth. An additional year of parental leave is possible without pay.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0890334412440846">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The head nurses at each of the 19 Danish NICUs were informed about the study in writing 2 months in advance. All of them answered and gave their written consent to be included in the study. Coded questionnaires were mailed to each head nurse. The head nurses were told that the questionnaire should be answered in cooperation with nurses from the unit with extensive experience in supporting mothers in the breastfeeding of preterm infants. The head nurse is the everyday leader of the unit who is involved in the daily nurses’ conferences in which the infants’ conditions, including their progress in breastfeeding, are discussed. Reminders were sent after 1 and 2 months. All data were handled confidentially.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0890334412440846">
<title>Instrument</title>
<p>Based on a review of the literature and input from an expert panel, a questionnaire including 56 questions was developed. The expert panel consisted of 8 neonatal nurses, each with 10-20 years of experience in the breastfeeding of preterm infants. Four of them were IBCLCs.</p>
<p>The questions in the questionnaire referred to unit characteristics, supportive family measures, and breastfeeding guidelines and practices found to be important in order to support breastfeeding. There were 12 questions concerning unit characteristics, such as systematic breastfeeding training for the staff, IBCLC among the staff, and whether or not the hospital was a designated Baby-Friendly hospital. Supportive family measures included 13 questions, for example, concerning education and the information material about breastfeeding provided, restrictions with regard to parents’ presence, and the provision of mother-infant rooming-in. Breastfeeding guidelines and practice included 31 questions such as whether or not the use of infant feeding bottles (regardless of contents) was avoided, or whether mothers were encouraged to start early in expressing breast milk and supported in making enough milk, whether preterm infants were put to the breast at an early stage, and whether skin-to-skin contact between infants and parents was encouraged at an early stage, continuously, and for a prolonged period. A further description of the questionnaire can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0890334412440846">Table 1</xref>. The questionnaire provided alternative responses to each question. In general, only 1 option had to be chosen, but multiple answers were possible when appropriate.</p>

<p>Systematic breastfeeding training for the staff, written breastfeeding policies, and written guidelines for the staff regarding breastfeeding-related topics were common (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0890334412440846">Table 3</xref>). The most common written guidelines were about pumping breast milk (n = 17), breastfeeding preterm infants (n = 16), nipple shields (n = 15), pacifiers (n = 11), and skin-to-skin contact (n = 10), and the least common were guidelines about prenatal information to mothers. Most units had early timing of initiation of breast milk pumping. Sixteen units advised mothers to pump colostrum 6-8 times a day before initiation of copious milk secretion, and 15 units advised mothers to continue pumping 6-8 times a day (or whatever was required for a daily production of 500 mL) after initiation of copious milk secretion. Pumping during the night was encouraged in all units, and double pumping in most, especially if the mothers did not have enough milk. The NICUs at designated Baby-Friendly hospitals had a higher number of such strategies, but the difference was not statistically significant.</p>
<p>Skin-to-skin contact between the preterm infant and the parents was encouraged in all units, and 18 units aimed to initiate skin-to-skin contact within the infant’s first 24 hours of life.

<p>During transition from exclusive tube feeding to exclusive breastfeeding, the most common method for supplementation in all NICUs was tube feeding. Donor milk was used in 16 units, but with different limits (eg, gestational age and weight). Supplementation with donor milk or infant formula was used when the mother’s milk supply did not cover the infant’s needs. Infants that did not fulfill the criteria for donor milk were given infant formula in the absence of their mother’s milk. In 2 NICUs, the infants were sometimes offered supplementation (breast milk/donor milk or infant formula) with infant feeding bottles during the transition when exclusive breastfeeding was still the goal. Pacifiers for preterm infants were used in all NICUs if the parents approved, but in 10 units, the use of pacifiers during the breastfeeding transition was minimized. Weight loss in the first days after transition to exclusive breastfeeding was accepted in all units. One unit did not answer the questions about change of pacifier use and weight loss. Not all units used test-weighing (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0890334412440846">Table 3</xref>). All NICUs allowed the combination of the preterm infant suckling at the breast when the infant still had nasal CPAP.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The survey of breastfeeding support in Danish NICUs showed that all units had strategies to support breastfeeding of preterm infants, but that the number and intensity of strategies varied among the NICUs. In all units, the mothers could room-in for the last days before the infant’s discharge, and most of the units had no restrictions to the presence of the parents, as well as no introduction of infant feeding bottles (regardless of contents) to breastfeeding infants. Skin-to-skin contact was practiced in all units, but with different duration.</p>
<p>Only 4 (21%) of the NICUs were situated in a Baby-Friendly hospital, but all units fulfilled some of the criteria for Baby-Friendly hospitals. In comparison, Greisen et al showed that 88% of Swedish NICUs, 33% of UK NICUs, and a very small percentage in other European countries were situated in Baby-Friendly hospitals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0890334412440846">29</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section20-0890334412440846">
<title>Family Conditions</title>
<p>Most of the Danish NICUs had no restrictions on parents’ presence. The Danish NICUs had beds for approximately half of the infants’ mothers, and in all the NICUs, the mother could room-in together with the infant for at least the last few days and nights before the infant’s discharge, in order to establish exclusive breastfeeding. This finding is supported by a European study, which shows that Denmark, Sweden, and the United Kingdom are less restrictive to parents’ presence in the NICU than other European countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0890334412440846">29</xref></sup> Greisen also found that all Swedish NICUs had beds for parents in the units, and the number of NICUs with beds for parents decreases gradually as one travels southward in Europe. The BFHI documents also stress the nonseparation paradigm in 1 of the Ten Steps to support breastfeeding,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334412440846">14</xref></sup> and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child states in Article 9 that infants shall not be separated from their parents against their will. These documents cover all children irrespective of the child’s birth or other status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0890334412440846">30</xref></sup></p>

<p>Sixteen (84%) of the units in the present study had a written breastfeeding policy. Data from NICUs in other countries are not accessible, but the findings are similar to those found in maternity units (94% and 85%) in 2 North American studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0890334412440846">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0890334412440846">32</xref></sup> Fifteen (79%) NICUs in the present study had systematic breastfeeding training for the staff. In comparison, 42% and 67%, respectively, of the maternity units in the above mentioned North American studies had staff breastfeeding training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0890334412440846">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0890334412440846">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Skin-to-skin contact between the preterm infant and the parents was common practice in all of the Danish NICUs, but with a different estimated average duration not exceeding 8 hours per day, and for most units, with less skin-to-skin time after the infants were transferred to a cot. The original Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) concept from Colombia recommends skin-to-skin contact 24 hours a day for warmth, development, and comfort,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0890334412440846">33</xref></sup> but this practice is not common in Denmark, although skin-to-skin contact is used in Denmark for even extremely preterm infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0890334412440846">34</xref></sup> The results of the present study showed that skin-to-skin contact was used to a great extent, even when infants had umbilical catheters or were receiving phototherapy. A study of NICUs’ skin-to-skin practices in the United States found more restrictive use, with fewer units practicing skin-to-skin contact (82%), and with umbilical catheters and phototherapy to a greater extent being barriers to skin-to-skin contact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0890334412440846">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>In all Danish NICUs, tube feeding was the most common method for supplementation during the transition to exclusive breastfeeding. Only 2 NICUs sometimes offered a bottle-feeding alternative during the transition. The term “Baby-Friendly hospitals” is well known in Danish hospitals. In particular, the step about avoiding the use of infant feeding bottles seemed to have been adopted in Danish NICUs, even though only 4 were located in designated Baby-Friendly hospitals. In the Ten Steps, pacifiers are not recommended for term infants, but with the parents approval, all Danish NICUs offer pacifiers to preterm infants for calming. Pacifiers are widely used in NICUs in western countries, but no studies were found covering the extent to which they are used. In an Australian study, nurses believed there was a rationale for allowing certain practices, such as using pacifiers, in the NICU because infants in the NICU were different. However, this practice was not supported within the BFHI framework in the maternity unit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0890334412440846">36</xref></sup> In a Swedish modification of the Ten Steps to neonatal care, the use of a pacifier is encouraged for the relief of pain, stress, and anxiety, and for stimulating the uptake of nutrients during tube feeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334412440846">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although some of the breastfeeding support strategies were used in all units, others were used in only a few units. Most of the strategies were used in more than half of the units. The 4 NICUs located at Baby-Friendly hospitals generally had a higher number of breastfeeding support strategies, but as expected, the numbers were too small to reach significance (results not shown; available from authors).</p>
<p>The present study is the first survey describing national breastfeeding support in NICUs. The results show that it is possible to support breastfeeding in several ways in NICUs, and this breastfeeding support could be adapted anywhere.</p>

<p>All Danish NICUs participated in the survey. There were only 4 missing values in total, so it can be assumed that the questionnaire was easy to understand and use. Most of the questions in the questionnaire were based on a basic knowledge of breastfeeding. As a validated questionnaire about conditions in the NICU that support breastfeeding was not found, a literature search in PubMed and Cinahl, a manual search, and agreement in an expert group was used for developing the questionnaire; the questionnaire was tested for validity, but not for reliability. All self-administered questionnaires run the risk of response bias,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0890334412440846">37</xref></sup> such as the tendency of some respondents to present themselves in a better light. The use of fixed-answer options enhances the chance of an accurate description. The survey was not an assessment, which was clearly explained to the respondents, and the respondents could not benefit from giving an overly positive picture of their unit.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The survey showed that Danish NICUs described their support of breastfeeding as being highly prioritized, which was reflected in skin-to-skin contact and parents’ presence in the NICU, practices of breast milk pumping and supplementation via feeding tubes, and avoiding the use of infant feeding bottles as a common practice. However, not all units optimally supported breastfeeding, and there is still room for improvement especially with regard to minimizing maternal-infant separation. Further research is needed to evaluate the extent to which these breastfeeding support strategies affect breastfeeding rates in the NICU.</p>
