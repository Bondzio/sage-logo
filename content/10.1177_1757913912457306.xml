<p>As noted by Professor Richard Parish in the recent Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) podcast (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rsph.org.uk">www.rsph.org.uk</ext-link>), a large body of evidence supports the importance of funding public health services and entities. It not only helps to promote population health and well-being (a key priority for the OECD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913912457306">1</xref></sup> but it also supports economic progress.</p>
<p>A report from the Public Health Clinical Network (PHCN)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1757913912457306">i</xref></sup> entitled, Core Public Health Functions for New Zealand, identifies five core public health functions:</p>
<list id="list1-1757913912457306" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>health assessment and surveillance;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>public health capacity development;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>health promotion;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>health protection; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>preventive interventions.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Yet how is our day-to-day work addressing these core functions? How well positioned are we to fulfil them? Have we heeded the warnings issued by Dr Margaret Chan in her address to the 23<sup>rd</sup> Forum on Global Issues that: <italic>“the world desperately needs a corrective strategy. The current huge gaps, in income levels, opportunities, and health outcomes, are a precursor for social breakdown. A world that is greatly out of balance in matters of health is neither stable nor secure.”</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913912457306">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>As with most of the developed world, New Zealand strives to address inequality and maintain core public health services in the face of funding constraints. We are very fortunate that our public health systems have allowed us to bear much of this without compromising basic services. However, epidemics of vaccine preventable disease are still being fought, and we are challenged by a small but significant minority who have never experienced the devastation of an epidemic uncontained by public health interventions and the benefits of herd immunity.</p>
<p>Additionally, in New Zealand we are in the unenviable position of still having to address what is fundamentally a third world disease, rheumatic fever, that has its roots in poverty and inequality, disproportionately affecting Maori and Pacific children. Considerable additional funds have recently been allocated to the detection and treatment of ‘sore throats’ although in the absence of dealing with root causes it is quite unclear whether a sustainable reduction is achievable.</p>
<p>As many negative health statistics persist, for example in child health, communicable and non communicable diseases, how do we re-focus our efforts on up-stream, effective and efficient preventive interventions? If not, as in other similar societies, we may find ourselves putting the bigger picture to one side and devoting more time and resources to fighting rather than preventing epidemics.</p>
<p>The cost-effectiveness of a well resourced public health service is acknowledged. As important as it is to ensure that ‘frontline’ medical services are available to those in need, as public health doctors we need to advocate for the retention and appropriate development of services that protect public health both nationally and internationally. Our recent significant measles outbreak had international origins, once again underscoring our global interdependence and the potential vulnerability of any country if adequate public health measures are under-resourced. We need to ensure we can act locally in order to shoulder our global responsibility.</p>
<p>As a society we are seeing the edges of many social programmes being ‘chipped away’ as organizations are increasingly forced to prioritise the urgent and important at the expense of more future focused initiatives that we know enhance the lives of communities and assist in the reduction of health inequalities. We share the concerns of international colleagues and note with interest the developments in the UK. Recent comments from Dr Gabriel Scally who prescribes serious investment in prevention, rather than treatment of illness, as well as the integration of health and social care as an answer to rising demand, resonate here in the antipodes.</p>
<p>Operating within static or even declining resources is a current reality for many social sectors and public health is certainly not unique in this regard. However, as Dr Chan noted, the ongoing financial crisis poses real risks to global health in all its manifestations. The question we may have to ask is are we helping to highlight the importance of the public health contribution and can we be more effective in insisting on the maintenance of key services to protect long-term health outcomes? The document prepared by the PHCN was one local attempt in this regard.</p>
<p>As public health practitioners we need to continue to advocate for public health locally and globally. Can we see what’s being affected in the current climate and are we advocating for a responsible and practical bottom line for public health?</p>

<p>The Public Health Clinical Network is comprised of Clinical Directors and Managers of each Public Health Unit. It does not purport to represent the totality of public health services in New Zealand. It prepared this document to provide input to policy makers and funding agencies on the range of public health services that a modern society would expect to be in evidence. The report, Core Public Health Functions for New Zealand, is available on the NZCPHM website.</p>
