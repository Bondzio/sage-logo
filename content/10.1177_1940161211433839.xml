<abstract>
<p>In recent years, political parties have reacted to far-reaching transformations in their media and sociocultural environments. These changes and adaptations, often assembled under the catchword “professionalization,” become most apparent during electoral campaigns. However, the campaign professionalism of political parties has not yet been systematically “measured,” having been examined mostly in single case studies. Against this background, we present an empirical test of the party-centered theory of professionalization. Ours is a four-country comparison of the campaign structures and strategies of political parties during the most recent European parliamentary elections. Our analyses demonstrate a wide variety in professional electoral campaigning. There are differences in campaign structures that not only point to country specifics but also to the impact of the size of the parties. We also ask whether there are differences between parties owing to their position on a right–left scale. Our findings point to some general trends in electoral campaigning that seem to be typical of societies with democratic corporatist media systems. Those similarities and country-specifics should be taken into account in future empirical analyses, which might benefit from our methodological approach.</p>

<title>Introduction<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1940161211433839">1</xref></sup></title>
<p>In most European Union member states, turnout for the European parliamentary (EP) elections has always been considerably below the participation rates in national elections. Furthermore, EU-wide, participation has dropped steadily, from 63 percent in 1979 to 43 percent in 2009. On one hand, such shrinking turnout reflects the EU’s geographic and political expansion to young democracies that lack long traditions of electoral participation. On the other hand, the increasing unwillingness of voters to cast their ballots points to growing deficiencies across the EU in creating electoral publics and mobilizing voters, especially younger ones. In fact, the number of voters who view EP elections as second-order national events has grown over the last three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1940161211433839">Steinbrecher and Huber 2006</xref>). In the perception of these voters, there is less at stake than in first-order national elections and referenda. Moreover, even in EU elections, the national political arena seems to be more important than the European one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161211433839">de Vreese et al. 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Low levels of attention and prevailing domestic frameworks in the minds of voters cannot be isolated from the campaign environment in which EP elections take place. Thus, the engagement of the mass media and the commitment of political parties to EP campaigns have increasingly become topics of investigation (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1940161211433839">Maier et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1940161211433839">Maier and Tenscher 2006</xref>). As numerous studies have demonstrated, in most EU countries, the EP campaign coverage is rather marginalized, low in visibility and common European content (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1940161211433839">de Vreese et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1940161211433839">Schuck et al. 2011</xref>). But the mass media are not the only ones to blame for the second-order coverage; the political parties as well are responsible for their second-order campaigning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1940161211433839">Bicchi et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1940161211433839">Cayrol 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1940161211433839">de Vreese 2009</xref>). Faced with both a rather uninformed and disinterested citizenry and a relatively restrained media environment, political parties have repeatedly campaigned in a “low heated and half-hearted” way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1940161211433839">Tenscher 2006</xref>) for the European Parliament, spending considerably less money and fewer efforts in EP elections than in domestic elections, while turning EP elections into national events.</p>
<p>Although the notion of half-hearted enthusiasm vis-à-vis EP elections is widespread, there is a far-reaching deficit in empirical studies that directly compares (cross-nationally or longitudinally) with EP campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1940161211433839">Bicchi et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1940161211433839">Bowler and Farrell 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1940161211433839">de Vreese 2009</xref>). Existing comparative studies habitually refer to countries as units of analysis. Although this macro focus is widespread in political communication research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1940161211433839">Swanson and Mancini 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1940161211433839">Negrine et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1940161211433839">Norris 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1940161211433839">Plasser and Plasser 2003</xref>), it conceals differences in campaigning within countries.</p>
<p>While differences on the macro level are quite reasonable, owing to diverse political cultures, political, party, media, and voting systems, variations on the meso level seem to be plausible, given the backdrop of distinct party cultures, campaign goals, party structures, and—last but not least—financial and personal resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161211433839">Gibson and Römmele 2001</xref>). Respective differences and particularities become obvious when we change the perspective from the macro to the meso level of politics, namely, to the political parties and their campaign activities. Some notable efforts have been made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1940161211433839">Gibson and Römmele 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1940161211433839">Strömbäck 2009</xref>), yet these have been restricted to (1) single case studies, (2) first-order national campaigns, and (3) analyzing campaign structures, thereby neglecting campaign strategies.</p>
<p>Against this background, we will change and widen the focus to a cross-country comparison of political parties’ campaign structures <italic>and</italic> strategies in the EP elections of 2009. We are not interested in single symptoms of campaigning or in the impact of electoral campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1940161211433839">Norris et al. 1999</xref>: 97-113). Rather, we investigate modes of professional campaigning and look at explanations for differences in EP campaigning. We thereby transfer for the first time some party-related assumptions about first-order campaigning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1940161211433839">Gibson and Römmele 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1940161211433839">Strömbäck 2009</xref>) to a second-order context. Despite the national peculiarities of the electoral arena, the synchronous timing of these elections offers an excellent opportunity to test professional campaigning at a particular moment in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1940161211433839">Bowler and Farrell 2011</xref>). Such a test not only demonstrates differences between parties and countries but also helps detect factors on the macro and the meso levels that impede or foster professional campaigning.</p>
<p>In this study, we focus on multiparty systems. We believe that the party level is most productive in terms of finding explanations for campaign professionalism, and for this we need a number of parties. Thus, with a few countries having a multiparty system, this objective can be reached. The countries chosen are quite similar with regard to their political, media, and party systems. Austria, Finland, Germany, and Sweden belong to the so-called North/Central European or democratic corporatist model of media and politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1940161211433839">Hallin and Mancini 2004</xref>: 143-97), facilitating comparisons on the political parties’ meso level. Yet the countries also show some relevant differences, thereby making the country-level analysis meaningful. Before we look at the empirical findings, we briefly substantiate the concept of professional campaigning from which a model of campaign measurement will be derived. Finally, our findings are summarized and discussed.</p>

<title>Professional Campaigning and the Process of Professionalization</title>
<p>It is common wisdom that the way electoral campaigns are planned, organized, and conducted has changed profoundly in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1940161211433839">de Vreese 2009</xref>: 7-9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161211433839">Farrell and Webb 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1940161211433839">Plasser and Plasser 2003</xref>). Faced with fundamental changes in the sociocultural, political, and media environment, political parties have initiated substantial transformations, both in their organizational structures and in their communicative strategies. First, they have made remarkable efforts to address the needs of the electoral market, the voters, the campaigns, and electoral success (“electoralization”; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1940161211433839">Lilleker and Lees-Marshment 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1940161211433839">Plasser et al. 1999</xref>). Second, political parties have been broadening their focus in recent years, from party to media logics (“mediatization”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1940161211433839">Asp and Esaiasson 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1940161211433839">Mazzoleni and Schulz 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1940161211433839">Strömbäck 2008</xref>). Third, they have striven for an enduring, strategically planned, rational, and sustainable campaign management (“professionalization”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1940161211433839">2</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161211433839">Farrell and Webb 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1940161211433839">Strömbäck 2009</xref>). Such transformations are indispensable, and they reflect political parties’ reactions and adaptations to the modernization-related transformations mentioned above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161211433839">Blumler and Kavanagh 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1940161211433839">Plasser and Plasser 2003</xref>: 22-24).</p>
<p>From the literature cited above, we have identified a set of alleged trends in political campaigns that are presented as being salient in first-order electoral campaigns, both organization-wise and with respect to political parties’ campaign strategies, as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1940161211433839" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Expanding structural, financial, and personal capabilities for cost-intensive long-term campaigning or permanent campaigning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1940161211433839">Blumenthal 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161211433839">Gibson and Römmele 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1940161211433839">Mair et al. 1999</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A shift toward externalization and commercialization of specific campaign tasks by resorting to hired professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161211433839">Blumler and Kavanagh 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161211433839">Farrell and Webb 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1940161211433839">Negrine 2007</xref>: 33-35; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1940161211433839">Plasser and Plasser 2003</xref>: 5).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A change from “selling” to “marketing” the political product (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1940161211433839">Lilleker and Lees-Marshment 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1940161211433839">Norris 2000</xref>: 171), including the use of market intelligence, opposition research, feedback tools, opinion polls, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161211433839">Gibson and Römmele 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1940161211433839">Holtz-Bacha 2007</xref>:71; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161211433839">Nord 2007</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increased focus on free media channels, particularly the broad spectrum of television formats, including entertainment and talk shows, based on professional event and news management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1940161211433839">Norris 2000</xref>: 170-72; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1940161211433839">Plasser and Plasser 2003</xref>: 4-6).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Intensified use of paid media platforms such as TV or radio spots, posters, ads, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1940161211433839">de Vreese 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1940161211433839">Plasser and Plasser 2003</xref>: 294-98; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1940161211433839">Wring 2001</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Segmentation of the voters into target groups, which are contacted by narrowcasting and micro-targeting (e.g., direct mails, direct e-mails, direct callings, canvassing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161211433839">Gibson and Römmele 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1940161211433839">Römmele 2002</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Strategic focus on the frontrunner, who acts as a principal agent of the political party (“personalization”) (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1940161211433839">Blumler and Kavanagh 1999</xref>: 213-14; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1940161211433839">Campus 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1940161211433839">Farrell and Webb 2000</xref>:122).</p></list-item></list>
<p>Many of these features may be operationalized to indicators for respective changes. It can be assumed that the more these elements are integrated into an electoral campaign, the more “professional” is the campaign. Furthermore, the manner and speed with which political parties turn to these components of professional campaigning might reflect their size, their organizational structure and culture, their parliamentary role, and even their ideological orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161211433839">Gibson and Römmele 2001</xref>: 37-38). To test these assumptions, a model is needed that is independent of temporal or spatial conditions, allows international and longitudinal comparisons, and adequately reflects differences in the campaign efforts of political parties. Such a party-related model or index was introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161211433839">Gibson and Römmele (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1940161211433839">2009</xref>) and slightly adjusted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1940161211433839">Strömbäck (2009)</xref>. Although its general applicability, the so-called “CAMPROF Index,” is biased toward “new” media technologies, which impedes longitudinal comparisons, it is nevertheless an index that looks exclusively at campaign structures (finances, personnel, infrastructure, and communicative resources), thereby neglecting strategic adaptations. As mentioned above, however, it is the organizational and strategic level on which political parties’ transformations take place, irrespective of whether it is a first- or second-order election campaign. Metaphorically speaking, the structure reflects organizational preconditions for campaigning, much like campaigns’ “hardware,” while the strategic conducting of the campaign stands for a political party’s campaign “software”.</p>
<p>Against this background, we introduce a modified and expanded index, which consists of two sub-indices: campaign structures and campaign strategies. Both indices incorporate a number of components, which are measured on different scales and added to those indices (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1940161211433839">appendix</xref>). Generally speaking, the more extensively a campaign element is used, the higher it scores on the indices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1940161211433839">3</xref></sup> The “campaign structure” index consists of eight items<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1940161211433839">4</xref></sup>: the size of the election campaign budget, the size of the campaign staff, the degree of centralization of the campaign organization, the degree of externalization, the differentiation of internal communication structures, the nature and degree of feedback, the degree of opposition research, and the duration of the campaign. The “campaign strategy” index consists of seven items: the degree of audience targeting, the degree of narrowcasting activities, the relevance of paid media, the relevance of free media, the relevance of talk shows, the degree of event and news management, and the degree of personalization.</p>
<p>Most of these items are objectively measured variables. However, for the strategic side of a campaign, it is not only the objective “reality” that is relevant but also the intersubjectively shared perceptions of a party’s reality that matters. For that reason, we have included some subjectively measured variables, such as the relevance of free media, paid media, or talk shows. For those variables, we turned to evaluations of the campaign managers in charge whom we contacted in the aftermath of the EP elections in 2009. Even though their statements might have been “edited” in light of the electoral outcome, these materials seem to offer the most valid way of obtaining insights into the campaign reality to date (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1940161211433839">Gibson and Römmele 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>All of those components are measured by scores, with a score of 24 being the maximum for the campaign structure index and 26 for the campaign strategy index (details can be found in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1940161211433839">appendix</xref>). For the analyses, absolute scores were first transformed into <italic>z</italic> scores, which equalize differences of scales and distributions of single items. Second, as the <italic>z</italic> scores have no clear low or high ends, both scales were forced onto the 0 to 100 range. Cronbach’s alpha was calculated for both indices. For the structural index, Cronbach’s alpha was .60. Although this value fails to reach the .70 level commonly taken as the standard, we decided to keep the index intact for theoretical reasons. The strategy index was more reliable (α = .74).</p>
<p>The following hypotheses guided the empirical investigation (the first two deal with campaign structure, the next three are concerned with campaign strategy, and the last two concern both campaign structure and campaign strategy):</p>
<list id="list2-1940161211433839" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1: Campaign structures</italic> in the two Central European countries, Austria and Germany, are assumed to be more elaborate than in the two Scandinavian countries. This assumption comes from single case studies of national elections in Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1940161211433839">Holtz-Bacha 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1940161211433839">Tenscher 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1940161211433839">2011</xref>), Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1940161211433839">Nord 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1940161211433839">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1940161211433839">Strömbäck 2009</xref>), Austria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1940161211433839">Lederer 2010</xref>), and Finland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1940161211433839">Moring and Mykkänen 2009</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Bigger political parties are assumed to score higher on the campaign structure index than smaller ones. The rationale behind this assumption is that bigger parties benefit from their size, both in regard to financial resources and the number of party members.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: There is no significant country impact on <italic>campaign strategies</italic> in any of the four countries because professional campaign strategies are assumed to form an important part of a common campaign culture in Northern and Central Europe.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: Smaller political parties are assumed to score almost as high as their bigger competitors on the campaign strategy index. This is based on the assumption that smaller parties try to compensate for their structural shortcomings by focusing on campaign strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1940161211433839">Tenscher 2006</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 5</italic>: Catch-all parties are assumed to score higher on the campaign strategy index than client parties. The rationale behind this assumption is that catch-all parties are encouraged to use as many media channels as possible in order to get in touch with their voters, while niche parties might concentrate on just a few channels.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 6</italic>: Right-wing parties are assumed to score higher than left-wing parties, both on the campaign structure index as well as on the campaign strategy index. This assumption is based on Gibson’s and Römmele’s party-centered theory of professional campaigning, which associates right-wing parties with “business-like practices” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161211433839">Gibson and Römmele 2001</xref>:37).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 7</italic>: Parties that have experienced an external or internal shock in the form of an electoral defeat or a change in the party leadership before an election will score higher on both the <italic>structural and the strategy indices</italic>. This assumption is likewise based on the party-centered theory of professional campaigning: After an electoral defeat, a party will be anxious to retain its previous support; after a change of party leader, the party is likely to intensify campaigning to secure the position of the new leadership.</p></list-item></list>

<title>Selection of Countries and Data Collection</title>
<p>As stated in the beginning, we wanted to include countries in our comparison that are similar but not entirely identical. This was done in order to reveal differences on the party level, which is our main locus of interest, but also to allow for potential country-level variation. There are, of course, several possible combinations of countries that form clusters with a fair number of macro-level similarities. So far, our study has been limited to four countries that are easily accessible to our research team. Besides practicalities, access is important because the study involves interviewing political elites and having local knowledge. The targeted countries, two in Northern Europe (Finland and Sweden) and two in Central Europe (Austria and Germany), belong to the well-established European democracies. All four have a parliamentary political system; their party systems are pluralistic with slight variations, and their media systems are all democratic-corporatist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1940161211433839">Hallin and Mancini 2004</xref>). The most significant differences concern voting systems, coalition formation, and campaign regulation. Germany and Finland are set apart, owing to a voting system that (partly in Germany and fully in Finland) encourages individual candidate campaigns in contrast to predominantly list voting in the other two countries. Finland, Germany, and Austria have also been more liberal in the regulation of campaign media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1940161211433839">Holtz-Bacha and Kaid 2006</xref>) than Sweden, where political advertising on television was only recently allowed. Austria and Finland have a tradition of multiparty coalition governments that may bridge the left–right cleavage, whereas Germany and Sweden follow a block-based government model with clear emphasis on the left–right division. The countries also differ somewhat in their relation to the European Union, Germany being an original member with a large number of delegates in the European Parliament, whereas Austria, Finland, and Sweden are much less populated countries that entered the EU in 1995. Yet even for the latter three countries, the length of membership has been long enough to have allowed parties to develop a relatively stable manner of campaigning in the European elections. Last but not least, the four countries were similar in the low levels of turnout for the two last EP elections. The country characteristics are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1940161211433839">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Within the four countries, we selected all of the political parties that had at least one delegate in the 2004 European Parliament as well as those parties that, according to preelection polls, were expected to win at least one seat in the 2009 elections. A total of twenty-eight parties (five from Austria, eight from Finland, six from Germany, and nine from Sweden) were selected for data collection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1940161211433839">5</xref></sup> Each country team approached the parties and arranged for interviews with campaign managers or their equivalents. In some countries, interviews were done in two waves, one six weeks before the elections took place in June and one right after the elections. Here, only post-election data are used. The interviews were conducted during the summer of 2009 either personally (Austria, Finland, Sweden) or using a semi-standardized mail questionnaire (Germany), which measured different aspects of campaign structures and campaign strategies. The pre-election questionnaire consisted of eight questions; the post-election questionnaire had twenty questions. A small number of questions fell outside the theme of professional campaigning and are to be used in other studies, but the main purpose of the interviews was to collect data for the items on our indices. The questionnaire was designed so that it could be used either as a thematic guide in personal interviews or could stand alone in a survey. The personal interviews were naturally richer in content and somewhat more free-flowing, which required the interviewers to take notes on the spot and recode the information to fit the questionnaire’s structure.</p>

<title>Modes of Campaigning</title>

In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1940161211433839">Table 2</xref>, the party scores on the professionalization indices are presented in country groups from the highest total score to the lowest.

The German Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) are by far the most professionalized parties. The Finnish True Finns Party (PS) and the Swedish Pirate Party show almost no signs of professional campaigning. The Finnish Left Alliance (VAS) is structurally advanced, but has a nonprofessional strategy. The great majority of parties are quite professionalized in both dimensions, yet they do not form a very homogenous group.</p>

<title>Explaining Modes of Campaigning</title>
<p>The party scores presented above show a good deal of variation, although we can initially assume that the outlier parties will turn out to be problematic for statistical analysis. Because our independent variables were not originally measured on an interval scale throughout and because the number of cases remained small, only a comparison of means was used. Multivariate analysis would require more parties in the study.</p>
<p>First, we tested the hypotheses related to campaign structure, that is, the effects of country group and party size.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1940161211433839">6</xref></sup> We assumed that Germany and Austria would score higher on the structural index than Finland and Sweden and that the same would be true the bigger the party. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1940161211433839">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1940161211433839">3</xref>, we see that the first two hypotheses were correct. The Central European parties are clearly ahead in building professionalized campaign structures by comparison with the Northern European parties. The campaign structures of big parties were twice as professionalized compared with small parties. This observation can be partly explained by the fact that structural elements in a campaign typically require funds that are more often available to the big parties. The four countries in our study have institutionalized proportional public funding schemes for parliamentary parties. The relationship between size and funds is not straightforward, however. For example, besides public funding, the small Swedish People’s Party in Finland receives ample funding from the country’s richest private foundation. For big parties without such an income source, an electoral defeat can result in lean years and lay-offs of regular staff members.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1940161211433839-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Second, we tested the hypotheses related to campaign strategies. In the three hypotheses, we assumed that country has no relevance for campaign strategy, that small parties compensate for their relative structural weakness by investing in campaign strategy, and that catch-all parties pay more attention to strategy than client parties because their voter base is more heterogeneous. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1940161211433839">Figure 4</xref> shows that the first of these assumptions was correct: the country has no statistically significant effect on the level of professionalism in campaign strategy. This indicates that although there are country-specific differences in campaign “hardware” (the structure), the tactics to which the parties resort are quite similar across the four countries. This finding points to the diffusion of various strategic elements encountered in European electoral campaigns and a possible tendency toward uniformity of campaigns. In all four countries, there was some evidence of European-level cooperation between parties.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1940161211433839-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1940161211433839">Figure 5</xref>, our hypotheses about the effect of party size at least pointed in the right direction. Although big parties are also more professionalized in terms of their campaign strategies, the relationship between party size and campaign strategy is not linear. The <italic>F</italic> test is statistically not significant; thus, we conclude that our assumption was not fully proven.</p>

</fig>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1940161211433839">Table 3</xref>, the <italic>F</italic> test shows too much within-group variation; hence the hypothesis about catch-all parties showing more signs of professional campaign strategy was not supported. Because client parties usually rely on a stable voter base, we are hopeful, as long as the group means are proportionally correct, that in future research a larger number of parties may improve the statistical test in favor of our assumption.</p>

<p>Third, we tested the hypotheses that predicted effects on both of our indices. We assumed that these effects would be visible in parties that have experienced either an electoral defeat or changed their leadership prior to an election as well as in the right-wing parties. We measured electoral defeat as the difference in the voters’ share between the next to the last and the last national parliamentary election before the 2009 European election. For these hypotheses, the results were mainly negative and partly mixed. A change in the party’s electoral success did not correlate with professional campaign strategy (<italic>r</italic> = .12, <italic>p</italic> = .57), whereas campaign structure showed a moderate correlation in favor of our assumption (<italic>r</italic> = .43, <italic>p</italic> = .03). As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1940161211433839">Table 4</xref> shows, as an indicator of an internal shock, change of party leadership clearly had no effect on campaign strategy, whereas the effect on campaign structure was nearly statistically significant. However, given the small number of parties studied, this observation must be treated with caution. Party ideology fared poorly on both occasions.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>After empirical analysis, it appears that the Central European parties invest more in their campaign structures than do their Northern counterparts. Large parties show more signs of structural professionalization than do midsized or small parties or parties that had an electoral defeat in recent memory. In terms of campaign strategy, we were able to prove that country and party size were not relevant factors in explaining the parties’ strategic choices. The catch-all dimension, party ideology, and change of party leadership failed to produce the predicted results and seem to be unrelated to campaign professionalism. In the question of campaign strategies alone, this seems to indicate that parties in general are more or less decidedly, if not uniformly, moving toward adopting similar strategic means in conducting their campaigns.</p>
<p>In general, the results show a variety of professional campaign activities, even within the largest cluster of parties. That supports our assumption that the differences in professional campaigning between countries are smaller than the differences between political parties within one and the same country. This finding clearly holds true for the two Nordic countries, Finland and Sweden. It also appears that smaller parties, independent of geographic origin, choose a strategic way to adapt to media logic and attract public attention on a short-term basis, while bigger parties tend to invest in organizational transformations that promise stable relationships (1) within parties and (2) between parties and the media/public. This organizational approach meets the criteria of political marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1940161211433839">Lees-Marshment 2001</xref>) but does not guarantee short-term success on election day.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this analysis produced results that fit quite poorly or only partially with the party-centered theory of campaign professionalism (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161211433839">Gibson and Römmele 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1940161211433839">Strömbäck 2009</xref>). Although our study was not primarily designed for testing the party-centered theory, it is quite clear that campaigns are more complex than the theory states. In the second-order electoral contexts of our study, catch-all parties—which prefer vote maximization over policy goals—did not stand out as particularly professional, contrary to the predictions of the theory. Neither did “business-oriented” right-wing parties or parties that had experienced a change of leadership prior to elections, which, according to the theory, should trigger professionalized campaigning as part of the consolidation of the new rule. Only an electoral defeat seemed to explain the parties’ resorting to professionalism, but only in terms of their campaign structures. In this sense, the hunt for good explanatory variables continues.</p>
<p>Still, this study adds some noteworthy empirical findings to the rapidly evolving “theory” on the professionalization of political communication (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1940161211433839">Negrine et al. 2007</xref>). First, it supports the assumption that there is something like a “Western European style of campaigning” (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1940161211433839">Plasser and Plasser 2003</xref>: 285-87)—at least in a strategic, though not in a structural sense. These are two distinct dimensions of campaign professionalization that are associated with different explanatory models of campaigning. Campaign structures seem to have a logic of their own, which is only partly connected with what parties do strategically. The correlation between the two variables is low (<italic>r</italic> = .41, <italic>p</italic> = .03). In many ways, professional strategy is commonly shared by almost all parties, irrespective of their material base.</p>
<p>Second, although there is a Western European style of professional campaigning, it might be restricted to second-order elections that simultaneously take place in all EU member states. At least to some extent, that might reflect transnational endeavors in campaigning in which the European branches of the political parties (“Europarties”) take a leading role (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1940161211433839">Carter and Poguntke 2010</xref>). Yet, it has to be explored to what extent electoral campaign professionalization is transferable to first-order election contexts or routine phases of political communication. It is an open question whether professionalization is more of a learning process irrespective of the type of election or if there are two levels in professionalization: an upper level with higher degrees of professional communicative activities at national first-order elections and a lower level at European and other second-order elections. If the latter case is true, such a limited degree of professionalism might explain not only media’s reluctance to cover EP elections, but also voters’ rising discomfort against EP election campaigns. That also has to be taken into account in future research, both theoretically and empirically.</p>
<p>As a consequence, we ask for a differentiated understanding of campaign professionalization. Macro-level studies should be combined with meso-level analytical approaches in separating structural from strategic elements, distinguishing between electoral campaign contexts (first- vs. second-order elections) as well as explaining variances with intraparty and external factors. Ultimately, the evolving “theory” of the professionalism of political communication and the process of professionalization will benefit from <italic>comparative analyses</italic> both in a longitudinal and cross-national sense. Concerning these matters, our study offers the first example of refocusing political communication research.</p>
<p>In terms of methodology, we have to underline the exploratory nature of this study, too. It is an early attempt to measure comparatively and to quantify the degree of professionalism of political communication activities. Quantification is a prerequisite for systematic and direct comparisons between political parties and/or countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1940161211433839">Gibson and Römmele 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1940161211433839">Strömbäck 2009</xref>). Although campaign managers’ answers (the subjective dimension), in combination with the measurement of some objective information, seem to be an appropriate way to tackle the phenomenon of campaign professionalism, the set of indicators still has to be controlled for validity. We have to leave that open for future cross-national and longitudinal analyses dealing with more cases (parties and/or countries). In that sense our study can serve as a point of reference for further comparative analyses of first- and second-order campaigning.</p>
<p>Last but not least, future analyses need to look not only for campaign efficiency but also for the impact of specific campaign features. Such evaluation studies have to control for political parties’ primary objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1940161211433839">Gibson and Römmele 2001</xref>), and they might even have to reflect campaign content with respect to its “tonality.” There is, however, much variation. Campaign “success” might mean high levels of media output, maximizing votes, positive evaluations of campaign pundits, or financial donations. Ideally, all of these aims should be quantified, and they would have to be put in a causal relationship with specific campaign structures or strategies. Although much still remains to be done, it is in the interest of political campaign research to follow this route; it is a useful way to approach a campaign’s “reality” comparatively, to assess its causes and consequences, and to begin a line of research that has a clear potential for accumulation of knowledge.</p>

<sec id="section8-1940161211433839">
<title>Professionalization Indices</title>
<p>The “Professionalization Index” consists of two additive sub-indices that measure the professionalism of (1) campaign structures and (2) campaign strategies of political parties. Both indices include multiple indicators reflecting the most important dimensions of electoral campaigning that have been widely discussed and empirically tested (see, e.g., Gibson and Römmele 2009; Norris 2000; Plasser and Plasser 2003; Strömbäck 2009; Tenscher 2007, 2011).</p>
<p>The existence as well as the magnitude of these indicators is measured with a certain score. As a general rule, the score for each indicator is generated on the basis of objective criteria. In some cases, these objective criteria are supplemented by an additional subjective assessment given by the parties’ campaign managers (marked with an asterisk). The maximum score of the overall Professionalization Index would be 50 (24 points measuring communication structures and 26 points measuring communication strategies), which, according to the status quo, would reflect 100 percent of campaign professionalism.</p>

<p>We want to thank Marie Grussell (the University of Gothenburg) and Lars Nord (Mid Sweden University, Sundsvall) for their participation and for permission to use the Swedish data. The data collection in Austria was carried out under the auspices of the Austrian National Election Study (AUTNES), a National Research Network (NFN) sponsored by the Austrian Research Fund (FWF) (S10905-G11).

<p>Although commonly used, the concept of professionalization is still somewhat ambiguous and undeveloped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1940161211433839">Negrine 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1940161211433839">Savigny and Wring 2009</xref>). We abstain from this discussion, as well as from process-related research. Instead, we focus on one specific electoral campaign and the status quo of professional campaigning.</p>

<p>Theoretically and empirically, it is unclear if an additive index adequately reflects degrees of professional campaigning. Perhaps single components have to be weighted accordingly – or perhaps intentional withdrawing of components may sometimes be a better indicator for professional campaigning than adding up the elements. As long as these questions of external validity are open, we should stay with an additive, but standardized index.</p>
