<p>Here at the <italic>Journal of Hand Surgery (European volume)</italic> we are dependent on submissions for most of what we publish. Nonetheless, we continue to seek other sources for useful information. In this edition we have included a Cochrane review and commentary on studies that compared wound cleaning with saline and tap water. I am sure this will change practice for many hand surgery units. In future issues we will publish relevant reports from the UK Confidential Reporting System for Surgery (CORESS) and have a journal watch looking at important articles published in other journals that are relevant to hand specialists. There is a very strong UK bias to this. As a British editor, I am obviously much more aware of the resources available in Britain than the rest of Europe. This is, however, a European journal, and so I want a stronger input from continental Europe. There may well be similar organizations in your own country providing reports/reviews that will be of interest to our readers. We would like to hear about them so that we can include them in the Journal.</p>
<p>We are continuing to have a podcast for one article in each issue, and I commend to you the very interesting discussion about the paper on distal interphalangeal joint arthroplasty. We would like to hear about your experience and views: write a letter, an article, or a review. From next month we will be providing commentaries on several articles in each issue. Again, the reviewers are mainly British. We will be seeking more commentators from continental Europe and would ask you to look at the papers recently published online and put yourself forward by writing to the Journal if you have some useful insights.</p>
<p>The Journal’s editorial staff and I look forward to meeting as many of our readers as possible at the Federation of European Societies for Surgery of the Hand (FESSH) meeting in Antwerp in June. Put it in your diary now!</p>
