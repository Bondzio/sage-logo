<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the benefits of Internet research is the plethora of tools available for understanding information consumption. Google Insights for Search (I4S) provides a new and unique data source for political scientists, which is particularly useful for state politics scholars. We outline the prior uses of I4S in social and health sciences, explain the data-generating process for states, and test the validity of these data for state politics research. Research demonstrates that Internet search volume is able to predict real-world behavior, such as unemployment claims and flu outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532440012438889">Ginsberg et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532440012438889">Polgreen et al. 2008</xref>). Our research is the first empirical test of validity of this data source for political science research. To do this, we use I4S query share data to correlate roll-off on ballot measures with Google search volume. Our test shows that Google searches in a state for ballot measures’ names and topics one week before the 2008 Presidential election correlate with actual roll-off on those ballot measures. This demonstrates that the more Internet searches there are for a ballot measure, the less likely voters are to not answer the question. This initial test provides evidence of construct validity for these data in an important area of state politics research. There are also limitations to this data source, which are outlined below.</p>
<p>Google is the dominant Internet search engine, used by 64.2% of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532440012438889">Prior 2007</xref>). I4S generates a scaled and normalized output demonstrating the search volume for Google searches on a particular search term by state and over time. With I4S, researchers are able to see state-by-state comparisons of the relative amount of search terms, news stories, or images created from actual Google search data. Another plus is that the data are available without charge. This tool makes it possible for state politics researchers to get comparable data for all 50 states in an easy and inexpensive manner. Importantly, these data also contain real-time results. Researchers can see search volume levels from all 50 states up to one week before the date that the researcher uses I4S. It is rare to have such a current measure of citizen interest or attention, and even less common to have a resource that allows researchers to gather data for a specific desired period across all 50 states. I4S has these capabilities. We now explore the data more in-depth.</p>

<title>I4S Data</title>
<sec id="section3-1532440012438889">
<title>Where to Get it?</title>
<p>Google provides data generated by I4S in an accessible manner with only a free Google account, such as a Gmail account, necessary for retrieval.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532440012438889">1</xref></sup> Google produces two similar search term investigation tools: Google Trends and I4S. Google Trends is the less sophisticated version of I4S, so we focus on I4S in this article.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532440012438889">2</xref></sup> I4S, unlike Google Trends, allows investigators to specify a number of parameters for their search. After the search specifications and filters are selected, Google provides the search volume results in a downloadable spreadsheet (a CSV file).</p>
<p>To use I4S, a researcher inputs a search term, news item, or image of interest. One may modify the search terms by location of searches—such as by states—or the time ranges to satisfy the specific question the researcher wants to answer. Researchers can filter their search volume results by type of search, country/location, year, and category. The “type of search” function classifies searches by web searches, image searches, news searches, or product searches. The “country” specification allows one to choose nearly any country in the world, or one can specify the search as “worldwide.” When one chooses a country for the specification—for state politics research this would most likely be the United States—I4S has a “sub-region” specification allowing for state-specific search volume returns.</p>
<p>Researchers can get time-series data within a particular state. The temporal filter gives investigators the chance to search for a number of canned periods (i.e., last 7 days, last 10 days, last month, etc.), for whole calendar years starting with 2004, or for specific date ranges. The specific date range option gives scholars the most leverage over their research question. Using specific date range option, one could search for the search volume of a term from January 2008 to February 2008. However, because I4S does not allow a date specification, the temporal filter cannot be specified to January 6, 2008, to February 6, 2008, for example. Depending on the search volume for the terms used in the analysis, I4S will have daily, weekly, or monthly search term volume outputs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532440012438889">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Scholars can also obtain cross-sectional data. To be able to make cross-state comparisons, researchers need measures that measure the same phenomenon in the same way for all of the states in question. I4S does this. By setting the location filter to “United States,” Google allows investigators the option to search by subregion (i.e., states). As a result, researchers are able to search for the exact same terms, images, news story, or product for every state within the same period. There are two choices for comparison with this filter. One is that researchers may search all 50 states plus Washington, DC, together for the specific search and time range. Researchers can combine these datasets to get cross-sectional time-series data by searching by each state individually—which will generate the search volume for that specific state alone within the filtered period—and then combining the 50 states together.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1532440012438889">
<title>What Are the Data?</title>
<p>Google normalizes and scales the data generated by I4S. The normalization process is done by Google using the search term being investigated by the researcher (i.e., <italic>Michigan Medical Marijuana</italic>) and another baseline search term (i.e., <italic>baseball</italic>) that can be compared with the researcher’s search term in all geographic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532440012438889">Carneiro and Mylonakis 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532440012438889">4</xref></sup> The comparison search term—in this example, baseball—is used because it has a stable and predictable search volume over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532440012438889">Carneiro and Mylonakis 2009</xref>). It is important to note that Google does not use comparison search terms that are constant or present a flat line if graphed, but rather they use terms that are highly predictable for any given time of year. So, in this example, the baseline term “baseball” has a very predictable pattern that increases during the baseball season every year, and Google uses that predictability as a reference to normalize your search term. Google has a repository of these baseline terms, all of which have been shown to produce predictable and stable results for normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532440012438889">Carneiro and Mylonakis 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532440012438889">Ginsberg et al. 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As your search term increases or decreases in volume over the period set in the filters, it is compared with the baseline term in all geographic locations in the location filters. For instance, if one searches the United States as a unit for <italic>California gay marriage</italic> over the months October 2008 to November 2008, the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1532440012438889">Figure 1</xref> appear. The figure demonstrates the search term volume for California gay marriage in all 50 states and is normalized to reflect relative “query shares” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532440012438889">Shimshoni, Efron, and Matias 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532440012438889">5</xref></sup> The figure shows two graphs: one is the trend line for query shares over the period specified, and the second is a density chart by state for relative query share score. We see that the search activity peaks just before election day and that California has the highest amount of search activity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1532440012438889">6</xref></sup> Google obtains these normalized query shares by taking the total number of searches for a term in a defined geographic area, dividing that by the total number of Internet searches in that area for the specified amount of time in question, and then normalizing that number with a constant search term across all geographic subregions in the filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532440012438889">Google 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532440012438889">Shimshoni et al. 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>Google scales the data after this normalization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532440012438889">Google 2009</xref>). Data range from “0” to “100.” As noted earlier, “100” reflects the highest amount of search volume within the specified date and geographic constraints. Once Google establishes where the highest search volume takes place, it scales the rest of the data points from that reference point. Thus, if the highest search volume for Michigan’s medical marijuana ballot measure is the Week A, but in Week B there is half the search volume, Week B’s scaled value is 50. The scaled and normalized query shares only reflect the activity during the time specified, and they reflect the activity of the search terms or images being investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532440012438889">Google 2009</xref>). The limitations of this part of the data will be further examined later.</p>

<title>Who Uses I4S Data?</title>
<p>At present, we know of no published political science journal articles or books using I4S as a dependent or independent variable. This is a new application, which has only existed since 2004, but researchers are discovering how this can be used to advance social science research.</p>
<sec id="section6-1532440012438889">
<title>Uses in Public Health</title>
<p>Public health researchers often want to anticipate the next big pandemic. Various studies have shown that using Internet search term surveillance can correlate with outbreaks, in some cases well before the official declaration of the outbreaks. Because tools of this nature have only been available since 2004, researchers needed to wait until there was some history of search terms in order to use this data in any meaningful way. As a result, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532440012438889">Polgreen et al. (2008)</xref> produce one of the earliest tests of search term data by using Yahoo! search terms to correlate the onset of seasonal flu incidents as measured by public health offices and agencies. Polgreen and colleagues use a cross-sectional time-series model to predict likelihood of influenza-related activities being correlated with flu-specific search activity over a 10-week period. They find that their data are robust and validate their theory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532440012438889">Ginsberg et al. (2009)</xref> replicate Polgreen et al.’s study with Google data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1532440012438889">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ginsberg et al. take the 50 million most common search terms for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) and create a normalized and scaled search volume score. They find, consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532440012438889">Polgreen et al. (2008)</xref>, that this new search volume score or “trend” is also highly predictive of ILI reports by public health agencies. Their work is the basis for Google Flu Trends,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1532440012438889">8</xref></sup> and the resulting I4S is useful for diseases other than the very common flu. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1532440012438889">Wilson and Brownstein (2009)</xref> use I4S to predict the onset of <italic>Listeria</italic>, which is an uncommon disease. They successfully replicate the flu onset models by showing that <italic>Listeria</italic>-related public health reports are correlated with the search term volume provided by Google Trends.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1532440012438889">9</xref></sup> Their results demonstrate that even for a relatively uncommon disease like <italic>Listeria</italic>, I4S/Trends is a robust predictive tool. Furthermore, the robustness of this database has been replicated in Europe by French public health agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532440012438889">Pelat et al. 2009</xref>). Pelat and colleagues use I4S search volume data to replicate the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532440012438889">Ginsberg et al. (2009)</xref>, and they do so using diseases other than the flu and in French. Thus, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1532440012438889">Pelat et al. (2009)</xref> suggest, I4S has broad applicability and should be tested in areas other than public health.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1532440012438889">
<title>Use in Economics</title>
<p>Economists are also having success with this tool using I4S to monitor economic conditions and activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532440012438889">Choi and Varian (2009)</xref> demonstrate that I4S can successfully measure three economic activities: retail sales, home sales, and automotive sales. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532440012438889">Kholodilin, Podstawski, and Siliverstovs (2010)</xref> suggests that I4S volume is significantly correlated with consumption in the United States as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532440012438889">Schmidt and Vosen (2009)</xref> add to this research by testing I4S capacity relative to survey based indicators for consumption activity and find that I4S search term volume is a more accurate and robust predictor of various types of private consumption. Other research finds that I4S data correlate with unemployment rates accurately and more robustly than traditional measures such as initial claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532440012438889">D’Amuri and Marcucci 2009</xref>). D’Amuri and Marcucci use the search term <italic>jobs</italic> in I4S. They perform a number of analyses using the best unemployment estimates in economics and demonstrate that the models perform better when the I4S term is included. I4S’s ability to predict unemployment is replicated in numerous countries, such as Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532440012438889">Askitas and Zimmermann 2009</xref>), Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532440012438889">D’Amuri 2009</xref>), and Israel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1532440012438889">Suhoy 2010</xref>). These strong results in public health and economics do not, however, mean that these data are not without limitations.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1532440012438889">
<title>Limits of the Data</title>
<p>These data possess strong potential usefulness. There are, however, at least four significant limitations. The first limitation is the most evident: The raw search volume numbers are not available. Google does not provide these numbers publicly. It claims that its normalization and scaling process is the most efficient way to avoid the large discrepancies in search volume that one might expect between places like Rhode Island and California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532440012438889">Google 2009</xref>). At this time, there is no way to know what the query share returns mean in terms of the actual number of people searching on the Internet. Crucially—and we stress this point—there is a threshold that the searches must meet in order to register in Google I4S. If 10 people search something, it will not pass the threshold. Google will not release the exact number of this threshold, but it insists that it must be a nontrivial amount of the search population. The fundamental point is that I4S query shares are a measure of <italic>relative</italic> search volume given the stated parameters by a researcher. Because Google uses a stable and predictable comparison term, it claims that their query share estimate is an accurate reflection of the real numbers of people using those search terms relative to the other geographic areas involved. While this is a serious limitation, it does not necessarily mean that these data cannot act as a useful explanatory variable if construct validity can be established as has been done in public health and economics.</p>
<p>The second limitation is that the search terms used to generate the query shares have real consequences for the search volume returns. Thus, coding decisions when using these data are momentous. Searching for <italic>gay marriage</italic> rather than <italic>California gay marriage</italic> may change the results returned by I4S. Consequently, the theoretical basis for the search term used is of paramount importance. Furthermore, I4S allows the option to compare search volume across multiple search terms at once. While this function is important, it may not be useful when generating search volume datasets for political science. For instance, searching simultaneously for <italic>California gay marriage</italic> and <italic>gay marriage</italic> within the same temporal parameters (October 2008 to November 2008) demonstrates that—not surprisingly—gay marriage has a higher relative search volume than California gay marriage. The trends of the lines produced by I4S are nearly identical with their peaks just before election day, but the values produced by I4S for the comparison are not interesting in themselves because they are calculated relative to each other. Thus, while this function is interesting as a descriptive tool for comparing search term validity, it does not add anything substantive to the point that query share values can be used as a predictive variable. The query shares produced in this instance are produced as a function of the other, and therefore may hide the actual implication of the more specific search term—California gay marriage.</p>
<p>The third limitation is that, like the search term coding decisions, temporal coding decisions are important. The normalization and scaling that Google applies to the data are significantly affected by the period in question. Thus, adding one month more or less than necessary can result in the effect being missed or overrepresented. The fourth limitation is these data are not a random sample of the population. Although the Internet is becoming ubiquitous and citizens are becoming much more fluent using the Internet, any research using this data must take into consideration that these data only tell us about people who use the Internet—and more specifically Google.</p>
<p>An additional consideration—that is not necessarily a limitation, but rather a consideration—is that these data are presented in the aggregate. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532440012438889">Ginsberg et al. (2009)</xref> state, it is impossible to connect any one individual with any particular search. Thus, researchers should be on guard against making ecological fallacies with these data because researchers may be tempted to make claims about individuals’ behavior. Discerning individual behavior is not possible with this data. Furthermore, scholars cannot make claims about the quality of the billions of searches being performed. We cannot know, for instance, if a person searches for <italic>California Prop. 8</italic>, (1) that he or she finds information from a reputable source, (2) which of the possibly thousands of websites returned that he or she clicks on, and (3) if this is the only search term he or she used to search for that information. This does not mean that we cannot draw conclusions from the data, but rather that we need to be careful in how we approach this data source and to what extent we broaden the explanatory power of these data.</p>
<p>Finally, researchers should be aware that the search parameters will greatly affect the type of data generated by I4S. As noted, the original data come either as a cross-section for the entire United States, or they can be generated by state as a time series within the state specified in the filters. The way for researchers to get cross-sectional time-series data is to generate their time-series search inquiries individually for all 50 states and then combine those datasets into one larger cross-sectional time series.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1532440012438889">
<title>A Validity Test for Political Science With I4S</title>
<p>A crucial issue with these data is that we do not know beyond the threshold that Google sets what the exact number of people searching for a topic is. Although it cannot be below the threshold—and therefore it cannot be a very small number of people—it still may be that these searches are not representative of the general population in these states. When comparing state level searches, it may be that an unrepresentative few are skewing the results, and therefore these data will have systematic error that bias any inferences made from them. To test the validity of these data, we follow the public health and economics researchers and test whether the Google data correlates with a real-life political phenomenon where there is hard data.</p>
<p>As a test for this measure in political science, our hypothesis is that search volume should serve as a proxy for voter interest in the aggregate. If voters are more interested, enthused, and mobilized about a ballot measure, there should more Internet searches and less roll-off. <italic>Roll-off</italic> is the process whereby voters vote for the top-of-the-ballot, but do not vote on the ballot questions on the same ballot. Thus, we hypothesize that higher levels of Google search volume in the week before election day should be correlated with lower percentages roll-off. Using I4S, we can test this hypothesis for the first time. Although this is an exploratory example, it is an important question in its own right. Roll-off is a well-known problem, and causes for it have been extensively researched in political science literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1532440012438889">Reilly and Richey 2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section10-1532440012438889">
<title>Variables</title>
<p>Our independent variable is I4S query share output for two different terms for all 153 ballot measures on state ballots in the 2008 Presidential election. We gather these data based on two types of search terms with one search term being the specific <italic>name</italic> of the ballot measure itself (e.g., <italic>California Proposition 8</italic>) for all 153 ballot measures. We include the state name where the ballot measure appears so that our search is as specific as possible (i.e., rather than just <italic>Proposition 8</italic>, we use <italic>California Proposition 8</italic>). This may limit our data, but we can be reasonably sure that people who search for <italic>California Proposition 8</italic> rather than <italic>Proposition 8</italic> know that they want information regarding California’s ballot measure and not another state’s Proposition 8. The second term we search is the <italic>topic</italic> of the ballot measure for all 153 ballot measures on state ballots in the 2008 Presidential election. Thus, instead of <italic>California Proposition 8</italic>, we search for <italic>California gay marriage</italic>.

<p>If we were trying to uncover a causal relationship between search level and roll-off, we would need to include control variables. But here, we only want to establish that I4S data taken a week before the election significantly correlates with actual electoral participation on ballot measures. Thus, we follow past research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532440012438889">Kholodilin et al. 2010</xref>) and do not present a kitchen-sink model packed full of control variables.</p>

<p>Our analysis also includes ordinary least squares (OLS) estimations using I4S data as the independent variables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1532440012438889">Table 2</xref>. We use three modeling specifications to test the hypothesis that greater search volume significantly correlates with lower roll-off on ballot measures. There are two independent variables representing the two methods of searches voters might perform when looking for information about their ballot measures. The first two models take these variables alone to test their effects, whereas the third specification estimates their effects on roll-off simultaneously. We also ran these models by removing the outliers mentioned above from the data, and we find substantively similar significant correlations between both types of search volume and roll-off. We also ran these models using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532440012438889">Rogers (1993)</xref> robust standard errors on clustered on states, and we find substantively similar significant correlations between both types of search volume and roll-off.

<p>In Model 1, we test the effect of ballot topic search volume on roll-off. The effect of higher levels of search volume is negative and significant at the <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10 level using a two-tailed test. In Model 2, we find that higher ballot name search volume is also significantly correlated (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, two-tailed test) with lower levels of roll-off. The differences in levels of significance are not surprising because there is much more variance in the <italic>topic</italic> variable as opposed to the <italic>name</italic> variable. Nonetheless, these results suggest that ballot measures with high search volume scores are more likely to have voters participate in them. Furthermore, both measures of search volume are negative and significant, showing that Internet search volume correlates with roll-off.</p>
<p>The final model tests both variables’ effects on roll-off, with negative and significant results for both topic and name.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1532440012438889">11</xref></sup> However, this model stands apart because it demonstrates the robustness of the variables’ predictive power. Just as economists and public health researchers have been able to use I4S to predict phenomena in their fields, political scientists can do so now as well with roll-off data. Although much more replication of validity in other areas is necessary, these results show that I4S has promise as useful data source for state politics research.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This research illustrates the validity of using Google I4S data in analyzing of one aspect voting behavior at the state level. Our research clearly demonstrates that higher Google search data is correlated with lower roll-off on ballot measures during the 2008 election cycle for both the name of the ballot measure as well as the topic. By testing these two ways of searching—by ballot name or by ballot topic—we account for voters who may be unfamiliar with the exact title of a ballot measure but are still seeking information on these measures. This effect was found across states and suggests that real-world Internet search data may help political scientists predict political phenomena, particularly at the state level where data are hard to come by. Because I4S query shares are shown to correlate with real-world data, it is possible that other search terms (which have no hard data to check against) may be fruitfully used by state politics researchers.</p>
<p>Our research demonstrates that there is an opportunity for scholars to look at real-time data on what citizens are searching for on the Internet as a proxy for interest. This information gives us a new way to test and predict information seeking and its impact on the electoral cycle. For example, sensitive subjects such as bribery or corruption may be researched using I4S due to its unobtrusive nature. Political science, however, should follow public health and economics and conduct a series of tests of validity before it gains full usage. Importantly, this project is a first cut at these data and their abilities. As shown in the literature from economics, continual testing of these data on other important dependent variables in political science—particularly state politics—is necessary going forward. By further testing the predictive capacity of Google I4S, political scientists can be certain of the validity of this innovative and real-time data in the future.</p>

<p>Google Trends is the first generation of this technology, but has limitations that I4S overcomes with regard to search specifications. For example, if one searches for <italic>Obama</italic>, Google Trends returns trend line graphs and an excel spreadsheet that shows the search volume for the term <italic>Obama</italic> from 2004 to the day of the researcher’s search. One may search for other terms as well to see the relative differences, but this tool is too broad and unable to generate highly specific data.</p>

<p>Daily search volume outputs are only available if the time range in question is one or two months. Search ranges much larger than this will beget only weekly outputs. Of course, all of this is dependent on the search volume for the terms being searched, so researchers should take care to note the structure of the Google output during the data-generating process. This is a limitation, but it is a relatively minor one.</p>

<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532440012438889">Carneiro and Mylonakis (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532440012438889">Ginsberg et al. (2009)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532440012438889">Shimshoni, Efron, and Matias (2009)</xref>, there are numerous comparison search terms used by Google to generate the normalized data. Google claims that their rigorous tests generate reliable results regardless of the comparison search term because the comparison terms have generally stable and predictable volume over time and when compared with one another. “Baseball” is used here as an example, but we have no way to know what term Google uses to generate the data normalization. Again, this is a limitation, but one with which we are comfortable given the robust results in this article and other works we cite.</p>

<p>It is important to note that searching for <italic>gay marriage</italic> with the same temporal filters generates essentially the same results, but because the search term is so much broader, the data are noisier and may not actually represent searches for the ballot measure.

<p>It should be noted that we have attempted to get the raw search term data from Google on numerous occasions. Polgreen, based on the footnotes in the 2008 article, is an employee or is at least professionally associated with Yahoo!, whereas Ginsberg and a few coauthors, as noted by a footnote in the 2009 article, are employees of Google. Thus, to get the actual search term data, it appears that one needs to be employed by the search engine company.</p>
