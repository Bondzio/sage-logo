<p>The emergence of “megamalls,” vast commercial spaces dedicated to support the national ritual of shopping, has fed America’s seemingly insatiable appetite to consume and have transformed the American landscape in the process. Coupled with the big-box-style chain development that drives them, these massive and self-contained “cathedrals of consumption” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092055X11420389">Ritzer 1999</xref>) have become ground zero in the grassroots struggle for community identity, vitality, and autonomy in locations across the country.</p>
<p><italic>Megamall</italic>, a documentary film about “money, power, and politics in the age of sprawl,” examines this phenomenon as a flashpoint for community conflict. The film tells the story of David versus Goliath: a small community seeking to protect its mom-and-pop businesses and unique neighborhood feel from out-of-town developers who see the community for its “untapped” potential for expansive commercial development. Out of this struggle of people versus profits, a grassroots movement to protect the town’s quality of life emerges to fend off a powerful and well-organized corporate campaign to win the hearts (and wallets) of local residents.</p>
<p><italic>Megamall</italic> begins by introducing the community and people of Nyack, a collection of small hamlets on the Hudson River in Rockland County, New York. The documentary is set primarily in the late 1980s to late 1990s and narrates the development struggles of residents living in the small suburban village. Although only 12 miles north of Manhattan, the quaint, sleepy town was home to approximately 6,500 residents and maintained a largely autonomous existence, including a vibrant historic downtown district filled with independent shops, cafes, and restaurants.</p>
<p>As is common in numerous postindustrial communities across America, <italic>Megamall</italic> characterizes the townspeople and their civic leaders as straddling the highly charged fence between economic growth and community vitality. Through documentary and archival footage collected over a 12-year period, the filmmakers recount this fascinating conflict through a chronological narrative filled with citizen interviews, planning board proceedings, grassroots protests, and countless public hearings about the proposed megamall complex. The film also includes more recent commentary through interviews with several planning experts, real estate economists, and social critics (including James Howard Kunstler, author of <italic>Geography of Nowhere</italic>), which provides a great deal of sociological context and analysis. The film provides a dynamic case study of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092055X11420389">Kunstler (1998)</xref> called “corporate colonialism,” a strategic effort to infiltrate, co-opt, and influence democratic political processes in the name of corporate profit. As such, it raises key questions about the role of citizens in public decision making and the responsibility of “corporate citizens” to the communities in which they do business.</p>
<p>In the first act, <italic>Megamall</italic> introduces The Pyramid Companies, which approached the town in 1987 with a proposal to build The Palisades Center, a massive, 1.2 million square foot, multiple-unit shopping mall complex on the site of an abandoned landfill and African American cemetery. Fearing the loss of community-owned businesses and a decline in civic life, the nascent Rockland County Civic Association (RCCA), a vocal grassroots citizen group, emerged in opposition. Led by resident Shirley Lasker, the group emerged from casual conversations at a backyard barbecue and mobilized to stop the development and protect the quality of life that residents had come to enjoy.</p>
<p>The conflict evolved into a 20-year, multiphase struggle to defend the community against this unpopular commercial development. It came to a head when the developers approached the town board to rezone a portion of western Nyack to accommodate their project plans. Fearing the impact on local businesses, activists opposed to the mall simply wanted to review the developer’s plans for the property and ensure direct citizen input on the proposed project. However, it was exposed that the company used $770,000 in incentives and kickbacks to sway the vote and planned triple the size of the development by sidestepping public review; the RCCA felt that it was time to fight back, reclaim its public right to due process, and ultimately stop the development.</p>
<p>The film then turns to the back-and-forth struggle between the RCCA and the development company, showcasing efforts by the former to ensure open and participatory public decision making and by the latter to sway public opinion and influence the board behind closed doors, including a $150 million lawsuit against the board. Caught between a rock and a hard place, the clearly outmatched and ethically challenged town board denied the townspeople a public vote and secretly negotiated with the company to allow an even larger mall facility. When the townspeople noticed the new construction footprint was significantly larger than the original plans, the RCCA took the board to court to stop construction and remove the additional retail space. Led by Lasker, the RCCA ultimately mobilized to prevent the developers from using the additional space (but only temporarily, as we come to find out).</p>
<p>In 1997, after 10 years of struggle, the mall eventually celebrated its “grand opening.” But in the months that followed, several problems began to surface. Reports emerged that the building itself was sinking into the ground and that shoppers could physically feel the structure shaking or shifting. Some speculated that its location atop an abandoned landfill could contribute to additional public safety concerns if the toxic materials underneath the facility escaped or leached into the building. Beyond these physical issues, the mall also took its toll on the social and economic fabric of the community. After a bomb threat and reports of gang activity and violence at the mall, visitors questioned whether Palisades was a safe place for their families to shop. Additional costs to the public were less direct, though equally detrimental to the town’s economic vitality. Within two years of the mall’s opening, Pyramid defaulted on a portion of its tax obligation to the city, the second largest mall in the city requested a significant tax cut, six of the town’s eight cinemas had closed, and several downtown storefronts and suburban strip malls became vacant shells. Rather than being an engine for economic prosperity, residents were starting to see that Pyramid’s promise to the community was broken. Through the leadership of Lasker, the film closes with RCCA making one final push to have their voices heard.</p>
<p>Relevant for courses across the sociology curriculum, <italic>Megamall</italic> addresses numerous sociological concepts across several topical areas including economic or political sociology (democracy, direct participation, civic engagement, civil society), social movements (collective behavior, grassroots activism, protest), organizations and institutions (power, bureaucracy, power elite, social inequality), leisure and consumption (consumerism, corporate culture) or environmental or urban sociology (suburban sprawl, brownfield redevelopment, community vitality, urban blight). The film also highlights the tensions between public and private interests, which would provide an excellent opportunity for introductory students to broaden their sociological imaginations. As such, the film has significant potential to make more real and concrete the struggles of an actual community experiencing the push and pull of social change. It also overlaps nicely with a number of classic texts and key essays commonly found in introductory readers, including Ritzer’s <italic>McDonaldization of Society</italic> and <italic>Enchanting a Disenchanted World</italic>, C. Wright Mills’s <italic>Power Elite and Promise of Sociology</italic>, Robert Putnam’s <italic>Bowling Alone</italic>, Benjamin Barber’s <italic>A Place for Us</italic>, Mark Gottdeiner’s <italic>Theming of America</italic>, and Barbara Ehrenreich’s <italic>Nickel and Dimed</italic>.</p>
<p>Although recently released, much of the documentary footage is from the later 1980s and 1990s. Knowing that students often dismiss films and texts more than a few years old as outdated or irrelevant, instructors may want to preface the documentary by stating that conflicts between developers and local communities take place over a considerable period of time and often span several decades. Also, as illustrated clearly in the film, the conflict does not simply end when the contracts are signed and the building commences. Today, the community of Nyack is still struggling with the mall’s influence, nearly two decades after the project was planned and 12 years after construction was completed. Case analyses of recent conflicts surrounding the Palisades Center, or Destiny USA, Pyramid’s most recent and highly controversial development in Syracuse, New York, could provide a great follow-up assignment for individual students or small groups.</p>
<p>At 81 minutes, <italic>Megamall</italic> may be a bit lengthy to show in its entirety during one class period, but the film is divided into three acts and could be easily integrated into several class periods while allowing ample time for brief lectures, focused discussions, or interactive activities. The film could be a catalyst for projects that would allow students to see these forces in their own communities, including case studies of community struggles with Wal-Mart or other big-box chain developments or similar locally unwanted land uses, including the siting and development of landfills, prisons, and nuclear sites. In smaller classes, instructors could include assignments that would encourage students to attend meetings of the town planning board or city council to understand how these social forces are influencing their own communities. In larger classes, students could work in teams or in recitation groups to develop case studies on controversial developments or conflicts related to land use zoning or in the planning process itself.</p>
<p>Because of its coverage of numerous sociological concepts and nearly “universal” applicability to local communities across the American landscape, <italic>Megamall</italic> is an excellent film to illustrate the complex dynamics of public processes, especially in the face of corporate influence. As such, it raises important questions about whether we are citizens who have a responsibility to the public or consumers who have responsibility to their private desires. It also closes with the important message that ultimately citizens and local officials are responsible for their communities, not corporations or private interests. As such, it empowers the viewer (our students) that to make necessary changes in our communities we have to get involved, and to get involved we have to speak up.</p>
