<p>Many patients with the terminal condition motor neurone disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MND/ALS) do not access social service homecare, which may have implications for the location of end-of-life care. We aimed to identify factors related to uptake of such care in MND/ALS. A case note review of patients at a UK MND/ALS clinic (<italic>N</italic> = 97) provided data concerning disease onset and severity, demographic variables and care received. Narrative interviews with people with MND/ALS (<italic>N</italic> = 24) and family carers (<italic>N</italic> = 18) explored their perspectives on social services homecare.</p>
<p>Quantitative analyses highlighted the role of increasing disease severity and age for social services homecare uptake. However, qualitative findings revealed a number of barriers delaying the uptake of such care. ‘Internal’ issues focused on retaining control and normality within the home. ‘External’ issues arose from limited understanding of the disease amongst service providers and lack of awareness of service entitlement amongst patients and carers. Multiple factors are implicated in the uptake of social services homecare. Uncertainties surrounding service entitlement must be addressed, including the simplification of bureaucratic procedures and clarification of the roles of health and social care professionals. Service providers need a greater awareness of the nature of the disease and their role in its management.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The issue of where end-of-life care should be provided for terminally ill patients is one that has received attention in many countries, including the UK, Canada, Australia and the USA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311398697">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311398697">8</xref></sup> This issue necessarily raises questions regarding the availability of homecare for such patients. Studies have shown that terminally ill patients with neurological conditions are less likely to receive homecare than those with a cancer diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311398697">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311398697">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311398697">8</xref></sup> Motor neurone disease (MND), also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is an often-rapidly progressive terminal neurodegenerative disease with 50% of patients dying within three years of symptom onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311398697">9</xref></sup> Muscle deterioration results in paralysis and profound disability, whilst bulbar involvement results in dysarthria affecting communication and dysphagia with consequent poor nutritional intake.</p>
<p>Homecare provision for MND/ALS patients differs between countries, and also within them. For example, within the UK there are no national eligibility criteria for the receipt of such care, which is the responsibility of local authority social services departments. Homecare may include care assistants in the person’s home to help with feeding, lifting, etc., assistive devices, day care centres and residential (as opposed to nursing) care on either a temporary basis (i.e. respite care), or for longer. However, we have previously reported that significant numbers of eligible patients did not utilize social services homecare, despite increasing levels of disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311398697">10</xref></sup> Existing evidence from both the UK and the USA suggests that funding-related unreliability in provision, a lack of knowledge concerning MND/ALS patient needs amongst staff and a lack of knowledge concerning available provision amongst patients and carers may all contribute to the under-utilization of homecare provision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311398697">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311398697">15</xref></sup> However, these findings are either based on data gathered in the 1990s,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311398697">13</xref></sup> or upon very small samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311398697">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311398697">15</xref></sup> Furthermore, only a limited attempt has been made to examine quantitatively the relationship between measures of a patient’s disease history and severity, and the receipt of homecare, with patients receiving it being significantly more disabled than those not receiving it.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311398697">13</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Given these limitations in current evidence concerning homecare for MND/ALS patients, and its under-utilization where available,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311398697">10</xref></sup> the present study had two objectives. Firstly, to elucidate the relationship between patients’ disease course and severity, and uptake of social services homecare in a UK sample by means of quantitative analyses. Secondly, to elucidate potential barriers to the uptake of such care by analysing qualitative data from a larger sample of patients and carers than recruited by previous studies.</p>
<p>To increase the number of people who die at home, those caring for them will need to receive appropriate support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311398697">16</xref></sup> Failure to meet patients’ wishes to die at home has a number of implications. For patients and carers there is often disruption and additional distress at the end of life as patients are taken from familiar surroundings to die in an institution. Furthermore there are financial implications for the National Health Service (NHS) from unnecessary hospitalization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311398697">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311398697">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311398697">19</xref></sup> A greater understanding of the barriers to service uptake may provide a basis for increasing homecare provision with consequent benefits for patients, carers and the NHS.</p>

<title>Method</title>

<title>Design</title>
<p>A comprehensive review of hospital and MND care centre case notes for all patients (<italic>N</italic> = 97, 49 male) followed up at the MND/ALS clinic in Preston, a post-industrial city in northwest England, was undertaken at two time points: Time 1 (T1) (March 2008) and Time 2 (T2) (March 2009). The format of these case notes allows for the collection of comparable information from all 97 cases; however, although no case notes were rejected, in a small number, some elements of data were missing. The multidisciplinary clinic, led by a consultant neurologist, covers a geographical location incorporating both rural and urban areas with a population approaching 1.8 million. All patients were eligible to receive social services homecare based on needs falling within the critical or substantial bands of the eligibility framework, which local authorities use to determine eligibility for services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311398697">20</xref></sup> NHS ethical approval was obtained and NHS research governance requirements were adhered to.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216311398697">
<title>Quantitative measures and analytic strategy</title>
<p>Data extracted from patients’ case notes recorded demographic details, MND/ALS histories, including site/type of disease onset, and current severity using the ALS Health States Scale (ALS-HSS),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311398697">21</xref></sup> the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311398697">22</xref></sup> and vital capacity (VC) measured as a percentage of predicted score. The ALS-HSS, a clinical classification system, classifies patients into one of four health states ranging from state 1 (mild) to state 4 (terminal). The ALSFRS-R is a 12-item scale measuring functional status and disease-related disability in MND/ALS patients. Items are rated from 0 (cannot do) to 4 (normal ability), with a maximum total score of 48.</p>
<p>Data were analysed using SPSS 16™. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311398697">Table 1</xref> lists the six patient history variables reflecting age and MND/ALS development that were examined regarding their relationships with receipt or not of social services care at T1, in addition to the three disease severity measures. These variables were screened for deviation from a normal distribution through calculated <italic>z</italic>-scores for skewness and kurtosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311398697">23</xref></sup> to inform subsequent choices of statistical tests. Differences on these nine variables between patients receiving or not receiving social services care were examined by either <italic>t</italic>-tests or Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-tests. These tests, and the intercorrelations between these variables, also served in the selection of independent variables (IVs) for the logistic regression with receipt or not of social services care as the dependent variable (DV). Statistical power in the regression model was, therefore, maximized by minimizing the number of IVs by excluding variables showing no inter-group differences, or with high intercorrelations with other potential IVs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311398697">23</xref></sup></p>

<title>Qualitative data and analytic strategy</title>
<p>Narrative-type interviews<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216311398697">24</xref></sup> were conducted with 24 MND/ALS patients and 18 family carers in order to obtain their perspectives without being influenced by pre-determined questions. Maximum variation purposive sampling was guided by patients’ ALS-HSS score to obtain a range of experiences.

<p>To enhance analytical rigour and reduce the likelihood of introducing bias, three researchers (MOB, BW, BJ) independently analysed the same three transcripts before comparing and agreeing on initial codes.

The model was significantly predictive of patients being in receipt or not of homecare at T1 (model χ<sup>2</sup> [3, <italic>N</italic> = 79] = 15.509, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). The regression coefficients and odds ratios in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269216311398697">Table 4</xref> show that for each unit rise on the ALFRS-R scale, the likelihood of receiving homecare decreased by 8.5%. However, for each unit rise in age at T1, the likelihood of receiving homecare rose by 5.7%. The time from diagnosis to T1 did not significantly improve prediction.</p>

<p>Themes identified relating to the uptake of social services homecare are detailed here with support from anonymized quotations. It should be stated that positive experiences with this care were reported, but the focus here is on understanding perceived barriers to accessing such care.</p>
<sec id="section11-0269216311398697">
<title>Entitlement</title>
<p>Patients and carers exhibited uncertainty regarding which services they may be entitled to. Awareness of the availability of services often seemed to be severely limited.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I haven’t got a clue about care. I haven’t got a clue if I needed care or anything like that and nobody’s said anything about it. (Patient 85)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, many patients and carers lacked specific information about exactly what services might be available for their needs.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>And that’s another thing what kind of help do I need? (Patient 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, guidance about who to contact to initiate care services was, at times, lacking. One patient summarized the experiences of others:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>But if you want somebody in to help, who do you see? You don’t know. Who do you contact for that type of thing? You don’t know. (Patient 86)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, for those with no prior experience of accessing homecare, there was poor insight regarding the responsibilities of the various service providers involved.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think as an outsider, it is very difficult to understand people’s roles. (Carer 217)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Searching for information about service availability and the input of different professionals was felt to be time consuming and had the potential to increase the financial and emotional pressure on carers.<disp-quote>
<p>And of course all these places are only open during the day, they are not open in the night time so for me to find out the information, I have to stop work to phone them which means I am not getting paid which means your finances drop, and that then triggers a whole set of other problems. (Carer 212)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269216311398697">
<title>Normality</title>
<p>Patients and carers frequently demonstrated their wish to maintain a sense of normality and retain some control of their personal lives. This was epitomized by a patient and carer who had rejected the option of social services homecare.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I can’t see any benefit in having someone coming in everyday to help you get washed, showered, I think that would be more disruptive for us. (Carer 214)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants also revealed a sense of events and people invading their privacy and domestic space. A carer described cancelling homecare arrangements in order to restore normality.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We wanted our house back … … we just felt it wasn’t our home any more, there were that many people traipsing in and out. (Carer 207)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0269216311398697">
<title>Care provision</title>
<p>Problems with care provision were frequently mentioned by participants. One patient, highly dependent with complex needs, reported difficulties accessing suitable carers.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>At that point they said I was worthy of care, full time care. Then came the problem, they couldn’t find the carers … a big problem. (Patient 94)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some participants commented that although they were aware the government was encouraging people with terminal diseases to be cared for at home, they felt they were not supporting people with the resources or finances to be able to do this.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If they [the government] are targeting people to keep them out of hospital then they should be getting carers to help them and they haven’t got them. (Carer 205)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It seemed incredible to some participants that the level of homecare that was required might not be delivered due to financial constraints, when the cost of the alternative, hospital admission, would exceed the amount required for homecare. This anomaly was highlighted by one carer.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The authority that provides the care said that seven nights care, this is someone sitting with her through the night, is not possible because it would cost too much. Oh alright, cost too much, what do you mean? she is seriously ill, she is dying, if they keep her in hospital I don’t know what the figure is these days, for a hospital bed, but it’s thousands apparently a week, and then here they are ‘oh no it costs too much’, what do they want? (Carer 215)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Continuity of homecare was often problematic with little consistency in care teams; in addition, patients dependent on social services homecare were let down by services that were, at times, poorly organized.<disp-quote>
<p>The social services agency business has at times been an absolute nightmare; only this week a carer did not turn up on two occasions. (Carer 217)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0269216311398697">
<title>Understanding</title>
<p>There was criticism of the quality of homecare provided. It was felt that social services carers were less likely to be familiar with the problems encountered by people with MND/ALS.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The sort of standard of care you get with a package of care is very, very poor. I think the majority of carers are geared up to going into older people. (Patient 46)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants also revealed instances of limited understanding of, or training in, managing the effects of the illness amongst care staff, which had obvious implications for the care received.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am certain none of these people (agency carers) know what MND is … they just have no idea … they do not know how to handle you … they don’t know how to manage you at all. (Carer 207)</p>
<p>The staff are mainly poorly selected, paid, trained and educated. (Patient 51)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Initiating homecare packages was also found to be difficult for participants who identified a lack of knowledge about the illness amongst social service staff.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It wasn’t easy because the people who were dealing with my paperwork at social services obviously didn’t know what MND is. (Carer 23)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0269216311398697">
<title>Putting off care</title>
<p>Some carers found it difficult to admit that they might not be able to cope.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s asking for the help, it’s hard because I have always been very independent. (Carer 210)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Others rejected additional care services out of a sense of duty towards the patient.<disp-quote>
<p>We haven’t availed ourselves of the services because at the moment I don’t want to leave him at all. (Carer 208)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0269216311398697">
<title>Impact on carers</title>
<p>It was also apparent that these experiences were having an impact on carers, who reported significant levels of emotional and physical exhaustion.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I just haven’t anything left, I just feel totally wrung out. (Carer 218)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our earlier findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311398697">10</xref></sup> indicated reluctance amongst MND/ALS patients and their carers to receiving social services homecare despite increasing disability; our current qualitative findings elucidate the perceived barriers to receiving such care. Our quantitative findings show that patients receiving social services homecare were more seriously ill than those not receiving it, which is consistent with findings from the only other study to employ quantitative severity measures with a relatively large sample of MND/ALS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311398697">13</xref></sup> It is possible, therefore, that the barriers to receiving social services homecare may only delay its receipt until a patient’s level of disability reaches a critical point for them and their carer. The patient’s current age, their MND/ALS onset age and the duration of their illness are also indicated as potential contributors to this process. Increasing disability levels and illness durations also have important implications for carers’ well-being, and should be considered in light of the barriers elucidated by our qualitative findings. The findings from this study support the rationale of employing both quantitative and qualitative methodology in tandem for an optimal understanding of complex human responses in health care research. Neither approach by itself provides an equivalent range of insights.</p>
<p>Resolving the barriers to receiving social services homecare may provide a basis for increasing its uptake, thus alleviating distress for both patients and carers. In addition, investing in community-based end-of-life care could prevent costly and unnecessary hospital admissions and increase the number of people enabled to die at home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311398697">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311398697">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311398697">20</xref></sup> Some barriers may be seen to have an ‘internal’ locus, emphasizing efforts to retain a shifting sense of domestic control and normality (see also Brown et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311398697">14</xref></sup> and Hughes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311398697">15</xref></sup>), and also a notion of ‘duty’ towards the patient, which prevented carers from seeking help. A high level of sensitivity and empathy would be required in addressing these barriers effectively.</p>
<p>Other barriers had an ‘external’ locus, such as the limited understanding of MND/ALS and its associated needs amongst social services staff who infrequently encounter this disease. Despite having been reported previously,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311398697">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311398697">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269216311398697">28</xref></sup> this lack of awareness persists and requires urgent attention from those who manage community services. Other ‘external’ barriers requiring the attention of service managers highlighted the need for clearer information about service provision, greater clarity regarding the respective roles of health and social services staff, simpler bureaucratic procedures for service access and greater continuity and consistency in provision received. One recommendation might be for patients and carers to have just one contact point from which they could obtain information and raise queries regarding both social services care and health care. This would help to avoid the frustrating ‘merry-go-round’ experienced by some patients and carers of being passed between agencies without their concerns being answered.</p>
<p>As this study examined service uptake by patients and carers served by one MND/ALS clinic, this may be seen as a limitation regarding the generalizability of its findings. In addition, as patients included in the study lived within one of six Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) within Cumbria and Lancashire also served by a number of local authorities providing homecare services, there may be local variations within service availability and provision that should be borne in mind when interpreting the findings. However, service uptake is an important topic for study, and given the variability of service provision both within and between countries, the present findings may be seen to elucidate the relationship between service uptake, disease severity and duration, and subjectively experienced barriers to uptake in both patients and carers, in a context where a range of home-based, residential and community services are available. In this way, the findings may be seen to have relevance beyond the study’s own geographical location, in part at least, by highlighting problems to be avoided. The debate about the location of end-of-life care is an international one,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311398697">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311398697">8</xref></sup> and if the documented wishes of patients and carers for the last year of life to be spent at home<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311398697">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311398697">3</xref></sup> are to be realized, then attention is required with regard to the level of disease-specific knowledge amongst those providing the services necessary for this to happen, and with regard to the sensitivity and consistency with which such services are managed.</p>
