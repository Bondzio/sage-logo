<abstract>
<p>This series of articles for rehabilitation in practice aims to cover a knowledge element of the rehabilitation medicine curriculum. Nevertheless they are intended to be of interest to a multidisciplinary audience. The competency addressed in this article is ‘An understanding of the different international models for funding of health care services and casemix systems, as exemplified by those in the US, Australia and the UK.’</p>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> Payment for treatment in healthcare systems around the world is increasingly based on fixed tariff models to drive up efficiency and contain costs. Casemix classifications, however, must account adequately for the resource implications of varying case complexity. Rehabilitation poses some particular challenges for casemix development.</p>
<p><bold>Objective:</bold> The objectives of this educational narrative review are (a) to provide an overview of the development of casemix in rehabilitation, (b) to describe key characteristics of some well-established casemix and payment models in operation around the world and (c) to explore opportunities for future development arising from the lessons learned.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Diagnosis alone does not adequately describe cost variation in rehabilitation. Functional dependency is considered a better cost indicator, and casemix classifications for inpatient rehabilitation in the United States and Australia rely on the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Fixed episode-based prospective payment systems are shown to contain costs, but at the expense of poorer functional outcomes. More sophisticated models incorporating a mixture of episode and weighted per diem rates may offer greater flexibility to optimize outcome, while still providing incentive for throughput.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The development of casemix in rehabilitation poses similar challenges for healthcare systems all around the world. Well-established casemix systems in the United States and Australia have afforded valuable lessons for other countries to learn from, but have not provided all the answers. A range of casemix and payment models is required to cater for different healthcare cultures, and casemix tools must capture all the key cost-determinants of treatment for patients with complex needs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Health systems around the world are increasingly moving towards payment systems based on a fixed tariff structure for each episode of treatment. The rationale for this approach is to drive up efficiency and to contain costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215511417468">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511417468">3</xref></sup> The challenge, however, is to develop a casemix classification which adequately accounts for case complexity (i.e. the differential costs of treating patients with different levels of need), and also commissioning currencies that provide equitable risk-sharing between the purchaser and provider.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511417468">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The term ‘casemix’ is used variously to describe the type of mix of patients treated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511417468">4</xref></sup> in terms of prognosis or resources, depending on the parameter of interest. In the context of healthcare funding models, ‘casemix’ systems classify people into groups that are homogeneous in their use of resources, but a good casemix system also gives meaningful clinical descriptions of these individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215511417468">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Casemix information has several uses – it can provide the basis for reimbursement, and also for comparing facilities or programmes, practice patterns and patient outcomes. Casemix information is collected as a standard minimum dataset and, depending on the content of the dataset, it may also be used to benchmark quality and efficiency and for internal management purposes. As well as informing resource allocation, it therefore serves as an information tool that allows policy makers to understand the nature and complexity of healthcare delivery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215511417468">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aims of this review are (a) to provide an overview of the development of casemix in rehabilitation, (b) to describe the key characteristics of some well-established casemix and payment models in operation around the world and (c)to explore the lessons that may be learned from them and opportunities for future development towards improved models.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This article provides an educational narrative review, as opposed to a formal systematic review. In order to draw on the relevant literature, we conducted a broad-based search of the major databases (MEDLINE 1950–November 2010 and EMBASE 1980–November 2010) using ‘rehabilitation’ in combination with ‘casemix’ and ‘payment systems’ and related terms. We also searched the internet and used our combined knowledge of the various systems and key authors to expand the reference base.</p>
<p>The language of casemix is full of acronyms that can be confusing for clinicians, but those who wish to explore the literature further will need to be familiar with them. As a service to our readers, we have deliberately included the most commonly used acronyms in this article and a glossary with definitions is provided <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269215511417468">Appendix 1</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269215511417468">
<title>Development of casemix and commissioning currencies</title>
<p>Casemix classification was first pioneered in the United States of America some 40 years ago,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215511417468">6</xref></sup> and Medicare introduced a ‘Prospective Payment System’ for short-stay acute care hospitals in 1983. The system was based on diagnosis related groups (DRGs), which were designed to measure and classify healthcare activity, based primarily on the diagnosis and the procedures carried out.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215511417468">7</xref></sup> Each DRG was assigned a ‘fixed tariff’ payment, as patients within each category were considered to be clinically similar and therefore expected to use the same level of hospital resources. Other countries that have since followed on similar lines to introduce DRG-equivalent systems include Australia, Canada, the Nordic countries and several European countries, including Italy, Germany, Hungary and Denmark.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215511417468">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The options for commissioning currencies range from a single fixed tariff payment for each episode, regardless of length of stay (‘episode rates’), to payment at a daily rate (‘bed-day’ or ‘per diem’ rates). Both systems present potential opportunities for gaming. Fixed episode payments tend to place the greater share of risk on the provider, and may encourage them to ‘cream-skim’ the easy cases and to discharge too early. Per diem payments may contain insufficient incentives to move the patient on, and so result in unnecessarily long admissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511417468">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The principal argument for episode payments is that the majority of the active treatment costs are incurred during the early part of the episode – longer staying patients mainly incurring only ‘hotel costs’ due to largely avoidable delays – so restriction of payment to within a few days either side of the average length of stay provides an incentive towards efficient case throughput. However, while this may be true for acute medical and surgical treatments, it does not necessarily hold good for other areas of healthcare. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215511417468">Figure 1</xref> shows a schematic diagram of the typical cost per day of different types of inpatient episode. In surgical and acute episodes, the majority of the costs are incurred within the first few days as expected, and tail off sharply thereafter. However, in palliative care the daily costs of care rise progressively towards death, while in rehabilitation the cost curve is largely flat – nursing, care and therapy inputs continuing at a similar level throughout the admission. Different payment models are therefore required for these longer term service areas.</p>

<title>Casemix in rehabilitation – international models</title>
<p>Rehabilitation poses some particular challenges for the development of casemix design:</p>
<list id="list1-0269215511417468" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Diagnosis alone is a relatively poor indicator of costs for inpatient rehabilitation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215511417468">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511417468">10</xref></sup> where nursing and therapy staff input (as opposed to medical treatments) are the major cost-indicators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215511417468">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511417468">13</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cost-efficiency does not always equate with shorter stay. Evidence from the United States and other countries has shown that the introduction of fixed episode payment schemes in rehabilitation may lead to poorer functional outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215511417468">14</xref></sup> and increased rates of discharge to institutional care,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215511417468">15</xref></sup> due to pressure for early discharge when reimbursement ceases.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Some patients need longer to achieve maximal independence, but there is also evidence that the resulting savings in the cost of ongoing care can offset the initial investment in rehabilitation by several fold.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511417468">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511417468">17</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As a result, some healthcare systems have recognized that rigid episode-based reimbursement may be unsuitable for rehabilitation and alternative casemix and payment models are required which are fair to both purchasers and providers and still reward efficiency. Italy has explored a system that links reimbursement to effective stay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215511417468">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215511417468">19</xref></sup> based on the time to reach peak improvement for different groups of conditions, while Australia has developed a ‘weighted blended payment model’ for rehabilitation, which applies a mixture of episode and per diem rates (described in more detail below).</p>
<sec id="section5-0269215511417468">
<title>The American system</title>
<p>When the US casemix system was first introduced in the 1980s, medical rehabilitation was excluded from the US-DRGs because it was recognized that rehabilitation inpatients could not be classified reliably by diagnosis alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215511417468">20</xref></sup> The level of functional dependency was considered to be a better cost- indicator, and in the 1990s a classification system based on function (as defined by the Functional Independence Measure (FIM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215511417468">21</xref></sup>) was developed instead.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215511417468">22</xref></sup> This system of ‘FIM-function-related groups’ (FRGs) was subsequently rederived to predict total rehabilitation costs and renamed ‘casemix groups’ (CMGs). These form the current basis for reimbursement by Medicare for inpatient rehabilitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215511417468">3</xref></sup> in the United States.</p>
<p>The In-patient Rehabilitation Facility Prospective Payment System (IRF-PPS) uses a complex casemix classification which is summarized concisely in a recent review by Richard Zorowitz.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215511417468">2</xref></sup> Each patient is assigned into one of 85 impairment codes, in 21 rehabilitation impairment categories. These are further broken down into casemix groups, based on the FIM-motor score on admission – and in some instances also the FIM-cognitive score and age of the patient, where these are required to provide further definition of costs. Each casemix group also has four levels of comorbidity that represent the presence or absence of medical conditions (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, etc.) and/or complications (e.g. tracheostomy).</p>
<p>Medicare also requires completion of a standardized data set consisting of diagnostic and demographic information (the In-patient Rehabilitation Facility Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF-PAI)) to be completed for each patient within 72 hours of admission, in order to qualify for reimbursement. The FIM is embedded in this tool. Further information may be obtained from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cms.gov/InpatientRehabFacPPS/">www.cms.gov/InpatientRehabFacPPS/</ext-link>).</p>

<title>The Australian System</title>
<p>Development of casemix in Australia followed a broadly similar pattern to that in the United States. Casemix funding for healthcare was first introduced in the state of Victoria in 1993/4, and since then most states have moved towards either casemix-based funding or using casemix to inform the commissioning and budget-setting process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215511417468">23</xref></sup> When Australian National Diagnosis-Related Groups (AN-DRGs) were introduced, it was similarly recognized that the costs of subacute care (including rehabilitation medicine, palliative care, psychogeriatric and elderly care evaluation) were not well described by this system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215511417468">10</xref></sup>. As in the United States, function-related groups were identified as a better way to determine the differential cost of rehabilitation episodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215511417468">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two separate function-related casemix systems have been developed to classify patient episodes for different levels of reimbursement for rehabilitation. The first, published in 1996, is the CRAFT system (Casemix Rehabilitation And Funding Tree), which is based on 12 functional categories determined by the modified Barthel Index.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215511417468">25</xref></sup> The second, published three years later, is the Australian National Sub-Acute and Non-Acute Patient (AN-SNAP) Classification, which is based on the FIM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511417468">26</xref></sup> Both systems include formal designation of services into level 1 and level 2, on the basis of set criteria for staffing and expertise.</p>
<p>The AN-SNAP classification is the more sophisticated of the two systems, and has now been taken up more widely across Australia and New Zealand, although states vary in the extent to which it is actually used for payment, or simply to provide information. The CRAFT classification is still used for the funding of general (but not specialized) rehabilitation units in the state of Victoria, but the AN-SNAP classification is being adopted by the Australian government in its new national casemix funding model to be progressively introduced from 2011.</p>
<p>The first version of the AN-SNAP classification for inpatient rehabilitation was developed in 1999 following analysis of 7397 case episodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269215511417468">26</xref></sup> It comprised 32 classes based on 10 principal ‘impairment categories’, subdivided by the FIM-motor subscale – and, in some categories, further subdivided by the FIM-cognitive scale and age. The latest version (AN-SNAP-II) (2006) was developed on analysis of 84 210 case episodes from 120 public and private rehabilitation units.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511417468">27</xref></sup> This version uses the same variables, but there are now a total of 45 classes. The classes for the impairment categories of ‘stroke’ and ‘brain dysfunction’ are provided as examples in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269215511417468">Table 1</xref>.

<p>While the AN-SNAP classification was originally developed as an episode classification, a more sophisticated ‘blended payment model’ for funding was subsequently developed, which is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0269215511417468">Figure 2</xref>. Episode and per diem cost weights are derived from analysis of resource use within each of the AN-SNAP classes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511417468">27</xref></sup> The model is designed to provide incentive to move patients on (as bringing in a new patient will attract a new episode weight), but still provides payment above simple hotel costs for longer episodes.</p>

<caption><p>A blended payment model. Patients staying for very short admissions are reimbursed at a standard short-stay rate. Those below the low trim point are reimbursed at the ‘low outlier’ per diem rate. Those with lengths of stay (LOS) within the episode range attract the weighted episode rate plus an ‘inlier per diem’ payment for each day. Those staying beyond the episode period attract the episode rate plus inlier per diem payment for the whole episode period, plus the days beyond the high trim point at the outlier per diem rate.

</fig>
<p>In addition, a 90-day business rule is applied so that, for patients still requiring inpatient rehabilitation beyond 90 days, the episode can be terminated and a new one started following clinical review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269215511417468">27</xref></sup> The blended payment model has significant advantages over the more rigid US prospective payment system, as it provides flexibility for longer stay rehabilitation programmes, where clinicians and commissioners agree that these are required.</p>

<title>The InterRAI network</title>
<p>The InterRAI network is an international collaborative group of researchers in over 30 countries developing casemix systems in areas of healthcare for persons who are elderly, frail or disabled. The network is not linked to any particular healthcare system or payment model, but has developed a family of instruments with the aim of providing a common language that will produce integrated healthcare information across a range of settings and across international borders.</p>
<p>The best known of the InterRAI casemix systems is the Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-III) which is used in institutional long-term care settings and skilled nursing facilities in the United States and Canada. The current version (5.12) of the RUG-III<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269215511417468">28</xref></sup> system uses 108 variables to create either 44 or 34 categories of patients with homogeneous resource patterns (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269215511417468">Table 2</xref>). The 44-group model comprises seven main clinical groups devised as a hierarchy.

<p>In all, there are currently 12 related assessment systems in the interRAI network, spanning areas that include post acute care, mental health, palliative care and long-term care facilities. However, although the principle underlying this collaborative approach is admirable, many of the tools have been in existence for more than a decade without being widely taken up so far in clinical practice.</p>

<title>Casemix development in the UK</title>
<p>The UK has a very different health culture from that in Australia or the United States. The National Health Service (NHS) provides the most comprehensive publicly funded healthcare system in the world, with the majority of healthcare being provided free at the point of delivery. In addition, a closely integrated social services system provides life-long care and support, which is free to all individuals who are unable to pay for it themselves. In the light of this ongoing responsibility, maximizing functional independence is highly valued.</p>
<p>The NHS is now moving towards a standard ‘fixed tariff’ payment system along similar lines to the US-style Prospective Payment system. Introduction of the Department of Health’s Payment by Results programme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215511417468">33</xref></sup> in England represents the biggest change in financial flows in the history of the NHS, and introduces some particular challenges as payment systems change from a ‘block contract’ model (in which the provider is paid a flat annual fee to provide an agreed level of service) to activity-based or ‘cost per case’ model (which reimburse providers on a case-by-case basis).</p>
<p>A trial application of the US-DRGs in the UK acute care sector demonstrated that they did not accurately fit the casemix of the NHS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269215511417468">34</xref></sup> Instead, the UK scheme introduces a national episode-based tariff for healthcare treatments, based on a casemix classification of healthcare resource groups (HRGs), which are derived from a combination of diagnosis (ICD-10) and procedure (OPCS) codes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269215511417468">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269215511417468">36</xref></sup> (see glossary of terms in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269215511417468">Appendix 1</xref> for further explanation). Like DRGs, HRGs are groups of conditions and interventions that are intended to have similar resource implications. The latest iteration (HRGs version 4) has been expanded significantly to underpin standard tariff payments for NHS treatments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269215511417468">37</xref></sup> Tariffs for each HRG are determined through analysis of ‘reference costs’, the average cost of treatment spells within each category, reported by healthcare providers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269215511417468">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>As in other episode-based funding models, the system is intended to reward additional activity and give an incentive to reduce length of stay, so driving up cost-efficiency. However, many specialties have recognized the need for increased ‘granularity’ of the classification to account for the additional costs of treating people with more complex needs. The introduction of mandatory tariffs has been put back in those areas pending further refinement of the casemix model. The Department of Health for England has also accepted the evidence that shorter lengths of stay do not always equate with efficiency,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215511417468">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215511417468">17</xref></sup> and has therefore started to explored alternative payment models for management of long-term conditions, for example in the areas of mental health, palliative care and rehabilitation.</p>
<sec id="section9-0269215511417468">
<title>The challenges for rehabilitation</title>
<p>The implementation of standard tariffs for rehabilitation in the UK poses a number of specific challenges:</p>
<list id="list2-0269215511417468" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Existing NHS coding systems, which are based on diagnosis and procedure codes, contain few categories relating to rehabilitation, and even these are poorly reported. There is, therefore, little retrospective national data on which to estimate activity and base tariff prices.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Where data are available, reference costs for rehabilitation show very high levels of variance due to the marked diversity of needs for rehabilitation among patients within each diagnostic grouping.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A further challenge is presented by variation in caseload across different levels of service specialization. Following recommendations from a report by the Royal College of Physicians in the mid 1980s,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269215511417468">38</xref></sup> rehabilitation services have developed on a three-tiered model of local, district and regional services. To gain the advantage of critical mass, complex cases have been clustered into regional (tertiary) centres with specialized staff and facilities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269215511417468">39</xref></sup> This clustering is feasible in the UK because of the relatively small geographic distances involved. However, it distorts the reference costs, as caseload complexity varies across the different levels of service.</p>
<p>Until recently, these three levels of service had not been formally defined, and it was left up to the provider to classify themselves. In 2009, the UK Department of Health for England published an updated National Definition Set which lays down specific criteria to support formal designation of ‘specialised services’ within in 36 healthcare domains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269215511417468">40</xref></sup> Definition no. 7 ‘Complex specialized rehabilitation for brain injury and complex disability’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269215511417468">41</xref></sup> identifies three levels of rehabilitation service:</p>
<list id="list3-0269215511417468" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Level 1 services – are discrete tertiary specialized rehabilitation services, serving a regional catchment of &gt;1 million population.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Level 2 services – are discrete specialist rehabilitation services, led/supported by a consultant specialist in rehabilitation medicine, but operating within a more local, district-level catchment population (typically 350 000–500 000).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Level 3 services – are local non-specialist rehabilitation services, often provided in the context of acute or intermediate care, as opposed to a discrete rehabilitation unit.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In general, level 1 services have been shown to carry a greater proportion of complex cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269215511417468">42</xref></sup> However, due to the scarcity of such services, level 2 services in many areas have evolved to serve a supradistrict population (e.g. 600 000–1 million) and also carry a relatively high proportion of complex cases. This has led to calls for more accurate ‘patient level costing’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269215511417468">43</xref></sup> and a casemix classification based on complexity of needs for rehabilitation, as opposed to simply categorizing by service type.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269215511417468">
<title>Development of casemix for rehabilitation in the UK</title>
<p>Until 2003/4, the UK casemix system (HRG version 3) did not include separate codes for rehabilitation. Casemix development for HRGs version 4 led to the inclusion of 23 codes for rehabilitation – three for assessment and 20 for admitted inpatient care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269215511417468">37</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269215511417468">Box 1</xref>). The classification is based on diagnosis alone. However, it has been accepted by the UK Department of Health that further refinement is required for the classification to be fit for the purpose of tariff development. An Expert Reference Panel comprising casemix developers from the NHS Information Centre and clinicians from a wide range of rehabilitation service areas was set up to advise on HRG and tariff development in rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Preliminary exploration of the various existing international models revealed that none were immediately suitable for implementation in the UK. Casemix classifications based on measures of physical dependency (e.g. the FIM) may work reasonably well in the context of short-stay level 3 services where acute stroke and orthopaedic rehabilitation form the bulk of the caseload, and patients have reasonably predictable requirements for intervention. However, they work less well in specialist level 1 and 2 programmes, where the predominant focus in the UK is on neurological rehabilitation. For patients with brain injury and other complex neurological disabilities, physical dependency is a much less good predictor of rehabilitation needs.</p>
<p>Although the FIM correlates broadly with needs for basic care in hospital and community settings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215511417468">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215511417468">13</xref></sup> it does not directly measure the requirement for nursing, and correlates only weakly with the need for therapy and medical intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269215511417468">44</xref></sup> It is also relatively insensitive in patients with predominantly cognitive/behavioural problems following brain injury, whose primary needs are for supervision as opposed to physical assistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269215511417468">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>The InterRAI RUG-III system was also explored, as it includes a crude measure of intensity of intervention and an earlier investigation had shown that it had potential as a casemix system for geriatric services in the UK.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269215511417468">32</xref></sup> However, it was found to have limited application in the context of complex specialized rehabilitation because of ceiling effects and, once again, the primary focus of this system is on physical dependency.</p>
<p>Therefore, although existing classifications provided a useful model to build on, they were not in themselves fit for purpose as a casemix and costing model for the UK. Instead, a different casemix classification is proposed, based on complexity of needs for rehabilitation (including care, nursing, therapy and medical intervention) as measured by the Rehabilitation Complexity Scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269215511417468">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269215511417468">44</xref></sup> The weighted per diem payment model has been developed in the context of neurological rehabilitation, but application is expected in other areas of rehabilitation, once it has been validated in this context. The model applies a simple five-tier multilevel tariff through serial complexity ratings, so that the level of reimbursement changes with the requirement for intervention as the episode progresses. A companion paper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269215511417468">46</xref></sup> provides further detail of the model, and the proposed methods for collecting costing and casemix data.</p>
<p>In summary, the development of casemix in rehabilitation poses similar challenges for healthcare systems all around the world. Well-established casemix systems in the United States and Australia have afforded valuable lessons for other countries to learn from but have not provided all the answers. A range of casemix and payment models is required to cater for different healthcare cultures. Casemix tools must be simple and timely for clinicians to apply in routine practice, but must also capture all the key cost-determinants to allow fair payment for treatment of patients with complex needs. The UK approach may have wider application in other socially supported systems of healthcare.</p>
