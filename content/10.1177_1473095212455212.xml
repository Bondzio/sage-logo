<abstract>
<p>Habermas’ critical theory, and particularly his theory of communicative action, has been applied in the theory and practice of communicative planning. The concept of creating a public sphere in planning processes has been used as an ‘ought’ that planners should seek to achieve to create a communicative rationality. Accepting some of the critique of communicative planning from an agonist and Foucauldian perspective, this paper presents a new application of Habermas’ critical theory. Evidence is presented from community activists in two neighbourhoods of their ongoing reflection on the changes to their built environment over 20 years of regeneration. In this context, Habermas’ theoretical work does explain the long-term discourse as the community moved towards a shared consensus on their neighbourhood. This is used to suggest that instead of looking for consensus in the tense conflicting of moments of initial engagement, planners should focus on the longue durée, and the Lifeworld of lived experience, where shared subjectivities over the built environment can develop.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Habermas’ theory of communicative action has been influential in spatial planning in critiquing rational planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473095212455212">Fischer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095212455212">Forester, 1993</xref>), informing the alternative in communicative planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1473095212455212">Forester, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1473095212455212">Healey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1473095212455212">Innes and Booher, 2003</xref>), and being applied in pragmatic planning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1473095212455212">Flyvbjerg, 1998b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1473095212455212">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1473095212455212">Healey, 2009</xref>). By the turn of the millennium, it was suggested that communicative planning was the new paradigm of planning theory and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1473095212455212">Huxley and Yiftachel, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>This article uses empirical evidence that reflects on the longer-term impacts of development – a 20-year story – to re-engage with Habermas’ theory of communicative action in planning theory. Whereas communicative action is often presented as an ‘ought’ – as the public sphere and creating something planners should aspire to but can probably never achieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473095212455212">Flyvbjerg, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1473095212455212">Huxley, 2000</xref>) – here is it considered as an ‘is’: an explanation of how people behave communicatively and come to agreement, including with their built environment. Two novel insights for planning theory are offered that have so far been absent in much of the literature. First, the paper presents an historical perspective on Habermasian discourse. This evidence from community activists’ experience of living with the physical outputs of regeneration – the built environment – is used to suggest that rather than focus on the difficult moment of communicative planning between the planner and community, what is equally important in understanding planning and development, and can be explained by communicative action, is the long-term discourse between a community and its built environment long after the planners and other policymakers have left. Second, the validity of this interpretation is shown through further evidence of community activists acting as ‘little Habermasians’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473095212455212">Barnett et al., 2008</xref>), constantly producing an active discourse of what deprivation and regeneration meant to their communities.</p>
<p>This article therefore offers a reappraisal of Habermas’ possible contribution to planning and new insights into communicative planning theory. Communicative planning has been critiqued from both a theoretical and an empirical perspective. The gap between the rhetoric of communicative planning and the reality of difficult community engagement has brought agonist perspectives to the fore, explaining why the discourse between planners and communities is often political and tense rather than rational, or at worst somewhat tokenistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473095212455212">Bond, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473095212455212">Brand and Gaffikin, 2007</xref>). The insights of agonism have also questioned whether the level of reflexive and empathetic understanding required of communicative planning can ever be achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1473095212455212">Huxley, 2000</xref>). Theoretically, work from Foucauldian and agonist perspectives has questioned the empowering possibilities of communicative planning. Foucauldian analysis has used the methodology of genealogy to uncover the power/knowledge at work within participatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473095212455212">Cruikshank, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473095212455212">Fischler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1473095212455212">McKee, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Looking over the longue durée in the built environment, this article suggests it is wrong to presume that a public sphere can emerge in the rapidity of a planning policy cycle. The persistence of the built environment means a public sphere should not be expected to be solely created by planners before development, but continues through time. Residents will have time to debate and discuss how the new built form responds to their lived experience, and proposals that were once controversial and produced anything but consensus, can become a welcomed change to a neighbourhood, or become part of an ongoing discourse that needs to be recognised in planning processes. The article concludes with some thoughts as to what this may mean for communicative planning and planning theory and practice.</p>

<title>Communicative planning – communication, discourse and power</title>
<p>The reflexivity of latemodernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473095212455212">Bernstein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1473095212455212">May and Perry, 2011</xref>) has led to a sustained intellectual project to question claims of expertise or superior knowledge within a differentiated society and polity, including within spatial planning theory and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473095212455212">Fischer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473095212455212">Fischer and Forester, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1473095212455212">Wagenaar, 2007</xref>). In planning theory, the theoretical perspectives of Habermasian critical theory, agonist theory drawing on the works of Lacan, Mouffe and Zizek, and Foucauldian theory have offered new ways of understanding and doing planning. Some of the debate between these perspectives is rehearsed here – focusing on communication, discourse and power – to frame the empirical data and the theoretical contribution of the article.</p>

<title>Communication</title>
<p>Habermas’ intellectual project has been to try and salvage the enlightenment from the paradox of rationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473095212455212">Ashenden and Owen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473095212455212">Bernstein, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473095212455212">Finlayson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1473095212455212">Outhwaite, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1473095212455212">White, 1995</xref>). Furthermore, his programme of critical theory has been offered as a counter to a post-structuralism he sees as playing into the hands of neo-conservatives and their particular brand of rational liberalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1473095212455212">Habermas, 1985</xref>). As such it appealed to planning theorists who wished to pursue positive planning in the face of post-modern critiques of modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473095212455212">Fischer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1473095212455212">Healey, 2003</xref>). It also allowed planning to be re-formed and understood anew as a collaborative, communicative practice in a differentiated world of governance and a networked polity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1473095212455212">Healey et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1473095212455212">Rhodes, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>At the heart of Habermas’ critical theory is the argument that the rationality of the enlightenment, exemplified by the reflexivity in Kant’s question of <italic>was ist Aufklarung</italic>? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473095212455212">Bernstein, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1473095212455212">Foucault, 2003</xref>), is a rationality defined by communicative action. In a free public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1473095212455212">Habermas, 1989</xref>), the Lifeworld, that arena of social life ‘geared towards the symbolic production and reproduction of its structural components: culture, society, and personality’, can flourish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473095212455212">Cook, 2005</xref>: 56–57). <italic>Homo democratus</italic> can be free to act communicatively, seeking ‘agreement [<italic>Einverständnis</italic>] that terminates in the intersubjective mutuality of reciprocal understanding, shared knowledge, mutual trust, and accord with one another’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1473095212455212">Habermas, 1996b</xref>: 119). To reach this consensus, speakers make a claim for validity based on three standards. The truth claim is judged on the following: first, its truth; second, the speaker’s truthfulness (whether they can be trusted); and finally, its rightness (whether it fits into expected norms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473095212455212">Finlayson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1473095212455212">Habermas, 1996b</xref>: 125–126). Through discourse, truth claims are presented publicly and the parties to the debate attempt to become reflexively aware of the other’s viewpoint to reach agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1473095212455212">Habermas, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1473095212455212">1996b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1473095212455212">McCarthy, 1985</xref>). Although argued to be a universal pragmatic epistemology, the relativity of truth claims, and especially the rightness of any judgement, means ‘[t]he typical states are in the gray areas in between’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473095212455212">Bernstein, 1983</xref>: 120; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1473095212455212">Habermas, 1996b</xref>).</p>
<p>Communicative action has been employed in planning theory because of its emancipatory underpinnings. In Habermas’ conception, the Lifeworld offers freedom. The development of modern industrial capitalism means that the Lifeworld has been corrupted by the System (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1473095212455212">Habermas, 1989</xref>). Crudely put, this is money and power, but can also be understood as the purposive, strategic rationality – the <italic>zweckrationalitat</italic> – identified as a threat by Weber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473095212455212">Bernstein, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473095212455212">Cook, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1473095212455212">Habermas, 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1473095212455212">McCarthy, 1985</xref>). In planning practice, this is the technical knowledge that has reified human subjects and ‘which makes a fetish of science’ as the answer to society’s ills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1473095212455212">Habermas, 1996a</xref>: 63). Applied to planning practice, the theory of communicative action has led to the creation of participatory processes and spaces to allow a public sphere to flourish. The aim has been to create a shared intersubjective understanding between competing stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1473095212455212">Healey, 1997</xref>), and examples of successful participatory processes work to create deep inclusion (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1473095212455212">Quick and Feldman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1473095212455212">Sandercock, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1473095212455212">Young, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>A further use of the theory of communicative action has been as a yardstick to measure participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473095212455212">Dryzek, 1995</xref>). It is the failure of participatory practices to reach the ideals of communicative action that has led to much of the criticism of communicative planning, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1473095212455212">Hillier (2003)</xref> simply puts it: ‘many planning strategies and/or disputes about development applications do not end in harmonious consensus’ (p. 37). Indeed, from a Lacanian perspective ‘conflict, antagonism and contradiction are not breakdowns of the system but rather lie at the heart of society and social change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1473095212455212">Hillier, 2003</xref>: 46). The emotionality, mess and tension of the real world mean that communicative practices are far from the ideal of rational communicative action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473095212455212">Barnes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1473095212455212">Huxley, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Further, the tensions and conflict apparent in participatory practice, often reflecting underlying socio-economic inequalities, produce the sort of instrumental and strategic communication of the <italic>zweckrationalitat</italic> railed against by Habermas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1473095212455212">Huxley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1473095212455212">Huxley and Yiftachel, 2000</xref>). The desire to reach consensus in communicative planning processes can mean deep underlying conflict is not surfaced or discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473095212455212">Brand and Gaffikin, 2007</xref>) and ‘the desirability for the legitimacy of a decision process may mean that a claim to consensus is made authoritatively irrespective of the level of agreement or of who might have been excluded from the process’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473095212455212">Bond, 2011</xref>: 171). In these cases, it is agonism that resonates and explains participatory practices and so it is suggested ‘planning theory needs to have conflict rather than consensus as its frame of reference’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1473095212455212">McGuirk, 2001</xref>: 214). In terms of the evidence presented in the rest of this article, it is important to recognise that this critique of the possibilities of communicative action derives from in-depth analysis of individual moments of participation on specific issues or plans, rather than an understanding of communicative action as an ongoing process.</p>

<title>Discourse</title>
<p>In Habermas’ critical theory, rational discourse embedded in the Lifeworld constitutes communicative action. It is through discourse that actors raise truth claims that are judged to form the basis of future action. The Foucauldian use of discourse as constitutive of society presents a very different idea of discourse to that used in the theory of communicative action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473095212455212">Fischler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473095212455212">Flyvbjerg, 1998a</xref>) and also presents a further critique to communicative planning.</p>
<p>Across a broad range of policy studies, Foucault’s methodology of genealogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1473095212455212">Foucault, [1980] 2003</xref>) and his theorisation of power/knowledge and governmentality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1473095212455212">Foucault, [1978] 2003</xref>) have gained great traction as a critique of modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1473095212455212">McKee, 2009</xref>). For those planners and policy analysts working with subalterns – groups who lack structural power and are being shaped by the governmentalities of the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473095212455212">Cruikshank, 1999</xref>) – the searchlight of Foucauldian critique has been alluring. In research on urban regeneration (here defined as the range of policy initiatives aimed at supporting or ‘turning around’ neighbourhoods characterised by concentrated deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473095212455212">Cochrane, 2003</xref>: 234]), analysis of the genealogy of Foucauldian discourses has highlighted and criticised the construction of the ‘problem’ populations within policy documents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473095212455212">Atkinson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1473095212455212">Hastings, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1473095212455212">Matthews, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1473095212455212">Watt and Jacobs, 2000</xref>), problematised the very concept of regeneration itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1473095212455212">Furbey, 1999</xref>), and in relation to communicative planning practice, has revealed how partnerships to empower the community cannot live up to their idealistic objectives because of the inherent contradictions of the power/knowledge nexus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473095212455212">Atkinson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473095212455212">Collins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473095212455212">Cruikshank, 1999</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473095212455212">Fischler (2000)</xref> suggests, it is the methodology of genealogy, and the questions it raises regarding what any consensus brought about by collaborative action might mean in terms of the exercise of power/knowledge, that arguably offers the greatest critique to the application of Habermas’ theory in communicative planning.</p>
<p>Foucauldian interpretations have been criticised for finding every social relationship to be laden with power. This can lead to social agency being downplayed or purposefully ignored for the sake of criticising something as ‘neo-liberal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473095212455212">Barnett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1473095212455212">Spicer and Flemming, 2001</xref>). At their worst, these analyses make actors empty vessels waiting to be filled up with discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1473095212455212">Spicer and Flemming, 2001</xref>), and applied Foucauldian theory becomes ‘Talcott Parsons updated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473095212455212">Barnett et al., 2008</xref>: 640). If the genealogical approach is unhelpful, then we have to raise the question that was often posed to Foucault – where does critique lead us? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1473095212455212">Foucault, [1980] 2003</xref>: 256). There is an inherent danger that analysis becomes ‘critical criticism’ that will ‘seduce us into despair and defeatism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473095212455212">Bernstein, 1985</xref>: 8, 25) rather than pragmatic analysis that seeks to make policy better. The key issue debated in the literature on communicative planning is whether a public sphere can be created that allows the Lifeworld to sufficiently flourish to produce a discourse to counter power/knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473095212455212">Fischler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1473095212455212">Huxley, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Power</title>
<p>Communicative action in the Lifeworld is perceived by Habermas as an emancipatory force: ‘Communicative reason operates in history as an avenging force’ and the Lifeworld will always challenge the System if allowed to flourish (Habermas, 1982, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473095212455212">Bernstein, 1985</xref>: 25). In collaborative planning, this has been embraced to try and produce a radical democratisation of policymaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473095212455212">Dryzek, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1473095212455212">Healey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1473095212455212">Young, 2000</xref>). Through participatory techniques such as consensus conferences, citizens, juries, and partnerships between street-level bureaucrats and citizens, policymaking is increasingly trying to bring the Lifeworld back into processes dominated by the System and <italic>zweckrationalitat</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473095212455212">Barnes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473095212455212">Fischer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1473095212455212">Wagenaar, 2007</xref>). As such, communicative planning becomes the operation of power in the sense of giving people the ability to effect change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1473095212455212">Fischler, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Critiques of communicative planning present this belief in the emancipatory potential of communicative action as somewhat naïve. As we have seen above, one of these criticisms stems from a Foucauldian perspective of the intertwining of power and knowledge in discourse. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473095212455212">Flyvbjerg (1998a)</xref> asserts, ‘[t]he value of Foucault’s approach is his emphasis on the dynamics of power. Understanding how power works [in terms of technologies of governance and discourses] is the first prerequisite for action, because action is the exercise of power’ (p. 228). Planners are always doing and acting in a power-full way within a governmentality of planning systems. From an agonist perspective, this ignores the underlying inequalities in power relations between the state and communities and that ‘[p]lanners operate within a “hard infrastructure” of legal/administrative and institutional procedures, guidelines, and rules that are products of instrumental rationality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1473095212455212">McGuirk, 2001</xref>: 209). Within this frame ‘[l]iberal moral and/or legalistic projects, such as those of Habermas, are generally unrealizably utopian on anything but a small scale’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1473095212455212">Hillier, 2003</xref>: 41).</p>
<p>Much of this critique derives from the analysis of moments of participation and evidence of the interaction between planners and communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473095212455212">Beaumont and Loopmans, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473095212455212">Brand and Gaffikin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1473095212455212">McGuirk, 2001</xref>). The agonistic and unequal character of participation even applies to the cases discussed here. However, by focusing on communicative action in spaces occupied by planners (or other policymakers) and communities, this work ignores the public sphere of communicative action created by community groups. In the cases presented in the following, this is a public sphere of working-class, predominantly middle-aged, predominantly female community activists committed to improving their neighbourhood for themselves and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1473095212455212">Grimshaw, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1473095212455212">Jupp, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To summarise this review of the debates around communicative planning, although Habermas is seen as ‘morally admirable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473095212455212">Flyvbjerg, 1998a</xref>: 229), his work and responding critiques have remained largely a theory of how planning <italic>ought</italic> to be carried out. The empirical evidence on which these broad discussions in planning theory are based predominantly focus on the process, and usual failure, of planners to create effective public spheres for the creation of communicative rationality. The rest of the article presents evidence of communicative rationality by communities themselves, without the planners but responding to the decisions of the planners.</p>

<title>Planning the built environment, meaning and history</title>
<p>The research discussed in the following sought to understand the meanings of one area of spatial planning policy – urban regeneration policy in Scotland between 1989 and 2009 and how meanings might have changed over this 20-year period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1473095212455212">Matthews, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1473095212455212">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1473095212455212">Yanow, 1996</xref>). During the course of nine months of fieldwork in two case study neighbourhoods – Ferguslie Park in Renfrewshire, south of Glasgow and Wester Hailes in Edinburgh – overt non-participant observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1473095212455212">Gans, 1976</xref>) was used to collect data in meetings organised to engage the local community and community groups themselves (44 meetings in total). Narrative interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1473095212455212">Hollway and Jefferson, 2000</xref>) were also carried out with 27 community workers and local policymakers and 16 community activists (43 in total).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1473095212455212">1</xref></sup> The unstructured narrative interview technique was specifically used to allow for the free association of ideas from people’s experiences of living in the neighbourhoods and Community Planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473095212455212">Cowell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1473095212455212">Matthews, 2012</xref>) experiencing the built environment to their experiences of regeneration and planning processes and practices. Thus, although participants knew the subject of the research (the regeneration programmes), most of the evidence presented in the following was in answer to the opening question ‘can you tell me about your experiences of living in [name of place]?’ The majority of the community activists had lived in the neighbourhoods most of their lives and had been involved in voluntary and state-led initiatives for over 40 years in some cases. For these participants, the negotiated text of the narrative interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1473095212455212">Fontana and Frey, 2000</xref>) became oral history, allowing them to recount their biographies and how their experiences of policy paralleled their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212455212">Diamond, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The interpretive ontology and epistemology underlying the research and analysis also accepted that the built environment of the neighbourhood told a story in itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1473095212455212">Yanow, 1995</xref>). This recognised that through construction, existence, demolition and reconstruction, the built environment entered into a semiotic discourse with residents as they interpreted it and recognised what it symbolised and represented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473095212455212">Feldman, 1995</xref>). The methods used sought to capture the stories, metaphors, symbols and other tropes that implemented and created regeneration policy at the neighbourhood level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1473095212455212">Shore and Wright, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1473095212455212">Yanow, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1473095212455212">2000</xref>). The methodology brought together these stories with evidence from ongoing community engagement around place – a process in Scotland called Community Planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473095212455212">Cowell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1473095212455212">Matthews, 2012</xref>) – for which community activists regularly relied on these stories to explain current problems and possible solutions. The history presented by these participants is subjective, but it was a live history being used and reconstructed in policy discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1473095212455212">Matthews, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1473095212455212">in press)</xref>.</p>
<p>The data gathered also included a broad record of official, semi-official, community and academic evidence, supported by easily accessible archives of newspaper cuttings covering twenty years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473095212455212">Collins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473095212455212">Collins and Gunson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1473095212455212">Gilloran, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1473095212455212">Hastings et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1473095212455212">Kintrea, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1473095212455212">McCrone, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1473095212455212">Paisley CDP, 1978a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1473095212455212">1978b</xref>).

<title>Agonism and communicative rationality in Ferguslie Park and Wester Hailes</title>
<p>Ferguslie Park and Wester Hailes are two peripheral neighbourhoods dominated by socially rented housing. Ferguslie Park was predominantly low-rise tenement flats built in the 1930s that had been experiencing low demand since the mid-1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1473095212455212">Paisley CDP, 1978a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1473095212455212">1978b</xref>). Wester Hailes was the last major local authority housing estate to be built in the UK with the majority of construction taking place from 1968 to 1971 and on construction was immediately an area of low demand housing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1473095212455212">Gilloran, 1983</xref>). As with many peripheral social housing estates in the UK and Europe, by the mid-1980s both neighbourhoods were experiencing very low demand and vacancy problems following decades of state disinvestment, combined with problems of concentrated unemployment, worklessness and socioeconomic deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473095212455212">Dekker and Van Kempen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1473095212455212">Tunstall and Coulter, 2006</xref>). In 1988, both neighbourhoods were chosen for the ambitious regeneration programme, <italic>A New Life for Urban Scotland</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1473095212455212">Matthews, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1473095212455212">Scottish Office, 1988</xref>). Over a decade (1989–1999) the programme invested over £400m in four partnership neighbourhoods, predominantly in capital expenditure on housing renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212455212">CPC, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The policy was widely criticised at the time and since (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1473095212455212">Johnstone and McWilliams, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1473095212455212">Scottish Office, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1473095212455212">Turok, 2004</xref>). This body of criticism focused on two aspects of the policy. First, the initial broad truth claim made about the cause of the urban ‘problem’ and its solution; and second, the deliberative environment that the policy was meant to develop. As a product of a Conservative government, the policy document defined the policy problem as working-class communities in peripheral housing estates becoming dependent on the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1473095212455212">Hastings, 2000</xref>). Communities were to be made ‘responsible’ through community ownership of their homes and the process of intense community engagement.</p>
<p>The process of developing partnerships was taking place when much of the emerging scholarship on communicative planning was emerging and the policy can be very much seen as part of the <italic>zeitgeist</italic> of modern urban governance in the late 1980s and early 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1473095212455212">Healey et al., 1995</xref>). This community engagement through ‘partnership’ was particularly problematic. It is well documented by the communities themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473095212455212">Collins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1473095212455212">Hastings et al., 1994</xref>), the policy evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212455212">CPC, 1999</xref>) and academic research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1473095212455212">Kintrea, 1996</xref>) that this attempt at community engagement was very much like the agonist processes described in much of the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473095212455212">Bond, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473095212455212">Brand and Gaffikin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1473095212455212">McGuirk, 2001</xref>). It was widely recognised that community activists were not equal partners and the language of partnership was tokenistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1473095212455212">Hastings et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1473095212455212">Kintrea, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1473095212455212">Nienhuis et al., 2011</xref>). In Wester Hailes, community activists drafted a document called ‘The Pitlochry Affirmation’ stating that ‘the community will do, not be done to’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1473095212455212">Hastings et al., 1994</xref>). In Ferguslie Park, the community partners were ejected from the partnership early on in the regeneration and the remaining years were spent rebuilding community representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473095212455212">CPC, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1473095212455212">Kintrea, 1996</xref>). Collins’ analysis of the discourses of partnership in Ferguslie Park, based on the work of Bakhtin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473095212455212">Collins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473095212455212">Collins and Gunson, 1997</xref>) underlines that the discourse genre of partnership used by the Scottish Office actually created conflict as it clashed with the discourse genre used by community activists fighting for improvements in their neighbourhoods. The result was the collapse of partnership working (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473095212455212">Collins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1473095212455212">Kintrea, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Returning to the neighbourhoods a decade after these regeneration partnerships meant this research could revisit the communities and understand how discourses had developed since the regeneration process ended – a story of where the neighbourhoods have been, what has happened to them, and what their future might be. This was not a given discourse in the Foucauldian sense, but a Habermasian deliberative discourse broad in subject and including the built environment as an agent. It was a discourse about planning and development but one that was not led by planners – they had left in 1999 when the regeneration of the neighbourhoods was ‘complete’. The quotes around, complete, emphasise a double irony: questioning whether a process called regeneration can ever be complete and successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473095212455212">Atkinson and Moon, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1473095212455212">Shaw and Porter, 2009</xref>); and highlighting that both neighbourhoods still had concentrated deprivation and associated problems, both being in the most deprived 15% of neighbourhoods in Scotland.</p>

<title>Discourse with the built environment</title>
<p>Twenty years since the regeneration programmes in Wester Hailes and Ferguslie Park began, the impact of the physical regeneration was still a ready topic of conversation. The stories that the narrative interview technique allowed to be told revealed two judgements on the redevelopment by community activists, a product of ongoing discourse after the initial planning decisions. The first of these is one of pleased acceptance – the new homes met a dire need for improved housing and gave tenants and residents something to be proud of. The second is more contingent, using the new homes and buildings to represent failed delivery and broken promises. The built environment was part of everyday life and was in discourse with community activists so ‘[w]e see here people jointly considering the extent to which certain maxims do and should hold for them, by taking their ordinary practices as objects of reflection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473095212455212">Barnett et al., 2008</xref>: 646).</p>
<p>The discourse of community activists with their built environment began with the very poor quality housing that had existed before regeneration. In both the neighbourhoods, the problems with housing led to the emergence of community activism in the 1970s, increasingly supported by state-funded community development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473095212455212">Cockburn, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1473095212455212">Gilloran, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1473095212455212">Paisley CDP, 1978c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1473095212455212">Taylor, 1988</xref>). The problems in the neighbourhoods differed. In Ferguslie Park, they emerged as a combination of poor construction and maintenance, overcrowding and simultaneous low demand with vacant properties being vandalised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1473095212455212">Paisley CDP, 1978b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1473095212455212">1978a</xref>). One activist had moved to the neighbourhood from elsewhere in Paisley and was shocked by the poor quality of the housing. Their story of living in the neighbourhood included problems with mice in their dilapidated tenement, still heated from an open fire in the mid-1970s:
<disp-quote>
<p>especially when you’ve got young children it’s quite frightening to find that you’ve got vermin running about your cooker an’ things like that and them coming out of the fireplace to sit and watch TV wi’ you it was quite scary at times. When we couldn’t afford to have a fire lit when the fire was lit it was okay but when the fire wasn’t lit the mice used to come out the grating an’ just run aboot the place it was not nice at the time. (Community activist)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The problems in Wester Hailes were because of modern, system-built high-rise flats and also a general environment that had been designed with the car in mind: ‘a bit short on the pavement department’ as described by one community activist. Residents described the neighbourhood as being ‘grey’ and somewhere they would not have chosen to live. Many of the stories began with them becoming homeless and having to accept a house in the neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>The poor housing was recognised in the initial regeneration strategy documents published in 1989: ‘Major investment is necessary to modernise Ferguslie Park’s housing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473095212455212">Ferguslie Park Partnership (FPP) 1989</xref>: 4); ‘The strategic goals for housing in Wester Hailes are … to improve physical standards’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1473095212455212">Wester Hailes Partnership [WHP], 1989</xref>: 8). New Life for Urban Scotland delivered this housing renewal through massive capital investment and as one research participant described ‘it did exactly what it said on the tin’ (strategic officer). Over £200m were spent over ten years in the two neighbourhoods to refurbish housing and build new homes to replace those that were unfit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1473095212455212">Matthews, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1473095212455212">in press)</xref>. In Habermasian terms, the regeneration strategies raised a truth claim that the major problem in the neighbourhoods was poor housing. This was widely accepted by the communities: ‘they [community activists] wanted the houses modernised or demolished an’ new houses built at the end of the day. They wanted to get away from the tenemental properties’ (community activist). The regeneration programme responded by investing in physical improvements.</p>
<p>Understanding this truth claim from a historical perspective reveals how the final judgement on this policy was not based on truth claims raised at any one moment, or a single participation event. Indeed, it was conflicts about the high levels of subsidy offered to private developers and newly formed community-based housing associations that led to much of the conflict during the regeneration process, especially in Ferguslie Park (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473095212455212">Collins, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1473095212455212">Kintrea, 1996</xref>). Rather, the truth claim that new housing and physical regeneration would improve the neighbourhood ricocheted down time. The new and refurbished houses and new spaces were not ‘read’ once on construction and completion and this interpretation then fixed. The discourse was ongoing with the readers, the community activists, changing their response to the text of the built environment as their lives changed. As they sought to find consensus on what regeneration had meant and what it could mean in the future, the built environment played different roles in this conversation.</p>
<p>In the stories recounted during interview, physical renewal was closely aligned with biographical details of personal and familial successes, such as a child moving into one of the new homes as a mortgaged purchaser rather than a tenant, or friends and relatives exercising the right-to-buy their socially rented homes, which was interpreted as a commitment to the neighbourhood. Activists who were fortunate to live in one of the newer housing association homes spoke of their friends in local authority homes being ashamed of their neighbourhood and home.</p>
<p>This positive story had particular resonance in community activists’ stories because of the intense feeling of injustice linked to stigma (for a discussion on the nature of stigma towards social housing estates in the UK, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1473095212455212">Hastings, 2004</xref>). Both the neighbourhoods had gained notoriety and stigma predominantly because of the poor built environment and historic housing allocation decisions. In Ferguslie Park, the regeneration strategy explicitly sought to improve the ‘exaggeratedly bad image’ of the neighbourhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473095212455212">FPP, 1989</xref>). Community activists linked the impact of the stigma of their address to their everyday lives. This was commonly explained as being let down by local service providers, or by saying that more affluent neighbourhoods received better service quality:
<disp-quote>
<p>I mean because you’ve got likes of [neighbouring more affluent area] and places like that where they do on the whole get a lot more done for them … I used to see it quite a lot you know where they were getting pickups in rubbish bins and things like that put into them you know a lot more then what we did. (Community activist)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There was also a feeling that both neighbourhoods had been used as a ‘dumping ground’ for difficult tenants, without the necessary support to maintain tenancies, the wider neighbourhood or communities. Among resident activists, the expected norm derived from this injustice was that any policy action should be a sufficiently large investment to overcome historic problems; as one community activist described it: ‘there has to be more. What? I don’t know. But there has to be more’. As such, the capital investment in the built environment was interpreted as the one sufficiently large investment that had occurred to meet the needs of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The communicative rationality among the residents allowed for this positive interpretation. However, through their discourse, they also explored the shades of grey around what regeneration meant. Subsequently another common interpretation was that the regeneration had offered nothing <italic>except</italic> physical renewal, recognising the continued problems of concentrated deprivation. As one community activist commented,
<disp-quote>
<p>to me the whole of the partnership the only real thing that I seen that’s been achieved is the change in the housing and I don’t know if that’s just me personally but that’s all I see in in twenty years I’ve lived here is housing. (Community activist)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One key example of this is the interpretation and symbolic use of the Tannahill Community Centre in Ferguslie Park. This modern building, opened by Queen Elizabeth in 1995, was emblematic of the wider failure of regeneration. The community had struggled to make full use of the space and as it had remained under the management of the local authority, community activists had never felt fully empowered to own the space; as one activist described, they were working on
<disp-quote>
<p>changing this into what can be a community centre to benefit this community because this buildin’ doesn’t. It’s whi- it’s painted the right colour it’s a white elephant. (Community activist)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this activist’s story, the white elephant of the Tannahill Centre spoke to the problems of Ferguslie Park and the concentrated deprivation and everyday problems that still continued and that there was a need for ‘more’ in the neighbourhood. In a dialogue with the built environment, the Centre represented the promises of empowerment offered to the community – of a community-run centre to benefit the community – that had been broken as the regeneration process became dominated by government partners.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, community engagement in the regeneration partnerships was difficult and fraught with tension. The discourse described above also allowed this to be reinterpreted as the consensus on the process of regeneration was debated. A unique aspect of the New Life regeneration partnerships was that as an expression of commitment, the UK Government Scottish Office appointed a senior civil servant to the chair of each of the partnership boards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1473095212455212">Scottish Office, 1988</xref>). This meant that the community activists most heavily involved in the partnerships, and who sat on the board felt a great sense of respect for some of these figureheads. Charged with implementing a policy in partnership with the community, these chairs worked hard to help communities and had a key role as a broker in delivering the policy. This was not always seen positively by senior officials at the Scottish Office headquarters. As explained by one community activist,
<disp-quote>
<p>the initial lead officer we had from the Scottish Office … was moved because he was seen to be too familiar with the local local authority mainly, but also with the local community. He tended to be quite open about what they were trying to achieve in the area … it didn’t always have to be done in a formal way if you know what I mean? It became quite informal at the end. (Community activist)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One interpretation of similar relationships has been that they represent the co-option of activists into the power/knowledge nexus of the regeneration partnership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473095212455212">Atkinson, 1999</xref>). In these activists’ stories of regeneration, the relationship was characterised as one of trust and respect. Another community activist described how their chairperson was readily available to be spoken to: ‘I would be allowed to phone [the chairperson] … or phone [name] his secretary’. When the chairs were movedon because they had become ‘too familiar’, this bond of trust and respect was broken, with a matched breakdown of relationships between partners.</p>
<p>This discourse among residents and between residents and their built environment, about the planning and regeneration of these neighbourhoods was allowing the initial truth claims of the regeneration to be constantly tested and used to understand how the neighbourhood was continuing to evolve. This discourse was constitutive of the world of these community activists, but it was evolving and questioning. Unlike in the tense moments of participation in the 1990s, the discourse was flourishing in the Lifeworld of a public sphere of middle-aged, predominantly female community activists. This Lifeworld also had critical power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473095212455212">Bernstein, 1985</xref>). Communicative action enabled these activists to reinterpret the improvements to the built environment as a positive and negative change, and to understand the process that they had gone through over 10 years of dramatic upheavals and political tensions. As ‘little Habermasians’, the grey areas in between intersubjective understanding were still open for exploration as the regeneration settled and the policy world continued to move on.</p>

<title>Policy action and the Lifeworld</title>
<p>For these long-term resident activists, regeneration was not a single 10-year planning event. It was an everyday process of coping with the complex problems produced by the spatial concentration of individual problems in their neighbourhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473095212455212">Atkinson and Kintrea, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1473095212455212">Wagenaar, 2007</xref>). Inter-subjective understanding as to what regeneration might mean could not be achieved in the fraught atmosphere of a rapid regeneration process. The discourse with the built environment over 20 years of change and mixed improvement described earlier allowed for this <italic>and</italic> provided a context for an ongoing negotiation of what regeneration might mean; for example, by discussing and comparing local environmental problems and what may be done to tackle these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1473095212455212">Hastings, 2007</xref>), or by discussing the youth antisocial behaviour that had occurred over the weekend and whether the police had been contacted. These processes of everyday regeneration took place in domestic or informal settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1473095212455212">Jupp, 2008</xref>). These ranged from the shared story or joke across the table at a tenants’ and residents’ association meeting, to a quick catch-up when walking about the neighbourhood. The communicative action of these people in meetings was active debate about ‘the gray areas in between’ of the truth of local deprivation and what regeneration had been and could be. The activists were ‘little Habermasians’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473095212455212">Barnett et al., 2008</xref>: 646) making truth claims about their experiences, and what policy interventions might make their lives better.</p>
<p>A common occurrence of this was debates about youth antisocial behaviour, and what should be done to stop it. Discussions often began with the characterisation of the perpetrators as young tearaways who needed boot-camp treatment. This would be tempered by the personal experience of others who had been volunteers with youth groups or had problems with their own young relatives. This redefined the problem as one of a lack of opportunity, for things to do in the evening and also in the longer term for employment and education. A more holistic solution to the problem then made sense within the negotiated truth and rightness of youth antisocial behaviour, as understood through communicative action.</p>
<p>These deliberative environments were a public sphere allowing the Lifeworld of these resident activists to flourish, uncorrupted by the technicism of the System, empowering them to understand their experiences of regeneration in their own terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473095212455212">Dargan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1473095212455212">Habermas, 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1473095212455212">Jupp, 2008</xref>). Community activist narratives would often include dismissive comments about the bad choices of planners in the past creating the poor neighbourhoods they lived in. They would readily and knowingly use the historic euphemisms of planners to describe the problems of their neighbourhood – ‘under-privileged’, ‘a deprived area’ – and link this to their narrative of successive policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473095212455212">Diamond, 2005</xref>). The residents thus had an institutional memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1473095212455212">Pollitt, 2008</xref>) of these various initiatives, usually greater than that of the professionals with whom they engaged, and debated the rights and wrongs of each approach.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the analysis of community activity in Wester Hailes and Ferguslie Park, Habermas’ critical theory could not be used as a normative ‘ought’ to which policy should aspire as in communicative planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1473095212455212">Flyvbjerg, 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1473095212455212">Healey, 1997</xref>) nor as a yardstick to measure participatory practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473095212455212">Dryzek, 1995</xref>). Rather, Habermas’ theory emerged abductively as an explanation of the ‘is’ – of the everyday deliberative practices of community activists. The historical approach taken questions the assumption that the depth of intersubjectivity required of communicative action can never be achieved. The historicity of the analysis suggests it is naïve to assume that intersubjective understanding can be reached in a rapidly moving planning and policymaking process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1473095212455212">McGuirk, 2001</xref>). What was most important for the community activists in Wester Hailes and Ferguslie Park was to be given the time to understand what the changes in the built environment meant to them and how to use them in their everyday practical discourses.</p>
<p>The discourse with and about the built environment in Wester Hailes and Ferguslie Park developed over two decades since the beginning of the regeneration process. Over this time, communicative action created an intersubjective understanding with the built environment. This discourse in the Lifeworld also produced some of the emancipatory potential theorised by Habermas. The discourse enabled communities to challenge definitions of ‘deprivation’ and ‘regeneration’ placed upon them and to understand the regeneration process in their own terms, both positive and negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1473095212455212">Matthews, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1473095212455212">in press)</xref>. These discourses were enmeshed in much larger biographies and were then developed through practices of discourse in the public sphere of community meetings and exchanges on the street.</p>
<p>Using Habermas’ critical theory in this way, this article builds on the growing body of pragmatic thought and application of pragmatism in planning and policy analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1473095212455212">Flyvbjerg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1473095212455212">Healey, 2009</xref>). The discourse of the community activists, over time, in these neighbourhoods demonstrates communicative action producing a pragmatic judgement and outcome. The understanding that had settled at the time of the fieldwork was that the physical regeneration and particularly the improvements to the housing conditions were the right, practical thing to do at the time. This resonates with the findings from regeneration experiences where physical renewal made residents feel more secure and happier in their neighbourhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1473095212455212">Manzi and Jacobs, 2009</xref>), and that community activists will prioritise physical renewal and capital investment for the rapid improvements it delivers, even if this is not the most ‘rational’ policy action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1473095212455212">Lawless, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1473095212455212">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of practices of communicative planning, it also adds to our understanding of processes of institutional capacity building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1473095212455212">Innes and Booher, 2003</xref>). Examples of successful collaborative approaches to policymaking often focus on the long-term nature of processes of building governance capacity, institutional capacity and trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473095212455212">Barry, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1473095212455212">Innes and Booher, 2003</xref>). The evidence presented here suggests that we also need to consider the built environment itself as part of those institutions. Buildings may not be of sufficient quality to warrant specific legislative protection, but the evidence from Wester Hailes and Ferguslie Park suggests that changes to the built environment continue to help communities understand their lived experience and constantly recreate new meanings and new solutions to challenges. Any future redevelopment processes and associated collaborative forums need to recognise this, if they are to achieve a level of intersubjective understanding with residents; and, further, should harness this knowledge, and the intersubjective understandings of residents, to inform future visions.</p>
