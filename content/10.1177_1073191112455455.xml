<abstract>
<p>The Five-Factor Model Rating Form (FFMRF) is a one-page measure designed to provide an efficient assessment of the higher order domains of the Five Factor Model (FFM) as well as the more specific, lower order facets proposed by McCrae and Costa. Although previous research has suggested that the FFMRF’s assessment of the lower order facets converge reasonably with other FFM measures, the structural validity of the domain-level assessment has not yet been evaluated. The current study employed an exploratory structural equation modeling framework to investigate the fit of a five-factor solution within a combined sample of 757 participants. This was a novel analysis using a combined sample drawn from three previously published studies and was composed primarily of undergraduates but also included a smaller clinical subsample. Results indicated that the FFMRF is well accommodated within a five-factor solution. Furthermore, the FFMRF domain scores evinced large correlations with domain scores from the NEO Personality Inventory–Revised. The results suggest that the FFMRF might hold promise as a choice for those seeking a brief measure that provides a valid assessment of both the broad and specific traits of the FFM.</p>

<p>The Five-Factor Model of personality (FFM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073191112455455">McCrae &amp; Costa, 2008</xref>) stems from the lexical tradition and comprises five bipolar domains that have been labeled surgency or extraversion (vs. introversion), agreeableness (vs. antagonism), conscientiousness (vs. disinhibition), neuroticism (vs. emotional stability), and intellect or openness (vs. closedness to experience). Although alternative models of general personality with between three and seven domains also have been studied extensively (e.g., the HEXACO model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191112455455">Ashton and Lee [2007]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1073191112455455">Tellegen’s [1985]</xref> three temperaments, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191112455455">Cloninger’s [2008]</xref> psychobiological theory), the FFM has proven useful for integrating diverse personality models within a commonly understood framework (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191112455455">Caspi, Roberts, &amp; Shiner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073191112455455">Deary, Weiss, &amp; Batty, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191112455455">Feingold, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1073191112455455">Ozer &amp; Benet-Martinez, 2006</xref>). Indeed, each of the models can be included within a common hierarchical structure, with the five-factor model derivable from the three-factor model of Tellegen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073191112455455">Markon, Krueger, &amp; Watson, 2005</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073191112455455">Markon et al. (2005)</xref> do suggest that the FFM represents the “crucial level of analysis for normal personality research” (p. 154). Because of this success some have argued that “the field has now achieved an initial consensus on a general taxonomy of personality traits” consisting of five personality dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191112455455">John, Naumann, &amp; Soto, 2008</xref>, p. 116).</p>
<p>The FFM does have an extensive research literature supporting its validity including evidence regarding heritability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073191112455455">Krueger &amp; Johnson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1073191112455455">Yamagata et al., 2006</xref>), developmental antecedents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073191112455455">Caspi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1073191112455455">Widiger, De Clercq, &amp; De Fruyt, 2009</xref>), universality across cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073191112455455">Allik, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1073191112455455">McCrae et al., 2005</xref>), temporal stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1073191112455455">Roberts &amp; DelVecchio, 2000</xref>), and preliminary research suggesting ties with brain structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191112455455">DeYoung et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, the FFM has evinced meaningful relationships with important life outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073191112455455">Hopwood et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1073191112455455">Mullins-Sweatt &amp; Widiger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1073191112455455">Ozer &amp; Benet-Martinez, 2006</xref>) and psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1073191112455455">Samuel &amp; Widiger, 2008a</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the five higher order domains are the primary units of the FFM, researchers have further subdivided the domains into lower order facets that provide a fine-grained representation of more specific traits (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191112455455">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191112455455">DeYoung, Quilty, &amp; Peterson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191112455455">Goldberg, 1999</xref>). Facet-level assessments have demonstrated incremental validity beyond the FFM domains for predicting specific behaviors including grade point average attainment and dating frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073191112455455">Paunonen &amp; Ashton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1073191112455455">Paunonen, Haddock, Fosterling, &amp; Keinonen, 2003</xref>) and are useful for differentiating among personality disorder constructs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073191112455455">Axelrod, Widiger, Trull, &amp; Corbitt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1073191112455455">Reynolds &amp; Clark, 2001</xref>). For these reasons, the lower order facets, in addition to the higher order domains, are particularly useful in many contexts.</p>
<p>Because of the utility offered by the facets, there are a number of measures that provide an explicit assessment of lower order constructs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191112455455">Ashton &amp; Lee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191112455455">Goldberg, 1999</xref>). Perhaps the most notable facet level measure is the NEO Personality Inventory–Revised (NEO PI-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191112455455">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992</xref>). Based on their work with this instrument, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191112455455">Costa and McCrae (1995)</xref> divided each domain into six underlying facets on the basis of factor analytic and theoretical considerations. For instance, they indicated that extraversion could be differentiated into the facets of warmth, gregariousness, assertiveness, activity, excitement seeking, and positive emotions. In choosing the facets, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191112455455">Costa and McCrae (1995)</xref> aimed for traits that were comparable in scope, consistent with the existing personality literature, and that represented “the more closely covarying elements within the domain, not arbitrary combinations of elements” (p. 25) to maximize their discriminant validity within the domain.</p>
<p>There are certainly other ways to divide the five domains into their component parts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191112455455">DeYoung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191112455455">Lee &amp; Ashton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1073191112455455">Saucier &amp; Goldberg, 2002</xref>) and the specific facets delineated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191112455455">Costa and McCrae (1995)</xref> have received some criticism. For example, because the FFM domains themselves are not entirely orthogonal, some facets relate to more than a single domain (e.g., impulsiveness within neuroticism typically correlates with conscientiousness and angry hostility often relates with antagonism; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191112455455">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992</xref>). In addition, some have lamented that their development occurred outside of the lexical tradition.</p>
<p>An obstacle to the widespread use of the NEO PI-R or most of these facet-level measures is that they include 200 or more items and require at least 20 to 30 minutes to complete. Such a detailed assessment is advantageous in many respects, but there are situations where this time burden is prohibitive. For example, more abbreviated measures are typically preferred for purposes such as (a) prescreening, (b) when an individual assesses a number of different targets, or (c) for large-scale surveys that cover a variety of topics. The NEO PI-R does have an accompanying abbreviated version, the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). With only 60 items the NEO-FFI is sometimes used by those seeking a more efficient assessment of the FFM. However, its utility is curtailed by the fact that it does not include a facet-level assessment.</p>
<p>In addition to these issues, abbreviated measures are often the only realistic means by which to collect descriptions from busy professionals, such as therapists or physicians within their clinical practice. This latter point was precisely the motivation behind the development by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1073191112455455">Lynam and Widiger (2001)</xref> of a brief rating form that allowed them to collect facet-level FFM descriptions of personality disorders from expert researchers and clinicians. In doing so, they included the identifying label for each of the NEO PI-R facet scales, as well as a few adjective descriptors to describe each of the poles. These adjectives were drawn from the NEO PI-R manual as well as other FFM adjective checklists (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191112455455">Goldberg, 1992</xref>). This rating form, which serves as a brief measure of the NEO PI-R model, was subsequently termed the <italic>Five-Factor Model Rating Form</italic> (FFMRF) and has been used in a number of studies to collect FFM descriptions from psychologists and other mental health professionals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073191112455455">Lowe &amp; Widiger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1073191112455455">Mullins-Sweatt &amp; Widiger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1073191112455455">Samuel &amp; Widiger, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1073191112455455">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1073191112455455">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1073191112455455">2010a</xref>). In these studies, the FFMRF has produced descriptions that have been reliable across raters and evinced temporal consistency comparable to other FFM measures (i.e., median 6-month stability for the domains was .54; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1073191112455455">Samuel &amp; Widiger, 2011a</xref>).</p>
<p>Recognizing its potential utility as an abbreviated measure of the FFM facets, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1073191112455455">Mullins-Sweatt, Jamerson, Samuel, Olson, and Widiger (2006)</xref> used the FFMRF to collect self-report ratings. Through a series of studies they made minor revisions to the adjective descriptors (e.g., <italic>sensitive</italic> and <italic>responsive</italic> were replaced by <italic>self-aware</italic> for high openness to feelings) and investigated the psychometric properties of the FFMRF. They found that self-report ratings on the FFMRF displayed reasonable internal consistency with a median alpha value for the domains of .69 across five samples. The FFMRF domain scores also displayed median convergent validity values with the NEO PI-R that ranged from .57 (openness) to .68 (extraversion). At the facet level, the average convergence of the FFMRF items with the respective NEO PI-R facets within each domain ranged from .37 (openness) to .50 (extraversion) and were larger than the mean discriminant validity correlations with facets within (<italic>Mdn</italic> = .24) and outside (<italic>Mdn</italic> = .03) the same domain. Finally, the FFMRF scores manifested predictable relationships with personality pathology, supporting the construct validity of the measure. The FFMRF has since been used in other studies as a self-report measure (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1073191112455455">Wirth, Lynam, &amp; Williams, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite this evidence supporting the validity of the FFMRF, there are limitations to the existing literature that should be addressed. Further examination is particularly warranted in the case of the FFMRF as abbreviated measures must demonstrate validity comparable to their parent measures rather than simply time savings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1073191112455455">Smith, McCarthy, &amp; Anderson, 2000</xref>). More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1073191112455455">Smith et al. (2000)</xref> identified a series of potential concerns that should be explored in the validation process of short form measures. For example, they indicated that abbreviated measures should demonstrate empirically that they reproduce the factor structure of lengthier inventories. This is particularly relevant for the FFMRF as the higher order factor structure is the defining feature of the FFM. However, there has not yet been an examination of the FFMRF to determine how well its facet ratings cohere within the FFM framework. We address this by examining the fit of a five-factor solution to FFMRF data drawn from 757 participants combined across three previously published data sets. We then investigated the convergent and discriminant validity of the FFMRF scores with those from the NEO PI-R.</p>

<title>Samples and Participants</title>
<p>The data used in the present study were compiled from three previously published studies in which the self-report FFMRF was administered. One hundred and thirty-eight undergraduate participants were drawn from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073191112455455">Samuel and Widiger (2008b)</xref>. An additional 536 undergraduate participants completed the FFMRF as part of a study concerned with measures of obsessive compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) in which a portion of this subsample included individuals prescreened for elevated levels of OCPD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1073191112455455">Samuel &amp; Widiger, 2010b</xref>). Finally, 83 participants were drawn from a clinical sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1073191112455455">Samuel &amp; Widiger, 2010a</xref>), yielding a total combined sample of 757 individuals. However, the current results represent a novel use of the data. The clinical sample has been used in existing publications, but those previous reports did not concern any data from the self-report FFMRF. The sample of 536 undergraduates completed the full FFMRF, but only the conscientiousness domain score was used in a previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1073191112455455">Samuel &amp; Widiger, 2011b</xref>), such that all facet-level information is novel. Finally, although no FFMRF data were reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073191112455455">Samuel and Widiger (2008b)</xref>, a preliminary subset of these participants (<italic>n</italic> = 75) was reported as Study 5 within the original <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1073191112455455">Mullins-Sweatt et al.’s (2006)</xref> article. Thus, to avoid potential overlap we use this particular subsample only for the factor analytic procedures and not the convergent and discriminant validity analyses, which are confined to the remaining 619 participants.</p>
<p>The demographics for the three subsamples have been reported previously in the articles cited above, but we note that demographics of the first two were comparable with typical university students (i.e., young, primarily White, and slightly more females than males). The clinical subsample was recruited from various treatment clinics within a moderately sized city in the Southeastern United States, but a majority of participants were drawn from a therapeutic community for women with substance use disorders. Demographically, the clinical subsample was older (<italic>M</italic> = 34.8 years), more diverse (24% African American), less educated, and was confined to women. Substance use diagnoses predominated the subsample, with cocaine abuse/dependence (59%) the most common. Other prominent diagnoses in this subsample included antisocial (36%), borderline (23%), and avoidant (21%) PDs, as well as major depressive (11%) and bipolar (10%) mood disorders. The pooled demographics for the combined sample was 68% female with a mean age of 20.9 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 6.4). Eighty-nine percent were White and 7% were African American.</p>

<title>Five-Factor Model Rating Form</title>
<p>The FFMRF is a one-page rating form consisting of an item representing each of the 30 facets of the FFM. The 30 items are organized with respect to the five domains. For example, under the heading Neuroticism are six items. Each item is rated on a 1 to 5 scale where 1 is <italic>extremely low</italic>, 2 is <italic>low</italic>, 3 is <italic>neither high nor low</italic>, 4 is <italic>high</italic>, and 5 is <italic>extremely high</italic>. For example, the neuroticism facet of anxiousness was assessed with the descriptors “fearful, apprehensive versus relaxed, unconcerned, cool” and the openness facet of ideas was assessed with the descriptors “strange, odd, peculiar, creative versus pragmatic, rigid.” Cronbach’s α values for the FFMRF domains within the combined sample ranged from .63 (openness to experience) to .80 (conscientiousness), with a median of .72.</p>

Eight items assess each of the 30 facets, which are in turn summed to score the five domains.

<title>Factor Analytic Procedures</title>
<p>Because the FFMRF implies a clear five-factor structure we sought to investigate how well it would fit within a traditional confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) framework using M<italic>plus 6.11</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1073191112455455">Muthen &amp; Muthen, 2011</xref>), employing the maximum likelihood estimator (MLR). Nonetheless, we recognized that the strict assumptions of CFA might provide an unreasonable standard for personality measures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073191112455455">Hopwood &amp; Donnellan, 2010</xref>). Indeed, even the most robust FFM inventories, such as the NEO PI-R, have failed to reproduce the expected five-factor framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1073191112455455">McCrae, Zonderman, Costa, Bond, &amp; Paunonen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1073191112455455">Vassend &amp; Skrondal, 1997</xref>). Thus, we also used exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM), which blends elements of CFA with those from exploratory factor analysis. Recent advances in this methodology have demonstrated that ESEM can adequately model data from FFM inventories, where CFA methods fail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073191112455455">Marsh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1073191112455455">Rosellini &amp; Brown, 2011</xref>). For the ESEM analyses, we used the MLR estimation procedure. Although the FFM domains are theorized to be orthogonal, we used the geomin rotation method recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191112455455">Browne (2001)</xref> as this oblique method allows factors to emerge as orthogonal if this reflects the data (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191112455455">Fabrigar, Wegener, MacCallum, &amp; Strahan, 1999</xref>). Echoing previous reports (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073191112455455">Marsh et al., 2010</xref>), we used several fit indices. These included the comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker–Lewis index (TLI), with values above .90 and .95 indicating acceptable and excellent fit, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073191112455455">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>). We also used the root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) with values lower than .080 and .050 indicating close and reasonable fit, respectively, and the standardized root mean square residual where values below .050 indicating good fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1073191112455455">Marsh, Hua, &amp; Wen, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Factor Analytic Procedures</title>
<p>We first employed a traditional CFA using the procedures described earlier. As with prior research using FFM instruments, a five-factor solution provided an inadequate fit, CFI = .753, TLI = .728, RMSEA = .067, and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = .080. We then proceeded with the ESEM analysis and this revealed a much better fit. The ESEM results indicated at least acceptable fit according to all the metrics, CFI = .943, TLI = .915, RMSEA = .033, SRMR = .027. To provide a clearer test of the differences between these two models, we examined the sample size adjusted Bayesian information criteria (BIC) for each model. The BIC for the CFA model was 55,427, and the value for the ESEM model was 54,668. This difference of 759 is quite a lot larger than the BIC difference of 10 that indicates very strong evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1073191112455455">Raftery, 1995</xref>) for improved fit.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1073191112455455">Table 2</xref> provides the parameter estimates based on the ESEM solution. These results suggest that not only does a five-factor ESEM solution fit the data adequately, but that the specific loadings align closely with the FFMRF’s a priori structure. Parameter estimates greater than |.30| are in boldface type, consistent with previous approaches to identify items with meaningful loadings on a factor. The standard errors for each of these loadings appear in parentheses. The first factor was defined primarily by the neuroticism facets, which obtained loadings ranging from .38 (impulsivity) to .69 (depressiveness). In contrast, the largest loading of a facet from another domain was −.15 for the positive emotions facet of extraversion. The second factor was defined by loadings of the six extraversion facets ranging from .35 (positive emotions) to .60 (gregariousness). The loading of the impulsivity facet from neuroticism (.33) was the only other that was larger than .30. The third factor was defined by loadings for the six facets of conscientiousness ranging from .46 (deliberation) to .61 (competence). The impulsivity facet from neuroticism also displayed a sizeable negative loading (−.30) on this factor. The fourth factor was more mixed as it included sizeable loadings of five of the agreeableness facets. Although the facet of straightforwardness (.26) failed to reach this threshold, the other agreeableness facets ranged from .39 (altruism) to .59 (tendermindedness). This factor also evinced loadings from the facets of warmth (.34), assertiveness (−.39), and angry hostility (−.39). The fifth and final factor was defined by five facets of openness, as well as the excitement seeking facet from extraversion (.30). The facet of openness to feelings failed to load appreciably on this factor (.16).</p>

<p>The first column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1073191112455455">Table 4</xref> provides the convergent correlations, indicating the degree of one-to-one correspondence between the measures. The convergent values for the facets were considerably more variable than for the domains, ranging from a low of .17 (tendermindedness) to .64 (order), with a mean value across of .41 across the 30 facets. In all cases the convergent correlations were larger than the average discriminant correlations with facets from other domains. These mean discriminant values with facets from other domains ranged from .05 (openness to aesthetics) to .15 (depressiveness), with a mean value of .10. When examining the range of discriminant correlations of each individual FFMRF facet, it is apparent that there was only one that was larger than the convergent correlation. This was for the FFMRF facet of tendermindedness (from agreeableness) that correlated more highly with the NEO PI-R extraversion facet of warmth (<italic>r</italic> = .21) than it did with NEO PI-R tendermindedness (<italic>r</italic> = .17).</p>
<p>The discriminant values with other NEO PI-R facets from the same domain were understandably larger given they assess related, but independent traits. Nonetheless, all but one of the mean discriminant values inside the home domain were lower than the convergent values. The one exception was again tendermindedness, which obtained a mean value of .23 with other facets from its home domain of agreeableness. However, there were three additional facets for which the FFMRF correlated more highly with a discriminant NEO PI-R facet within the same domain than with the target scale. FFMRF openness to ideas correlated more highly with NEO PI-R openness to fantasy (.33) than the convergent correlation (.28). Similarly, the FFMRF agreeableness facet of compliance related more strongly to NEO PI-R altruism (.28) than its home facet (.27), and the FFMRF conscientiousness facet of competence correlated more strongly with NEO PI-R achievement striving (.31) than its convergent value (.29). Tendermindedness, though, was the most problematic as this FFMRF facet correlated more highly with four NEO PI-R facets (straightforwardness, altruism, modesty, and compliance) than the NEO PI-R facet of the same name.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>An important validity test for any abbreviated measure is that it demonstrates a factor structure that is consistent with that of the parent instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1073191112455455">Smith et al., 2000</xref>). This is even more crucial in the case of an instrument designed to assess a model such as the FFM, where the higher order factor structure is a hallmark. The current study demonstrated that the FFMRF displayed an adequate fit within a five-factor structure using ESEM and that the loadings of the individual facets within this solution were largely consistent with their theoretical placements. In fact, the fit indices for the FFMRF in the current study were even higher than those obtained for the more established NEO-FFI in two published studies (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073191112455455">Marsh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1073191112455455">Rosellini &amp; Brown, 2011</xref>). In addition to the hierarchical structure, the FFMRF displayed convergent validity correlations that were large at the domain level (e.g., &gt;.50; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191112455455">Cohen, 1992</xref>). Although, there were exceptions, the convergent validity of the FFMRF facets was also quite reasonable (e.g., 24 of the 30 facets obtained values &gt;.30 with an overall mean of .41). The discriminant validity, evidenced by the mean absolute value of correlations outside the home domain, was also quite good, with a value of .13 for the domains and .10 for the facets. Only a single FFMRF facet (tendermindedness) correlated more highly with a NEO PI-R facet outside its home domain, than it did with the convergent scale. These findings build on existing evidence to indicate that the FFMRF provides a concise and efficient assessment of the FFM’s higher order domains as well as the more specific facets proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191112455455">Costa and McCrae (1992)</xref>. Taken together, this suggests the FFMRF should be considered when one is interested in assessing the higher and lower order traits of the FFM, but constraints prohibit the administration of a lengthier measure.</p>
<sec id="section12-1073191112455455">
<title>Hierarchical Structure</title>
<p>As indicated above, the FFMRF demonstrated an adequate fit with the five-factor solution and the specific loadings were largely consistent with theoretical placements. Nonetheless, there were instances in which specific facets evinced significant cross-loadings on additional factors and at least one case where a facet failed to load appreciably on the predicted factor. There were six facets that obtained a sizeable (≥.30) loading on a factor other than that predicted. However, in most of these instances the cross-loading of certain facets was understandable given their content and was consistent with prior research on FFM instruments. For example, the facets of warmth and assertiveness from extraversion and angry hostility from neuroticism also loaded on agreeableness. The finding that warmth would load highly on a factor defined by agreeableness is hardly surprising or without precedent in the literature. Research has routinely demonstrated a “fuzzy boundary” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191112455455">John et al., 2008</xref>, p. 136) between agreeableness and extraversion and warmth has often been at the center of this, both literally and figuratively.</p>
<p>When these two domains are placed on orthogonal axes, one can examine where individual traits fall, and this type of research has demonstrated that the term warmth falls within the interstitial space between the two domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073191112455455">Hofstee, de Raad, &amp; Goldberg, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191112455455">John et al., 2008</xref>). The most well-known of these circles is the interpersonal circumplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1073191112455455">Wiggins, 1979</xref>), which is a 90-degree rotation of agreeableness and extraversion, and explicitly labels the upper pole warmth. Thus, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191112455455">Costa and McCrae (1992)</xref> placed the facet of warmth within the domain of extraversion, they also obtained notable cross-loadings with agreeableness. Other measures have placed it within agreeableness (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1073191112455455">Saucier &amp; Ostendorf, 1999</xref>), and research from the lexical tradition has generally indicated that warmth is closer to agreeableness than extraversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191112455455">Goldberg, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073191112455455">John, 1990</xref>). The current results support the primary placement of warmth within extraversion, but again indicate that it relates nearly as highly with agreeableness.</p>
<p>Similarly, angry hostility is placed within the domain of neuroticism on the FFMRF and the current results support this placement. However, it also loaded strongly (−.39) on the factor defined by agreeableness. Likewise, the facet of assertiveness, although assigned to extraversion, also loaded negatively on agreeableness (−.39). Again it is not particularly surprising as factor analyses of other FFM instruments also show these cross-loadings (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191112455455">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073191112455455">Trull et al., 1998</xref>) and these facets often correlate highly negatively with measures of agreeableness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191112455455">John et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The current factor analysis also suggested meaningful secondary cross-loadings of other facets including impulsivity and excitement-seeking. The facet of impulsivity loaded primarily on its intended domain of neuroticism (.37), but evinced secondary loadings with conscientiousness (−. 30) and extraversion (.33). This is again consistent with previously published findings as the impulsivity facet from the Structured Interview for the FFM (SIFFM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1073191112455455">Trull &amp; Widiger, 1997</xref>) actually obtained a primary negative loading with conscientiousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073191112455455">Trull et al., 1998</xref>). The difficulty of placing the facet labeled impulsivity may stem from the fact that the construct of impulsivity is quite broad. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1073191112455455">Whiteside and Lynam (2001)</xref> identified four facets from the NEO PI-R that assessed distinct aspects of what others have termed impulsivity. These included the facets of impulsivity (neuroticism), as well as excitement-seeking (extraversion), deliberation (conscientiousness), and self-discipline (conscientiousness). Thus, it not particularly surprising that the FFMRF facet of impulsivity would also cross-load with the domains of conscientiousness and extraversion.</p>
<p>Continued research on the FFMRF’s assessment of these particular facets will be helpful in determining if they achieve expected correlations with measures beyond the NEO PI-R and/or other outcomes. In any event, the current study suggested that the FFMRF evinces a five-factor structure that is largely consistent with its conceptual organization. In fact, the structural validity of the FFMRF appears to be as high as other existing measures of the FFM. As indicated previously, the ESEM fit indices for the five-factor solution obtained in the present study were higher than those obtained for the NEO-FFI in two previous publications (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073191112455455">Marsh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1073191112455455">Rosellini &amp; Brown, 2011</xref>). Although we are not aware of any published studies that used ESEM to examine the fit for the NEO PI-R or the SIFFM, exploratory factor analysis of these instruments display structures similar to what we found for the FFMRF.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the FFMRF facets achieved a robust, primary loading on their home domain. The primary exception was the facet of openness to feelings, which loaded only .16. Nonetheless, this particular facet appeared not to fit well with the FFMRF at all, as it also did not load any higher on another factor. This particular facet has been problematic for the FFMRF in prior research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1073191112455455">Mullins-Sweatt et al., 2006</xref>) and has been revised previously to address this issue. However, in the current study it did not load cleanly on the openness factor and achieved among the lowest convergent relationships with the NEO PI-R. Although its discriminant validity was adequate, this might reflect that it does not correspond well with any of the other content on the NEO PI-R, whether within openness or across the instrument. Thus, the performance of this item suggests that results concerning openness to feelings on the FFMRF should be interpreted carefully and that additional revisions might be considered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1073191112455455">
<title>Convergent and Discriminant Validity</title>
<p>The current study suggested that the FFMRF evinced large convergent correlations at the domain level that were consistent with the values reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1073191112455455">Mullins-Sweatt et al. (2006)</xref>. The mean convergent value of .58 for the domains suggests that the content assessed by the FFMRF is comparable to that assessed by the NEO PI-R. The convergent values for the facets were also quite large in many instances (i.e., <italic>r</italic> = .64 for the conscientiousness facet of order). However, there were exceptions. For example, the FFMRF facet of tendermindedness achieved relatively poor convergence with the NEO PI-R (<italic>r</italic> = .17). The findings for the openness facets of feelings, actions, and ideas as well as the agreeableness facet of compliance were also lower than might be expected. Although single items are undoubtedly handicapped in this regard, the adequate convergence for several other facets raises the bar and suggests that the FFMRF’s assessment of these traits might differ in important ways from the NEO PI-R.</p>
<p>It is notable in this regard that three facets of openness were among the most problematic. Not all of openness had this issue as, for example, the facet of openness to fantasy obtained a convergent value of .52. Nonetheless, there may be something specific that limits the convergence between the NEO PI-R and FFMRF assessments of openness. One possible explanation for the limited convergence is that the FFMRF was originally developed as a measure to be used by clinicians. This might serve to decrease the convergent values in two ways. First, the FFMRF includes some terms that connote specific meanings to professionals but that may be more difficult for laypersons to comprehend and respond to effectively. This is particularly salient for a few facets of openness (e.g., <italic>alexythymic</italic>). An investigation of the reading level required for comprehension of the FFMRF would be useful to address this possibility. Second, the adjectives included on the FFMRF often reflect more pathological terms that are hypothesized to be maladaptive, extreme variants of the same traits assessed by the NEO PI-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073191112455455">Widiger &amp; Trull, 2007</xref>). Although a body of research has provided relatively consistent support for this hypothesis (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1073191112455455">Samuel &amp; Widiger, 2008a</xref>), the findings for certain aspects have been varied (e.g., the relationship of high openness with oddity/eccentricity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1073191112455455">Watson, Clark, &amp; Chmielewski, 2008</xref>). Thus, some FFMRF adjectives might not have perfect one-to-one correspondences with the NEO PI-R’s assessment of these traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073191112455455">Haigler &amp; Widiger, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to note in this regard that even if this were the case it might not necessarily reflect a limitation of the FFMRF. The NEO PI-R is only a single representation of the FFM and there are other measures that also provide an assessment of these same traits. Thus, research that examines the correlation of the FFMRF with other FFM measures beyond the NEO PI-R (and those assessing similar constructs, such as the HEXACO PI-R) would be useful in determining the extent to which the FFMRF representation of these traits is unique from those designed to assess the more normative aspects.</p>
<p>The discriminant values for the FFMRF also were mostly in line with expectations. There was appropriate convergence among different facets within domains (<italic>M</italic> = .23) and more limited relationships to facets from other domains (<italic>M</italic> = .10). Although three facets (compliance, competence, and ideas) obtained a discriminant correlation within the same domain that was larger than the convergent value, these differences were slight (i.e., .28 vs. .27). The only FFMRF facet that can be said to have truly problematic discriminant validity is tendermindedness. Not only was the mean correlation with other NEO PI-R agreeableness facets higher than the convergent value, but FFMRF tendermindedness even correlated more highly with the NEO PI-R facet of warmth (from extraversion) than with its own companion facet. As discussed previously, the similarity between the facet of warmth and aspects of agreeableness (particularly tendermindedness) is not unexpected. Nonetheless, this convergent value from the current study (.17) is notably lower than what was obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1073191112455455">Mullins-Sweatt et al. (2006)</xref>, so future research is needed to determine if this limited convergence will replicate in additional samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1073191112455455">
<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>Taken together, the current findings concerning the hierarchical structure and convergence with an established measure provided additional support for the validity of the FFMRF. This suggests that the FFMRF is an abbreviated measure that maintains the higher order structure of the FFM while also providing an effective assessment of the lower order facets. The inclusion of the lower order facets is crucial for the utility of the FFMRF, as they have been shown to be useful for differentiating constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1073191112455455">Reynolds &amp; Clark, 2001</xref>) and predicting specific behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1073191112455455">Paunonen et al., 2003</xref>). Nonetheless, the current article was limited by the fact that a majority of the participants were undergraduate students. Although a clinical group did comprise a portion of our combined sample, it would be useful to replicate and extend these findings using a community sample with a greater range of ages and other demographic variables as well as a variety of reading levels.</p>
<p>An additional property of the FFMRF that could have affected the current findings was the fact that the FFMRF items are grouped according the domains to which they are assigned. It is possible that such a format could increase the cohesion of the factor structure. This should be investigated in future research that uses alternative ordering of the FFMRF items. Nonetheless, the fact that a number of FFMRF facets did display secondary loadings that are consistent with previous factor analytic research does suggest that participants rated facets at least somewhat independently.</p>
<p>The FFMRF is emerging as a potentially useful choice for individuals wishing to obtain a valid and efficient assessment of the FFM. Currently, the 44-item Big Five Inventory (BFI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1073191112455455">John, Donahue, &amp; Kentle, 1991</xref>) is the most commonly employed short-form measure for assessing personality within psychology research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191112455455">John et al., 2008</xref>). This use is warranted as the BFI provides a well-validated, freely available, and brief measure of the FFM domains. In fact, the convergence between the BFI and NEO-FFI in prior research (<italic>M</italic>= .77; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073191112455455">John &amp; Soto, 2007</xref>) was higher than that obtained for the FFMRF and NEO PI-R in the current study (<italic>M</italic> = .58). Thus, it would be unreasonable to suggest the FFMRF should replace the BFI in instances where only domain scores are necessary. However, a possible limitation of the BFI is that it does not allow the assessment of lower order traits or facets. Thus, it is important that the current results suggest the FFMRF provides a valid assessment of the five higher order factors but also yields information about lower order traits. Given the increased predictive validity demonstrated for facet-level measures in general, future research that directly compares the BFI and the FFMRF in terms of their respective abilities to predict important behavioral outcomes associated with personality would be quite helpful.</p>
<p>Similarly, the NEO-FFI is also an established measure of the FFM domains that is used quite frequently. It has the advantage of being explicitly tied to the NEO PI-R (indeed, the NEO-FFI is simply a subset of the NEO PI-R items), but like the BFI is limited by only providing an assessment of the FFM domains. Thus, it would also be useful for future studies to compare the NEO-FFI (along with the BFI) with the FFMRF in terms of comparative validity.</p>
<p>It would also be useful for future research to investigate other important properties of the FFMRF. For example, one potential concern with single-item assessments is their temporal consistency, so studies that report test–retest values for the FFMRF are necessary. This should include both short- (i.e., a week) and long-term (i.e., 6 months or more) retest intervals to gather information about both the dependability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1073191112455455">Watson, 2004</xref>) and consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1073191112455455">Roberts, Wood, &amp; Caspi, 2008</xref>) of the measure. Another potentially useful analysis for short-form measures is to quantify the time-savings versus the validity cost relative to a longer measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1073191112455455">Smith et al., 2000</xref>). In other words, research should investigate the time it takes individuals to complete the FFMRF relative to a longer inventory, such as the NEO PI-R, and then compare the two in terms of their validity. This would provide information so that assessors could make informed decisions about the trade-off between efficiency and validity when considering a short form.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The current study builds on previous research to demonstrate that the FFMRF has a higher order structure that corresponds well with its prescribed FFM framework and evinces large convergent correlations with the NEO PI-R domains. Although some FFMRF facets deserve further scrutiny, most demonstrated defensible convergent and discriminant validity. These findings indicate that the FFMRF can be considered a robust measure of the FFM domains that also includes the added benefit of assessing specific, lower order traits. Further research is needed, but our findings suggest the FFMRF is a reasonable alternative for those seeking an abbreviated measure of the FFM that includes both broad and specific traits. Nonetheless, we emphasize that any abbreviated measure offers psychometric trade-offs in exchange for time savings, and the complete NEO PI-R is recommended when resources permit. However, when barriers prevent the administration of a lengthy instrument and lower order traits are desired, the one-page FFMRF appears to be a practical option for assessing personality.</p>
