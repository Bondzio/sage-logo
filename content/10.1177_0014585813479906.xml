<sec id="sec2-0014585813479906"><title><bold>Reviewed by:</bold> Sara Bonfili, University of Macerata, Italy</title>
<p><italic>Answering Auschwitz</italic> collects 19 essays about Primo Levi’s life and works, interpretations of his journalistic articles, his influence on Holocaust Studies and Jewish groups, in addition to some philosophical, phenomenological and theological interpretations of Levi’s works. The published essays were presented in 2007, the year of the 20th anniversary of Levi’s death, at the three-day international conference at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, where scholars from Italy, Scotland, England, Belgium, Israel and United States met.</p>
<p>The volume is divided into four parts: ‘Psychology, Theology and Philosophy’, ‘Humanism and Politics’, ‘Literature’ (covering Primo Levi’s literary background), and ‘Reflection on Writing’. The final section contains Terri Bowman’s drawings (2006) that shape the painful experience of the Lager and the ‘grey zone’, as in the chapter of that name in <italic>The Drowned and the Saved</italic>.</p>
<p>Stanislao G Pugliese’s prologue focuses on Primo Levi’s role in opposing revisionism, Nazism and fascism. Levi was a prominent figure as a witness to the Holocaust, a political analyst and a public affairs observer. With his humanism, he taught us to be rational in the face of ethical problems while being open-minded in respect to some ethical themes and much more conservative in respect to others. He represented Jewish pride instead of atheism, but he also criticized the government of Prime Minister Begin during the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Pugliese remembers Levi’s warnings about the risk of revisionism. For instance, he cites Silvio Berlusconi (Italian Prime Minister, 1994–1995, 2001–2006, 2008–2011), and his interpretations of some fascist facts. Pugliese alludes to it, calling it an ‘Italian anomaly’, but referring also to other risks of historical memory loss.</p>
<p>Some essays are focused on the psychological experiences of the victims and persecutors, like ‘Warum?’ (‘Why?’), by Joram Warmond, who speaks about perpetrators and bystanders, most of the time ‘willing executioners’ (p. 22), or ‘Guild or Shame?’ by Amy Simon, about the camp survivors’ feeling of guilt and pain for resisting, not rebelling against Nazi crimes. Joan Åhr in ‘Primo Levi and the Concept of History’ treats ‘history’s miscellany’ of <italic>The Drowned and the Saved</italic>, deepening Levi’s distinction between victims and killers. The scholars all quote the famous ‘grey zone’, referring to the contradictory behaviour of some prisoners and bystanders, as from Levi’s 1986 collection <italic>The Drowned and the Saved</italic>.</p>
<p>Mary L Baird, in ‘Kenosis, Saturated Phenomenology and Bearing Witness’, underlines Levi’s camp experiences and the overwhelming event of Auschwitz as a ‘saturated phenomenality’, as French phenomenologist Jean-Luc Marion defined it. That is to say that the tremendous experiences through which Levi lived made him into a writer, a vocation that, in Baird’s opinion, he might otherwise have never pursued (‘If I had not lived the Auschwitz experience I probably would have not written anything’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0014585813479906">Primo Levi, 1958</xref>: 246).</p>
<p>Timothy Pytell discusses ‘What Is a Good Death?’, concerning Primo Levi’s supposed suicide, making connections with the high number of Holocaust survivors’ suicides, such as Bruno Bettelheim, Paul Célan, Jerzy Kosinski, Tadeus Borowski, and above all Jean Améry, of which Pytell gives a detailed biography. Améry was born Hans Maier in Vienna in 1912, an assimilated Jew, like Levi, and like him he never conceived of himself as a Jew, as he wrote in <italic>Being a Jew: A Personal Account</italic> (1984). He was a philosopher and philologist, as he explained in many works, and as Levi recounts in ‘Intellectual in Auschwitz’, a chapter of <italic>The Drowned and the Saved</italic>. He fled to Antwerp, where he was captured by French and Belgium authorities as a German citizen and deported to Camp de St. Cyprien in the spring of 1940; after the French defeat, he was transferred to Gurs in July 1940. After many adventures, he managed to evade the authorities and return to Belgium, but he was again arrested in 1943, tortured and brought to Auschwitz, which he narrates differently from Levi. Pytell remembers his position on suicide as a conscious and human choice in the essay ‘On Suicide’ (1999), criticized in Levi’s ‘Intellectuals in Auschwitz’. In addition to this, he notes that Levi’s biographer, Ian Thomson, recounted that the writer was very focused on Améry’s idea of self-murder during his last days, and even if not sure about this, Pytell dares to support the interpretation of the suicidal death. I would rather lean towards the accident, perhaps due to a depressive situation, remembering Levi’s opinion about being an intellectual who constantly withstands death, having resisted Auschwitz.</p>
<p>Other scholars deepen Levi’s cultural background: Joseph Farrel explores Levi’s inspiration from religious books, ancient and modern philosophy and classic literature, and Jonathan Druker remembers Levi’s scientific and humanistic knowledge (see <italic>The Monkey’s Wrench</italic>).</p>
<p>Shifting from humanism to politics, we read about Levi’s partisan experience in Ilona Klein’s ‘The Partisan and His Doppelganger: The Case of Primo Levi’, and we learn about the influence of the Piedmontese writer as intellectual and opinion leader in Risa Sodi’s ‘Primo Levi and the Public Interest: Turin, Auschwitz, Israel’. These scholars demonstrate that Levi had an important role, forgotten in Italy and under-known abroad, as historian and model for Jewish intellectual groups, due to his public dialogue with the Israeli political class.</p>
<p>Massimo Giuliani opens the third part of this book, ‘Literature’. In his ‘Primo Levi’s Struggle with the Spirit of Kafka’, the scholar underlines the influence in Primo Levi science-fiction stories of the Jewish tradition of midrashim (a moral story created with biblical figures in which the pedagogical teaching is done by forcing the original texts or interpreting the not-said). In <italic>Vizio di forma</italic> and <italic>The Truce/The Reawakening</italic>, Levi portrayed the influence of the biblical struggle between good and evil and the unexplainable sense of persecution and human shame of Kafka’s <italic>The Trial</italic>. Levi resolves the problem with precious irony, which joins laughter and intellectual comprehension, enthusiasm and resignation: Giuliani’s neologism for that is ‘salv-action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0014585813479906">Giuliani, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Sara Vandewaetere provides information about ‘Ethics and Literary Strategies’ of the works dealing with German people who refused to hear or see the news of the deportation tragedy. Levi speaks of this in <italic>The Truce</italic><italic>,</italic> and in <italic>The Drowned and the Saved</italic> he says: ‘Quasi tutti, ma non tutti, erano stati sordi, ciechi, e muti’ (<italic>I sommersi e i salvati</italic>, p. 138). Scholars also refer to literary strategies such as ‘defamiliarizating’ description, scientific metaphors, narration of ‘face-to-face’ encounters, use of sensory perceptions, especially hearing and touching, to express the close memory of trauma and a vivid sense of indignation.</p>
<p>Elisabeth Scheiber tells of ‘Literary Encounters and Storytelling Techniques’, referring to the short stories, like Lilìt (Lilith). She recognizes a complex use of time, with a circular, modified pattern that Andrea Rondini calls ‘temporal hybrid’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0014585813479906">Rondini, 2002</xref>). Then she goes on to explain the main time schemes, dividing, for instance, ‘recent past’, ‘present indicative’ and ‘future perfect’ stories. Intertextual references, mise en abyme and paratextual elements are used to avoid the failures of communication, to control his texts for his own ethical and aesthetic purposes.</p>
<p>William McClellan deals with the link between Levi and the history of reception, with Giorgio Agamben’s references, Walter Benjamin’s concept of ‘image’, the major narrators of the Holocaust and Levi’s explanation of historical and moral consequences of that tragedy, of its unprecedented nature and its reception by the third postwar generation of historians.</p>
<p>Nancy Harrowitz explores the autobiographical element in The Periodic Table, <italic>The Drowned and The Saved</italic> and <italic>If This Is a Man/Survival in Auschwitz</italic>. The chapter of literary analysis opens with ‘Writings against the Fascist Sword’, by Fred Misurella, who compares Levi’s works with that of other writers, such as Alberto Moravia’s <italic>The Conformist</italic> and Giorgio Bassani’s <italic>The Garden of the Finzi-Continis</italic>.</p>
<p>Nicolas Patruno, in ‘Singoli stimoli: Primo Levi’s Poetry’, analyzes the peculiarity of Levi’s poems: in particular, he remembers that the author described them very modestly, considering them ‘not all that beautiful’ (p. 156). On the contrary, as we know, they are very original, written in a basic language, with the intention of being read ‘as if one was reading a newspaper’ (Giovanni Raboni, La Stampa, 17 November 1984). In <italic>The Search for Roots</italic> (<italic>La ricerca delle radici</italic>), Levi rails against all those who intentionally write in obscure ways, addressed to a limited public: ‘I am diffident toward those who are poets for the few, or only for themselves’. In fact, he considers important both the aesthetic and psychological dimension of his poetry. Patruno analyzes ‘L’elefante’, ‘Pio’, ‘Delega’, ‘Shemà’, ‘Alzarsi’, ‘Il superstite’, ‘Canto dei morti invano’, ‘Giudizio’ and others, noting that Levi feels so guilty for being a survivor that he borrows two verses of Coleridge’s ‘The Rime of the Ancient Mariner’ about the pain of memory. Ian Thomson speaks about the epistolary relationship between Levi and Hety Schmitt-Maas, an anti-Nazi German woman who knew Levi and his works in 1966. Levi speaks about a mysterious ‘Mrs. Hety S’ in one chapter of <italic>The Drowned and the Saved</italic>. She was intending to transmit the message of <italic>If This Is a Man</italic> to the repentant former Nazi Albert Speer, who she contacted in 1975. Speer never said anything about the book. Levi was annoyed when she told him, believing she had done it without good reason. However, she represented the ‘good German’, about which Levi often wrote.</p>
<p>Ann Goldstein in ‘A Note on the Problem of Translation’ refers to Levi’s short stories, such us ‘Buffet Dinner’, ‘The Fugitive’, ‘TV Fans of Delta Cep’, ‘Bureau of Vital Statistics’: they all transmit happiness and sadness because, as Levi used to say, ‘days are happy and sad’ (Levi, 2007: 16).</p>
<p>Finally, James Tasato Mellone completes the volume with a bibliography that covers the years 2003–2010. He distinguishes ‘Works by Primo Levi’; ‘Edited Collections of Essays’ consisting of important essays, conferences and books; ‘Biographical Studies’ that list the most important studies on the events of Levi’s life; ‘Studies on Memory, Testimony and The Holocaust’ that include some scholarship on Levi’s historical role as chronicler of the Holocaust; ‘Critical Studies’, that groups the rest of the Levi scholarship together.</p>
<p>The commented bibliography, final notes, Terri Bowman’s artworks, the list of the cited works, the contributors’ bios and a final index complement the volume. <italic>Answering Auschwitz</italic> is a complete collection of specialized and original scholarship on Primo Levi’s works. In addition to that, it makes a contribution toward acquiring an accurate knowledge of the Holocaust through Primo Levi’s courageous testimony and teaching.</p>
