<abstract>
<p>An effective way to study the dynamic performances and seismic behaviours of large-scale engineering structures is using a scale model. This article aims to develop a geometric-scaled model of the 1/50 for a quayside container crane such that the dynamic characteristics of the prototype can be accurately predicted from the relevant features of this scale model. To this end, a detailed design process for the main components of a 1/50 scale model of the quayside container crane was first presented according to the similitude law. Then, a hammering modal test and the Ling dynamic system shaking table test were successively carried out to obtain the dynamic characteristics of this 1/50 scale model. Furthermore, the experimental results were compared with the computed results of the prototype obtained from numerical simulation and they showed a fairly good agreement. From the comparison results, it can be seen that the model design is instructive enough to provide some valuable information and practical use for professionals and researchers involved in the design of large-scale port facilities.</p>

<p>With the rapid development of shipping industry, the use of transportation facilities for serving containers at the port is increasing. Quayside container crane (officially known as the most important port transportation equipment), located in modern harbour where strong typhoons are frequent and even earthquakes occur sometimes, is the main equipment used for handling containers or other heavy cargos. It is a mega-truss structure made of high-quality steel products, and its elevation view is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211423603">Fig. 1</xref>. As it is well known, China was hit by several severe earthquakes and typhoons in the past few years, which caused extensive damages. Among these, several quayside container cranes collapsed or were seriously damaged. Consequently, it is necessary to make a detailed study on the structural performances of the quayside container crane under earthquake or wind excitations. However, it is impossible to perform a field measurement of the vibration response with the full-scale prototype structure due to the limitations of the testing facilities and cost. As an alternative, scale models have been frequently used to experimentally investigate the dynamic performances of this type of large-scale engineering structures.

<p>In previous studies, Kanayama <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211423603">1</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211423603">2</xref></bold>] experimentally analysed the local bucking and elastic behaviours of a quayside container crane under seismic loads. Prior to these experiments, a brief design process for two different scale models of this crane was first presented based on the similitude law. Jacobs <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211423603">3</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211423603">4</xref></bold>] performed a series of shaking table tests on two different scale models to study the linear and non-linear seismic performances of the quayside container cranes under Loma Prieta earthquake load. In these experiments, a detailed test plan and two simplified crane models were simultaneously constructed. Numerical simulation for these models was successively carried out to calibrate test results. These analysis results demonstrated that the major deformation in the structure was concentrated in the portal structure. Based on the damage modes of the quayside container cranes under earthquake actions and the characteristics of the over-span flexible structures, the anti-seismic design on such large machines was experimentally investigated by Zheng <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211423603">5</xref></bold>]. Similar to references [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211423603">1</xref></bold><bold>]</bold> and [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211423603">2</xref></bold>], only a concise design description on a 1/15 scale model was given during this research. By the use of different small-scale models, Sugano <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211423603">6</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211423603">7</xref></bold>] and Toshiro <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211423603">8</xref></bold>] conducted some shaking table experiments to obtain the horizontal seismic performances of the quayside container crane under Kobe earthquake record, and to reasonably develop the seismic-isolated design method for the quayside container crane. The experimental results were then compared with the results of numerical simulation. Lee and Kang [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406211423603">9</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211423603">10</xref></bold>] performed a series of wind tunnel tests on a 1/150 scale-down model of a container crane in order to study its dynamic behaviours under wind load in an atmospheric boundary layer. It should be noted that the design of this 1/150 scale-down model was scarcely mentioned in these investigations.</p>
<p>These investigations indicate that the scale model is really a very effective tool to experimentally study the dynamic behaviours of the quayside container crane. However, all the previous studies only present a brief design process for the scale models of quayside container cranes and have focused on the dynamic behaviours of scale model under the exoteric excitations, and did not take into consideration on how to accurately and reasonably design the cross-sectional parameters and shape for a variety of components of the scale model. In addition, owing to the complexity of the problem itself, the large size of the structure and difficulties in physical modelling, detailed designing of such a scale model of large port structure has rarely been reported in the literature.</p>
<p>To this end, a detailed design process on the cross-sectional parameters and shapes of different mechanical components of a 1/50 scale model of a quayside container crane is presented in this article to obtain some guidelines on the design of the cross-sectional parameters and shapes for the other similar structures in the practical engineering, and to provide a reliable model for the subsequent earthquake-resistance test.</p>
<p>First, an exhaustive design step of a 1/50 scale model of a quayside container crane is developed, in which this model is mainly composed of the bending beam and the tension–compression bar components and the concentrated mass. Then, using this model, the dynamic characteristics of the quayside container crane are experimentally investigated in terms of natural frequencies, mode shapes, and frequency response curves, compared with those of the prototype obtained from numerical simulation. The experimental results agree fairly well with the results of numerical simulation. Further, the source of the errors between the experimental and numerical simulations is analysed in detail.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954406211423603"><title>2 DESIGN OF A 1/50 SCALE MODEL OF A QUAYSIDE CONTAINER CRANE</title>
<p>In this research, a double 20-ton-capacity quayside container crane with overall length 150 m, height 75 m and total weight about 1220 ton is selected as a study object. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211423603">Fig. 2</xref>, the quayside container crane mainly consists of the portal structure (including the landside legs, the waterside legs, thesill beams of landside and waterside, the landside portal, the waterside portal, the horizontal beams, the waterside pylon and the brace bar system), the boom, the girder, the drawbar system, the operation machine facility, the operation trolley, and the hoisting appliances, and it is used for handling containers at modern harbours. The quayside container crane moves along the ground tracks <italic>via</italic> the operation cart in transverse (<italic>OY</italic>) direction, and the operation trolley moves along the beam tracks in longitudinal (<italic>OX</italic>) direction, handling containers on the docked ships.
<fig id="fig2-0954406211423603" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Main components of the quayside container crane</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211423603-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Because it is impossible to develop a full-scale quayside container crane for every possible test configuration, a scale model must be reasonably designed to have a good look at the prototype behaviours. It provides a convenient and cost-effective means for predicting the full-scale behaviours from experimentson a small-scale model in the laboratory. While designing such a scale model, considering that thecomponents of quayside container crane can produce a variety of deformations in the practical working condition, these components are mainly divided into two types based on their deformation characteristics: the bending beam components (including the portal structure, the boom, and the girder) and the tension–compression bar components (including the drawbar system, the brace bar system, and the waterside pylon), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211423603">Fig. 2</xref>. The bending beam components chiefly show the characteristics of bending deformation, and the tension–compression bar components have a main effect on the tension or bracing. In addition, some large mechanical equipments or heavy cargos, such as the operation machine facility, the containers, and the hoisting appliances, which play a leading role in the inertia, are treated as the concentrated mass. Therefore, it is very important to properly design the cross-sectional parameters and shape of these components so as to obtain an accurate small-scale model for the subsequent seismic experiments and investigations.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0954406211423603"><title>2.1 Definition on known scale factors</title>
<p>For the purpose of accurately predicting the corresponding dynamic characteristics and seismic behaviours of the prototype, certain laws of similitude, which are derived based on the dimensional analysis [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211423603">11</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406211423603">14</xref></bold>], must be reasonably selected. In a structural dynamic problem on scale models, after some basic scale factors (as the ratios of the prototype to the scale model) are selected, other scale factors can be derived based on these known scale factors. In this study, the scale factors of geometry (length), Young's modulus, and density, as the known scale factors, are <italic>λ</italic> = 50, <italic>λ<sub>E</sub></italic> = 1, and <italic>λ<sub>ρ</sub></italic> = 1, respectively.</p>
<p>According to the structural drawings of the quayside container crane and also considering the actual experimental conditions, such as the size of the shaking table, the space of the laboratory, and the measurability of experimental results, a geometric-scaled model of 1:50 is adopted in this research. Since the material of the scale model is in agreement with that of prototype, the scale factors of Young's modulus and density, <italic>λ<sub>E</sub></italic> and <italic>λ<sub>ρ</sub></italic>, are both selected as 1.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954406211423603"><title>2.2 Deduction on unknown scale factors</title>
<p>Because the majority of components of the quayside container crane (the portal structure, the boom, and the girder) are bending beams and meanwhile the ratios of length to height of these components are relatively large, the unknown scale factors of the scale model are deduced based on the bending theory of Euler beam, mainly including the scale factors of time <italic>λ<sub>t</sub></italic>, frequency <italic>λ<sub>ω</sub></italic>, mass <italic>λ<sub>M</sub></italic>, deformation (displacement) <italic>λ<sub>u</sub></italic>, velocity <italic>λ<sub>v</sub></italic>, acceleration <italic>λ<sub>a</sub></italic>, strain <italic>λ<sub>ε</sub></italic>, stress <italic>λ<sub>σ</sub></italic>, and viscous damping <italic>λ<sub>d</sub></italic>.</p>
<p>The material properties of the model are represented by Young's modulus <italic>E</italic> and density <italic>ρ</italic>. The geometric properties of bending beams are characterized by the cross-sectional area <italic>A</italic>, the length <italic>l</italic>, the cross-sectional radius of inertia <italic>r</italic>, and the cross-sectional moment of inertia <italic>I</italic>.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0954406211423603"><title>2.2.1 Scale factors of time λ<sub>t</sub> and frequency λω</title>
<p>According to the similitude law, when an Euler beam is under bending vibration and the corresponding damping coefficient is not considered, the inertial force should be similar to elastic restoring force, given as follows

where <italic>λ<sub>r</sub></italic> is the scale factor of cross-sectional radius of inertia. Since the cross-sectional radius of inertia also belongs to geometry parameter of the model (just like the length), <italic>λ<sub>r</sub></italic> herein, is equally set as 50. Substituting equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0954406211423603">3</xref>) into equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-0954406211423603">2</xref>) results in

<p>According to the reciprocal relationship between the time and frequency, the scale factor of frequency <italic>λ<sub>ω</sub></italic> can be deduced from equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-0954406211423603">4</xref>) as follows

<p>Owing to the influence of structural size, the damping in the full-scale prototype is higher than its value in the small-scale model.

<p>Based on foregoing similitude scale factors deduced from the bending theory of Euler beam, the cross-sectional parameters and shapes of all the bending beam components in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211423603">Fig. 2</xref> can be determined. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211423603">Figure 4</xref> gives the cross-sectional shapes of the bending beam components of the prototype and the 1/50 scale model.

<p>Since the bending beam components are made by welding the standard angle steel, the cross-sectional thickness <italic>t<sub>m</sub></italic> is selected according to the regulation of thickness of the angle steel [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211423603">15</xref></bold>]. Once the thickness <italic>t<sub>m</sub></italic> is determined, the cross-sectional parameters, <italic>W<sub>m</sub></italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>W<sub>m</sub></italic><sub>2</sub>, are given calculating by using equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula19-0954406211423603">19</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula20-0954406211423603">20</xref>). Because there are three groups of numerical solutions in computing equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula19-0954406211423603">19</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula20-0954406211423603">20</xref>) (simultaneous cubic equation in two unknowns), it is necessary to reasonably select one group of them as cross-sectional parameters (<italic>W<sub>m</sub></italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>W<sub>m</sub></italic><sub>2</sub>).</p>
<p>In this article, the girder is taken as an example to concretely illuminate foregoing design process. According to the structural drawings of the girder together with foregoing scale factors, these cross-sectional parameters are given as follows
<disp-formula id="disp-formula27-0954406211423603"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211423603-eq27.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Substituting these parameters into equations (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula19-0954406211423603">19</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula20-0954406211423603">20</xref>) leads to
<disp-formula id="disp-formula28-0954406211423603"><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211423603-eq28.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Based on practical engineering experiences, the cross-sectional parameters herein for the girder are <italic>W<sub>m</sub></italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.025 m and <italic>W<sub>m</sub></italic><sub>2</sub> = 0.049 m.</p>
<p>Utilizing <italic>W<sub>m</sub></italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>W<sub>m</sub></italic><sub>2</sub>, and <italic>t<sub>m</sub></italic>, it can be obtained that the actual values of <italic>λ<sub>ry</sub></italic> and <italic>λ<sub>rz</sub></italic> of the girder are 49.293 and 48.874, respectively, which are not equal to the given value 50. This is a main reason for the occurrence of errors (because <italic>λ<sub>r</sub></italic> plays an important role in deducing other scale factors and cross-sectional parameters). However, the errors are relatively small and satisfy the design requirement of the cross-sectional radius of inertia. In conclusion, the cross-sectional parameters of the other bending beam components can also be derived based on foregoing design process, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954406211423603">Table 2</xref>.

<sec id="sec11-0954406211423603"><title>2.4 Design based on cross-sectional parameters of tension–compression bar components</title>
<p>Since the tension–compression bar components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211423603">Fig. 2</xref>) frequently behave like the characteristics of tension or bracing in the model, their design method based on the cross-sectional parameters is different from that based on the bending beam components. According to practical loading conditions of the quayside container crane, a simplified mechanics model of the tension–compression bar is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211423603">Fig. 5(a)</xref>. When the structure is under low-frequency vibration, the mass of system is chiefly supplied bybending beam components, and the tension–compression bar components mainly play an important role in terms of rigidity.

<sec id="sec13-0954406211423603"><title>2.6 Design of boundary conditions</title>
<p>The boundary conditions at the base of the quayside container crane must be properly modelled to replicate a realistic representation of sliding, uplift, derailing, and their effects on the dynamic responses. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211423603">Fig. 6</xref>, the quayside container crane seats onthe rails cast in the reinforced concrete wharf decks and its bottom mainly consists of the sill beam of landside, sill beam of waterside, the balance beam, and the operation cart with wheels. The cross-sectional parameters and shape for the sill beams oflandside and waterside have been designed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec10-0954406211423603">Section 2.3</xref>. Because the balance beam also belongsto the bending beam components, its cross-sectional parameters can be designed as <italic>W<sub>m</sub></italic><sub>1</sub> × <italic>W<sub>m</sub></italic><sub>2</sub> × <italic>t<sub>m</sub></italic> = 0.044 × 0.050 × 0.006 m<sup>3</sup> based on the design method described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec10-0954406211423603">Section 2.3</xref>. In addition, the wheels are welded in place to simulate a braked condition as would be found in the field.

<p>Since the boundary conditions at the base play an important role in investigating the seismic behaviours of the quayside container crane, these factors are not considered in the following verification experiments.</p>
<p>It should be noted that in such a large-scale portstructure, there are some important components, such as the boom, the landside legs 2, and the waterside legs 2, whose sections are tapered or irregular. In addition, there may be some stiffeners in these components, whose functions are delaying the local buckling. However, they are hard to scale due to the speciality of the cross-sectional size and shape. To this end, they must be properly simplified during the designing. To accurately reflect the cross-sectional properties of these components, a detailed design flow sheet is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211423603">Fig. 7</xref>.

<p>In addition, it is necessary to take some connecting components of the boom and the girder into account during designing such a scale model, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211423603">Fig. 8(b)</xref>.

However, since they have a small effect on the dynamic performances of the structure and only play a role in the connection, there is no need to strictly comply with the similarity condition.

<sec id="sec16-0954406211423603"><title>3.2 The 1/50 scale model</title>
<p>According to the structural drawings of the quayside container crane and foregoing deductions on the similitude scale factors and the cross-sectional parameters, the corresponding 1/50 scale model was developed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211423603">Fig. 9(b)</xref>. In this model, the operation machine facility was made to a rectangular mass plate, which is equivalent to the pattern of 6 concentrated mass. In addition, some connecting locations such as the joint of the horizontal beams and the landside (waterside) legs were properly reinforced and simplified. Since the main components ofthis scale model were fabricated by welding the standard angle steels, it was bound to generate certain bending deformation during the welding, which was a source of the error.</p></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec18-0954406211423603"><title>4.1 Hammering modal test</title>
<p>In this section, a hammering modal test is first developed to obtain the natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes of 1/50 scale model. In general, theoretical prediction of the damping coefficient for each mode shape is difficult; thus, no attempt is made here to measure the modal damping within the tests.</p>
<p>The measurement method for hammering modal test follows single-input multi-output. For this experiment, a hammer was used to generate transient excitation forces (pulsing signals) in vertical (<italic>OZ</italic>) or transverse (<italic>OY</italic>) direction, and then the transient excitation forces, after amplifying (charge amplifier), were fed to the dynamic signal collection system as inputs. Simultaneously, the vibration responses at various locations measured with the help of accelerometers were directly connected to the dynamic signal collection system as outputs. Finally, the modal parameters (the natural frequencies and main mode shapes) were determined using the DHMA modal testing software.</p>
<p>According to the practical requirements of a quayside container crane, there are many working conditions to be followed while handling containers. In this article, only the modal tests under the working conditions of boom down and boom up were carried out.</p>
<p>Natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes for the first eight modes of the scale model obtained from tests and those of the prototype obtained from numerical analysis (including boom down and boom up) are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0954406211423603">Table 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211423603">Figs 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954406211423603">11</xref>, respectively. It can be found from the tableand figures that this 1/50 scale model could accurately predict the dynamic characteristics (the natural frequencies and mode shapes) of the prototype with small error. It should be noted that the sixth mode shape under the working conditions of boom down is a coupled mode. It means that vertical and transverse modes simultaneously appear in this mode shape.

<sec id="sec19-0954406211423603"><title>4.2 Ling dynamic system shaking table test</title>
<p>For the purpose of accurately validating the rationality of model design so as to provide a reliable model forthe subsequent earthquake-resistance test, in addition to verifying the natural frequencies and main mode shapes of the structure, it is also necessary to justify its variation trends of dynamic responses in the scope of frequency domain. In this section, a series of Ling dynamic system (LDS) shaking table (different from the shaking table used for seismic experiment) tests were carried out to obtain the frequency responsecurves at some key measurement nodes of scale model.</p>
<p>In this experiment, only shaking table tests under the working condition of boom down were conducted. The scale model was mounted on the LDS shaking table with the same restriction pattern at the bottom as followed in the hammering modal test. A signal generator was used to give simultaneous excitation signals, and then the signals, after filtering (high-pass and low-pass filters) and amplifying (power amplifier), were connected to LDS shaking table. Utilizing the inputting device of shaking table itself, the signals were fed to the dynamic signal collection system as inputs. In parallel, the vibration responses at some key measurement nodes (such as s1, s2, s3, and s4, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211423603">Fig. 9(b)</xref>) measured with a number of accelerometers were also connected to the dynamic signal collection system as outputs.</p>
<p>Based on foregoing LDS shaking table test, the vertical (<italic>OZ</italic>) or transverse (<italic>OY</italic>) frequency response curves at measurement nodes s1, s2, s3, and s4 can bedetermined, and then a comparison between theexperimental and the computed results of the prototype obtained from the numerical analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954406211423603">Fig. 12</xref>. (Note that the experimental results have been converted according to the similitude law.) It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954406211423603">Fig. 12</xref> that although the response amplitudes of frequency response curves of the prototype and scale model have some differences, their variation trends in the scope of frequency domain arebasically the same and the differences (errors) relatively small. Therefore, it is showed again that the global dynamic behaviour of the prototype is well represented by the 1/50 scale model.

<sec id="sec20-0954406211423603"><title>5 ERROR ANALYSIS</title>
<p>Through foregoing analysis, it can be found although the 1/50 scale model can accurately predict the dynamic characteristics of the prototype, errors still exist. The major factors for the occurrence of errors are drawn as follows: (1) According to the design given in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-0954406211423603">Section 2</xref>, it is known that the scale factor of the cross-sectional radius of inertia <italic>λ<sub>r</sub></italic> plays an important role in deducing the other scale factors and the cross-sectional parameters. However, <italic>λ<sub>r</sub></italic> is not exactly equal to the given value 50 for each component due to the restrictions of the available size of section steel, which is the main reason for the occurrence of the errors. (2) Except for the tension–compression bar components, the scale factors of the cross-sectional area of the other components are not the same due to the limitations of the available size of section steel, which leads to the errors for the scale factor of mass (equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula6-0954406211423603">6</xref>)). (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0954406211423603">3</xref>) Since the main components of this scale model are made by welding the standard angle steels, it is bound to generate certain bending deformation during the welding. (4) In addition, the disturbance of the testing apparatus itself, the artificial operation errors, and the local environment are also important factors for the occurrence of errors.</p></sec>
