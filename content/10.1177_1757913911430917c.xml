<p>In the UK alone, the water industry treats and supplies 16 billion litres of water to its domestic and commercial customers in order to meet our average daily <italic>per capita</italic> usage of 150 litres. The surface and groundwater sources that provide this water face a range of recognised contaminants which are removed during the water treatment process. However in addition to such recognised threats, the industry faces low probability but high impact events termed Water Contamination Emergencies. These are broad ranging encompassing chemical, biological and radioactive sources, introduced both accidentally or deliberately. Inevitably high profile, such as the accidental aluminium contamination at Camelford in 1988, they require constant vigilance and effective monitoring systems to ensure early identification with a consequent reduction in potential impact.</p>
<p>This book summarises the proceedings of the fourth conference on Water Contamination Emergencies held in October 2010 and with a sub-title of Monitoring, Understanding and Acting, an event the editors describe as the most ambitious of the four. Comprising seventeen European and two US-based contributions it focuses predominantly on preventative and response strategies. As such the bulk of the contributions consider the analytical challenges necessary to provide reliable early warning systems and which utilise advances in on-line sensor technologies for chemical and radioactive contaminants and off-line molecular methods for microbiological alerts. But of course the efficacy of any early warning system is only as effective as the procedures in place to deal with an emergency once it has been identified and this book makes clear that in many European countries comprehensive systems of command and control are in place, with appropriate advice available for the relevant authorities. Of course it is the public who bear the brunt of the consequences of water contamination and so an effective communication of the potential risk is crucial. An important conclusion from these deliberations was that water companies will never stop learning how to improve their response to major incidents as the risks are simply too great.</p>
<p>Although inevitably with such a tightly focussed subject area the papers in this collection are specialist in nature, although the editors have made a commendable effort to simplify and clarify the important messages. A wide range of professionals might potentially be involved should a water contamination emergency occur and this collection provides for them a valuable synthesis of both our vigilance and our ability to respond.</p>
