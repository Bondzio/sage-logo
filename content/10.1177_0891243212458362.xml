<p>Amid continued political debates around social spending and frequently shifting social policy initiatives, Lisa Brush’s new book, <italic>Poverty, Battered Women, and Work in U.S. Policy</italic>, provides much needed insight into some of the real-life challenges and consequences of public policy. Specifically focusing on the role of paid employment—particularly that which is required by welfare policy—in the lives of poor, battered women, Brush challenges conventional wisdom, policy assumptions, and conceptual frameworks regarding the interconnections among poverty, battering, and work. Her analysis reveals critical unintended consequences and outcomes of welfare rescission actions beginning in 1996, illuminating many of the challenges, problems, and contradictions of viewing work as the primary solution to battering and welfare.</p>
<p>Brush shows how many of the factors that contribute to women’s poverty are the same ones that trap them in abusive relationships. Her analysis of two specific policies, that is, the Personal Responsibility Act of 1996 (including the Family Violence Option or FVO) and the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, reveals important contradictions that constrain the choices of poor battered women. Not only do these policies increase surveillance, social control, regulation, and discipline of poor women, as well as reinforce negative ideologies and stereotypes, but they also enforce contradictory requirements. For example, the FVO creates exemptions from both work requirements and time limits for battered women, but the same government agencies and policies require that women work in order to receive welfare benefits. Similarly, mothers receiving welfare must identify the “deadbeat dads” of their children, yet they are also expected to file protective orders against them.</p>
<p>Brush argues that conventional wisdom and policy assumptions about poverty and battering often focus on individual-level factors such as bad decisions and immoral behaviors that lead to a policy emphasis on personal responsibility. She argues that the popular imagery of both “victim empowerment folklore” and “politics of disgust” cast poor and battered women in a negative light and contribute to social policies that replace entitlement to, with petitioning for, services.</p>
<p>Brush’s analysis addresses various conceptual frameworks regarding the relationship of paid work to battering and to larger gender dynamics. She provides nuanced discussions of work–family conflict exposure, exchange, and backlash models of work and battering, ultimately making a strong case for her argument that work requirements provide additional avenues for coercion that abusers can use against women. Ultimately, such welfare surveillance reproduces the coercive dynamics of abuse.</p>
<p>One of the major strengths of Brush’s work is her use of multiple and varied sources of data, including retrospective and prospective interviews with 40 women receiving welfare; longitudinal administrative data on welfare receipt and civil restraining order petitions; and texts and field notes from a community literacy project. She discusses the limited availability of national statistics on rates of battering among women receiving welfare, as well as the difficulties in calculating the costs of abuse. Her creative use of existing data to answer complex questions regarding the relationships between battering and welfare use suggest that many more women who depend on welfare assistance are also experiencing violence than the official government agencies realize. Her inclusion of the lived experiences of those most affected by public policy through both interviews and the literacy project help to illuminate the challenges and problems in understanding and responding to poverty and battering, and their interconnections.</p>
<p>Ultimately Brush endorses a social justice approach to these social problems, one that focuses on human rights and social inclusion rather than personal responsibility. She identifies a number of changes and types of support that would likely do more to help alleviate these problems than does current policy, including support for addiction and mental illness; shared responsibility for raising children, including affordable child care; more rapid response from law enforcement; more equitable gendered expectations and heterosexual relationships that emphasize men’s respect for women and women’s greater independence and self-determination; greater social respect rather than a “politics of disgust”; better information, access, and support for controlling fertility; and enhanced career and training options for women. The bottom line for Brush is that we need policies that provide economic benefits and view social rights and “political personhood” independently of marital status and employment status.</p>
<p>The only weakness was that some sections on data and measurement challenges were somewhat dense and difficult to follow, but Brush does a nice job of weaving those sections together with the narratives and reiterating her overall points and conclusions. Overall, the book is well written and comprehensive and would be ideal for graduate sociology courses in gender, poverty, battering, or social policy. It also serves as an excellent model for how sociologists participate in and contribute to policy analysis in unique and meaningful ways.</p>
