Abstract
Advocacy work as a part
of transformational development is still approached with ambivalence by many
in the evangelical community. It is clear, however, that distal causes, rooted
in structural sin, contribute greatly to the kind of poverty that development
practitioners face, even though articulating the causal mechanisms through
which this occurs is difficult. Case studies show that a distinctively Christian
engagement with advocacy requires a clear sense of our `identity' and the
construction of an alternative narrative and engagement in symbolic acts,
witnessing in this way concerning the sins that require remedy.

Angelina's
Story At first I do not think any of us in the room recognized the significance
of what was happening the day in the spring of 2008 when Angelina Atyam of
the `Concerned Parents Association' of Northern Uganda rose to address the
crowd at Eastern Mennonite University's `Frontiers in Peacebuilding' luncheon.
In her gen- tle and humble way she told a story about how her daughter had
been kidnapped by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA); about the bitterness and
anger that that event sowed in her heart and the hearts of her local Christian
community; and the amazing spiritual awakening that occurred in that community
one Sunday morning when, in the process of reciting the Lord's prayer together,
they realized – in a collective way – that they could not pray
`forgive us our trespasses' because they had not, in fact, forgiven those
who had clearly trespassed against them: the LRA. Going home `without giving
each other the grace', Angelina and the others realized that they needed to
forgive if they were to have any hope of find- ing peace in that devastated
land. The Concerned Parents Association grew from
90
this
experience and carried a simple message of forgiveness and a desire for healing.
What made the luncheon event extraordinary (beside the testimony of the work
of God in their midst) was that, on that day, as a result of Eastern Mennonite
University's (EMU) work in global peacebuilding and the work of a little known
network-building advocacy group named the `3D Security Initiative' started
by an EMU faculty member, participants in the audience included members of
the US military, the US Department of State and several prominent Washington,
DC-based think tanks. At one point Angelina faced squarely in their direction
and proclaimed, `Our gun is now prayer. It is a gun you can carry with confidence
because it won't hurt anybody. We can take our gun with us even through the
checkpoints, because our gun is spiritual'. In reflecting on that extraordinary
event one can note several simple yet power- ful elements in Angelina's presentation
and EMU's actions that supported it: 1 Angelina had a clear sense of her identity – she knew exactly who she was and on whose behalf she spoke. 2 She had a simple
narrative – an alternative narrative – about the nature of con~ict
and how to resolve it. 3 This narrative was grounded in a critical symbolic
kingdom act embodied by the church in Northern Uganda that lent credibility
to the narrative and from which the narrative sprang.1 4 The narrative was
spoken as a witness to representatives of a state in a way that challenged
the state's actions and offered an alternative. It was, in fact, a call to
discipleship – a call to follow Christ. In this article we will explore
these points as we seek to define what it means for Christian development
practitioners (organizations and individuals) to engage in `advocacy'. Or,
as John Howard Yoder stated in his critical work written nearly 45 years ago:
`we shall here attempt to ascertain on what grounds, according to what standards
and with what hope of success it is … not only possible but obligatory
that the Christian should witness to the social order in a relevant way' (Yoder,
1964/2002: 8). This `witness', we will conclude, is a useful way to think
about what advocacy means for the development agency. Evangelicals and Advocacy:
Historical and Recent Views and Practice Before examining the context in which
development takes place and the need and opportunity for engaging in advocacy
it is important to examine attitudes evangelicals in the USA have had towards
political engagement more generally and advocacy in particular. Mark Noll
demonstrates that, historically, evangelical engagement in politics has been
driven less by critical reflection about the role of state and the Christian's
responsibility to challenge it and more by a legacy of `moral activism, populism,
intuition and biblicism' (Noll, 1994: 160).2 Indeed he argues that in the
early to mid part of the 20th century: Among evangelicals of all varieties,
there was little evidence of any felt need to systematic theoretical reflection,
for a theology applied self- consciously to politics, or for critical-historical
studies in aid of political theory.
91
Concern
for political involvement was replaced with an almost exclusive focus on personal
evangelism and personal piety. Current events evoked interpretations of prophecy
instead of either reforming activism or politi- cal analysis. (Noll, 1994:
165) This state of affairs continued into the late 20th century with most
evangelical politi- cal engagement (first driven by the `Christian Right'
and later by increasing engage- ment of the `Christian Left') remaining `a
deeply populist movement' with `the most visible forms of political reflection … still … intuitive – carried on without serious recourse to self-conscious
theological construction, systematic moral philosophy, thorough historical
analysis, or careful social scientific research' (Noll, 1994: 169). In the
closing chapter of the book, Noll notes that it was not clear in which direction
evangelical political action would go. All told, his analysis demonstrates
a lack of vision for, and a deep ambivalence about, engagement in politics
and, by extension, in advocacy work on the part of the American evangelical
churches. In the more than 10 years since he has written the answer may now
be some- what clearer. With the continued development of movements like Evangelicals
for Social Action (ESA), an `association of Christians seeking to promote
Christian engagement, analysis and understanding of major social, cultural
and public pol- icy issues' (ESA, 2008) and of evangelical `think tanks' like
the Center for Public Justice (CPJ), an `independent, non-partisan organization
dedicated to public policy research, leadership development, and civic education'
(CPJ, 2008), it is clear that evangelicals ARE engaging in thoughtful political
reflection and public policy advocacy. Further, the National Association of
Evangelicals (NAE) in a 2004 Policy Document stated: We know that we must
wait for God to bring about the fullness of the kingdom at Christ's return.
But in this interim, the Lord calls the church to speak prophetically to society
and work for the renewal and reform of its structures … As Christians
engaged in public policy, we must do detailed social, economic, historical,
jurisprudential, and political analysis if we are to understand our society
and wisely apply our normative vision to political questions. (NAE, 2004)
It would appear that the days of the ad-hoc moral activism, intuition and
popu- lism described by Noll have given way to a process of considered involvement
in political engagement and advocacy. This trend would seem to represent a
way forward for evangelicals. Indeed, emerging agencies like the International
Justice Mission (IJM) are engaging in a critique of the past and the lack
of involvement of evangelicals in the political sphere while simultaneously
mod- eling what such involvement should look like. Thus IJM founder and president
Gary Haugen can write: Over recent years a number of Christian ministries – especially in the development field – have begun to appreciate the
problems of oppression and to begin advocacy programmes. Recent examples include
efforts to speak to issues of Third World debt, conflict diamonds, sex trafficking,
92
child
soldiers and child labour. These efforts are promising developments that represent
a maturing of the evangelical vision. Yet agencies involved in this new engagement
in advocacy have tended to do so at the fairly rarified level of public policy
advocacy. They have taken on macro-level issues and sought to mobilize public
policy elites to pursue structural policy solutions. There is much that is
right about this and, indeed, more should be done … (including) what
we might call `case advocacy' – the diverse set of tasks that can be
pursued to bring rescue and justice for a victim of abuse and oppression.
(Haugen, 2003: 7)3 Clearly, there has been a shift in evangelical understandings
of the value of politi- cal engagement – including advocacy. James
Skillen of CPJ acknowledges that disputes between various Christian groups
will arise as they engage in advocacy and civic education, but sees this as
`reality' and evidence that Christians are actu- ally working out difficult
issues in real life settings. `Evangelical advocacy' would appear to be meaningful
reality in the USA today. Corporate or Structural Sin: The Context in which
`Development' Takes Place Given the foregoing, it is reasonable to ask how
the development practitio- ner who is a follower of Jesus might understand
her call to engage in advo- cacy and what advocacy has to do with her work.
At a recent conference on Transformational Development held at George Fox
University in November 2008,4 some practitioners showed ambivalence about
engaging in advocacy. They expressed fears that it could detract from the
important community-based work to which they had been called and risk having
practitioners become enamored with power as they engage leaders in dialogue
around the challenges of poverty and underdevelopment. And yet any `development'
practitioner who has worked at improving maternal and child health, developing
critical water and hygiene infrastructure, improving primary education systems,
increasing crop yields or the myriad other actions that go into what we call
`community development' knows that there are both proximal and distal causes
for the poor health, lack of infrastructure, limited edu- cational opportunities,
low food production and the other challenges of `underde- velopment'. Proximal
causes are what development workers seek to remedy in their day-to-day actions.
But they are also aware of the systemic – more distal – causes
that have led to the status quo. These include everything from local systems
of patronage and inequality, to corrupt officials at many levels, to international
sys- tems that provide preferential trading opportunities for wealthy country
produc- ers at the expense of poorer people. In reality, both personal and
systemic sin lead to the kind of poverty that devel- opment practitioners
face. Sin leads people to abuse, engage in corrupt acts, and misuse resources
in a way that is hurtful to themselves, their families and their communities.
At the same time, it is clear that broader structures also constrain people's
ability to achieve the potential for which God created them. Evangelicals
today largely accept the notion that `(s)in is not only attributable to persons
as individuals but also to nonpersonal social structures as well' (Fitch,
2005: 156).5 Ron Sider places this understanding in the context of evangelism
when he says:
93
Biblical
evangelism calls on people to repent from sin – all sin, not just some
privatized list of personal sins. A biblically faithful evangelist will call
on people to repent of involvement in unjust social structures in the way
that evangelist Charles Finney insisted that converts forsake the social sin
of slavery. Racism, sexism, and economic oppression are an affront to God.
Therefore simply by doing biblically faithful, evangelistic preaching about
sin, the evangelist challenges unjust structures. By pay- ing equal attention
to repentance of both personal and social sin, the evan- gelist already forges
a powerful link to social action. (Sider, 1993: 173). The over one billion
people who live on less than two dollars per day live that way not because
of their own ineptitude or simply because nature has dealt them a tough hand.
In addition to local constraints of many kinds there are systems in place
that systematically discriminate against the poor. Many Christian develop-
ment agencies acknowledge these structures (implicitly or explicitly) by stating
that they operate in an environment of `injustice' and that they must engage
in dealing with the causes of poverty by focusing on that injustice (in addition
to carrying out works of healing, relief and development).6 While development
practitioners know that these larger structural sins exist, the fact that
they are so large, so `macro', and so complex in terms of their opera- tion
makes it difficult to analyze them and to understand how to deal effectively
with them. In the end, agencies may settle for a more basic message about
the need to deal with immediate (proximal) causes of poverty without a clear
sense of what to do about the larger structural sins. And yet, as Jacques
Ellul wrote (presciently) over 60 years ago (long before globalization and
its interconnected- ness were the reality they are today): The Christian is
in solidarity with others, whether he wants to be or not, and this fact is
much more true materially speaking, in the current world than in past civilizations.
Isolation is no longer possible – no separateness. The illusion of
a Christian life in a convent or hermitage has disappeared. Whether it concerns
simple things like transportation, the interdepen- dence of economic institutions
or the evolution of democracy, in every way various influences work together
to force humans into this solidarity. Thus the Christian cannot call himself
`pure' compared to others, he can- not say he lives outside the sin of the
world. A critical fact of this civilization is that, more and more, sin has
become collective and individuals race to partici- pate in it. Everyone lives
with the consequences of the failures of all the rest … (Ellul, 1948:
19, author 's translation, emphasis added) Thus, according to Ellul, we all
participate in the sinful structures that lead to the poverty, oppression
and exclusion that our development efforts seek to remedy. This should lead
us to ask whether we have any responsibility, as followers of Jesus, to speak
or act in ways that bring to light and challenge the sinful struc- tures of
which we are a part. This article argues that we do and, while we may at times
despair at being able to clearly articulate the causal mechanisms of the structural
sin, we can find ways to `witness' to the state (or the corporation or other
social entity that participates in the structures), if we acknowledge and
live out our identity in Christ, if we commit to engaging in acts that support
our
94
words
and if we make the connections between the outcast with whom we work and those
who work within the systems that oppress. This work of advocacy not only complements
our community-based work, but also becomes a critical way to engage in a clear
proclamation of the already/not yet kingdom of God to the statesperson/corporate
leader. In the next two sections we examine concepts of `advocacy', and uniquely
`Christian' ways of engaging in it that build on the importance of our `identity'
and what it means to engage in symbolic acts and tell stories – to
witness – con- cerning the sins that require remedy. The next section
provides three brief case studies that show how these principles might play
out. Definitions Standard texts and manuals on advocacy provide the following
definitions of advocacy: Seeking with, and on behalf of, the poor to address
underlying causes of poverty, bring justice and support good development through
influencing the policies and practices of the powerful. (Gordon, 2002: 29)
Advocacy is the pursuit of influencing outcomes … that directly affect
peo- ple's lives … Advocacy consists of organized efforts and actions – based on the reality of `what is … ' (T)o influence public attitudes,
and to enact and implement laws and public policies so that visions of `what
should be' in a just, decent society become a reality. (Cohen et al., 2001:
7–8) These authors go on to name different types of advocacy but perhaps
more impor- tant for our purposes is this observation by VeneKlasen and Miller:
Diverse advocacy approaches are not just different ways of reaching a similar
end. They embody different values, political views, and goals, and thus seek
different ends. (VeneKlasen and Miller, 2007: 17) These definitions point
to concepts of speaking out with, or on behalf of oppressed people in order
to bring about changes in policy that will render their lives `what they should
be'. In itself this does not appear to be controversial for the Christian
development practitioner but the VeneKlasen quote points to the fact that
there are different approaches to advocacy and that they represent differ-
ent values. With this in mind it is important to ask what values and approaches
we should, as Christians, embody in our advocacy efforts. Advocacy that is
`Christian' is Grounded in a Clear Sense of Identity In reviewing Angelina's
story we maintained that her clear sense of who she was enabled her to speak
with conviction and clarity to powerful actors who influence the lives of
many people. A question for the advocate (or agency engaged in advo- cacy)
is `what is our primary identity'? And how can being clear on that identity
influence the way we engage in advocacy? Scripture provides two extremely
powerful images of the identity of the follower of Jesus. One might say that
these two sides of the same coin constitute our collective identity in Christ.
Peter wrote in I Peter 2:9–11:
95
But
you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging
to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness
into his wonderful light. Once you were not a people, but now you are the
people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received
mercy. Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to
abstain from sinful desires, which war against your soul. (emphasis added)7
The writer to the Hebrews uses the same language and describes our `spiritual
ancestors' in Chapter 11 explicitly in these terms. Paul adds a critical element
to this identity in II Corinthians 5 stating that we are ambassadors of reconciliation – ambassadors of Christ. The verb he uses: presbeuw (to ambassador) means to
be `elder' or `first in rank'. In Paul's time, as now, an ambassador was someone
who represented the interests of his or her nation abroad. This ambassadorship
moves far beyond merely seek- ing the reconciliation between human and God.
This is made clear in how Paul describes God's `reconciliation project' in
Christ in Colossians 1:13–20: For He rescued us from the domain of
darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son, in whom we
have redemption, the for- giveness of sins. He is the image of the invisible
God, the firstborn of all creation. For by Him all things were created, both
in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions
or rulers or authorities – all things have been created through Him
and for Him. He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.
He is also head of the body, the church; and He is the beginning, the firstborn
from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything.
For it was the Father 's good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him,
and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through
the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things on earth or things
in heaven. (emphasis added) This identity places the follower of Christ in
a critical position of being an ambas- sador of a sovereign carrying out the
sovereign's wishes, representing the sover- eign's policies, practices and
wishes in the nations of this world in which s/he lives. The Colossians passage
indicates that God's `reconciliation project' is noth- ing less than the great
unwinding of the fall – the restoration of the entire created order
into a relationship of peace with God. Again Ellul provides a useful summary
of this identity and, in naming the criti- cal reality of the Christian's
solidarity with the world, shows how this identity might provide both a rationale
for engaging in advocacy and how we might begin to do it. The first condition
of the Christian is a well known reality, but perhaps not sufficiently understood
in its total reality: the Christian belongs to two cities. She is in the world,
she has a social life. She is a citizen of a nation, she has a place in a
family, she has a job and must work to earn money. She lives her life according
to the same rules as other men and women and with them. She is of the same
natural state and lives in the same condition. Everything she does in the
world she must do seriously, because she is in solidarity
96
with
others and cannot neglect the responsibilities of any woman because she is
like all the others. BUT, on the other hand, she cannot be totally a part
of this world. This world is only ever a provisional `tent' (I Peter 1:13)
in which she is an alien and a traveler (Hebrews 11:13). This whole thing
is a provisional situation – even if it is extremely important, because
she belongs to another city. Her family tree (her identity) is elsewhere and
she receives her thoughts from outside. She has another lord. … She
is an ambassador of this nation on earth, which is to say that she must represent
the demands of her lord. She establishes a relationship between the two, BUT
she cannot represent or take on the interests of this world: she defends the
interests of her lord, like any ambassador who represents and defends the
interests of her state. (Ellul, 1948: 46, author 's translation) Thus our
solidarity with other humans provides a strong rationale for walking with
and speaking out on their behalf: we understand their plight because it is
our own. And yet our identity requires us to use our understanding of the
human plight to speak and act in a very particular way. We represent the policies,
inter- ests and desires of our sovereign. We obey the laws of the nations
of our residence but we dare not defend their interests or policies. Instead
we speak to the powers of the countries in which we live from the perspective
of our sovereign. Space does not permit a full exploration of the implications
of our `alienness' but that piece of our identity is clearly linked to the
issue of our solidarity with the suffer- ing of the many aliens – outcasts,
homeless, stateless – people of our world. Yoder, in developing the
importance of the Christian witness to the state, describes the reality of
this solidarity. The Christian church is primarily not a ministerial organization
or a con- ference body, but a host of people called laymen in the language
of many denominations, whose primary contact with and witness to society is
constituted by the fact that they earn their living and raise their families
right in the midst of that society. (Yoder, 1964/2002: 20) To sum up: our
role of advocates is grounded first and foremost in our sense of who we are
in Christ. Interestingly, a critical piece of that identity would suggest
a strong role in advocacy. After all, ambassadors do seek to `influence outcomes'
and achieve policy change that is in the interests of the nations they represent.
Advocacy that is `Christian', then, would seem to require not only an acknowl-
edgement of our `solidarity' with the outcast of this world, but also a continual
process of discernment as followers of Jesus to learn what should be the con-
tent of our advocacy efforts. With this identity in mind, the next section
explores some general ways of thinking about how to engage in advocacy – to be faithful `ambassadors of reconciliation'. Ways of Engaging in `Advocacy'
as Followers of Jesus: Witness, Symbolic Acts, and Alternative Narrative For
some, the foregoing may seem to `over-politicize' the message and life of
Jesus and the New Testament writers. Within Evangelicalism, in particular,
there may be a hesitancy to interpret Paul's words in ways that would suggest
politi- cal engagement. And yet, as Evangelical New Testament scholar N. T.
Wright
97
points
out in studying the life and teaching of Jesus, we must recognize that, `the
kingdom of God was not just about religion and ethics but about eschatology
and politics and the theology that holds them all together … ' (Wright,
1999: 73). John Howard Yoder, in his landmark work The Politics of Jesus,
assembles an overwhelming amount of evidence to conclude that Jesus' life,
work and teaching provide a normative social ethic for his followers that
embraces all elements of life – social, political and economic. This
brief article cannot explore these points but, as noted earlier, there is
a growing sense throughout the church that Christ's teaching and act of going
to the cross offer a critique of social, political and eco- nomic systems
that stand in opposition to God and that his life and sacrifice modeled a
different conception of power and authority embodied in sacrifice and service.
With this in mind, what might we discern from the life of Christ and the teaching
of the Bible that can guide our advocacy work? Our advocacy must be grounded
in the way we live as a community of faith. In other words, our advocacy must
be consistent with the lives we live and the actions in which we engage as
a community. Agencies of the church that walk with the poor would seem to
be well positioned to fulfill this important condition. Indeed, this is the
power of engaging in `grass roots' work with the poor: we learn of the reality
of their condition and can speak with integrity about the complexity of the
structural forces that keep them poor – the `root causes'. Yoder provides
more specific guidance on how to engage in advocacy (witness) by building
on the importance of the `implicit witness' of the church. Even when we move
beyond the implicit witness which is given by the very example of the church,
by their own inner life and for service to the world, and come to speak of
particular concerns and criticisms with which she may approach statesmen,
the centrality of the church's own experience in this witness should remain
clear. This would definitely dis- tinguish the witness of which we here speak
from traditional `lobbying' efforts of church and interchurch agencies. 1
The witness to the state must be representative of the church's clear conviction.
Legislators and executives have plenty to do with church spokesmen who actually
do not speak for their constituencies, and with agencies of government which
themselves engineer the arti cial public opinion they claim
to express … 2 The witness of the church must be consistent with her
own behavior. Only if she herself is demonstrably and ethically working on
a given problem does the church have a right to speak to others … 3
The church should speak only when she has something to say. There should be
no sense of a responsibility to `cover the eld' with a full
gamut of statements on every kind of subject that might be of any moral signi cance, Only such matters as can be clearly identi ed
by the church as presenting a clear moral challenge or abuse can justify their
being given more than perfunctory attention. (Yoder, 1964/2002: 21, 22). Here
Yoder lays out a more specific set of criteria to guide the church's witness
to the state and at its center is the concept of consistency with the church's
behavior. The agency that is not walking with and engaging deeply in an identification
with the poor has no basis for witness to the state about structural injustices
that keep the poor in poverty. Yoder goes beyond this to begin to suggest
some other key points that he develops further. The church, Yoder points out,
should not seek to `cover the field' but rather limit itself to specific issues
to which it has something unique to say.
98
In
practice this implies that our advocacy efforts should stay focused fairly
narrowly around the issues that we have studied and with which we have direct
experience and a fairly nuanced understanding. This points out the critical
need to maintain a high commitment to ongoing learning and documentation of
the causes and consequences of poverty and oppression with which it has direct
contact. The development agency and practitioner must use the tools of research
and evaluation not only to assess the implementation and value of program-
ming, but also to work with the poor to enable them to take their complex
story to the powerful and seek redress. In this way the `evaluation' function
is seen as a critical means to speaking authentically and rigorously of structural
causes of poverty. Yoder again demonstrates the importance of this by developing
further the third point in the earlier extracted quote. In doing so he develops
parameters that should guide the work of the advocate (the `witness'). He
writes: Since we cannot say that God has any `proper' pattern in mind to which
unbelief should conform, the Christian witness to the state will not be guided
by an imagined pattern of ideal society such as is involved in tra- ditional
conceptions of the `just state', the `just war ', or `the due process of law'.
An ideal or even a `proper' society in a fallen world is by definition impossible.
The Christian speaks not of how to describe, and then to seek to create the
ideal society, but of how the state can best fulfill its responsi- bilities
in a fallen society. The Christian witness will therefore always express itself
in terms of specific criticisms, addressed to given injustices in a particular
time and place, and spe- cific suggestions for improvements to remedy the
identified abuse. This does not mean that if the criticisms were heard and
the suggestions put into prac- tice, the Christian would be satisfied; rather,
a new and more demanding set of criticisms and suggestions would then follow.
There is no level of attainment to which a state could rise, beyond which
the Christian cri- tique would have nothing more to ask; such an ideal level
would fie none other than the kingdom of God. (Yoder, 1964/2002: 32, emphasis
added) It is important to note that Yoder, in developing these points, is
placing his coun- sel within a very high ecclesiology that, as he states elsewhere,
sees the church as bearing the inner meaning of history. The church accomplishes
God's intent for the world not by bringing about a given social order but
rather by coming into existence and embodying in itself the yet to be accomplished
kingdom of God. Yoder 's approach is also grounded in the reality of the fall
and a strong convic- tion that there is a proper role for the state in God's
plan. However it also builds on the ambassadorial identity presented earlier.
Yoder uses the term `witness', which implies for our purposes that advocacy
done Christianly is, in reality, a call to discipleship. Yoder makes it clear
that this witness, however, must use lan- guage that is accessible to the
statesperson in order to call them to change. Thus human rights language and
appeals to legal frameworks and policies would all be part of the advocacy
language toolkit of the advocate. Advocacy that is Christian can and should
rely on a skill set and toolkit common to all advocates: ground- ing advocacy
in quality community development, researching issues carefully, communicating
ideas clearly, and studying legal and policy standards rigorously. However,
advocacy that is Christian has some clear distinctives:
99
1 The
content of its message is consistent with the mission, life and teaching of
Jesus: we favor issues that are clearly closest to Christ's concern for the
least (see for example Jesus' `mission' in Luke 4:14–21). 2 Its conduct
is done with a clear sense of calling by God to embody the Kingdom: we acknowledge
a clear eschatological hope. 3 We do it in the context of a community of faith
the establishment of which we understand to be God's purpose for accomplishing
God's plan: we have a high ecclesiology. 4 We do it as witness, recognizing
that we are calling people to follow Jesus: we rely on God's Spirit to move
in hearts (we have a clearly established pneumatology). We conclude this section
by offering a possible way of conceptualizing our role as advocates. N. T.
Wright, in describing what Jesus did in his ministry provides a beautiful
summary for how we might think about engaging in advocacy. Wright develops
the argument that Jesus challenged the symbols of his day (the nation, the
Temple, food laws, the Sabbath) by himself engaging in symbolic acts (cleans-
ing the Temple, eating with sinners, healing on the Sabbath, calling people
away from family) and then telling `stories' about what he had done. The acts
were a liv- ing invitation to the Jews of Jesus' time to participate in a
`new way of being Israel'. The `stories' were, effectively, the articulation
of an alternative narrative offered to people about the meaning of history
and their lives within it (Wright, 1999).8 According to Wright, our role is
to challenge the symbols of our day (power, consumerism, the myth of redemptive
violence, individual autonomy, etc.) by engaging in symbolic acts of our own – acts that point to and embody the king- dom of God (living with the poor,
meeting basic needs, connecting people, build- ing community), and then telling
stories about them – providing an alternate narrative to the powers
of this world as we call them to participate in God's great story of the unwinding
of the fall. Let us examine, briefly, a few examples of how Yoder 's principles,
summarized in this way, might play out in practice. Cases The actual venues,
forms and approaches to advocacy – even in the context of Yoder 's
principles – can be quite varied as these three brief cases reveal.
They include public policy advocacy, international acts of solidarity and
witness to political leaders, which are only a few of the many forms that
advocacy can take (recall Gary Haugen and IJM's `case advocacy' approach as
an example of yet another form of faithful witness). The Canadian Food Grains
Bank and Food Aid Policy: The Canadian Food Grains Bank (CFGB) is a partnership
of Christian relief and development agencies concerned with the problem of
food security around the world.9 In addition to delivering food commodities
and raising money to deal with this problem around the world, CFGB engages
in advocacy. In the early part of this century they realized that Canadian
government policy on food aid required that 90 percent of the value of food
aid offered by the government had to be grown in Canada and shipped from there.
Recognizing that this was both costly and had the potential to depress prices
in regions near the receiving areas around the world (hurting local farmers
in Southern Africa, for example), CFGB engaged in an extended process of engaging
farmers, processors and government officials across Canada in a dialogue about
the potential impoverishing effects of
100
the
Canadian policy. As a result the Government of Canada changed its policy to
allow for up to 50 percent of food aid to be purchased in local/regional markets.
CFGB engaged in rigorous research, committed to speaking the truth about its
findings but also spent time building relationships and community across the
entire nation in order to bring about this change. In so doing it achieved
a tangible result but, perhaps more importantly, helped a variety of stakeholders
to gain a more nuanced understanding of the global connectedness of the poor
with the wealthy. Its witness was in naming a policy that kept people poor
and its alterna- tive narrative was that farmers in Canada could enter in
solidarity with the poor in practical ways. Justapaz and Days of Prayer for
Colombia Justapaz (Just Peace) is an advocacy organization run by the Mennonite
and Mennonite Brethren churches of Colombia.1 0 Justapaz began, around 2004,
to document and publish human rights abuses against evangelical church members
and leaders around Colombia. The complex set of factors that lead to violence
against these people seem almost beyond understanding but Justapaz has used
connections in the USA to bring these stories and the vision of the Colombian
church to policy makers in Washington, DC by engaging US leaders in dialogue
around the various effects of government policies in the region – specifically
the USA's `drug war '. Justapaz, and the Colombian Mennonite and Mennonite
Brethren churches, are taking a tremendous risk in walking with victims of
violence and by engaging the US church in prayer and visits to congressional
offices on designated days of prayer and action. They are raising the voice
of the poor to those whose policies have direct effects on them. They are
presenting an alternative narrative to the discourse about the efficacy of
the US drug war, and in so doing are risking their own lives. Their symbolic
act is to challenge the received wisdom that a military victory can end the
drug problem, by embodying weakness. Further they create community across
geographic boundaries by bringing people from Colombia to the USA and providing
space to allow these real people to tell their stories to church members and
congressional leaders. The Mennonite Central Committee's Meetings with President
Ahmedinijad of Iran Starting in 2006, the Mennonite Central Committee (MCC)
began to arrange annual meetings between Iranian President Ahmedinijad and
US-based religious leaders when he came to New York for the UN General Assembly.
MCC did this in order to challenge the Iranian President about his views on
the holocaust, the existence of the state of Israel and human rights abuses
in Iran. However, the group also used the meeting to confess complicity with
the abuses of the US gov- ernment in the overthrow of the elected government
of Iran in 1953 (a fact that still represents for Iranians the breaking of
the relationship between Americans and Iranians). MCC also used the existence
and content of these encounters to participate with other Christian leaders
in meetings with congressional leaders to encourage them to seek alternatives
to violence in dealing with Iran. Indeed, the meetings were also an opportunity
to talk about the need for humility and the seeking and offering of forgiveness
for past abuses on both sides. MCC has engaged in a highly controversial symbolic
act by meeting face to face with an `enemy'. However, both with the Iranian
President and then with
101
congressional
leaders it has had the opportunity to tell important `stories' about God's
justice, forgiveness and desire for reconciliation. Conclusion: And what of
`Results' These brief examples point out the potential for advocacy that is
distinctively Christian. Though not described in detail here, each one … 1 Was carried out by agencies (and individuals within them) that had a clear
sense of their identity as ambassadors of reconciliation. 2 Sought to take
a complex situation and engage it with an alternative narrative about how
things could be. 3 Included both engagement in challenging symbols – by engaging in symbolic acts of their own – and then telling stories
about these acts. 4 Was spoken as a witness on (1) a speci c
issue, (2) in a speci c situation and (3) addressed to speci c states people. One question remains: `does this kind of advocacy
work?'. In other words, what are the results and how do we measure them? While
the CFGB example does point to a tangible result, much work done in advocacy
leads to no discernable change (at least in the short run) and may seem to
fall on deaf ears as the power- ful continue to permit (or even promote) abuses
that hurt the poor. As described earlier – the structures of sin in
our world are real and represent the actual `prin- cipalities and powers'
of which Paul spoke. How then do we think about results or success in advocacy?
There are really two answers to this question. Like any action undertaken
by a development agency or institution we must commit ourselves to tracking
progress and assessing results. This is less about being able to proclaim
success and more about committing ourselves to an ongoing learning process
to alter course, adjust our practice and seek novel ways to live `symbolically'.
In addition, if we engage in this process with the poor and oppressed, we
have an opportunity to discern with them ways to engage in advocacy that honor
their stories while protecting them from unintended consequences of the advocacy
work itself (an issue we have not touched on here but a critical one to consider
in any advocacy work). Thus, we should continuously assess progress. At the
same time we should acknowledge that our advocacy efforts are grounded in
more fundamental con- cepts that drive us to do it despite any indication
of results: first, we do it because of our identity – we must do it
because of who we are, ambassadors of reconcilia- tion. Second, we do it to
engage in calling people to Christ – advocacy is a critical piece of
our witness to the good news of the kingdom of God. Thus, no matter the result
we are compelled, it would seem, to engage in advocacy. Advocacy is messy – yielding ambiguous results or none at all, raising addi- tional and confusing
questions about the complexity of sinful systems and requir- ing time and
resources. Without a clear sense of who we are we cannot hope to be steadfast
in it. And yet it appears we must do just that. As N. T. Wright states in
concluding remarks about how we should engage our world – to live and
act `humanly': Your task is to find the symbolic ways of doing things differently,
planting flags in hostile soil, setting up signposts that say there is a different
way to be human. And when people are puzzled at what you are doing, find
102
ways – fresh ways – of telling the story of the return of the human race from
its exile, and use stories as your explanation. (Wright, 1999: 186) The commitment
of the 3D Security Initiative, Eastern Mennonite University and the Concerned
Parents Association to engage in advocacy came together on that very interesting
day in the Spring of 2008 when Angelina Atyam – sure in her identity – planted a flag in front of people with a very different world view. She claimed
there was a different way of being human – one that humanized perhaps
the cruelest rebel group in the world. One built upon the offer of forgiveness
and reconciliation. I am sure her listeners were puzzled by her clearly told
story of how she and others are living out their faith in powerful ways in
the killing fields of Northern Uganda. And in that puzzlement, sparked by
her living witness that gave the story great force, lies reason for hope.
