<abstract>
<p>Degarelix is a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist for the first-line treatment of androgen-dependent advanced prostate cancer. It has a direct mechanism of action that blocks the action of GnRH on the pituitary with no initial surge in gonadotrophin or testosterone levels. Degarelix is the most extensively studied and widely available GnRH antagonist worldwide. Clinical studies have demonstrated similar efficacy to the GnRH agonist leuprolide in achieving testosterone suppression in patients with prostate cancer. However, degarelix produces a faster suppression of testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), with no testosterone surge or microsurges, thus preventing the risk of clinical flare in advanced disease. Clinical trials have demonstrated that degarelix can offer improved disease control when compared with a GnRH agonist in terms of superior PSA progression-free survival (suggesting that degarelix likely delays progression to castration-resistant disease), and a more significant impact on bone serum alkaline phosphatase and follicle-stimulating hormone. Degarelix is generally well tolerated, with no reports of systemic allergic reactions in any clinical studies. In conclusion, degarelix offers clinicians a rational first-line hormonal monotherapy option for the management of advanced prostate cancer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the pioneering work of Huggins and Hodges, which demonstrated that surgical castration resulted in significant clinical improvement in men with advanced prostate cancer (PCa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1756287212461048">Huggins and Hodges, 1941</xref>], androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the mainstay for management of advanced/metastatic PCa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1756287212461048">Heidenreich <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>]. ADT is also recommended in combination with radiotherapy in the management of intermediate and high-risk localized disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1756287212461048">National Comprehensive Cancer Network, 2012</xref>].</p>
<p>Surgical castration, the seminal ‘gold standard’ ADT, is irreversible and can have negative psychological effects on patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1756287212461048">Heidenreich <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1756287212461048">Wirth <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>]. Surgical castration has generally been replaced by medical castration induced by gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1756287212461048">Kelly and Gomella, 2011</xref>]. However, GnRH agonists may be associated with mechanism-of-action drawbacks, for example, promoting a counterintuitive initial testosterone surge that might delay the onset of initial testosterone suppression and may also result in potentially detrimental exacerbation of clinical symptoms (clinical flare) in advanced disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1756287212461048">Van Poppel and Nilsson, 2008</xref>]. Importantly, testosterone surges can also occur following repeated administration of agonists (microsurges/acute-on-chronic responses) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1756287212461048">Tombal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1756287212461048">Klotz <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>]; furthermore, late breakthrough testosterone escapes (&gt;0.5 ng/ml) have been noted as a result of renewed testosterone production due to loss of GnRH receptor sensitivity during long-term treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1756287212461048">Tombal and Berges, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1756287212461048">Morote <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1756287212461048">Perachino <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>].</p>
<p>The GnRH antagonists offer an alternative ADT that avoids the testosterone surge and microsurges associated with agonists, and thus more closely resembles the original goal of surgical castration. Worldwide, the most extensively studied and widely available antagonist is degarelix. Following its approval in the USA in December 2008 for the treatment of advanced PCa, degarelix is now available in many countries throughout North America, Europe, Australia and South America. This review documents the growing body of clinical evidence that supports the use of degarelix in PCa and examines how its pharmacological profile may impact treatment outcomes in PCa therapy.</p>

<sec id="section2-1756287212461048">
<title>Rationale for development of degarelix</title>
<p>The counterintuitive testosterone surge associated with GnRH agonist therapy inspired the development of the GnRH antagonists, whose mechanism of action achieves a more direct effect on testosterone suppression. Thus, GnRH antagonists effect a rapid and competitive receptor binding that blocks the action of GnRH on the pituitary, with no initial increase in gonadotrophin or testosterone. Release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is prevented and thus testicular testosterone production is rapidly suppressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1756287212461048">Frampton and Lyseng-Williamson, 2009</xref>].</p>
<p>However, earlier-generation GnRH antagonists were limited by adverse events (AEs) associated with their histamine-releasing properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1756287212461048">Doehn <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>], which resulted in anaphylactic-like syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1756287212461048">Mongiat-Artus and Teillac, 2004</xref>]. Therefore, newer GnRH antagonist agents such as degarelix were developed to obviate the histamine-releasing characteristics of the GnRH antagonist drug class.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1756287212461048">
<title>Preclinical studies</title>
<p>Degarelix has been investigated in rat and rhesus monkey preclinical models, demonstrating that subcutaneous administration produced a rapid, reversible and dose-dependent suppression of the pituitary–gonadal axis, indicated by a reduction in LH and testosterone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1756287212461048">Broqua <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>]. Subcutaneous administration of degarelix allows the formation of a gel depot that facilitates sustained drug release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1756287212461048">Princivalle <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>]. This is reflected in the prolonged LH and testosterone suppression associated with degarelix which, in comparative studies, displayed a longer duration of action than other GnRH antagonists (abarelix, cetrorelix, ganirelix, azaline B).</p>
<p>With early GnRH antagonists, histamine release from mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1756287212461048">Schmidt <italic>et al</italic>. 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1756287212461048">Hook <italic>et al</italic>. 1985</xref>] resulted in systemic or local anaphylactoid reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1756287212461048">Broqua <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>]. Indeed, abarelix, the first antagonist clinically available for PCa, was associated with a risk of systemic allergic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1756287212461048">Mongiat-Artus and Teillac, 2004</xref>]; this agent was voluntarily withdrawn from the US market for commercial reasons. In animal studies, degarelix displayed only weak histamine-releasing properties, having the lowest propensity for histamine release among the GnRH antagonists tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1756287212461048">Broqua <italic>et al</italic>. 2002</xref>]. Similar findings were revealed in an <italic>ex vivo</italic> human skin model, with degarelix again displaying the lowest propensity to release histamine <italic>versus</italic> ganirelix, abarelix and cetrorelix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1756287212461048">Koechling <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>].</p>

<sec id="section4-1756287212461048">
<title>Pharmacokinetics</title>
<p>Degarelix forms a depot after subcutaneous injection, from which the drug is released in two phases into the circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1756287212461048">Frampton and Lyseng-Williamson 2009</xref>]. This biphasic pattern of disposition comprises a short initial fast-release phase followed by a second slow-release phase in which plasma levels display a half-life of several weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1756287212461048">Steinberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1756287212461048">White <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>]. Phase III data from study CS21 showed that in patients with PCa, after a single dose of 240 mg, <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> (the maximum plasma level) of degarelix was 66 ng/ml, the area under the concentration–time curve (day 0–28) was 635 ng ⋅day per ml and the mean time to <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> was 40 h. Based on population pharmacokinetic modeling, estimates of the median terminal half-lives for the starting and maintenance doses were around 43 days and 28 days, respectively. The long half-life after subcutaneous injection of degarelix is a consequence of a very slow release of the drug from the depot that is formed at the injection site. Dose adjustment is not required in older patients or in patients with mild or moderate renal or hepatic impairment. Due to the scarcity or lack of data on patients with severe renal or hepatic dysfunction, caution is warranted in these groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1756287212461048">Frampton and Lyseng-Williamson 2009</xref>].</p>

<title>Europe/South Africa and North American studies</title>
<p>To determine the optimal dosing schedule for degarelix, two open-label, randomized, 1-year dose-finding studies of similar overall design were conducted in Europe/South Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1756287212461048">Van Poppel <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>] and North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1756287212461048">Gittelman <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>]. The European study (<italic>n</italic> = 189) compared six degarelix treatment groups with starting doses of 200 or 240 mg followed by maintenance doses of 80, 120, or 160 mg. The median age of patients was 72 years and the median testosterone and PSA levels at baseline were 4.13 ng/ml and 27.6 ng/ml, respectively. Disease stage was localized in 22%, locally advanced in 32%, metastatic in 19% and not classifiable in 27%. The North American trial (<italic>n</italic> = 127) investigated a starting dose of degarelix of 200 mg followed by monthly maintenance doses of 60 or 80 mg. The median age of patients was 76 years and the median testosterone and PSA levels at baseline were 4.13 ng/ml and 13.4 ng/ml, respectively. Disease stage was localized in 43%, locally advanced in 11%, metastatic in 19% and not classifiable in 28%. In both trials, degarelix was well tolerated and degarelix treatment for 1 year was associated with a rapid, profound, and sustained suppression of testosterone to castrate testosterone levels (≤0.5 ng/ml) without an initial testosterone surge. These trials also showed rapid PSA suppression with degarelix and PSA was maintained at low levels throughout both studies. Together, these studies identified a starting dose of 240 mg and maintenance doses of 80 or 160 mg for further phase III investigation.</p>

<title>Japanese study</title>
<p>The efficacy and safety of degarelix 240/80 mg and 240/160 mg was also assessed in a 1-year randomized phase II dose-finding trial in Japanese patients (<italic>n</italic> = 273) with PCa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1756287212461048">Ozono <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>]. In the degarelix 240/80 mg and 240/160 mg groups, the mean age of patients was 75 and 74 years, the median baseline testosterone levels were 4.52 and 4.31 ng/ml and the median baseline PSA levels were 24.65 and 20.20 ng/ml, respectively. Overall, disease stage was localized in 46%, locally advanced in 30%, metastatic in 23% and not classifiable in less than 1%. Both degarelix regimens rapidly and effectively suppressed testosterone to castrate levels, without a testosterone surge. PSA and FSH levels were also rapidly suppressed and low levels maintained during the rest of the study.</p>
<p>The best overall tumor response [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR); according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines] occurred in 71.4% of patients in the 240/80 mg group and 72.7% in the 240/160 mg group. Tumor response was also evaluated using the Assessment Criteria of Response to Noninvasive Treatment for Prostate Cancer (as defined by the Japanese Urological Association); the overall response rate (CR + PR) showed a rapid and sustained antitumor effect. The risk–benefit balance for efficacy and safety in this trial showed that an appropriate monthly degarelix regimen for Japanese patients with PCa was 240/80 mg.</p>

<title>Phase III trial</title>
<p>A randomized, open-label trial (CS21) in North America/Europe compared the efficacy of degarelix with the GnRH agonist leuprolide for achieving and maintaining testosterone suppression over 1 year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1756287212461048">Klotz <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>]. Patients with PCa (<italic>n</italic> = 610) (localized 31%, locally advanced 29%, metastatic 20%, not classifiable 19%) were randomized to degarelix 240 mg for 1 month followed by monthly maintenance doses of 80 mg (<italic>n</italic> = 207) or 160 mg (<italic>n</italic> = 202), or monthly leuprolide 7.5 mg (<italic>n</italic> = 201). Randomization was stratified by geographical region and body weight. In the leuprolide group, 11% of patients received flare protection via concomitant bicalutamide (given at the investigator’s discretion). The median age of patients was 73 years and the median testosterone and PSA levels at baseline were 3.93 and 19.0 ng/ml, respectively.</p>
<p>Both degarelix regimens were as effective as leuprolide in suppressing testosterone to ≤0.5 ng/ml between days 28 and 364 (primary endpoint, considered a treatment response). Treatment response was achieved by 97.2%, 98.3% and 96.4% of the degarelix 240/80 mg, 240/160 mg and leuprolide groups, respectively (intention-to-treat population). However, degarelix suppressed testosterone significantly faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1756287212461048">Figure 1</xref>). At day 3, castrate testosterone (≤0.5 ng/ml) was reached by around 96% of patients in the degarelix 240/160 and 240/80 mg groups; in contrast, no patients on leuprolide had achieved castrate levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1756287212461048">Klotz <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>]. Indeed, with leuprolide, median testosterone increased from baseline by 65% by day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1756287212461048">Figure 1</xref>), and remained greater than 0.5 ng/ml until measurements on day 28. Moreover, 80% of patients receiving leuprolide experienced a testosterone surge (increase from baseline of ≥15% on any 2 days in the initial 2 weeks of therapy) <italic>versus</italic> none in the degarelix groups. In addition, testosterone microsurges (increases of &gt;0.25 ng/ml) in the week following the ninth injection occurred in 4% of the leuprolide group (in 2% testosterone increased to &gt;0.5 ng/ml) <italic>versus</italic> 0% of degarelix recipients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1756287212461048">Klotz <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>].</p>

<p>PSA reduction was also significantly faster with degarelix. Median PSA had decreased by 64% and 65% in the 240/80 and 240/160 mg groups, respectively <italic>versus</italic> 18% with leuprolide by day 14. PSA decreases remained significantly greater with degarelix (85% and 83%, respectively) <italic>versus</italic> leuprolide (decrease of 68%) by day 28. PSA failure (two consecutive PSA rises of &gt;50% <italic>versus</italic> nadir and PSA ≥5 ng/ml on two consecutive measurements at least 2 weeks apart) was lowest with degarelix 240/80 mg (the probability of PSA failure during the study was 8.9% with degarelix 240/80 mg <italic>versus</italic> 14.2% with degarelix 240/160 mg and 14.1% with leuprolide). Degarelix also produced a rapid decrease in median LH and FSH levels, which remained suppressed until the end of the trial. With leuprolide, however, there was an initial increase in LH and FSH, and FSH levels did not fall to the same extent as in the degarelix arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1756287212461048">Klotz <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>].</p>
<p>On the basis of the efficacy and safety findings, the degarelix dosage of 240/80 mg was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2008 and the European Medicines Agency in 2009.</p>

<title>Prostate-specific antigen</title>
<p>Tombal and colleagues reviewed the CS21 data, and concluded that during the first year of treatment, the degarelix 240/80 mg group displayed a significantly lower risk of PSA failure or death [i.e. improved PSA progression-free survival (PFS)] <italic>versus</italic> leuprolide (<italic>p</italic> = 0.05; log rank) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1756287212461048">Tombal <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>]. Indeed, after adjusting for baseline PSA and disease stage, the hazard ratio (0.664; 95% confidence interval 0.385–1.146) indicated that the risk of PSA failure or death with degarelix was 34% lower than with leuprolide. In CS21, PSA failure occurred in 26 patients (13%) in the leuprolide group and in 16 patients (8%) in the degarelix 240/80 mg group; death occurred in nine (4%) and five (2%) patients in these groups, respectively.</p>
<p>Around half (49.7%) of the CS21 patient population had advanced disease, and PSA failure mainly occurred in this subgroup. In patients with metastatic disease, PSA failure occurred in 21.6% of degarelix 240/80 mg <italic>versus</italic> 36.2% of leuprolide patients (<italic>p</italic> = 0.156). PSA failure was only observed in patients with baseline PSA greater than 20 ng/ml. In this subgroup, the risk of PSA failure was significantly lower for patients receiving degarelix <italic>versus</italic> leuprolide (<italic>p</italic> = 0.04). In CS21, PSA failure over time was a preplanned analysis; PSA PFS was a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis.</p>
<p>Initial PSA suppression was more rapid with degarelix 240/80 mg than with leuprolide, regardless of baseline disease stage: 59% of degarelix patients achieved PSA less than 4 ng/ml at day 28 <italic>versus</italic> 34% with leuprolide (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). In patients with metastatic disease, there was an initial increase in PSA with leuprolide but not with degarelix. In this patient cohort, a higher proportion of the degarelix group achieved PSA less than 4 ng/ml over the study period. A large study in patients with metastatic PCa showed that a PSA of ≤4 ng/ml after 7 months of ADT is a strong predictor of survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1756287212461048">Hussain <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>].</p>

<title>Serum alkaline phosphatase</title>

Baseline S-ALP levels were also three to four times higher in patients with baseline PSA &gt;50 <italic>versus</italic> ≤50 mg/ml. There was an earlier suppression of S-ALP with degarelix 240/80 mg than with leuprolide in patients with baseline metastatic disease or baseline PSA greater than 50 ng/ml. Indeed, at day 364, reduction in S-ALP was significantly greater with degarelix 240/80 mg <italic>versus</italic> leuprolide in patients with baseline metastatic disease (<italic>p</italic> = 0.014) and in those with baseline PSA greater than 50 ng/ml (<italic>p</italic> = 0.007) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1756287212461048">Figure 2</xref>). There was also a late increase in S-ALP with leuprolide (which might suggest treatment failure) but not with degarelix towards the end of the 1-year trial period in these patient groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1756287212461048">Figure 2</xref>). In localized or locally advanced disease, S-ALP levels were maintained around baseline in both treatment groups.</p>

Conversely, leuprolide had a seemingly more favorable effect on insomnia and bodily pain than degarelix; however, the mean increase in insomnia with degarelix may be explained in part by significantly lower baseline insomnia in this group. In patients with metastatic disease, there were significant improvements at month 12 in global health status for degarelix <italic>versus</italic> leuprolide, as well as role emotional and appetite loss. However, the clinical significance of these findings remains to be determined.</p>

<title>Long-term phase III extension trial (CS21A)</title>
<p>To investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of degarelix, a 5-year extension trial (CS21A) was conducted. After 1 year in CS21, patients treated with degarelix continued with the same monthly maintenance dose (160 or 80 mg), while those treated with leuprolide were randomized to degarelix 240/80 or 240/160 mg. An interim analysis was conducted after a median follow-up of 27.5 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1756287212461048">Crawford <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>]. Data were reported for patients continuing degarelix on the approved 240/80 mg dose; for patients who crossed over from leuprolide to degarelix, the data were pooled. The interim analysis showed an improvement in PSA PFS in patients who crossed over from leuprolide to degarelix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1756287212461048">Figure 3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1756287212461048">Crawford <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>]. Thus, after 27.5 months of follow-up, the risk of PSA progression in 1 year was more than halved. PSA PFS hazard rates were reduced from 0.20 events/year in the first year to 0.08 events/year following the crossover from leuprolide to degarelix (<italic>p</italic> = 0.003). For patients continuing on degarelix 240/80 mg, there was no significant change in PSA PFS hazard rates (0.11 events/year in year 1 in CS21 and 0.14 events/year in CS21A; <italic>p</italic> = 0.464).</p>

<p>Intermittent ADT (IAD) with degarelix is under investigation in two phase III trials in PCa, the results of which are eagerly anticipated. CS29 [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00801242] is a European noncomparative, two-cycle study of degarelix 240/80 mg in patients requiring ADT. After 7 months of degarelix, patients with PSA less than 4 ng/ml stop therapy until PSA rises to over 4 ng/ml (maximum 24 months). The second trial, CS37 [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00928434] is a US randomized comparison of IAD with degarelix <italic>versus</italic> continuous ADT (CAD) with degarelix or leuprolide in patients with biochemical failure after localized therapy. Patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups: 14 months of CAD with degarelix 240/80 mg or leuprolide (starting dose of 7.5 mg on day 0 followed by maintenance dose of 22.5 mg at day 28 and every 84 days thereafter), or 7 months of degarelix followed by 7 months without treatment (after 7 months, patients were discontinued if PSA levels were &gt;2 ng/ml).</p>
<p>Degarelix is also being studied in the neoadjuvant setting, in which a randomized trial comparing 3 months of degarelix <italic>versus</italic> goserelin/bicalutamide for prostate size reduction is underway in patients with intermediate- to high-risk PCa who require neoadjuvant hormone therapy prior to radiotherapy (curative intent) (CS30 [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00833248]).</p>

<p>In CS21, both degarelix and leuprolide were well tolerated, with a similar incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (79%, 83% and 78% of patients in the degarelix 240/80 mg, degarelix 240/160 mg and leuprolide groups, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1756287212461048">Klotz <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>].

Patients who crossed from leuprolide to degarelix experienced an improved musculoskeletal AE rate after crossover: first-time musculoskeletal and connective tissue AEs were reported in 17% of the continuous degarelix group <italic>versus</italic> 20% of the leuprolide/degarelix crossover group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.532).</p>

<title>Cardiovascular safety</title>
<p>An assessment of cardiovascular (CV) safety data from the CS21 trial showed no significant differences between leuprolide and pooled degarelix groups for mean change in Fridericia’s correction of QT interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1756287212461048">Smith <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>]. A markedly abnormal Fridericia’s correction of QT values occurred in very few patients (≤1%) with either treatment. Ischemic heart disease, the most frequent cardiac disorder, occurred in 4% of degarelix patients <italic>versus</italic> 10% of leuprolide patients. In this class, the most frequent events were myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction (each occurring in 2% of leuprolide patients and in less than 1% of those on degarelix). Cardiac failure occurred in less than 1% of degarelix patients <italic>versus</italic> 2% of leuprolide patients. Supraventricular arrhythmias (occurring in 2% of the pooled degarelix and 4% of the leuprolide group) were the most common type of arrhythmia. Other arrhythmias included bradycardia, atrioventricular conduction disturbances, ventricular arrhythmias, bundle branch block and cardiac arrest (all occurring in ≤1% in both groups).</p>
<p>A pooled analysis of data from 1704 men in nine clinical trials investigated potential relationships between CV disease (CVD) events, baseline patient characteristics and degarelix treatment dose and duration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1756287212461048">Smith <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>].

<title>Effects on testosterone</title>
<p>The rapid testosterone suppression with degarelix allows for a quicker onset of the therapeutic effect of testosterone suppression, avoiding the counterintuitive, supraphysiologic testosterone surge associated with GnRH agonists. Thus, in patients with advanced PCa, rapid relief of PCa-related symptoms may be achieved more efficiently by avoiding the risk of cancer stimulation and worsening of clinical status via a surge-induced clinical flare. Flare symptoms can be serious, and may include bone pain and bladder outlet/ureteral obstruction; as well as potentially rare complications, such as spinal cord compression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1756287212461048">Van Poppel and Nilsson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1756287212461048">Thompson, 2001</xref>].</p>
<p>Testosterone microsurges (&gt;0.5 ng/ml) have been reported in around 6% of patients with agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1756287212461048">Tombal, 2005</xref>]. However, a study with goserelin reported the occurrence of testosterone surges above a castration threshold of 0.185 ng/ml after at least one repeat injection in 17.7–27% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1756287212461048">Zinner <italic>et al</italic>. 2004</xref>]. Reports of the incidence of testosterone breakthroughs (&gt;0.5 ng/ml) with GnRH agonists have varied. While Tombal and Berges reported breakthroughs greater than 0.5 ng/ml in 2–13% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1756287212461048">Tombal and Berges, 2005</xref>], Morote and colleagues reported breakthroughs greater than 0.5 ng/ml in 24.7% of patients in at least one measurement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1756287212461048">Morote <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>]. While the clinical significance of microsurges/breakthroughs has not been fully established, some evidence suggests that maintaining low testosterone may influence outcomes. Thus, in patients with nonmetastatic PCa receiving GnRH agonists (with/without anti-androgens), androgen-independent PFS was related to testosterone breakthrough escape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1756287212461048">Morote <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>]. In patients with breakthrough testosterone greater than 0.32 ng/ml, mean PFS was significantly lower (88 months) than in those without such a breakthrough escape (137 months, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.003). Also, in patients with metastatic disease receiving GnRH agonists, high testosterone at 6 months was associated with an increase (1.33-fold) in cancer-specific mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1756287212461048">Perachino <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>]. Analysis of a large, localized PCa population database also showed that, for patients receiving continuous GnRH agonists adjuvant to curative radiotherapy, consistent castrate testosterone levels less than 0.50 ng/ml were associated with a lower PSA nadir before and after radiotherapy and a lower risk of subsequent biochemical relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1756287212461048">Pickles and Tyldesley, 2011</xref>].</p>

<title>Effects on prostate-specific antigen</title>
<p>The improved PSA PFS noted with degarelix <italic>versus</italic> leuprolide in CS21, and in patients crossing over from leuprolide to degarelix in CS21A, is indicative of delayed progression to castration-resistant disease with degarelix. Disease progression may trigger clinician and patient desire for a change in antineoplastic therapy, with potential attendant physical and psychological morbidities as well as further economic costs. In the subgroup of patients with the highest PSA failure risk (baseline PSA ≥20 ng/ml), the time for 25% of patients to experience PSA failure or death was delayed by around 7 months with degarelix (514 days <italic>v</italic>ersus 303 days with leuprolide; <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1756287212461048">Boccon-Gibod <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>].</p>
<p>The more rapid PSA suppression associated with degarelix may also be an indicator of prognostic significance.

Thus, a decrease in bone turnover marker levels may delay progression of bone metastases and improve survival. In CS21, the initial S-ALP peaks in metastatic patients likely reflect increased osteoblastic activity associated with tumor cell death and rebuilding of bone tissue around skeletal metastases. In general, S-ALP peaks in CS21 were less pronounced with degarelix than with leuprolide, possibly indicating the improved prognosis in terms of PSA PFS previously noted.</p>
<p>Baseline disease stage and pretreatment PSA have been linked to PCa outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1756287212461048">Stock and Stone, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1756287212461048">D’Amico <italic>et al</italic>. 2007</xref>].

<title>Use of degarelix in the clinic</title>
<p>Degarelix is certainly as effective in achieving testosterone suppression as a GnRH agonist, the most common ADT used in advanced PCa, and has proven long-term efficacy and tolerability, maintaining testosterone and PSA suppression for more than 3 years. Thus, degarelix provides an alternative first-line ADT for advanced disease.</p>
<p>Indeed, the pharmacological profile of degarelix provides several advantages over GnRH agonists. As stated earlier, degarelix offers a more rapid onset of castration and more effective control of testosterone, PSA, S-ALP and FSH. Moreover, the differential pharmacological profile of degarelix <italic>versus</italic> agonists may also offer clinical advantages.</p>
<p>The fast onset of castration with degarelix is particularly beneficial in symptomatic patients. The lack of surge-induced tumor-promoting effects with degarelix makes it a preferred ADT option in patients with a high tumor burden and risk of acute problems, such as urinary tract symptoms, pain or spinal cord compression. Degarelix also avoids the need for concurrent antiandrogen administration for flare protection, with possible compliance advantages as a result of monotherapy. Concomitant antiandrogens do not completely remove the risk of clinical flare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1756287212461048">Heidenreich <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>]. First-line use of degarelix also avoids the risk of anti-androgen toxicity and so offers possible side effect profile advantages and cost savings.</p>
<p>Other therapeutic benefits associated with the differential pharmacological profile of degarelix <italic>versus</italic> agonists include superior effects on PSA PFS, which delays the onset of castrate-resistant disease (and potentially toxic chemotherapy), while the improved S-ALP profile in patients with metastatic disease may indicate a prolonged control of skeletal metastases in patients with bone metastases.</p>
<p>IAD has been investigated as an alternative to CAD in PCa therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1756287212461048">Abrahamsson 2010</xref>]. IAD alternates active on-treatment periods with off-treatment periods without ADT, which facilitate testosterone recovery. In advanced PCa, IAD aims to minimize ADT-related AEs and improve HRQoL by reducing treatment exposure while providing comparable efficacy. It is also hypothesized that IAD may delay progression to androgen-independent disease. Recent results from a large international trial [S9346 (INT-0162)] comparing IAD and CAD showed that, in hormone-sensitive metastatic PCa, IAD was noninferior to CAD in patients with extensive disease but IAD was statistically inferior in those with minimal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1756287212461048">Hussain <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>]. The rapid testosterone and PSA suppression observed with degarelix makes it a suitable candidate for IAD; European Association of Urology guidelines consider that GnRH antagonists might provide a valid alternative to agonists for IAD, provided clear results are obtained from randomized studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1756287212461048">Heidenreich <italic>et al</italic>. 2012</xref>]. Results from ongoing trials of IAD with degarelix will clarify the potential role of this agent in IAD. It should be noted that, unlike GnRH agonists, degarelix is currently only available as a 1-month formulation and so cannot offer the potential convenience of longer-term (e.g. 3- to 12-month) depot formulations. However, it remains important for patients to see their physicians on a regular basis, and some men like the support of seeing the physician more often; for some patients, the reassurance gained from frequent physician visits may decrease disease-related anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1756287212461048">Sartor, 2006</xref>].</p>
<p>In contrast to abarelix, which has been associated with the risk of potentially serious, immediate-onset systemic allergic reactions, degarelix has not been associated with these types of reactions. The hormonal side effect profile of degarelix is comparable with that of agonists. However, in addition to chills, degarelix is associated with a higher incidence of injection-site reactions <italic>versus</italic> agonists; nevertheless, in the majority of cases no treatment was needed and over-the-counter remedies (e.g. analgesics, cold packs) were effective in 20% of cases. Injection-site reactions with degarelix may be a consequence of a different administration route (subcutaneous degarelix <italic>versus</italic> intramuscular leuprolide) and a higher injection volume. There have been previous reports of local injection-site reactions with subcutaneously administered GnRH agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1756287212461048">Oka <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>].</p>
<p>Studies suggest that CV risk with degarelix may be driven by normal aging, with similarities identified between risk factors in studies of the general population and in patients receiving degarelix. In contrast, the US FDA has highlighted an increased risk of diabetes, heart attack, stroke and sudden death with GnRH agonists, with the consequent requirement to add warnings of such risks to GnRH agonist labels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1756287212461048">US Food and Drug Administration, 2010</xref>]. Interestingly, most but not all studies show no association of orchiectomy with an increased risk of CV events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1756287212461048">Levine <italic>et al</italic>. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1756287212461048">Keating <italic>et al</italic>. 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1756287212461048">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1756287212461048">Alibhai <italic>et al</italic>. 2009</xref>], raising the possibility that CV risk may vary for different forms of ADT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1756287212461048">Smith <italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>].</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Multiple clinical studies have demonstrated that degarelix is an effective and well tolerated treatment for advanced PCa. Degarelix rapidly suppresses testosterone and PSA, without the initial testosterone surge or microsurges associated with GnRH agonists. Degarelix also displays long-term efficacy, maintaining effective testosterone and PSA suppression for over 3 years. Compared with GnRH agonists, degarelix is associated with improved testosterone and PSA control, offering a prolonged time to castration-resistant disease, an improved FSH profile and more favorable effects on S-ALP. Degarelix is generally well tolerated, without systemic allergic reactions; with the exception of injection-site reactions, most AEs reflect androgen suppression or the underlying condition.</p>
<p>The different pharmacological profile of degarelix brings clinical benefits in PCa therapy including: a delay in progression to castration-resistant disease <italic>versus</italic> agonists, avoidance of the negative clinical effects associated with surge-induced flare, a monotherapy approach to ADT that may improve compliance and avoids the need for antiandrogens (and any attendant AEs), the prolonging of control of skeletal metastases in metastatic disease <italic>versus</italic> agonists, and possible clinical benefits associated with improved FSH control.</p>
<p>Thus, degarelix, which is now the most comprehensively studied and widely available GnRH antagonist, offers an additional option to GnRH agonists as a first-line ADT for the hormonal management of PCa.</p>
