<abstract>
<p>Reconstruction of critical sized bone injuries is a major problem that continues to inspire the design of new materials and grafts. Natural ceramics (hydroxyapatite (HA) coralline HA, or synthetic HA) and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) are being explored for use as scaffolds in bone tissue engineering, among several other materials. The present study evaluated the bone forming capacity of nanosize bioceramics synthesized <italic>in situ</italic> in poly-vinyl alcohol (PVA) with different ratios of HA and β-TCP; the Ca/P ratio was 1.62 for bioceramic P1, 1.60 for P2 and 1.58 for P3. Further osteogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) acquired from different sources for osteogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> and their bone healing properties <italic>in vivo</italic> were also evaluated. MSC isolated from human placenta, Wharton’s jelly from umbilical cord, fetal bone marrow and adipose tissue, cultured in the presence of nanosize bioceramic particles, were monitored for osteogenic differentiation. Placental cells showed the best osteogenic potential of the different MSC studied on the basis of expression of osteogenic markers. Complete regeneration of the damaged region was observed <italic>in vivo</italic> when MSC derived from placenta were used with nanoceramic (Ca/P ratio 1.58) in the experimental defect created in the femur of Wistar rats. Even small variation in the Ca/P ratio can alter the outcome of tissue constructs.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328211415132" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tissue engineering (TE) is a multidisciplinary field, aimed at developing biological substitutes that enable restoration, maintenance or improved tissue function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211415132">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211415132">2</xref></sup> Bone constitutes the skeletal system of vertebrates and provides structural support, a mineral reservoir and a means for withstanding load and protecting the internal organs. Bone is a composite tissue, with cells embedded in a matrix composed of hydroxyapatite (HA) mineral and organic constituents, mainly collagen, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and phosphorylated sialoproteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211415132">3</xref></sup> An engineered bone graft generally requires a scaffold that can be seeded with cells capable of osteogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211415132">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211415132">5</xref></sup> Such a scaffold is a temporary matrix for cell proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition until the bone tissue is restored/regenerated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211415132">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211415132">8</xref></sup> An ideal biomimetic scaffold should have osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211415132">9</xref></sup> The cells generally used in TE constructs are mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), usually obtained from bone marrow, which show both proliferative and multi–lineage differentiation potential, including osteogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211415132">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211415132">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Current therapies for bone defects caused by trauma, injury or resection of bone tumors involve autografts, allografts or metal implants. Donor site limitations, morbidity and complications restrict the use of autografts, and immune rejection, transmission of infectious diseases and/or lack of osteoconductivity and osteointegration limit the use of allografts and metallic implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211415132">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211415132">16</xref></sup> It is therefore anticipated that the identification and use of bone graft substitutes will reduce or eliminate the need of auto/allografts and metallic implants.</p>
<p>Natural ceramics such as coralline HA or synthetic HA and/or β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) have been tried in differing compositions and physical forms, such as particulate, cements, coatings on metal implants and composites with or without polymers for use as scaffold in TE and clinical purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211415132">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211415132">19</xref></sup> Among these, biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) ceramics emerge as better substitutes because of their resemblance to the bone matrix component, their biocompatibility and their low immunogenicity. Close association of the two components β-TCP and HA in ceramics endow them with important properties, as each component has slightly different physicochemical properties and biological advantages. β-TCP is more soluble and is resorbed more readily than HA; HA is more osteoconductive than but not as osteoinductive as β-TCP. Biphasic ceramics prepared with various combinations of Ca/P ratio have been tried that reflect the need for a better control over resorption and substitution during the bone reconstruction process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211415132">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previously we reported the biocompatibility and osteogenic differentiation of MSC by HA/β-TCP biphasic nanoceramics in varying ratios.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211415132">21</xref></sup> Because these nanoceramics favored cell survival, adhesion and induced osteogenic differentiation in bone marrow derived MSC, in the present study we determined the suitability of these materials for osteogenesis in culture conditions for MSC derived from four different sources and bone defect repair <italic>in vivo.</italic></p>
<p>MSC derived from medical waste, such as extra-embryonic tissue and lipoaspirate, display MSC-specific markers and show similar expansion and differentiation potential as bone marrow derived MSC,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211415132">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211415132">23</xref></sup> but these cells have not been fully exploited for therapeutics. Some of these cells are easier to obtain than bone marrow derived MSC as no invasive procedure is involved. However, information on the differentiation of these cells for osteogenesis in the presence of bioceramics is not available.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the <italic>in vivo</italic> healing properties of nanosized biphasic ceramics prepared in a narrow range of Ca/P ratios. Initial evaluations were made of the osteoinductive properties of these materials in culture with MSC obtained from different sources and the osteogenic response of MSC was monitored through expression of osteogenic markers. These ceramics were used alone and with inclusion of cells in the implant to gain insights into the efficacy, contribution and usefulness of using these ceramics for regenerative therapy for bone injuries/defects.</p>

<p>MSC were isolated from human placenta, Wharton’s jelly, fetal bone marrow and adipose tissue. Briefly, the solid tissues were flushed with Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS), diced into smaller pieces and digested with a cocktail of dispase (0.1 mg/ml), trypsin (0.1%) and DNase (0.025%) for 30 min at 37°C; the cells were then enriched by Ficoll gradient and cultured in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) containing 15% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 0.1 mM hydrocortisone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211415132">24</xref></sup> Plastic-adherent MSC were characterized by analysis of specific markers – CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90 and CD105 – using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immunostaining. Biphasic nanoceramics in powder form were autoclave sterilized and washed in HBSS. A suspension made in HBSS (50 mg/ml) was applied as a film on cover slips, air-dried over night and UV sterilized; control dishes were treated similarly with HBSS alone. The culture media was changed every third day.

<sec id="sec8-0885328211415132"><title>In vivo studies</title>
<p>Small animals, such as mice and Wistar rats, are usually used for pilot studies. In the present pilot study, Wistar rats were chosen as they are easy to handle and their femurs can be drilled to create critical size injuries. Critical size injuries do not heal spontaneously and develop fibrous tissues. Skeletally mature 3-month-old female Wistar rats of body mass 150–200 g from the animal house were at standard environmental conditions (temperature 22–25°C, humidity 40–70% with 12:12 dark/light photoperiod) approved by the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiment on Animals, and all the experimental protocols were approved by Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology.</p>
<p>Experimental animals were divided into three groups. Group I: three animals were implanted with the TE construct (nanoceramic powder plus MSC); group II: three animals were implanted with only nanoceramic powder; group III: one animal served as a control or was sham operated – no treatment.</p>
<p>Animals were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine with a dose of 40 mg/kg body weight and 5 mg/kg body weight, respectively. The lateral and median aspect of the femur was cleaned. An incision was made to cut open the skin on the dorsal aspect above the femur. A careful incision was then made to cut open the biceps femoris muscles to expose the femur bone. A pediatric bone driller was used to make a hole of 5 mm in the dorsal surface of femur without touching the bone marrow, thus preventing any hemorrhage. Material + cell (TE constructs) were prepared with human placental MSC for each of the nanoceramic powders, P1, P2 and P3, and the TE constructs were implanted in the drilled cavity of the rats of group I. In each TE construct, placental MSC (50,000 cells) were mixed with 100 mg of autoclaved nanoceramic powder to a 50 μl slurry and filled into the drilled hole. The group II animals received acellular ceramics (P1, P2 and P3), whereas the drilled femurs of the control/group III animal was left unfilled. The muscle layer was stitched with simple interrupted suture using absorbable materials and skin was closed using non-absorbable suture materials. Povidone-iodine ointment was applied externally for 3 days. The animals were subjected to X-ray imaging. At the end of the experiment, the animals were killed by an overdose of CO<sub>2</sub>. Detail necropsy was done and femur bones were collected and fixed in 10% formalin. Fixed bones were decalcified with EDTA before embedding in paraffin wax. Fixed and paraffin embedded bones were cut to 5 µm thickness, stained with hematoxylin and eosin following standard procedure and examined under a light microscope.</p>

<sec id="sec9-0885328211415132"><title>Immunostaining for human nuclear antigen</title>
<p>Antibodies to human-specific nuclei are useful cytological and histological markers for identifying human cells in xenograft models. Immunostaining was carried out on the femur sections using a monoclonal antibody for human nuclear antigen (HNA) (Millipore MAB1281), stained with antimouse second antibody-Alexa Fluor 549 and mounted with 4-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in glycerol. Sections were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) with appropriate filters.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0885328211415132"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>To quantitatively analyse the gene expression, mean fold values and standard errors of the mean (SEM) were calculated. Each experiment was performed twice. Two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests with equal variances and one-way ANOVAs were carried out to test the mean fold variation between the cell types with the three ceramics, and also between the ceramics with all the four cell types used. Two-way ANOVA was performed between ceramics and cell types with osteogenic gene expression.

<p>MSC from all four sources characterized by flow cytometry were positive for MSC-specific surface markers – CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90 and CD105 – and differentiated into osteogenic, neurogenic and endothelial lineages (data not shown). The three bioceramics had different proportions of HA to β-TCP: in P1 the ratio was 60:40 (Ca/P 1.62), in P2 it was 55:45 (Ca/P 1.60) and in P3 it was 50:50 (Ca/P 1.58). These supported the survival and growth of MSC as reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211415132">21</xref></sup> These MSC were maintained with the bioceramics for 3 weeks without addition of any other osteoinducers. MSC from all the four sources showed a positive staining for ALP with each of the three biphasic nanoceramics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211415132">Figure 1</xref>).

<p>An analysis of osteogenic gene expression was performed by real time PCR. There was an upregulation in expression of the osteogenic markers (OC, OP, Runx2 and BMP-2) for all the three nanoceramics. Fold changes calculated by Pfaffl’s method [25] after normalization with four housekeeping genes indicated that the three nanoceramics enhanced the expression of osteogenic markers OC, OP, Runx2 and BMP-2 in all the four types of MSC studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211415132">Figure 2(a)</xref>). P3 showed the greatest upregulation of overall osteogenic markers (15.50-fold), followed by P2 (10.70-fold) and P1 (9.695-fold), but these changes were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885328211415132">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211415132">Figure 2(b)</xref>). Among the four cell types studied, placental MSC showed a significantly higher level of expression of all the markers (23.42-fold), followed by MSC derived from bone marrow (14.49-fold), adipose (6.74-fold) and Wharton’s jelly (2.89-fold) (p &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211415132">Figure 2(c)</xref>).

<p>Based on the cell culture results, MSC derived from placenta were selected for use in <italic>in vivo</italic> bone healing studies. After creating drilled hole injuries in the femur bones of Wistar rats, injury sites were implanted with acellular nanoceramics or nanoceramics plus placental MSC (TE construct) immediately. X-ray imaging carried during the first month showed that callus formation has not initiated and bone cavity was present in rats implanted with P1, P2 and their respective TE constructs (Supplementary Figures 1–4). However, at the end of the third month callus formation was observed in the middle aspect of the femur in rats implanted with P1 and its TE construct. In rats with P2 and its TE construct (P2-TE), callus formation was not seen and bone cavity remained in the median aspect of the femur at the end of 3 months. In P3 and P3-TE implanted rats, mild callus formation had already started in the bone cavity by the first month and prominent callus protruding in the median aspect of femur with completely closed cavity was seen at the end of the third month (Supplementary Figure 3).

<p>The histology of the bone implanted with nanoceramic material in the drilled hole injury with or without placental MSC revealed that in all cases healing was better in the TE implants containing cells. Angiogenesis was high in the drilled region in all cases. There was no evidence of graft rejection or inflammation in any sample in histology.</p>
<p>In case of P3 and P3-TE, the material could not be identified on gross inspection. There was good integration of material and newly formed bone. The entire 5 mm area was sectioned and we did not find any evidence of fibrous tissue or material in the injury area. The sections showed a normal histology throughout; very few sites had cartilaginous remnants or material in case of P3-TE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211415132">Figure 3(a) and (b)</xref>).</p>
<p>In animals that received only P3, healing was good and very few areas showed gaps in an otherwise normal histology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211415132">Figure 3(c)</xref>). The newly formed bone did show areas interspersed with trabecular bone and cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211415132">Figure 3(d) and (e)</xref>).</p>
<p>In rats that received P2 and cells (P2-TE), the injury area seemed to have healed but the cavity was not filled. The cortical portion of the healed injury appeared smooth. Integration into the bone appeared good; we could not find any traces of material in the healed bone but the periosteum region had a large amount of material surrounded by fibrous tissue that seemed to ossify (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211415132">Figure 4(a) and (b)</xref>). In case of P2 alone it was difficult to see healing as despite decalcification, the tissue was difficult to section. Cartilaginous portions were seen with incomplete ossification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211415132">Figure 4(c) and (d)</xref>).</p>
<p>P1-TE constructs also did not show complete healing and integration of the material.

<p>Because the implanted cells had a role in healing, we also demonstrated integration of human cells into the injury site using HNA staining. Immunohistology of these sections showed presence of HNA-positive cells in the area of bone healing in all nanoceramics with MSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211415132">Figure 6</xref>). Cells could be seen integrated as osteocytes, osteoblasts, in angiogenesis and also infiltrated in the marrow. The cells that were implanted had also differentiated, as these cells demonstrated the expression of Runx2 transcription factors, as detected by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization using digoxygenin-labeled antisense probe. In samples processed in parallel with the sense probe, the probe did not bind to RNA (Supplementary Figure 5).

<p>The tissue response to graft material <italic>in vivo</italic> is an important parameter when designing new materials for TE. Nanoceramic biomaterials that had been shown to be biocompatible in culture conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211415132">21</xref></sup> were tested as a graft material in this study. The questions remain whether material alone or material along with cells will be a good strategy for bone repair and, among the different sources of cells, which one performs the best.</p>
<p>Here we report for the first time a comparative analysis of the nanoceramic-based osteogenic differentiation potential of MSC derived from four different human sources. In cultures, MSC grown with P1, P2 and P3 nanoceramics showed induction of ALP, indicating that these biomaterials induce osteogenic differentiation of MSC. ALP is an important marker of osteoblasts; it increases phosphate levels in the cells, thus helping in mineralization. Several groups have previously shown increased ALP activity in other systems when osteogenic differentiation was induced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211415132">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328211415132">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>To compare the osteogenic efficiency among different types of MSC and among the nanoceramics, quantitative PCR studies were carried out for the osteogenic markers OC, OP, Runx2 and BMP-2. Each type of MSC grown with each nanoceramic was analysed for osteogenic markers. The results indicated that P3 was more efficient in enhancing the expression of the osteoblast markers than P2 and P1. On average, among the different markers, BMP-2 and Runx2 upregulated to the greatest degree (both by P3). Runx2 is a master control switch regulating the commitment of MSC to osteogenic lineage and expression of all other osteogenic markers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328211415132">29</xref></sup> BMP-2, although an upstream regulator of Runx2, is known to potently induce osteoblast differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328211415132">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among the four types of human MSC used for nanoceramic-based <italic>in vitro</italic> osteogenesis, placental MSC showed significant upregulation of the markers (23.42-fold; p &lt; 0.05) compared with bone marrow (14.49-fold), adipose (6.74-fold) and Wharton’s jelly (2.89-fold). Because placental MSC showed remarkable overall osteogenic differentiation capacity, these cells were chosen for creating TE constructs with each of the three biomaterials for <italic>in vivo</italic> implantation studies.</p>
<p>The tissue response to implant material was assessed by <italic>in vivo</italic> grafting of the nanoceramic material in rats in which a defect was created by drilling a critical sized hole in the femur. In critical sized bone defects, fibrous tissue usually fills up the gaps and osseous healing is precluded. The defect may develop connective tissue or a weak callus with vascular ingrowths, collagen matrix may form by 4–6 weeks, and ossification and adequate strength is typically achieved in 3–6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328211415132">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328211415132">32</xref></sup> Any material developed as implant needs to be able to expedite the process of healing and be integrated. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies carried out by creating a drilled hole injury of the femurs of Wistar rats indicate that ceramic nanomaterials and their respective TE constructs induce healing of the damaged region within a short span of 3 months, although the degree of integration varies. Incorporation of cells along with material during implantation has advantage for all the three nanoceramics. The complete integration of the material was seen in nanoceramic P3, which has a Ca/P ratio of 1.58, with no evidence of demarcation between the newly formed and old bone. These findings highlight the possible therapeutic application of HA-β-TCP nanoceramics, especially at a Ca/P ratio of 1.58, for bone grafts. Periodic X-ray imaging revealing the formation of a prominent callus at the site of damage at the end of 3 months also supports this prediction. P1 and P2 nanoceramics and their respective TE constructs did not indicate an efficient integration of material in the damaged region. Histology studies of P2 showed regions of integration in some regions but it was a rare event in P1. It seems that it may take more time for the empty areas or boundaries to disappear. P3 not only induced the most <italic>in vitro</italic> osteogenesis but also promoted complete healing and regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic> in a 3 month period. Although the Ca/P variation between the three nanoceramics is not very large, they still differ enough to conclude that P3, with a Ca/P ratio of 1.58, can promote more efficient osteogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> and tissue regeneration <italic>in vivo</italic>. P3 has less HA than P1 and P2 and shows better osteoinductivity and osteointegration. It has been proposed that resorption and integration of the material also depends on the method by which biphasic ceramics (BCP) is prepared.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328211415132">33</xref></sup> The nano-size of the ceramics (in the range of 20–30 nm) precludes the formation of too many acellular deposits of HA at the implantation site, especially in the TE constructs. The particulate nature of the nanoceramics would ensure better cell migration and infiltration. Nanodimensional apatites used by many other groups also report better biocompatibility, osteoinductivity and incorporation <italic>in vivo</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328211415132">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885328211415132">36</xref></sup> Histological changes showing repair of critical injuries with various implants have also been reported, with different degrees of success.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885328211415132">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885328211415132">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>HNA staining was performed to confirm the incorporation of human cells in the bone drilled Wistar rats. HNA marks human cell nuclei but not those of various other groups of animals, except closely related primates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0885328211415132">40</xref></sup> Femur sections of rats implanted with a TE construct of each of the nanoceramics demonstrated that human MSC are incorporated with each of the three nanoceramics, and possibly have a role in the development of callus in the damaged region of rat femurs.</p>
<p>To confirm that the incorporated cells have differentiated into an osteogenic phenotype, we used Runx2 as a marker. Human Runx2 mRNA expression was detected in each of the femur sections of rats implanted with P1-TE, P2-TE and P3-TE constructs, indicating that human MSC implanted with nanoceramics as TE constructs have survived and have received signals promoting osteogenic differentiation. We thus propose that the commitment of MSC to the osteogenic fate, promoted by the nanoceramic-containing environment, has promoted the healing of the drilled femur.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0885328211415132" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, all the three ceramics are biocompatible and osteoinductive as evidenced by ALP-positive staining and real time PCR for osteogenic markers. Among the four cell types, placenta shows significantly better response to nanoceramics. These <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of the healing of femur drilled hole defects in Wistar rats indicate that biphasic ceramics in nanomaterial form with MSC produce a better healing of the critical sized defects in terms of osteoinduction and osteointegration. Among the three nanoceramics, P3, either as material alone or as TE construct with human MSC, promotes better regeneration/healing of the damaged region of femur than P1 and P2. However, this is a preliminary study and a first step towards performing preclinical trials in smaller animals to evaluate the proof of concept. Further studies in larger animals would be helpful in ascertaining the findings.</p>
