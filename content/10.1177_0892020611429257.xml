<p>This edition of <italic>Management in Education</italic> draws on a variety of articles that have a common thread running through them, that of quality of provision. We move through a series of discussions ranging from consideration of the quality of the British Educational Leadership, Management and Administration Society annual conference provision through to discussion of the development of leadership support, teacher support and a range of educational provision.</p>
<p>We open with Bridget Grenville-Cleave and Ilona Boniwell drawing our attention to contested understandings about whether educational standards are rising or falling across the gamut of educational provision. Bridget and Ilona use this illustration to highlight the issues raised for educational professionals’ sense of well-being and present evidence comparing the results of educational professionals against other professional roles. They argue that autonomy is crucial to a sense of control and to a sense of well-being which is currently under threat in the education sector. Moreover well-being is linked to improvement.</p>
<p>Robert Whiteley and George Richard then explore the ways in which teaching staff in schools within British Columbia engage in extra-curricular provision, against a backdrop of ever increasing demands placed upon curriculum success. Robert and George argue that extra-curricular activity has been shown to benefit students in terms of their curriculum performance and that teaching staff are generally willing to undertake this. However, this is increasingly against the odds as their workloads intensify and it becomes ever harder to find the time, space and energy to make such a commitment.</p>
<p>Tim Simkins and Ros Garrick next draw us into the whole issue of children’s services. Tim and Ros outline some of the issues that are already recognised in terms of multi-agency working and extend this to make more explicit the complexities of a number of aspects of such developments. They highlight differences in a number of areas such as organisational culture, the individual and the team’s developmental stage, in organisational structures and in the ability to clearly identify core aims. Thus asking organisations to work in a multi-agency context is not as straightforward as it might at first appear to politicians.</p>
<p>As readers will be aware <italic>Management in Education</italic> is a journal of the British Educational Leadership, Management and Administration Society (BELMAS). As a consequence two articles in this edition are focused upon the remit of BELMAS and the annual conference. Colin Russell, the current chair of BELMAS, reflects on both the conference and the shape of BELMAS to come, particularly in the light of the forthcoming celebration of the organisation’s 40th birthday. Izhar Oplatka also provides us with his assessment of the most recent annual conference and compares this to his report from the conference of 2007 (also published in <italic>MiE</italic>) in terms of the widening international appeal of the organisation.</p>
<p>Following this, Malini Mistry and Krishan Sood take a closer look at leadership in Early Years settings and how such leaders are prepared. Malini and Krishan talk about the shortfalls in current preparation and discuss the ways in which higher education should be working to enhance practitioners’ critically reflective skills. They also argue for a more carefully nuanced provision that recognises the individual needs of different practitioners in different contexts and locations.</p>
<p>Finally Viola Wong discusses the ways in which quality measures in higher education may be developed and used more effectively. Viola urges the reader to consider concepts about quality as ‘a work in progress’ that is constantly evolving. She also discusses the ecology of quality and the ways in which process can be developed at all levels by all of those involved.</p>
<p>What these articles make apparent is the different ways and approaches that may be taken in assessing the quality of provision. They also demonstrate the crucial importance of those people involved in such processes. Thus the ineffective nature of many conventional ‘hard-and-fast’ measures of quality becomes understandable. Moreover, making judgements about what to privilege in terms of measurement is made on the basis of a diminished view of life, narrowing rich experiences to something more easily captured and measured.</p>
<p>As always ideas and comments are welcomed.</p>
