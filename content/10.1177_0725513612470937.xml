<p>
<italic>Thesis Eleven</italic> was established in Melbourne in 1980. The <italic>Thesis Eleven</italic> Centre was established as a duly constituted centre of La Trobe University in 2002. From 2012, the journal has shifted to six issues a year. From this issue, we would like to announce that the journal now operates in affiliation with a number of other centres throughout the world. Alphabetically, in order of their universities, these are the Philippines-Australia Studies Network, Ateneo de Manila University; the Innovation Network, University of Copenhagen; Department of English, University of Delhi; <italic>Theoria</italic>, University of Johannesburg; the Bauman Institute, University of Leeds; and Center for Cultural Sociology, Yale University. Henceforth, these affiliated centres will be listed alongside our individual affiliations with advisory editors.</p>
<p>Since 1980 we have engaged in cultural traffic on global, local, and regional scales. These affiliations offer potential publishing opportunities to our affiliated centres, as well as open possibilities for sharing events and visits, people and ideas. We are delighted to announce this innovation formally, and look forward to all that may come of it.</p>
