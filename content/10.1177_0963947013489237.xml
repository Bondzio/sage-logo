<abstract>
<p>As Monika Fludernik (2011) points out, creative metaphors receive less attention than conceptual metaphors in cognitive studies. The complex role of metaphor in literature and its narrative function needs to be further explored. Realistic novellas do not display a predilection towards elaborate creative metaphors. They contain other figures of speech and more conventional figurative forms such as symbols, allegories and similes – the latter to approximate an experience or perception. My hypothesis is, however, that in realistic texts metaphorical agency is often contained and instigated by virtual micronarratives (digression, memory, association, imagination and dream). How does metaphoricity relate to virtual parts of the storyworld? In order to investigate this question I use Wilhelm Raabe’s poetic realist novella <italic>Keltische Knochen</italic> (<italic>Celtic Bones</italic>, published 1864) as a case study. Raabe’s travel account shows how virtual passages can receive and entail a metaphorical dimension. In Raabe’s novella the narrator witness claims that it does not manipulate reality by rhetorical tricks and metaphorical transformations, and therefore makes a clear distinction between the virtual and real parts of the storyworld. At the same time this distinction is undermined because the virtual events interfere with the real events and transform them into metaphorical sequences. The metaphorical sequences open up alternative segments of the storyworld that can be coined as paranarratives. The case study exposes the negotiability and the co-text dependence of literary metaphoricity and contributes to the exploration of the narrative potential of figurativeness in literary texts.</p>

<title>1 Introduction and methodological preliminaries</title>
<p>Traditionally, figures of style are associated with an aesthetic dimension of language. Cognitive theorists and linguists overruled the ornamental stance and argued that metaphors are ubiquitous expressions of underlying cognitive structures in everyday speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963947013489237">Lakoff and Johnson, 1980</xref>) and in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963947013489237">Lakoff and Turner, 1989</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963947013489237">Stockwell (1999</xref>: 137) indicated, cognitive theorists and linguists tend to overlook the co-text dependence of literary metaphor (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963947013489237">Birgisson, 2012</xref>: 288). Taking our cue from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963947013489237">Fludernik’s (2011)</xref> plea to further explore the complexity of creative metaphoricity, this special issue investigates the narrative potential of figurativeness. I want to focus on how metaphoricity relates to virtual parts of the storyworld – like dreams, memories, hallucinations and imaginations.</p>
<p>Classical narratology and the study of figurativeness do not grant each other a lot of attention. More recent cross-fertilizations between the two disciplines encompass, on the one hand, a pragmatic branch of rhetorical narratology, which focuses on the ideological involvement of the reader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963947013489237">Booth, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963947013489237">Kearns, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963947013489237">Phelan, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963947013489237">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963947013489237">Phelan and Rabinowitz, 2005</xref>); on the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963947013489237">White (1973)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963947013489237">Lodge (1977)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963947013489237">Jakobson (1980)</xref> and many others uncover ‘megafigures’ underlying literary and non-literary texts and the expressed worldviews. Biebuyck and Martens take on a different approach, they detect networks of figures of speech in literary texts and explain how these networks entail a ‘tropological circle’:<disp-quote>
<p>Reading a powerful literary metaphor opens the door to reinterpret non-figurative utterances in the literary text referring to identical or related semantic fields and to allocate a surplus metaphorical dimension. In this manner, literary metaphors recuperate parts of the foreground narrative of the text. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963947013489237">Biebuyck and Martens, 2011</xref>: 65; see also: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963947013489237">Pimentel, 1990</xref>: 34–67)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both Pimentel and Biebuyck and Martens explain that networks of figures of speech open up alternative segments of the storyworld: tropes connect and develop paranarratives. As opposed to Pimentel, however, Biebuyck and Martens show that these networks are not only built up by semantic fields but also by figurative <italic>forms</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963947013489237">Biebuyck (2005)</xref>, moreover, shows how literary texts deploy different forms of indirect figurativeness. First, adnominal (adjectival and verbal) metaphors often tend to be lexicalized and need cotextual triggers such as other figures of speech, for example syllepsis, to affirm their figurativeness. Second, similes can receive a metaphorical dimension when the source does not enhance but complicates the understanding of the target. Third, the emergence of a metaphor can be evoked but not executed, a figurative form that can be coined as ‘proto-metaphor’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963947013489237">Biebuyck, 2005</xref>: 190). Raabe’s novella <italic>Celtic Bones</italic> (<italic>Keltische Knochen</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963947013489237">1974 [1864]</xref>) provides an excellent case to investigate ‘metaphorization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963947013489237">Pimentel, 1990</xref>: 50) and the indirect figurativeness it entails.</p>
<p>Wilhelm Raabe (1831–1910) is generally considered an exponent of poetic realism. Similarly to current ‘reality television’ the credibility pact with the audience is not based on <italic>being</italic> real, but pretending, seeming and <italic>claiming</italic> to be real. Poetic realist novellas <italic>pretend</italic> to give an honest account of real-life events. Raabe’s novella <italic>Celtic Bones</italic> plays upon this pretence and the expectations of the reader as it presents a witness account of a journey that debates its own reliability. The reception of Raabe’s oeuvre consists of two extreme positions. On the one hand, it is situated explains a Biedermeier poetics of illusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963947013489237">Vonhoff, 1994</xref>: 153; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963947013489237">Eiden-Offe, 2011</xref>) that offers idyllic escape routes from contemporary socio-economic harshness. <italic>Celtic Bones</italic> reflects this poetics as the narrator explains his journey to the mountains as a flight from the hypocrisy of Vienna and its neglectful attitude towards the war with Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963947013489237">Raabe, 1974 [1864]</xref>: 210). On the other hand, the narrative experiments and social criticism in Raabe’s work are foregrounded as precursory of modernism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0963947013489237">1</xref></sup> The generic point of interest of poetic realism is the dialogue with the historical context. Early biographical Raabe scholarship shows that basic aspects of the story can be related to Raabe’s experiences as a tourist in Vienna, Linz and the Hallstatt region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963947013489237">Plitschke and Hoppe, 1974 [1864]</xref>: 474–476). More recent research on <italic>Celtic Bones</italic> illuminates the critical views of its author, for example on tourism and popularizing archaeology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963947013489237">McIsaac, 2007</xref>) and on the a German or European identity for a German nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963947013489237">Downing, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0963947013489237">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Figures of speech and figurativeness in Raabe’s novella <italic>Celtic Bones</italic> (and in his work in general) have so far largely been neglected. Indeed, it does not contain a lot of creative metaphors and presents itself as an anti-rhetorical authentic Narrative. Of course, the traditional equation of rhetoric and artificiality, and opposition of rhetoric and authenticity is problematic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0963947013489237">3</xref></sup> The narrator militates against the rhetorical battles between the characters and confirms that he does not give in to the temptation to poeticize and manipulate reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963947013489237">Raabe, 1974 [1864]</xref>: 213, 210). This emphasis however paradoxically draws attention to the constructedness of Raabe’s satirical travel account that in fact is filled with figures of speech. Realist poetics do not presuppose a ‘sober’ style: Fludernik coins – ‘describes’ realism as ‘ekphrastic ornamentalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963947013489237">Fludernik, 1996</xref>: 131). When it comes to the deployment of figurativeness, however, realist poetics often restrict the transgressive potential inherent to metaphor to virtual micronarratives (a digression, a memory, an association, an imagination, a dream or a delusion) marked as ‘unreal’ parts of the storyworld. The analysis of <italic>Celtic Bones</italic> however will show that the metaphorical agency goes beyond these virtual boundaries.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963947013489237">Baßler (2010)</xref> does not analyse tropes <italic>in</italic> Raabe’s texts but rather investigates poetic realism and Raabe’s oeuvre by means of a tropological model. He conceives tropes as megafigures carrying the aesthetics and world view expressed in large amounts of texts. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963947013489237">White (1973)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963947013489237">Lodge (1977)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963947013489237">Jakobson (1980)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963947013489237">Baßler (2010</xref>: 65–66) coins the vertical axis as the symbolic or metaphorical axis: events are idealized and charged with meaning. The metonymical, horizontal axis is the axis of causal chains of events, of realism without deeper or higher significance. He explains the programme of ‘poetic realism’ as an intrinsic connection between both axes by a metacode (‘nature’): all individual manifestations of reality point to an inherent order or meaning (vertical axis), and at the same time the inherent laws of reality only reveal themselves in their actual manifestations (horizontal axis). Baßler contrasts the programme of poetic realism with its practice, and develops a second model for the latter. The two axes remain operational (in contrast to modernism that expels the vertical axis) but the connection between them is loosened because of the lack of a metacode. Deeper significance and overall truth persist in an unfulfilled longing for them. The attempt to charge reality with meaning turns over into a meaningless succession of events. The succession of events consequently turns over into the desire for an inherent order or meaning in reality. Resignation, according to Baßler, is omnipresent in Raabe’s work and can be explained as the only possible outcome of the infinite switching between the horizontal axis of event succession and the vertical axis of symbolic meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963947013489237">2010</xref>: 66–67).</p>
<p>Baßler’s focus on resignation does not take notice of the subversive potential of Raabe’s œuvre and in our case <italic>Celtic Bones</italic>. In my understanding of figurativeness (based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963947013489237">Biebuyck, 1998</xref>), metaphors have, in contrast to symbols or allegories, a subversive potential. This conception of the metaphorical dynamics in a literary text can be described with a different toppling model: the linear conceptualization of the narrative (horizontal axis) is interrupted by metaphorical processes entailing a co-occurrence of two concepts (projection on the vertical axis). The target domain does not replace the source domain, nor do they blend, but they collide. The bidirectional charge of meaning (vertical axis) provokes an alienation, a disturbance in the conceptualization of the storyworld and entails a shift in its understanding (projection to the horizontal axis). Because of this perspectival shift, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963947013489237">Caracciolo (2013)</xref> relates metaphor to internal focalization: metaphors invite recipients to adopt a new perspective on a conceptual domain, just as engaging with a focalizing character encourages readers to ‘try on’ his or her experiential perspective and worldview. Metaphors often try to capture the experiential states of characters, as they are able to integrate perception, emotion and language (see also the concept of ‘hyperrealist metaphor’ by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963947013489237">Müller, 2011</xref>). The concentration of metaphors therefore often increases when these experiential states are intense and difficult to put into words. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963947013489237">Caracciolo (2013)</xref> calls these metaphors phenomenological metaphors and links them with narrative empathy, as the perspective-taking can influence the readers’ own worldview. Raabe’s novella <italic>Celtic Bones</italic> starts with an invitation to try on the perspective of the allodiegetic narrator and a staging of the emergence of a metaphor.</p>

<title>2.1 ‘It is a dismal picture’</title>
<p>The opening passage is an illustration of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963947013489237">Caracciolo’s (2013)</xref> argument that metaphors reflect everyday experience in their cross-modal integration of perception, emotion and language and that they invite the reader to adopt the perspective of the focalizing character.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Trapped in the rain! … Who, at the mention of those words does not feel <italic>a ghostlike memory rise</italic> within the soul, the <italic>memory</italic> of an hour – two hours – a day – two, three, four – eight days, when he or she was <italic>also</italic> trapped in the rain …</p>
<p>It is a dismal <italic>picture</italic> – trapped in the rain! It comes creeping toward you, gray, grim and grouchy, sends out a hundred chilling, damp tentacles to wrap about your heart and is as difficult to shake off as any other unpleasant, uncomfortable, and untimely happenstance of this world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0963947013489237">4</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963947013489237">Raabe, 1974 [1864]</xref>: 201, emphasis mine)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, the passage plays out what Caracciolo, drawing on empirical reader research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963947013489237">Miall and Kuiken (1994)</xref>, explains as the heightened emotional involvement and empathy provoked by stylistic foregrounding (e.g. striking figures of speech). The exclamation, the rhetorical question, and the three alliterative sequences enhance the reader’s involvement in the evocation of the emotional, bodily and linguistic experience of being trapped in the rain. The usual order is reversed: by stimulating the readers to imagine how it feels to be trapped in the rain, the narrator familiarizes them with his experience. By inviting the readers to call up a memory of a trip that ‘turned into water’, the narrator stirs up his own memory in order for him to be able to relate his travel story. An internal focalization through the eyes and body of the allodiegetic narrator is opened up and exposed as a pursuit of the reader’s empathy.</p>
<p>The passage is a ‘picture’, (‘Vorstellung’) or image, which marks the imaginary character of the scene that is not part of the ‘real’ storyworld. It introduces an analogy (‘also’, ‘ebenfalls’), an attempt to evoke linguistically what it is like to be trapped in the rain during a journey, based on similar experiences and ‘memorie[s]’ of the readers. The creation of a cognitive dialogue between reader and narrator at the beginning of a story is spelled out: ‘dear reader, let’s imagine and remember together what it is like to be trapped in the rain during a journey!’ Virtual narration and analogy normally exclude metaphoricity as they disarm the alienation provoked by creative metaphor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963947013489237">Biebuyck, 1998</xref>). Nevertheless, the passage, a combination of memory, imagination and analogy, receives a metaphorical dimension because of the unusual development of the virtual analogy. The verbs ‘rise’ (‘aufsteigen’) and ‘creep … toward you’ (‘herankriechen’), the adjective ‘ghostlike’ (‘gespenstisch’) and the attribution of ‘tentacles’ (‘Fangarme’) turn the gradual recollection first, into the appearance of a phantom and second, into the approach of a fantastic tentacled animal that the narrator and reader cannot get rid of. The creation of a metaphor is simultaneously developed and impaired by the analogy and virtuality markers.</p>
<p>The exteriorization and individuation of a memory or a mental picture reverses the subject-object relation. The appearance of a phantom presents the recollection as a perceptual process, the tentacled creature embodies the memory of a disagreeable moment and evokes an emotional reaction. The feeling of a tentacled creature trying to reach your heart is associated with the feeling of wet clothes sticking to one’s body. The remembered experience metonymically infects the experience of remembering: the process of recollection is described as getting gradually soaked by rain, as an image ‘creeping’ towards one and trying to reach one’s heart with its hundred damp tentacles. The confrontation with traumatic memory (this exaggeration makes up the ironical tone of the passage) is associated with the feeling of being scared, cold, trapped and haunted.</p>
<p>By consequence, a whole range of interfering figurative forms and fields are activated in this opening passage: analogy, metaphor and metonymy (figurative forms); rain, memory and haunting (semantic fields). These figurative forms and fields are linked with other parts of the novella. Rain, for instance, later in the novella repeatedly functions as a fertilizer of the seeds of poetic inspiration (for both Krautworst, the poet, and the narrator). By looking at the figurative network the opening passage turns out to put forward the writing process as a laborious, mysterious, haunting, disagreeable activity. Another example of how a figurative network functions within a story is the retroactive explanation of the source domain of the analogy in the beginning of the story. Later it is mentioned that the travel companions are crossing Lake Hallstatt in a boat when it starts raining. The female rower is compared to a whale, the tentacles of the opening passage in this context evoke another marine animal, the octopus (enhancing the reference to the writing process). Crossing the lake is described as entering a Dantesque inferno. Whereas in the opening passage the ghostlike memory to a rainy day ‘rises’, here the ghost of Virgil ‘rises’ from Lake Hallstatt in the rain. Or better it ‘would most likely have risen’ from the water ‘if it weren’t for the prosaic boatmen’. The novella raises the conflict between realism and poetic imagination and the hypocrisy of both writers and readers of realist prose. The counterfactual or speculative conditional construction (‘if it weren’t for X, Y would have happened’) embeds the intertextual evocation of the underworld in a virtual setting. The underworld scene plays an important role, both in the primary narrative and in the paranarrative, the alternative story segments opened up by the figurative network. In the primary narrative it anticipates the importance of Hallstatt’s excavated burial grounds and identifies the narrator as a bourgeois intellectual. Within the figurative network it recalls the link between writing and rain in the opening passage and it transforms the population of Hallstatt into dead ghosts and skeletons, a crucial metonymical dynamic in the novella.</p>

<title>2.2 ‘A very similar experiment’</title>
<p>The arrival of Steinbüchse, an archaeology professor, ends the exposition of the novella and starts the action gradually bringing the novella to its typical peripeteia, the central climactic event of the genre. He is presented as the double of Zuckriegel, an anatomist, the poet Krautworst and the narrator being the other two mirror figures. After going for a solitary walk, the narrator returns to the inn and describes, first from an acoustic, then from a visual perspective, the confrontation of the anatomist Zuckriegel with the newly arrived archaeology professor Steinbüchse.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>But there I stood stock-still, listening – Zuckriegel had his voice turned up to the highest register, and another voice was simultaneously singing the antistrophe with him, with extraordinarily disharmonic effect. The kitchen crew pressed into the hallway, intimidated-excited; knowing however, that our traveling companion only too gladly and too often got himself involved in altercations, I opened the door to the taproom and entered. I stood there, full of doubts and glued to the threshold, my mouth wide open, and the door wasn’t closed either.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a conjurer in the Prater in Vienna take a live rabbit by the hind legs, rip it apart in the middle, and then present a gaily struggling animal in each hand to his amazed an enthusiastic audience. A <italic>very similar</italic> experiment appeared to have been performed on Zuckriegel the anatomist – he was present twice over in the Seeauer’s taproom and was now engaging in the most violent argument with his doppelgänger.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0963947013489237">5</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963947013489237">Raabe, 1974 [1864]</xref>: 212, emphasis mine)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The entrance into the taproom and the sight of the two professors fighting is delayed and prepared by an acoustic moment in the corridor. The memory of the magical rabbit trick in the Wiener Prater delays the disclosure of the scene and the understanding of the narrator’s surprise. The delays and the tension they create accentuate the power and skilfulness of the narrator.</p>
<p>The characterization as ‘very similar’ (‘ganz ähnlich’) turns the memory of the rabbit trick into an analogy. Analogies function as helpful tools to conceptualize an impression by a character and in order to do so first mention the target, then the source that subsequently explains and replaces the target. Because of the inversion of the usual order of source and target, the bunny-passage subverts this uni-directional posterior dynamic and instead creates a bidirectional transformation of two co-occuring concepts, typical of metaphor. First the source is mentioned, the doubled rabbits, then the target is mentioned, the doubled scholars. When the magician and his rabbits are brought up, the reader does not know where this will lead to and an irritation occurs. His attention is sharpened and in the subsequent analogy source and target co-occur: rabbits become scholars and scholars become rabbits. The scholarly discussion turns into a circus act and the Wiener Prater turns into an academic gathering. This bidirectional shift in meaning grants the scene a metaphorical dimension. The metaphorized analogy is embedded in a virtual narrative (‘this scene reminds me of’). The proliferation of superfluous intellectuals in nineteenth century Austria and their focus on wealth and comfort are mocked. The vegetative, asexual reproduction of the rabbits and the link with magic evokes the capitalist logic of money accumulation. As the magician moreover acquires money by doing the magic trick, a metonymical link is established between an activity and its consequence. In an ironical reversal the bourgeois audience of the circus entertainment at the Wiener Prater is turned into a circus attraction itself with the Hallstatt people and the readers as their public. Earlier the poet is described as a tightrope walker because of his chequered suit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963947013489237">Raabe, 1974 [1864]</xref>: 205). In the amusement park the narrator aspires to the role of the conjurer who holds the two struggling rabbit-scholars (and the curious reader) ‘up in the air’ and who is occupied with the benefits that his writing will bring.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0963947013489237">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Zuckriegel’s fights with Steinbüchse and Krautworst the narrator witness plays the role of a neutral consultant: ‘let me play the mediator, allow me to open the peace conference … No new breach of the peace! No unnecessary aspersions! No learned rhetorical flourishes!’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963947013489237">Raabe, 1974 [1864]</xref>: 213, ‘lassen Sie mich den Neutralen spielen, lassen Sie mich den Friedenskongress eröffnen … Keinen neuen Friedensbruch! Keine unnötigen Anzüglichkeiten! Keine gelehrten Redeblumen!’). The narrator’s imperatives are hypocritical and ironic, as he does not do anything else but juggle around with learned rhetorical figures and fuels or moderates the conflicts between the other characters in the way it suits him and his story. The academic debate between the scholars is not based on arguments and knowledge but on personal profit. The narrator’s imperatives present this superficial conflict as a war. This hyberbole inversely denounces the trivialization of Austria’s war with Italy. Sequences of similar word groups are omnipresent in the novella (compare the opening passage) and mostly count three or four elements referring to the changing amount of travel companions: first three, then four with Steinbüchse joining in, and finally back to three. With the metaphor ‘our clover leaf’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963947013489237">Raabe, 1974 [1864]</xref>: 203, ‘unser Kleeblatt’), the narrator presents the travel companions as a leaf consisting of three or four parts – the latter a symbol of luck. As the narrator is part of this clover leaf, his double role as character and narrator is problematized. He is conjurer and rabbit at the same time. He cannot hold the superior position he aspires to as he is constantly exposed to be as superficial, hypocritical and opportunist as his travel companions. Because of the heightened empathy of the narrator, the immersion in his perspective, provoked by stylistic foregrounding, the reader in turn gets confronted with the critique of bourgeois, capitalist culture. The clover metaphor is linked to the rabbit metaphor and reveals that despite the outplayed difference between the characters they are in fact doubles of one person or typus, the proliferating 19th-century bourgeois intellectual.</p>

<title>2.3 ‘How would it be if’</title>
<p>The climax of the novella is the grave theft. Although the two scholars disagree on the origins of the historical burial ground they agree to a joint grave theft mission. Zuckriegel wants bones for his collection, Steinbüchse bronze grave offerings. The narrator joins them and on the way to the burial ground he fantasizes about a revolt by the displayed skeleton they are about to see, the highlight of the visit.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>These poor dead warriors, women, youths and maidens! It is not pleasant to be awakened after so many centuries of undisturbed sleep and to have to be gawked at by such a warped and atrophied tribe. <italic>How would it be if</italic> suddenly such a thousand-year-old decayed skeleton pulled itself together with a clatter, stood up, rubbed the sleep from its empty eye sockets, and angrily grabbed for its bronze sword in order to descend on the haemorrhoid sufferers, the crinolines, the professors, and the yawning tourist laggards?</p>
<p>That <italic>would</italic> turn into a frolicking running and leaping down the mountain; and what <italic>would</italic> the nineteenth century not lose on the twisting paths along the way down to Hallstatt! What <italic>would</italic> that old Celt or Germanic tribesman be able to snap up by way of glasses, wigs, snuffboxes, parasols and umbrellas, galoshes, plaid blankets, and opera glasses! Hussa, what a souvenir that <italic>would</italic> be, my gentlemen and ladies, when one is again sitting safe on the train or at home, thinking of the prehistoric spook!</p>
<p><italic>But I am digressing</italic>, I still have to tell about <italic>another</italic> running and jumping down the mountain, during which a lot of things got lost <italic>as well</italic> that were proclaimed as a legally fair catch by the pursuing vindicators of the dead.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0963947013489237">7</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963947013489237">Raabe, 1974 [1864]</xref>: 235, emphasis mine)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The consequent use of the subjunctive and the construction ‘how would it be if’ (‘was wäre, wenn’) emphasize the virtual, hypothetical character of the scene. The concluding metanarrative comment ‘I am digressing’ (‘Ich schweife ab’) affirms the virtuality of the passage that is identified as a digression, a pause of the real events. The sight of the excavated grave is delayed on the level of the primary story by the rain, the walk to the site, the obligatory preliminary museum visit and the tricky lock covering the skeleton. The heightened tension for the characters is doubled and transferred to the readers by the insertion of a digression. The narrator thematizes the analogy of the imagined with the subsequent ‘real’ scene by making explicit the <italic>tertium comparationis</italic>: he still has to relate ‘another’ run downhill during which a lot of things get lost ‘as well’, which are claimed by the vindicators of the dead. The imagined scene by consequence becomes an elaborated simile for the actual scene that follows.</p>
<p>McIsaac explains the passage as ‘the conversion of exchange value into memory value’ inherent to the touristic encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963947013489237">McIsaac, 2007</xref>: 147): the equation of valuable objects and authenticated experience (‘souvenir’). Educational trips by scholars and authors do not imply an authentic interest in the other but take on the form of a circus and a bidirectional reduction and exploitation. The skeleton rapaciously gathers 19th-century material objects such as glasses, wigs, snuffboxes, parasols, umbrellas, galoshes, plaid blankets, and lorgnettes as souvenirs. Not much later, the scholars fall upon the skeleton, grab bones and bronze armour. They are persecuted by the locals who gather the accessories left behind by the scholars. The virtual scene therefore turns out to be the blueprint of the actual scene, a mirror that not only doubles but also transforms it.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The lock now opened with a bang; the maid flung back the lid of the box, the two scholars shot forward, their eyes flaming with greed – there the Celt or primal Teuton lay on his left side, well preserved, peaceful and relaxed, his sword beside him, at his breast a green clasp, which <italic>looked</italic> terribly <italic>like</italic> a sat-to-death sofa spring. <italic>It seemed as if</italic> a sly smile <italic>were playing</italic> across the skeleton’s bared teeth, <italic>with an expression like</italic>: ‘Come, kiss me!’ and Zuckriegel <italic>would have done</italic> just that with pleasure.</p>
<p>But what happened now proves once again that a well-thought-out, nicely laid plan of attack can be wrecked by the haste and violence of the moment. The greed of the two scientific body snatchers did not permit me to fulfil my promise to charm and fetter the attention of the maiden. With a cry that <italic>seemed</italic> to have a zoological basis, Zuckriegel and Steinbüchse fell upon the Celt and helped themselves. But the maid of the Rudolf Tower likewise let out a cry …</p>
<p>But things were stirring all about. From all sides the doughty descendants of the problematical Celt or Teuton streamed in, responding to the maiden’s cry, some with axes, others with mighty cudgels. A few breathless words by the maid sufficed to send them on the track of the robbers, whose fluttering coat tails were just vanishing into the depths of the forest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0963947013489237">8</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963947013489237">Raabe, 1974 [1864]</xref>: 236, 237 emphasis mine)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>McIsaac describes the passage as a ‘metaphorically sexualized theft’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963947013489237">McIsaac, 2007</xref>: 148). ‘Peaceful’ and especially ‘relaxed’ indeed have a metaphorical purport. The sequence of adjectives ‘well-preserved, peaceful and relaxed’ confronts the literal, material bones (well-preserved) with the personified skeleton (peaceful and relaxed) and recalls the virtual awakening of the skeleton (on the tension between the literal and the metaphorical, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963947013489237">Goatly, 2003</xref>). The italicized caution markers impair metaphoricity: the green pin <italic>is not</italic> a sofa spring but <italic>looks like it</italic>, the skeleton <italic>seems</italic> to purse its lips, Zuckriegel <italic>would have</italic> kissed the skeleton, and the scholars’ scream <italic>sounds like</italic> an animal cry. Figurativeness is strongly intertwined with focalization. The personification of the seductive skeleton is a realistic depiction of the scholars’ ‘hallucination’ (a typical example of virtual narration) provoked by the greed and the adrenaline of the moment. From the point of view of the narrator, the scene becomes a simile with which he approximates the perception and behaviour of the excited academic thieves.</p>
<p>Contrarily to its usual function, however, the simile alienates us from the behaviour of Zuckriegel rather than helping us to understand it. The disloyal narrator passes the responsibility for the personification of the skeleton onto the scholars. Likewise, he abdicates the responsibility for his role in the failure of the theft mission. Earlier he promised Zuckriegel to kiss the guide in order to distract her attention. According to his own report the narrator cannot kiss and distract her because of the precipitate action of the scholars. The time the narrator takes for the description of the skeleton at the moment he should have performed the kiss refutes this explanation. A co-occurrence is created between Zuckriegel’s virtual kissing and the narrator’s unexecuted kiss. The virtual kiss prevents the actual kiss and in this way strongly interferes with the primary action as it contributes to the failure of the grave theft. The scene receives a metaphorical dimension, which is not verbal, but situational.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0963947013489237">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The relation between the virtual and the actual scene exposes a metonymical shift because the vindication is transferred from the skeleton to its ‘doughty descendants’ that pursue the scholars with ‘axes’ and ‘mighty cudgels’. The weapons and later the ‘raw screams of victory’ accentuate the prehistoric character of the Hallstatt pursuers in the perception of the narrator. Their appearance (‘things were stirring all about. From all sides … streamed in’, ‘ringsumher regte es sich. Von allen Seiten strömten … herzu’) is described as the resurrection of the other skeletons in the burial ground. The metonymical shift implies a multiplication of the avengers. Another transformation is the frightening warrior waving his sword, which is changed into the seductive, relaxed skeleton pursing its lips. The responsibility for the body snatching is deferred to the victim, which shows that figurativeness can have ethical implications. The actual locals, like the virtual skeleton, are only after material ‘souvenirs’ or relics: not only the stolen skull, arm bone, ribs, sword and clasp of their ancestors are recuperated but two umbrellas, two hats, a silk handkerchief, a wig and glasses are collected as well. ‘They let go of Steinbüchse and Zuckriegel’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963947013489237">Raabe, 1974 [1864]</xref>: 238, ‘Steinbüchse und Zuckriegel selbst hatten sie laufen lassen’). As opposed to the usual order in a simile, the target (the revenge of the descendants) is mentioned after the source (the revenge of the skeleton). When the locals suddenly appear from all sides and pick up the 19th-century accessories of the two scholars, one recalls the virtual scene. The awakened skeleton becomes an outraged inhabitant of Hallstatt and the inhabitants of Hallstatt become living skeletons; war becomes a tourist attraction and tourism is exposed as attack and robbery. Target and source co-occur, they reflect in one another and, as a consequence, the real scene receives a metaphorical and subversive dimension.</p>

<title>3 Conclusion</title>
<p>Raabe’s novella is a meta-rhetorical text that chimes in with the popular criticism of rhetoric as a schoolish catalogue of figures of speech that conceal and manipulate reality. <italic>Celtic Bones</italic>, however, simultaneously shows the potentially subversive power of the figurative network in a literary text. Realist texts like Raabe’s novella may display a striking ornamental style but they do not contain a lot of creative metaphors. In addition to the abundance of conceptual metaphors and ‘learned rhetorical flourishes’ in <italic>Celtic Bones</italic>, however, I uncovered a creative metaphorical layer in the text, which is provoked by virtual narration. The authenticity of the poetic realist story is defended by marking what is a virtual and what is a real part of the storyworld and confers figurativeness on the former. In <italic>Celtic Bones</italic> the virtual narratives take on the form of memories, imaginations, delusions and digressions, often in mixed forms. For the suspicious reader, the agency of these sequences goes beyond mere digressions or delusions of the narrators or the characters: they acquire a metaphorical dimension. The virtual passages do not simply pause, delay and anticipate the primary events and actions but fuel, provoke and transform them. They create a metaphorical paranarrative.</p>
<p>Partly the figurative sequences can be described as phenomenological metaphors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963947013489237">Caracciolo, 2013</xref>) that invite the reader to try on the perception and experience of the homodiegetic narrator. But they equally create a metanarrative and meta-rhetorical that alienates the reader from this very perspective. The virtual passages often entail analogies that do not render the storyworld more comprehensible and conceivable but, on the contrary, defamiliarize the reader from conventional perceptions. The virtual sequences occur at important moments in the novella and heighten the tension as they delay crucial events, only to interfere with them. They do not merely announce what is coming but entail a narrative surplus. Additional meaning is created as source and target co-occur and produce metaphorical transformations and metonymical shifts, such as shifts in time, focalization and responsibility. Raabe’s novella subverts nineteenth-century bourgois culture by critically unveiling the bidirectional transformation of and the rivalry between travellers and locals, history and present, soldiers and intellectuals, writers and readers, and literature and science. In <italic>Celtic Bones</italic>, ‘buried’, sedimented patterns of thought are excavated, displayed and revived.</p>

<p>Jückstock-Kielsing claims that only Raabe’s later ‘better’ works contain a hidden subversive meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963947013489237">Jückstock-Kiesling, 2006</xref>: 9). The author’s own rejection of all work preceding <italic>Drei Federn</italic> (1865) is often affirmed by scholars. According to his letters, the early Raabe would have made artistic sacrifices to adapt to the literary market and to the taste of the public. The analysis of <italic>Celtic Bones</italic> shows that a novella published one year earlier does not simply adapt to but rather problematizes the literary market and bourgeois readership. <italic>Drei Federn</italic> compiles three different versions of the same series of events that do not complement but undermine each other. In a more subtle way <italic>Celtic Bones</italic> also foregrounds the impossibility of authorial guidance, as the authority and authenticity of the allodiegetic (witness) narrator is eroded. Raabe remains implicit about his poetics but his works engage in a critical dialogue with the programme of poetic realism (elaborated by, among others, Julian Schmidt and Gustav Freytag in their periodical <italic>Die Grenzboten</italic> and by Karl Gutzkow) which approved of literature that, through idealization, showed reality in its true form. The presupposed reliable narrator with a bird’s-eye view on reality, the ability to select a representative piece and render it in a stylized form is problematized in Raabe’s <italic>Celtic Bones</italic>.</p>

<p>Downing tries to find out Raabe’s position in the debate on the Celtic or Germanic origin of the bones and links this matter to the discussion on the foundations of a German identity. He interprets, for instance, the title as an argument for Raabe’s tendency towards a Europe-based German identity. Alliteration is one of the most frequent figures of style in <italic>Keltische Knochen.</italic> Therefore the title can be better understood as an erosion of the debate revealing it as a ridicule form discussion.</p>
