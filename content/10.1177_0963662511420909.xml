<abstract>
<p>This study aimed to assess public attitudes in Japan to the promotion of genomic selection in crop studies and to examine associated factors. We analysed data from a nationwide opinion survey. A total of 4,000 people were selected from the Japanese general population by a stratified two-phase sampling method, and 2,171 people participated by post; this survey asked about the pros and cons of crop-related genomic studies promotion, examined people’s scientific literacy in genomics, and investigated factors thought to be related to genomic literacy and attitude. The relationships were examined using logistic regression models stratified by gender. Survey results showed that 50.0% of respondents approved of the promotion of crop-related genomic studies, while 6.7% disapproved. No correlation was found between literacy and attitude towards promotion. Trust in experts, belief in science, an interest in genomic studies and willingness to purchase new products correlated with a positive attitude towards crop-related genomic studies.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>Recent advances in genome science have prompted studies on its application to medicine and agri-food. Over the past 10–15 years, emerging technologies such as genetically modified (GM) food, pharmacogenetics, and stem-cell research have generated new dimensions in the relationship between science and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963662511420909">Cronin, 2008</xref>). For instance, in terms of advancing science, rice research in Japan has led to the production of rice that accumulates materials that function to prevent disease and maintain good health. Examples include GM rice seeds that accumulate a GLP-1 analogue and stimulate insulin secretion; this has applications in diabetes prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0963662511420909">Sugita et al., 2005</xref>). Researchers have also produced a transgenic rice that accumulates human T-cell epitopes for oral immunotherapy against Japanese cedar pollinosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0963662511420909">Takagi et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>However, over the past decade, GM organisms have come to be viewed as problematic in Japan, as evidenced by a large number of newspaper articles covering issues ranging from the unknown ecological impact of these organisms to uncertainty about food safety. Additionally, some consumer groups have organized activities including demonstrations at experiment stations and have petitioned the government on GM technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0963662511420909">Yamaguchi and Suda, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The potential risks of recombinant-DNA (r-DNA) molecule technology were discussed as long ago as the late 1960s. Prior to the 1975 Asilomar meeting (called Asilomar II), concerns raised about r-DNA risks included the possibilities of genetically modifying human beings, or the potential hazards associated with inserting viral DNA into bacteria. Unlike the initial concerns, however, the contested issues of today relate to the social, environmental, economic and ethical consequences of creating products from the progenitor technology. The public’s attention has turned away from the risks of r-DNA in basic research to the risks of biotechnology, primarily in agriculture and the pharmaceutical industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963662511420909">Krimsky, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been suggested that innovative technologies with specific social and ethical implications require acceptance and legitimization by the public for effective and equitable implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963662511420909">Milewa and Calnan, 2001</xref>). Further, the establishment of a credible process for public discourse and respectful consideration of diverse views is considered critical for the application of these new technologies in the public sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963662511420909">Omenn, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The Eurobarometer survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511420909">Gaskell et al., 2006</xref>), carried out in the European Union, and the British Social Attitude Survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0963662511420909">Sturgis, 2005</xref>) measured public opinion on specific applications of genetic technologies and general attitudes towards genetic research. Similarly, the Biotechnologies and Public Opinion survey in Italy was conducted to determine public attitudes towards medical and food biotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511420909">Bucchi and Neresini, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In Japan, the Society for Techno-innovation of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (STAFF) carried out several surveys on attitudes to GM farm products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963662511420909">STAFF, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511420909">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0963662511420909">2007</xref>) and the Japanese General Social Survey-2005 looked at general attitudes towards GM foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0963662511420909">Tanaka, 2007</xref>). These explored social acceptance of GM foods, but did not research public attitudes to promotion of genomic studies applied to farm products; no comparison of public perception between the application types of medicine and farm products was described. In 2005, we conducted the Attitude Survey on Genome Science. This was the first large-scale opinion poll aimed at assessing Japanese citizens’ attitudes towards genomic studies, including its application in medicine and agri-food.</p>
<p>Siegrist has indicated that perception and acceptance of gene technology vary according to the type of application in Switzerland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963662511420909">Siegrist, 2003</xref>). In a previous study focusing on the relationship between the quality of press coverage and public perception, it was pointed out that a contrast in public perception between “desirable” biomedical (RED) and “undesirable” agri-food (GREEN) biotechnology existed in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963662511420909">Bauer, 2002</xref>). The Italian telephone survey mentioned above reported that 84% of people favoured medical biotechnologies and 57.3% food biotechnologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511420909">Bucchi and Neresini, 2004</xref>). It is no exaggeration to say that many individuals around the world maintain a persistent ambivalence towards food biotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963662511420909">Salleh, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In our earlier study, we analysed data from the Attitude Survey on Genome Science and obtained new data on public opinion towards medicine-related genomic studies. Our findings showed that more than two-thirds of the general public approved of the promotion of medicine-related genomic studies and that people with a high level of genomic literacy tended to approve of its promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511420909">Ishiyama et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, the study explored neither people’s opinion on the promotion of crop-related genomic research, nor the relation between genomic literacy and approval thus far.</p>
<p>“Scientific literacy” has been agreed upon as a goal of science teaching by the science education community. This term has a broad meaning. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963662511420909">Bybee (1997)</xref> pointed out, scientific literacy consists of a set of characteristics, that is, knowledge, understanding, values, abilities, and sensibilities. When we designed the frame of this survey, we agreed that genomic literacy, particularly the aspects of knowledge and understanding of genomics, might be an indicator that explains a person’s attitude toward genomic research. This is partially true in medicine-related genomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511420909">Ishiyama et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In regards to the correlation between knowledge and attitude, various studies have found the following: greater scientific knowledge can engender attitudinal changes that favour genetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662511420909">Sturgis et al., 2005</xref>); an increase in knowledge is coupled with an increase in concern about the use of genetic engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0963662511420909">WHO, 2002</xref>); and the relationship between a greater knowledge of genetics and a favourable attitude towards genetic studies is not straightforward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662511420909">Jallinoja and Aro, 2000</xref>). As to why this is the case, many views have been expressed. In the present investigation, we examined the relationship between genomic literacy and attitude regarding the research field of farm products, and planned to compare attitudes according to application types.</p>
<p>Researchers have frequently suggested that difficulties associated with genomic science applications are related to the level of public scientific literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0963662511420909">Sturgis et al., 2005</xref>). It has also pointed out that public uptake of science depends primarily upon trust in, and credibility of, scientific experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511420909">Wynne, 1992</xref>). Furthermore, it has been suggested that the mass media make up an important part of the social context in which citizens judge controversial science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511420909">Nisbet and Goidel, 2007</xref>). Thus we assessed current as well as credible information sources to examine factors besides genomic literacy which explain attitudes to crop genomic studies promotion.</p>
<p>Gender differences in attitude have frequently been demonstrated. This can be seen, for instance, in the investigation based on the Eurobarometer 52.1 survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662511420909">Simon, 2010</xref>) and a survey study examining attitudes towards genetically engineered salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963662511420909">Qin and Brown, 2007</xref>). In the present investigation, we examined the gender difference in attitude towards crop-related genomic studies, and assessed the factors that contribute to this difference.</p>
<p>In this study, we aimed to examine the attitudes of Japanese people towards the promotion of genomic studies as applied to crops, and to explore the correlations among their attitudes, genomic literacy and other factors that could explain their attitude. In addition, we aimed to assess the factors that could explain the gender difference in attitude to genomic crop studies.</p>

<title>Respondents</title>
<p>In all, 4,000 people were surveyed in this study (age range, 20–69 years); they were selected from the general population via a stratified two-phase sampling method. The survey was performed using mailed questionnaires during November and December 2005.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0963662511420909">
<title>Questionnaires</title>
<p>The questionnaires were developed in accordance with the British Social Attitude Survey, the Eurobarometer Survey, and the Biotechnologies and Public Opinion in Italy. To measure scientific literacy, the survey instrument was based on an international scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963662511420909">Miller, 1998</xref>). It also used a scale for measuring genetics literacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963662511420909">Furr and Kelly, 1999</xref>). To examine context validity, the questionnaires were developed with assistance from genome researchers and science communicators. Preliminary investigations were performed targeting the general public and university students. The contents and expression of the items were revised based on the results.</p>
<p>We developed questionnaires that dealt with the following topics:</p>
<sec id="section5-0963662511420909">
<title>Respondent characteristics</title>
<p>We selected nine sociodemographic factors for evaluation: gender, age, marital status, whether respondents had a child or children, whether they lived with their family, type of housing, occupation, annual household income, and education.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963662511420909">Shamos (1995)</xref> considered scientific literacy to have three dimensions: cultural, functional, and “true” scientific literacy.

<p>Type 1: Knowledge of genomic terminology (subjective understanding). “Genome,” “gene,” “DNA,” “chromosome,” and “recombinant DNA technique” were selected as basic genomics terms. Respondents were asked whether they understood the meaning of each of these terms. The Cronbach’s α for five items was .856.</p>
<p>Type 2: “Contextual understanding” of genomic terminology (objective understanding). Respondents were given five sentences, each containing one of the above genomics terms. They were asked to determine whether the sentences were scientifically correct. The Cronbach’s α for five items was .654.</p>
<p>Type 3: Awareness of the benefits and risks of genomic studies. This study assessed public understanding of the relationship between genomic studies and society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963662511420909">Macer (1994)</xref> suggested that a social evaluation of genetic technology is based on a type of cognitive structure that consists of an awareness of the benefits and risks of biotechnology and genetic engineering. The respondents in the present study were presented with three sentences of each of the two types of awareness (six in total) regarding the benefits and risks of genomic studies as applied to crops. For example, one of the sentences regarding benefits was, “Genomic crop studies are useful for people’s health.” An example sentence regarding risk was, “The safety of genomic studies applied to crops has not been confirmed.” Respondents were asked how they perceived each sentence and were instructed to respond with one of the following six pre-coded responses: “agree,” “slightly agree,” “slightly disagree,” “disagree,” “neutral,” and “don’t know.” To develop these sentences on benefits and risks, items in surveys including Biotechnologies and Public Opinion in Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511420909">Bucchi and Neresini, 2004</xref>) and “Attitude survey on genetic recombination technology, farm products and foods” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963662511420909">STAFF, 2004</xref>) were referred to. The Cronbach’s α for six items was .755.</p>
<p>Reliability analyses were performed for each type of investigation item and for all items. The Cronbach’s α for all 16 items was .788. Consequently, while α of type 2 was rather low, the Cronbach’s α indicated sufficient internal consistency for the 16 items of this genomic literacy measurement.</p>

<title>Opinions on the promotion of genomic studies</title>
<p>Respondents were asked their opinions on the promotion of crop- and medicine-related genomic studies, and on the promotion of basic genome research. In this paper, we are chiefly discussing the data collected regarding respondents’ opinions on the promotion of genomic crop studies and comparing those with the data we obtained on opinions on the promotion of genomic medical studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0963662511420909">
<title>Other factors</title>
<p>We selected 11 factors that were thought to have a relation with public decision making and genomic literacy. These comprised learning experience, attitude and knowledge towards science in general, interest in genomic studies, willingness to purchase GM rice, perception of current states of public opinion, current information sources, and credible information sources (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0963662511420909">Table 3</xref>). A fundamental scientific term (“food chain”) and a relatively new term (“dioxin”) were used to assess the level of general scientific knowledge. The subjective and objective understanding of the participants was assessed using the method described above.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<sec id="section10-0963662511420909">
<title>Genomic literacy score</title>
<p>For each item, a respondent’s level of subjective understanding was coded as 2 (“know the meaning of the term”), 1 (“aware of the term”), or 0 (“never heard of the term”); the aggregate score ranged from 0 to 10. Similarly, the respondent’s level of objective understanding was coded as 1 (“correct”) or 0 (“incorrect” or “don’t know”), with an aggregate score of 0 to 5. When a respondent demonstrated awareness of the benefits and risks of genomic studies related to crops, a score of 1 was assigned; when no awareness was demonstrated (i.e. when the respondent chose “don’t know”), a score of 0 was assigned. The reason for this scoring was as follows. We hypothesized that respondents who answered “don’t know” could not decide whether genomic study was beneficial, risky, or neutral because they were not sufficiently literate or informed to make a judgement. Since there were six sentences, the total score ranged from 0 to 6. Finally, each score was converted to 10 points, to equalize the weight of each of the point totals; consequently, the final score for genomic literacy ranged from 0 (lowest) to 30 (highest).</p>
<p>For the validity of genomic literacy measurement, mean scores of literacy may operate as the data for assessing the construct validity. People with higher levels of education showed a significantly higher literacy score (based on one-way analysis of variance, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), as did people with higher annual household income (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Similarly, people in the professions also obtained a higher score than blue-collar workers and the unemployed (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Furthermore, a strong correlation was observed between respondents’ general scientific knowledge score and their genomic literacy score (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0963662511420909">Table 3</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The score for genomic literacy significantly related to the factors which we expected it to be related to, confirming construct validity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0963662511420909">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Three analyses were performed (<italic>A, B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>). There were significant differences between the genders, in terms of genomic literacy and opinions regarding the promotion of genomic crop studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963662511420909">Table 2</xref>); analyses were therefore stratified by gender.</p>

<p><italic>A</italic>) <italic>Comparison of the mean scores of genomic literacy</italic>: The mean and standard deviation of the genomic literacy score were calculated for each factor, and a <italic>t</italic>-test or one-way analysis of variance was used to compare the difference of the mean scores of respondents classified as follows. Responses for factors regarding experience, attitude to science, interest, willingness and perception, included two categories: “yes” and “no, neutral, or don’t know” (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0963662511420909">Table 3</xref>). Current and credible information source questions had multiple answers. Therefore, these factors were analysed for each option. The score for general scientific knowledge was divided into three groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0963662511420909">Table 3</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>B</italic>) <italic>Univariate analysis; factors related to the approval of genomic studies promotion</italic>: Opinions on the promotion of genomic studies were categorized as “agree” or “disagree or cannot decide.” Logistical regression analyses were performed, using these categories as criterion variables and each factor (9 sociodemographic factors and 11 other factors) as an explanatory variable. As for information sources, each option was analysed as an explanatory variable. The odds ratio (OR) plays an important role in logistic regression analysis. OR greater than 1 indicates that the condition is likely to occur in that group compared to the other group. OR less than 1 indicates that the condition is less likely to occur in that group compared to the other group.</p>
<p><italic>C</italic>) <italic>Multivariate analysis; relationship between attitudes towards the promotion of genomic studies and genomic literacy</italic>: Opinions on the pros and cons of genomic studies promotion were categorized into two groups as described in <italic>B</italic>). A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed using these categories as criterion variables and the quartile scores of genomic literacy acted as explanatory variables. These variables were used as covariates. Univariate analysis revealed significant differences in these variables, but strong correlations (<italic>r</italic> &gt; .30) were observed between them (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0963662511420909">Table 4</xref>). A correlation analysis among the genomic literacy score and other factors had been performed previously to determine the covariates.</p>

<title>Responses</title>
<p>There were 2,171 responses; the overall response rate was 54.3% (51.1% males and 58.6% females). The response rates, by age, were as follows: 41.9% of 20–29 year olds, 58.4% of 30–39 year olds, 59.7% of 40–49 year olds, 53.2% of 50–59 year olds, and 57.9% of 60–69 year olds. The response rate was higher among females than males, and was highest in the 40–49-year-old group.</p>

<sec id="section14-0963662511420909">
<title>Level of genomic literacy</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0963662511420909">Table 1</xref>, the evaluation of subjective understanding revealed that the lowest percentage of respondents (14.9%) answered, “I know the meaning of the term genome”; 54.8% answered, “I have heard of the term genome”; and 30.3% answered, “I have never heard of the term genome.” Of all the listed terms, the greatest number of respondents were unfamiliar with the term “genome.” The evaluation of objective understanding revealed that the percentage of correct answers to each question ranged from 12.7% to 71.9%, indicating that the response to each question item differed considerably. The last type of items pertained to awareness of the benefits and risks of genomic crop studies, and more than 88.8% of the respondents had an opinion on each of the questions.</p>
<p>The average score of genomic literacy was 20.1, and the standard deviation was 5.0. Males and females had average scores of 20.4 and 19.8, respectively; a <italic>t</italic>-test revealed a significant difference between them, with <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963662511420909">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of the average scores compared by sociodemographic factors (<italic>Statistical analysis A</italic>) were as follows. We observed score differences among occupations, annual household income, and education, in both males and females. The average genomic literacy scores were higher among people with professional careers, higher annual incomes, and more schooling (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Furthermore, the scores differed with respect to the resident status in males (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and to age (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and to the presence of a child (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) in females. The average scores of other factors (experience, attitude to science, interest, willingness, perception and information sources) and <italic>p</italic> values are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0963662511420909">Table 3</xref>. There were no differences in the willingness to purchase GM rice, trust in information from the government, and trust in information from television for either males or females. There were differences in the average literacy score for information obtained from classes at school, newspapers or journals, the Internet, scientists at institutes or university, and industrial enterprises in males.</p>
<p>The responses for factors related to experience, attitude to science, interest, willingness, perception and information sources in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0963662511420909">Table 3</xref>, revealed a difference between males and females in both number and percentage. On the basis of a χ<sup>2</sup> test, males were significantly more likely to respond “Yes” for the following variables: “liked to study science at school” (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); “interested in science” (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); “think scientific development has more advantages than disadvantages” (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); “would like to use new products” (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); “interested in genomic crop study” (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); “currently obtain information via newspapers, books or journals (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), television or radio (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), internet (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), or outreach activity (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01)”; and “trust in information from government (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and the internet (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).”</p>
<p>Conversely, females were significantly more likely to respond “Yes” for the following variables: “currently obtain information via family or friends” (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); “never heard of genomics” (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); and “trust in information from scientists” (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). In brief, males had significantly more positive attitudes towards science in general, were interested in genomics, and obtained information via various forms of media. As the results of the <italic>t</italic>-test reveal, all of these factors showed significantly higher average genomic literacy scores except for the factor “trust in information from government” (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0963662511420909">Table 3</xref>). In contrast, females were significantly more likely to obtain information from people close to them and to trust in scientists.</p>

<title>Opinions on the promotion of genomic studies</title>
<p>Survey responses regarding opinions towards genomic studies promotion are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963662511420909">Table 2</xref>. Fifty per cent of participants approved of the promotion of genomic studies related to crops while 6.7% disapproved. A further 43.3% were undecided. A gender split shows that this promotion was approved by 56.6% of males and 44.5% of females. Opinions on the issue of genomic studies applied to medicine are also shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0963662511420909">Table 2</xref>. The promotion of these medical studies was approved by 69.4% of the people and disapproved of by 1.3%, while 29.3% were undecided. Males were more likely than females to approve of the promotion of both crop and medical studies (χ<sup>2</sup> test; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p>In the results of logistical regression analyses for sociodemographic factors (<italic>Statistical analysis B</italic>), differences in attitudes among males were shown in part on occupation, partly on variation in annual household income, and level of education. Among females, differences were shown based in part on age group, and partly on variation in annual household income. For other factors, differences in attitudes were observed in males on the basis of all eleven factors. In females, differences were observed in nine factors, with the exceptions being “liked to study science at school” and “know people have an opinion on genomic studies.”</p>

<p>Results of the logistical regression analyses are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0963662511420909">Table 4</xref>. A multivariate analysis (<italic>Statistical analysis C</italic>) was adjusted for the eleven factors described in table note (d). The covariant of the analysis was selected based on univariate analyses and the correlation analyses mentioned above in the section on statistical analysis.</p>
<p>For univariate analysis, OR for the highest quartile of score versus the lowest quartile was 2.47 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.67–3.65) for males and 1.98 (95% CI, 1.37–2.84) for females. Genomic literacy and positive attitude were correlated, for both males and females. We observed a particularly strong correlation in males.</p>
<p>However, the results of the multivariate analysis showed no significant difference between genomic literacy score and positive attitude (adjusted OR for the highest quartile of score versus the lowest was 1.16 for males and 1.24 for females; 95% CI, 0.66–2.04 for males and 0.76–2.04 for females).</p>
<p>Otherwise, there were some views that demonstrated a strong correlation with attitude. These included “I think that scientific development has more advantages than disadvantages” (adjusted OR, 2.42 for males and 2.01 for females; 95% CI, 1.58–3.68 for males and 1.44–2.80 for females). Also showing this strong correlation were “I am interested in genomic studies applied to crops” (adjusted OR, 3.18 for males and 2.56 for females; 95% CI, 2.21–4.27 for males and 1.85–3.56 for females), and “I would like to purchase GM rice if it were developed as a medical supply” (adjusted OR, 8.44 for males and 7.28 for females; 95% CI, 5.88–11.27 for males and 5.32–9.97 for females). For source of information, current information sources did not show significant correlation between attitudes. Believing that “industrial enterprises” were a credible source of information was correlated with attitude (adjusted OR, 2.70 for males and 1.88 for females; 95% CI, 1.48–4.92 for males and 1.13–3.12 for females). At the same time, considering “classes at school” and “scientists at institutes or university” as credible information sources was related to a favourable attitude towards promotion of studies in males, but not for females.</p>

<title>4. Discussion</title>
<p>In this investigation, we aimed to assess the attitudes of Japanese people towards the promotion of genomic crop studies by analysing data from our Attitude Survey on Genome Science. Furthermore, we aimed to explore the relationship among survey respondents’ attitudes, genomic literacy, and other factors associated with their attitudes. In addition, we aimed to assess the factors that could explain the gender differences in attitude to genomic crop studies. Below is a five-point discussion based on analysis of our results.</p>
<p>The first point to consider is public attitudes towards the promotion of genomic crop studies. Our results revealed that half of all respondents favoured this promotion, with males favouring it more highly than females in terms of both number and percentage. In terms of comparison in attitudes towards the research of genomics in crops and in medicine, people tended to have more positive attitudes towards genome research related to medicine than to crops. This is consistent with the findings of the Eurobarometer survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963662511420909">Gaskell et al., 2006</xref>) and the survey of Biotechnologies and Public Opinion in Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511420909">Bucchi and Neresini, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963662511420909">Calnan et al. (2005)</xref> suggested that public acceptance of a technology specifically depends on its perceived utility, people’s pragmatism in their assessments of technology, and whether they judge technologies “in context.” This may be why results from the present study showed that more than two-thirds of the Japanese public favoured the promotion of genomic research in medicine and half of the public favoured the promotion of genomic research in crops. While the data are not shown here, we observed in the present survey that people had better awareness of the benefits of genomic studies when applied to medicine than of those benefits associated with crops.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963662511420909">Bucchi and Neresini (2004)</xref> reported that 57.3% of people favoured the promotion of genome research into food biotechnologies. However, in our study only 50.0% of Japanese respondents approved of the promotion of genomic studies as applied to crops. While it is difficult to compare results from these two countries – largely because of differences in the research methods used – it seems that on this issue Japanese people are generally more conservative in their decision making. Additionally, the rates of people who disapproved of the promotion of genomic studies were 33.4% in Italy and 6.7% in Japan, and the undecided rates were 9.3% in Italy and 43.3% in Japan. In the present study, the attitudes of Japanese people were categorized as “agree” or “cannot decide.” Thus it seems that the general public in Japan is less likely than its Italian counterpart to make a decision on the issue of promoting genomic crop studies. The same tendency towards a prudent attitude was explored in the field of medical genomic research in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511420909">Ishiyama et al., 2008</xref>) and previous national representative opinion surveys concerning gestational surrogacy in Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0963662511420909">Suzuki et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662511420909">Jallinoja and Aro (2000)</xref> conducted a survey among Finns on attitudes to genetic testing which revealed that people with a low level of knowledge had greater difficulties in declaring their opinion on attitude-related statements. According to this observation, Japanese people’s insufficient genomic literacy might have caused these cautious attitudes towards innovative technologies. The other possible reasons are a high level of unfamiliarity with the subject or ambivalence in their attitudes, as pointed to in an investigation which analysed data of a Dutch consumer panel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511420909">Henneman et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The second point relates to genomic literacy scoring. A mean score of 20.1 (scores ranged from a low of 0 to a high of 30) suggested the level of genomic literacy among Japanese people might not be adequate to argue the ethical, legal, and social implications of genome science from their own perspectives based on genomic literacy. The National Institute of Science and Technology Policy (NISTP) in Japan reported the level of scientific literacy was lower in Japan than in 15 American and European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963662511420909">NISTP, 2001</xref>). The results of the present investigation might therefore be consistent with the evidence from the NISTP.</p>
<p>Our results also revealed that the level of genomic literacy differed with respect to a range of sociodemographic factors, learning experience, attitude to and knowledge about science in general, interest in genomic studies, perception of current states of public opinion, current information sources, and credible information sources. The results of the present study supported the results of a survey of the Dutch public which indicated that factors such as younger age, high education level, being a professional, and familiarity with the issue were positively associated with knowledge about genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963662511420909">Henneman et al., 2004</xref>). However, there were differences between that study and our present study. For example, our finding that females having a child, or children, had a lower genomic literacy level differed from that found in the Dutch study data. Moreover, female gender was reported to be positively associated with the level of genomic literacy in the Netherlands; by contrast, the present study revealed that genomic literacy level was higher in males. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963662511420909">Shaw and Bassi (2001)</xref> reported that males and females performed equally well on scientific knowledge questions. Each country has its own history, culture, and social systems, and the differences mentioned above might be explained by these social factors.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, in the present study, willingness to purchase GM rice, trust in government and television were not related to the level of genomic literacy in either men or women. This suggests that genomic literacy and a willingness to purchase GM rice were not related. Furthermore, people with various literacy levels trusted information from the government and television. In addition, people with a high literacy level were likely to trust in classes at school, newspapers or journals, the internet, and scientists.</p>
<p>The third point considers the relationship between genomic literacy and attitude towards the promotion of genomic crop studies. In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963662511420909">Ishiyama et al., 2008</xref>), we found that members of the general public with high genomic literacy scores tended to support medicine-related genomic studies. In the present investigation, the same tendency was observed in univariate analysis. For multivariate analysis, there was no significant difference between literacy score and positive attitude. This result is consistent with that of a Finnish attitude survey which revealed that there was no simple relationship between a greater knowledge of genetics and a favourable attitude towards genetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963662511420909">Jallinoja and Aro, 2000</xref>). These results indicate that the relationship between people’s genomic literacy and attitudes towards genomic studies may vary according to the scientific field in which the studies are applied.</p>
<p>The fourth point concerns the relationship between trust and attitude towards the promotion of genomic crop studies. Results from the present investigation suggested that belief in science (a variant of the belief that scientific development has more advantages than disadvantages), interest in genomic crop studies, willingness to purchase GM rice, and trust in industrial enterprises were more closely related to people’s positive decision making than genomic literacy in the field of farm products. In addition, trust in scientists (including school teachers) was associated with a favourable attitude for males. This last finding was supported by the view that public uptake of science depends primarily upon the trust and credibility towards scientific experts, as illustrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0963662511420909">Wynne (1992)</xref>. A qualitative study that focused on lay understandings of GM food in the United Kingdom argued that concerns about GM food often centred on the perceived uncertainty of “expert” scientific knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963662511420909">Shaw, 2002</xref>). Stated another way, trust in information from “experts” might be associated with a positive attitude towards the use of genome research for application with crops. We are now in a position to consider that perceived certainty or uncertainty of “experts,” in our investigation called “scientists” might be related to public attitudes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963662511420909">Gutteling et al. (2006)</xref> analysed data from the Netherlands and found the higher the level of trust people have in government, the more they will have a positive attitude towards GM food. They are more likely to accept it, and are more optimistic about technological developments. However, in the present investigation, trust in information from government offices was not associated with a positive attitude towards the promotion of genomic crop studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963662511420909">Nisbet and Goidel (2007)</xref> analysed nationally representative survey data from the United States and found that the mass media provide an important part of the social context by which citizens judge controversial science. In the present study, we could not find an association between positive attitude and mass media (newspaper, journal, television or radio). Our study did not have enough evidence to explain these findings. Thus further investigation is needed to explore the social context. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963662511420909">Hess (2011)</xref> demonstrated that research into the public deficit model was often based on assumptions of individualism and lay knowledge, suggesting subordinate networks in diverse social fields and “dissensus conferences” as possible policy innovations.</p>
<p>The last point of discussion we wish to raise concerns gender-based differences in literacy scores and attitudes towards genomic crop studies. In the present study, there were differing gender results for the level of genomic literacy, opinions on the promotion of genomic crop studies, and factors related to the literacy score and approval of studies. Our data showed that males tended to have more positive attitudes towards science and technology in general, and obtain information via various forms of media. This may explain why the literacy scores were higher in males. In addition, we found that females tended to obtain information via family or friends but males did not. Also, people who trusted citizens’ groups had a higher genomic literacy level in females but males did not. The gender difference indicated in the present study might be noteworthy.</p>
<p>With regard to attitudes towards genomic crop studies, only for males did trust in information from scientists at school, institutes or university tend to positively influence favourable attitude. Trust in information from industrial enterprises was strongly related to a favourable attitude in males. That is, trust in scientists and enterprises might contribute to males’ more favourable attitudes towards genomic studies as applied to crops.</p>
<p>Gender differences in attitude have been explored in previous research that examined Japanese public attitudes towards innovative assisted reproductive technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963662511420909">Minai et al., 2007</xref>) and attitudes towards genetically engineered salmon in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511420909">Qin and Brown, 2008</xref>) as well as the attitudes towards biotechnology using the Eurobarometer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662511420909">Simon, 2010</xref>). These three investigations all found that women had significantly more negative attitudes than men. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963662511420909">Qin and Brown (2008)</xref> said that attitudinal male/female differences could be attributed to women’s lower levels of trust in government agencies and scientific organizations. Conversely, in the present study trust in government was lower among females, but trust in scientists at institutes or universities was higher in females than males; also, these findings were not related to a positive attitude. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662511420909">Simon (2010)</xref> said that for men, increased knowledge of biotechnology decreased their probability of being pessimistic about science, whereas for women more knowledge of biotechnology actually leads to the opposite: a greater probability of being pessimistic. In our study, higher genomic literacy levels were related to a positive attitude towards medical research, but were not related towards the same positive attitude when it came to crop-related genomic research for either males or females. We do not have the evidence to interpret this inconsistency among countries in the present study. However, differing social backgrounds in each country must be considered as one of the reasons to explain these different findings. Nevertheless, we take the view that “the results complicate the deficit model of social support for science, which posits that more knowledge of science always leads to more positive attitudes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963662511420909">Simon, 2010</xref>: 642).</p>
<p>The present study has some limitations. The cross-sectional design of this study does not allow causation to be clarified. Longitudinal or interventional studies are thus required to assess any attitudinal changes and to identify the causal association. Moreover, the low response rates among males and young people need to be taken into account. Regarding the measurement of genomic literacy, objective questionnaires should be formulated to improve reliability.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, our study explored public attitudes towards the promotion of genomic crop studies and revealed correlations among belief, interest, willingness, trust, and a favourable attitude. This was done by analysing the data of the Attitude Survey on Genome Science, which was the first large-scale opinion poll in Japan to include questions on the application of genome research for medicine and crops.</p>
<p>Further research could explore citizens’ attitudinal change over 5 years by comparing data from three surveys conducted at three time points over a 5-year period. To deepen our understanding, we should also study the potential relationship among individuals, social background and social networks.</p>

<title>5. Conclusion</title>
<p>We conducted the Attitude Survey on Genome Science. This was the first large-scale opinion poll aimed at assessing Japanese citizens’ attitudes towards genomic studies, including its application in medicine and to crops. Survey results showed that 50.0% of respondents approved of the promotion of crop-related genomic studies, while 6.7% disapproved. No correlation was found between the level of genomic literacy scores and favourable attitude towards crop-related genomic studies promotion. The relationship between people’s genomic literacy level and favourable attitudes towards genomic studies promotion may vary according to the scientific field in which the studies are applied. Belief that scientific development has more advantages than disadvantages, interest in genomic crop studies, willingness to purchase new products, and trust in information from industrial enterprises were more closely related to people’s positive attitudes towards genomic studies promotion than genomic literacy in the field of farm products. There were gender-based differences in literacy scores, attitudes towards genomic crop studies and factors related to the literacy score and approval of studies. Males tended to have more positive attitudes towards science and technology in general and obtain information via various forms of media. This may explain why the literacy scores were higher in males. Trust in information from scientists tended to positively influence favourable attitude, only for males. This may explain why males have more favourable attitudes towards genomic studies as applied to crops.</p>
