<body>
<p>Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, with an estimated global incidence of 533,100 new cases including more than 40,000 people in the United States diagnosed annually.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812436648">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812436648"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812436648">3</xref></sup> During the past 20 years, treatments for HNSCC have gradually evolved to combining surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Cisplatin is one of the most frequently used chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of HNSCC, and the antitumor activity is dependent on its ability to cross the cell membrane. A combined multimodality approach, including the addition of conventional chemotherapy (eg, cisplatin) to radiation, has improved disease outcomes but with significant patient morbidity and an increase in treatment-related deaths.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812436648">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812436648">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>More recent advancements in therapies for HNSCC have emerged since the identification of new molecular targets that are specific for head and neck carcinomas. One of these new targets includes the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR is a tyrosine kinase receptor that has been found highly expressed in HNSCC and has been associated with more advanced disease and less favorable outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812436648">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812436648">7</xref></sup> These discoveries led to the development of novel therapeutics such as cetuximab, which is a monoclonal antibody that enters the tumor and targets the extracellular domain of EGFR. Study results have shown modest outcome improvements in HNSCC treated with cetuximab, especially when used in combination with radiotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812436648">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite advancements in the treatment of HNSCC with novel targeted therapeutics and combined treatment regimens, toxicities still contribute significantly to patient morbidity. The toxic drugs pose limitations on treatment by exerting their effects on normal tissue, resulting in toxicities and dose-limiting side effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812436648">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812436648">10</xref></sup> There is a need for combined treatment regimens with nonoverlapping toxicities or treatment regimens that increase drug delivery and uptake in diseased tissues while sparing normal tissue.</p>
<p>Recently, a technique known as microbubble-mediated ultrasound therapy (MB-UST) has been explored in other cancer types as a potential modality to locally enhance drug delivery at the tumor site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812436648">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812436648"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812436648">13</xref></sup> Microbubbles (MBs) are ultrasound contrast agents that function as intravascular tracers. They are made of a protein, starch, lipid, or polymer shell filled with inert gas. Definity MBs are commercially available and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for cardiac outflow applications. It is known that exposure of MBs to a properly timed ultrasound field results in mechanical oscillations that can disrupt nearby endothelial cell membranes and temporarily enhance vascular permeability. It is hypothesized that MB-UST increases permeability of cells by the membrane disruption induced by MB-UST, thereby allowing intracellular uptake of exogenous membrane-impermeable molecules. The treatment of HNSCC with adjuvant MB-UST may subsequently enhance the antitumor effectiveness of chemotherapeutic and biologically targeted treatment by increasing cell permeability and tumor uptake of chemotherapeutic agents, resulting in enhanced drug delivery to diseased tissue while minimizing the harmful systemic side effects of the toxic drugs.</p>

<title>Cell Lines, Culture, and Transformation Methods</title>
<p>This work was approved by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The head and neck cancer cell lines SCC-1, SCC-5, Cal27, and FaDu were grown and maintained under appropriate culture conditions using proper aseptic techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812436648">14</xref></sup> Cell lines were maintained in DMEM, 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% Pen/Strep (Sigma, St Louis, MO). Cells were grown at 37°C, with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 90% relative humidity. All cells were cultured to 70% to 90% confluence before passage. Appropriate cell numbers for in vitro assays were determined using flow cytometry (Accuri C6; Accuri Cytometers Inc, Ann Arbor, MI). The FaDu cell line was established from a squamous cell carcinoma of the pharynx (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The SCC-1 cell line was established from a squamous cell carcinoma from the floor of the mouth, and the SCC-5 cell line was established from a primary tumor of the supraglottis. The SCC-1 and SCC-5 cell lines were provided by Thomas Carey, PhD, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</p>
<p>The SCC-1 cell line was chosen for transfection with a lentivirus containing both puromycin resistance and luciferase genes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812436648">15</xref></sup> Briefly, SCC-1 cells were plated in a 24-well plate 24 hours prior to viral infection at a density of 0.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in 0.5 mL of complete DMEM medium (with serum and antibiotics). Lentivirus was thawed in a 37°C water bath and prepared in a mixture of complete medium with Polybren (concentration of 5 µg/mL). Media were aspirated from plate wells and replaced with 0.5 mL of this prewarmed Polybrene/media mixture per well (for the 24-well plate). Cells were infected by adding 10 µL of viral stock. The infected target cells were selected for stable expression using puromycin. Luciferase expression was assessed by Xenogen 200 series IVIS photon counter (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkington, MA) after adding 150 µg/mL D-luciferin (Gold Biotechnology, St Louis, MO) in the culture medium. Puromycin selection pressure was used to generate stable SCC-1 cell lines.</p>

<title>In Vitro Ultrasound Therapy and Luciferin Uptake</title>
<p>MB-UST was administered in vitro under conditions previously described by Sorace et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812436648">13</xref></sup> Briefly, 50 µL of activated microbubbles (concentration of 14 million MBs/mL; Definity, Lantheus Medical Imaging, Billerica, MA) was added to cells grown in acoustically transparent flasks (Opticell, Rochester, NY). Immediately after administration of MBs, flasks were inverted and immersed in a water bath at 37°C opposite a 0.75-inch immersion transducer (Olympus, Waltham, MA) in series with a signal generator (AFG3022B; Tektronix, Beaverton, OR) and power amplifier (A075; Electronics and Innovation, Rochester, NY). Cells were exposed to an ultrasound field for 5 minutes at a transient frequency of 1.0 MHz, a mechanical index of 0.5, a pulse repetition period of 0.01 seconds, and a duty cycle of 20%.</p>
<p>To look at luciferin uptake, SCC-1 cells expressing the luciferase gene were grown on acoustically transparent flasks. After 24 hours, 30 µg luciferin was added. MB-UST was administered to half of the flasks. Control flasks were administered MBs and subjected to the same conditions, but ultrasound was not used. Luciferase expression was assessed again using the Xenogen photo counter.</p>

<sec id="section4-0194599812436648">
<title>In Vitro Cellular Uptake and Viability</title>
<p>Cisplatin (NovaPLUS, Irving, TX) was conjugated to an Alexa680 fluorphore (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) by separation column chromatography, while cetuximab (Imclone, New York, NY) was conjugated to Cy5.5. MBs were administered to plated cells (1 × 10<sup>6</sup>) using combination MB-UST and 10 µM cisplatin or 10 µM cetuximab therapy. Control cells underwent no therapy, monotherapy with cisplatin, cetuximab, or UST alone. Following a 24-hour incubation period, cells were washed using phosphate-buffered saline and assessed for fluorescence using an Olympus 1X70 microscope (Olympus American, Melville, NY).</p>
<p>After treatment, SCC-1, SCC-5, FaDu, and Cal27 cells were trypsinized and stained for viability and death using calcein AM and propidium iodide (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cells were then stained with 1.0 µL of working calcein-AM stock (50 µL) and incubated for 15 minutes in 37°C. After incubation, 2.0 µL of 0.5 mg/mL propidium iodide was added. Cells were analyzed for viability by fluorescence counts (10k event) using flow cytometry. All experimental groups were analyzed in triplicate.</p>

<sec id="section5-0194599812436648">
<title>In Vivo Ultrasound Therapy</title>
<p>Athymic female nude mice (6 weeks old) were obtained (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). SCC-5 cells (2 × 10<sup>6</sup>) were implanted in the left flank of 30 mice. Three weeks postimplant, mice were sorted into the following 6 groups (n = 5): no treatment (control), UST alone, 10 µM cisplatin, 100 µM cetuximab, 10 µM cisplatin + UST, and 100 µM cetuximab + UST. All reagents were delivered by intravenous tail vein injection. UST consisted of administering 100 µL of MBs (Definity) followed by US exposure in a 37°C water bath using the setup described in the in vitro methods but with a pulse repetition period of 5 seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812436648"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812436648">13</xref></sup> The control group received 100 µL saline injections. Mice remained under isoflurane anesthesia for the entirety of the experiment. Therapy occurred twice weekly for 4 weeks and was followed by weight and digital caliper measurements of tumor size. On days 0, 14, and 28, tumors were assessed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI; Bruker 9.4T MR, Bruker Corp, Billerica, MA). On day 28, animals were euthanized and tumors excised for histological analysis.</p>

<title>Immunohistologic Analysis</title>
<p>Serial sections of 5-µm thickness from tumor samples were cut from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks and floated onto charged glass slides (Super-Frost Plus; Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Antigen retrieval was performed with 0.01 M Tris-1 mM EDTA buffer (pH 9) using a pressure cooker. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. After blocking, all slides were then incubated at 4°C overnight with either Ki67, TUNEL, or CD31 antibody. Negative controls were achieved by eliminating the primary antibodies from the diluents. Following washing with TBST, peroxidase-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (for CD31, TUNEL, and Ki67; 1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) was applied to the sections for 30 minutes at room temperature. Diaminobenzidine (Scy Tek Laboratories, Logan, UT) was used as the chromagen and hematoxylin (7211; Richard-Allen Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI) as the counterstain.</p>

<title>MB-Mediated Ultrasound Therapy Disrupts Cell Membranes In Vitro</title>
<p>Transmembrane migration of a small molecule, luciferin (the substrate for luciferase), was used to determine the amount of disruption of cell membranes. Enhanced luciferin uptake following MB-UST was demonstrated with a luciferase-positive SCC-1 head and neck cancer cell line. Comparison of luciferase expression between the control and therapy groups showed a 41% increase in luciferin uptake in cells receiving MB-UST as compared with control (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812436648"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). In vitro results also demonstrated that adjuvant MB-UST can increase intracellular drug concentrations of fluorescently labeled cisplatin and cetuximab. Cetuximab with adjuvant MB-UST demonstrated a 28% intracellular increase compared with treatment with cetuximab in the absence of MB-UST (<italic>P</italic> = .01). Cisplatin with adjuvant MB-UST revealed a 9% increase over control counterparts without MB-UST (<italic>P</italic> = .67; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812436648"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>After determining that MB-UST can disrupt cell membranes and the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin and cetuximab with adjuvant MB-UST by examining cellular apoptosis in 4 HNSCC cell lines in vitro (SCC-1, SCC-5, FaDu, and Cal27), a dose curve for one cell line was established. Results showed that adjuvant MB-UST enhances the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin and cetuximab in all 4 head and neck cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599812436648"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>). Fluorescent images of propidium iodine–stained SCC-5 cells showed qualitative analysis of viable and dead cells. The representative images showed increased fluorescent red expression (dead cells), signifying an increased amount of apoptosis when using adjuvant MB-UST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599812436648"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>). Enhanced drug uptake in SCC-5 cells resulted in a significant leftward shift in the dose-response curves. This shift was greatest at the 1-µM dose for cisplatin and 10-µM dose of cetuximab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599812436648"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>In Vivo Drug Uptake</title>
<p>In vivo treatment of xenografted tumors using MB-UST demonstrated an inhibition of tumor growth in comparison to animals receiving chemotherapeutic drug (cisplatin or cetuximab) alone, MB-UST alone, or no treatment (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Mice that underwent MB-UST alone revealed no significant difference in tumor size following treatment when compared with untreated controls (<italic>P</italic> = .81).

<title>DW-MRI</title>
<p>Intratumoral apoptosis and early-phase cell wall disruption was assessed per tumor volume from the adjusted diffusion coefficient (ADC) values obtained from DW-MRI on days 0, 14, and 28. ADC values are known to correspond to disruption of cell membranes and release of free water into the tumor mass and can be used as an early predictor of response to therapy in HNSCC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812436648">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812436648">16</xref></sup> Significant increases in ADC values were found in tumors treated with cetuximab and adjuvant MB-UST from cetuximab alone (<italic>P</italic> = .001) and cisplatin and adjuvant MB-UST and cisplatin alone (<italic>P</italic> = .001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0194599812436648"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Currently the overall effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents is determined by their ability to penetrate tissues and cross cell membranes. This effectiveness is compromised by insufficient delivery of drug to the tumor microenvironment and by the side effects of delivering the drug to normal tissues. Our current studies show that adjuvant MB-UST can increase the efficacy of HNSCC chemotherapeutics, such as cetuximab and cisplatin. This technique may be leveraged to adjust dosing of conventional and targeted therapeutics to allow treatment with subtherapeutic drug concentrations and therefore decrease toxicity. As MB-UST is a localized treatment like radiation and surgery, it can be used on any disease that is localized. The effects of MB-UST allow a site-specific method to increase drug uptake, and the localized nature of treatment also means localized toxicity.</p>
<p>MB-UST may increase the therapeutic efficacy of these agents by causing a transient increase in tumor permeability and therefore increase the uptake of exogenous molecules into the tumor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812436648">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812436648">17</xref></sup> This application has also been shown to be effective in the delivery of small molecules and genetic material into cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812436648">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812436648">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812436648">19</xref></sup> The proposed mechanism of action is through mechanical vibration of MBs using US, whereby membrane disruption and tumor permeability are temporarily induced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812436648">20</xref></sup> This effect has been demonstrated previously by increased cellular uptake of small fluorescent molecules and labeled chemotherapeutic agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812436648">19</xref></sup> In the current in vitro experiments, we were able to use a membrane-impermeable fluorescent molecule to demonstrate the effects that MB-UST has on extracellular small-molecule uptake. Results show that MB-UST was sufficient to increase molecule uptake by showing a 41% increase in luciferase expression secondary to an increase in membrane permeability.</p>
<p>In vitro results also show that MB-UST increases the uptake of 2 fluorescently labeled drugs, cisplatin and cetuximab, resulting in an increase in drug delivery and apoptosis. The in vivo results suggest that adjuvant MB-UST has an additive effect with cetuximab and cisplatin, as demonstrated by a statistically significant reduction of tumor size in these treatment groups. The enhancement of cisplatin uptake with adjuvant MB-UST is possibly attributed to the transient porous membrane created by MB-UST, thereby facilitating more drug entry into the nucleus. The increased cytotoxicity seen with cetuximab and adjuvant MB-UST may be secondary to increased uptake in the tumor from the MB-UST–induced increase in vascular permeability or by changes in cell signaling. To assess the response to MB-UST, we investigated the use of DW-MRI as an imaging technique to assess tumors. In vivo data from DW-MRI analysis showed a statistically significant increase in ADC values associated with MB-UST treatment. These ADC values correlate with an increase in free water in the tumor secondary to a loss of cell wall integrity.</p>
<p>Combining different treatment modalities has been shown to improve locoregional control of HNSCC; however, at the same time, this can increase overall toxicity. In particular, it has been shown that the addition of cetuximab to either radiotherapy or cisplatin will potentiate the toxic effects of either therapy. We can overcome this limitation by delivering the drug only to the tumor itself by using site-specific MB-UST to enhance drug delivery into HNSCC cells. It has been shown in previous studies that MB-UST can be effective at delivering drugs and transferring genetic material into cells for potential treatment in breast, prostate, and colon cancer,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812436648">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812436648">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812436648"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599812436648">23</xref></sup> and we are now able to demonstrate this effect in HNSCC. The effect cannot be described as synergistic as MB-UST is not applicable to the synergy effects as described by Chou.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599812436648">24</xref></sup> We are outside of this statistical analysis since MB-UST alone without drug has no effect. However, MB-UST can produce an additive effect with nonoverlapping toxicity. In vitro studies show that we can use lower doses of a therapeutic agent and see a cytotoxicity profile similar to higher doses.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we show that MB-UST can be effective in increasing drug uptake and thereby apoptosis in HNSCC in vitro and in vivo. This application can allow the use subtherapeutic doses of cetuximab and cisplatin without reducing the clinical efficacy of the drugs. We also conclude from our imaging results that DW-MRI may be a potential tool for monitoring the response to combination MB-UST and drug therapy.</p>
