<p>Martial's <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic> celebrates spectacles at the Flavian amphitheatre, which was most likely built with money gained from the Judean War. This article contextualizes epigrams from Martial's <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic> with evidence from the histories of Josephus and other sources, finding possible references to the Judeans in specific epigrams with anthropomorphized animals. It also takes into consideration an epigram from the <italic>Florilegium Gallicum</italic>, which has been published at the end of the <italic>Liber</italic> since the sixteenth century. In the <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic>, Martial engages in a strategy of virtually silencing the Judean people—‘<italic>de Solymis</italic> … <italic>perustis</italic>’, as the poet says in <italic>Ep</italic>. 7.55—whose pillaged property built the Colosseum. This may, in part, be a result of the blending of epigrams from the reigns of both Titus and Domitian into a revised <italic>Liber</italic> featuring a single ‘Caesar’ who represents both emperors. Since Domitian never fought in the Judean War, Martial avoids—or has removed during revision—overt comments about victory in the Judean War. It is up to the reader, therefore, to find the Judeans quietly and ignominiously metamorphosed into animals to be punished in his text's arena, and finally, as losers who pay the price for rebellion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Martial's <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic> (or <italic>Book of Spectacles</italic>) celebrates the Flavian amphitheatre, later known as the Colosseum, and certain spectacles held there, including the magnificent inaugural events of 80 CE hosted by Titus and possibly ones held later by his younger brother and successor, Domitian. Titus had successfully besieged Jerusalem in 70 and became emperor after his father Vespasian's death in June of 79. Martial, however, is seemingly silent in the <italic>Liber</italic> about the Judean War (66–73) that brought Titus his greatest fame (as the depiction of the Jerusalem temple objects on the extant Arch of Titus makes clear) and that provided Vespasian at least some of the money necessary for rebuilding and improving Rome after the civil war of 69 had taken its toll on the capital.</p>
<p>New light was shed on the connection between the Flavian amphitheatre and the Judean War when Géza Alföldy deciphered a ghost inscription from the Colosseum<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0951820712467895">1</xref></sup> that firmly links the funding of the Colosseum's construction with booty (‘<italic>manubIs</italic>’)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0951820712467895">2</xref></sup> taken by the Romans under Vespasian and Titus in the Judean War.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0951820712467895">3</xref></sup> Fergus Millar, spurred by Alföldy's work, has described the Colosseum as one of the ‘Monuments of the Jewish War’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0951820712467895">4</xref></sup> Keith Hopkins and Mary Beard in 2005, however, cast doubt on Alföldy's reconstructed inscription, but they also affirm a connection between the Colosseum and the conquest of Jerusalem:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>A skeptical reader is likely to feel (as we do) that there is an uncomfortably long distance between the scatter of holes and the suspiciously appropriate solution to ‘joining the dots’. Nonetheless, inscribed text or no inscribed text, the underlying point remains. The Roman Colosseum was the fruit of the Roman victory over the Jews. It was, in effect, the Temple of Jerusalem transformed by Roman culture, rebuilt for popular pleasure and the ostentatious display of imperial power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0951820712467895">5</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>More recently, Kathleen Coleman has published a scholarly edition of Martial's <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic> with an introduction that includes a section on the Flavian amphitheatre based in part on the work of Alföldy and Millar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0951820712467895">6</xref></sup> Furthermore, Jodi Magness accepts Alföldy's reading without hesitation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0951820712467895">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet none of these scholars has contextualized a close reading of Martial's <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic> with the Flavian victory in the Judean War, about which the Judean Josephus wrote an account in his <italic>Bellum Judaicum</italic> from the 70s onward at Rome. We know from a number of his later (and much nastier) epigrams that Martial knew that Jerusalem had burned and that Judean immigrants, including writers like Josephus, had come to Rome.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0951820712467895">8</xref></sup> Overall, he paints an unflattering portrait of Judeans: Seth Schwartz sharply refers to ‘Martial's stable of burlesque Jewish and crypto-Jewish actors, poets, and deracinated urban debauchees’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0951820712467895">9</xref></sup> <italic>Epigram</italic> 7.35, for instance, takes a comic jab at Judean men when Martial's slave has ‘a true super-<italic>mentula</italic>, such as is typical of lustful, sexually potent Jews’, according to Dwora Gilula's interpretation of ‘<italic>sed meus, ut de me taceam, Laecania, servos</italic>| <italic>Iudaeum nuda sub cute pondus habet</italic>’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0951820712467895">10</xref></sup> In Martial's epigrams mentioning Judean men, the humor at their expense revolves around their circumcised <italic>mentulae</italic> (7.30, 7.55, 7.82, and 11.94). In 7.55, the poetic narrator goes so far as to threaten a man named Chrestus that if he plays around with other men, he will end up performing <italic>fellatio</italic> not on the narrator's <italic>mentula</italic>, which is nice and small, but on one from burned down Jerusalem that is condemned now to paying tribute (7.55.6–8: ‘<italic>lingues non mihi—nam proba et pusilla est-/sed quae de Solymis venit perustis/damnatam modo mentulam tributis</italic>’; we shall return to this issue of financial penalties for Judeans after the war).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0951820712467895">11</xref></sup> For Chrestus to end up servicing a defeated Judean would be a true degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0951820712467895">12</xref></sup> Meanwhile, in other epigrams, Judean women are said to have bad breath from fasting on the Sabbath (4.4), while Judean children make noise in Rome after being trained by their mothers to beg (12.57).</p>
<p>Though a few of Martial's epigrams denigrate Judeans, one in particular shows the importance of Judea for Flavian propaganda; 2.2 proclaims:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Creta dedit magnum, maius dedit Africa nomen</italic>,</p>
<p><italic>Scipio quod victor quodque Metellus habet</italic>;</p>
<p><italic>nobilius domito tribuit Germania Rheno</italic>,</p>
<p><italic>et puer hoc dignus nomine, Caesar, eras</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>frater Idumaeos meruit cum patre triumphos</italic>,</p>
<p><italic>quae datur ex Chattis laurea, tota tua est</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0951820712467895">13</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Victory over Judea (‘<italic>Idumaeos</italic>’) earned Vespasian (‘<italic>patre</italic>’) and Titus (‘<italic>frater</italic>’) a triumph (in 71 CE), but Domitian (called here both ‘<italic>puer</italic>’ and ‘<italic>Caesar</italic>’) gets his glory—not shared with his father or brother—from victory over the Chatti (from which he took the name Germanicus in 83).</p>
<p>Given that Martial's later epigrams show an awareness of the existence of Judeans and the fate of their homeland at the hands of the Roman army under Vespasian and Titus, it is possible that we can read his earlier <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic> not only as a highly polished laudatory piece in honor of ‘Caesar’ the benefactor<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0951820712467895">14</xref></sup> but also with an eye toward the unnamed Judeans who lost the war. For Martial to have drawn overt negative attention to Judeans in the <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic>, as he does in his later epigrams, might have been too heavy-handed for a celebratory book of epigrams; the poet had to be more ingenious than that.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0951820712467895">15</xref></sup> In his later books of epigrams, however, Martial had free rein to say whatever he wanted with respect to Judeans since the occasions for those books of epigrams and the situations described were entirely different.</p>
<p>Another factor, connected to the title ‘Caesar’ used throughout the <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic>, may account for a lack of direct reference to Judeans or the Judean War in the book: its date. It is quite possible that the <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic> came together or underwent revision with additions—and subtractions?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0951820712467895">16</xref></sup>—made during the reign of Domitian (81–96 CE). The case of Josephus's <italic>Bellum Judaicum</italic> might provide a parallel for this kind of publication history: it was originally presented to both Vespasian and Titus; the latter, ‘after he had inscribed the volumes with his own hand, ordered them to be made public’ (Josephus, <italic>Vita</italic> 361–63, therefore, by 79 CE for Vespasian and by 81 for Titus). Though Domitian played no role in the Judean War, Josephus mentions him at <italic>B.J</italic>. 4.646–55 (on the civil war at Rome), 7.37 (games held on his birthday), 7.75–88 (on the German and Gallic revolt), and 7.152 (riding in the triumph), thus the younger brother shares at least some of the family glory. Josephus's text probably underwent revisions well into the 90s, according to Seth Schwartz.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0951820712467895">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>When Coleman attempts to pin down which Caesar is being addressed in Martial's <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic>, she builds on Buttrey's observations concerning Domitian's coinage and states:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We seem to have reached an impasse: the opening trio of epigrams (1–3), the pair celebrating a parade of <italic>delatores</italic> in the amphitheatre (4–5), and the poem celebrating a <italic>naumachia</italic> at Augustus’ <italic>stagnum</italic> (34) point to the inauguration of the Flavian amphitheatre under Titus, and general similarities with the recorded spectacles on that occasion are discernible elsewhere in the collection too; yet the pair of epigrams about the exploits of a rhinoceros (11 and 26) point to a date under Domitian.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0951820712467895">18</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>If we accept that the collection does date ultimately to the time of Domitian (perhaps before late 85),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0951820712467895">19</xref></sup> it could then be that the blending of the two Caesars who hosted spectacles at the amphitheatre, Titus and Domitian, into one ‘Caesar’ addressed in these epigrams<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0951820712467895">20</xref></sup> can account for Martial not mentioning Judeans or the Judean War in the version of the <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic> that we have. Only in the poem not found in the <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic>, 2.2, which we just examined, where the Flavian ‘brother’ (Titus) and ‘father’ (Vespasian) are clearly marked in line 5,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0951820712467895">21</xref></sup> does Martial make open reference to their victory in Judea as a counterpart to Domitian's own victory. In the <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic>, however, with epigrams from two different reigns coming together and the two brothers’ identities coalescing into a single ‘Caesar’, overt reference to the Judean War would have made little sense, since Domitian did not participate in this war. In any case, these epigrams are not historical accounts, and their artistry is what matters most to poet and audience.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Judeans and their war can be discerned in Martial's <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic>. If we accept that the Roman public, including Martial, was aware that the Flavian amphitheatre was funded at least partially out of the liquidation of Judean assets taken during the war (an assumption that would make sense even if we did not have Alföldy's reconstruction of the inscription proclaiming this to the public at the amphitheatre), and we add to this the fact that Judeans had served as arena victims after the war, as Josephus attests, then we can look in the <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic> for some traces of the vanquished Judeans through the plights of the creatures perishing in the amphitheatre, especially particular animals that receive anthropomorphic treatment in certain epigrams.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0951820712467895">22</xref></sup> When Titus was in power (79–81 CE), the Judean War was still featured in imperial propaganda such as coins and the (no longer extant) arch of Titus erected in the Circus Maximus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0951820712467895">23</xref></sup> Certain epigrams in the <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic>, composed during Titus's reign in honor of the inaugural games, may reflect this attention to the Judean War as well, albeit in a subtle way, since overt references in any epigrams composed under Titus would have been removed during later revision under Domitian, when the two Caesars became one in the epigrams.</p>

<title>Judeans Anthropomorphized</title>
<p>It is hardly a surprise that Judeans are silenced by name in the text, since silence plays a role in the <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic> both at the beginning and towards the end of the collection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0951820712467895">24</xref></sup> Martial opens by commanding: ‘<italic>Barbara pyramidum sileat miracula Memphis</italic>’, ‘Let barbarous Memphis keep silent about the wonders of the pyramids’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0951820712467895">25</xref></sup> As home of the oldest and previously most magnificent wonders in the world, Egypt comes first, but a first-century reader might have realized that this was also the place where Vespasian was first declared emperor aloud by the Roman legions in 69 during the Judean War, which coincided with the Roman civil war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0951820712467895">26</xref></sup> Through <italic>inclusio</italic> Martial rounds out this theme of silence in <italic>Spect</italic>. 34, possibly the last epigram in the original collection, by having the Fucine Lake and the lake of Nero (of his Domus Aurea on top of which the Colosseum was built) also silenced (34.11: ‘<italic>Fucinus et Teucri taceantur stagna Neronis</italic>’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0951820712467895">27</xref></sup> Rhetorical silencing, therefore, shapes the text, and perhaps the reader is being invited to consider more covert silencing as well, which may also help explain why the Judeans (the elephant in the room, so to speak) are never mentioned by name.</p>
<p><italic>Spect</italic>. 3 surveys the spectators who come from the far reaches of the empire and beyond in order to see the games and who with ‘<italic>uox diuersa</italic>’ becoming ‘<italic>una</italic>’ (line 11) proclaim Caesar ‘<italic>patriae</italic> … <italic>pater</italic>’ (line 12).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0951820712467895">28</xref></sup> Included among these are the Arab and the Sabaei, who ‘have hastened’ to the show (line 7: ‘<italic>festinauit Arabs, festinauere Sabaei</italic>’). Coleman explains that this echoes the appearance of these peoples on Aeneas's shield (<italic>Aeneid</italic> 8.706) and reflects the importance of the Arabs and Sabaei in trade and their geographic location.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0951820712467895">29</xref></sup> One can, however, add that these spectators may also recall the Arabs who were allied with the Romans during the Judean War. Arabs fought, for instance, as auxiliary archers, javelin-men, and slingers with Vespasian at Jotapata, where Josephus was taken prisoner.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0951820712467895">30</xref></sup> Furthermore, the Arabs, according to Josephus, committed war crimes against fleeing Judean refugees at Jerusalem during the siege in 70, for which Titus sternly reprimanded them for having implicated the Roman legionaries in their ‘savagery’ and their ‘hatred towards the Judeans’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0951820712467895">31</xref></sup> No wonder, then, that the Arab ‘hastened’ to the show, perhaps even hoping to see his wartime enemy further punished in the arena. Martial, however, never names Judeans among the criminals in the amphitheatre at Rome, even though Josephus describes Judeans dying in the arenas of the Middle East after the war as part of the Roman victory celebrations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0951820712467895">32</xref></sup> It would be real poetic justice, however, if one of the <italic>delatores</italic> in the ‘<italic>turba</italic>’ destined for exile in <italic>Spect</italic>. 4 included one of the several people who supposedly brought false charges against Josephus at Rome.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0951820712467895">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Also, absent from this crowd of spectators in <italic>Spect</italic>. 3 are the Judeans themselves, but Martial's list of nine different peoples is hardly exhaustive (nor should we expect every detail of the spectacles to be explained in a set of poems, despite its deceptively ‘microcosmic dynamic’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0951820712467895">34</xref></sup>). We should remember, in any case, that, according to Josephus, Judeans considered blood sport to be ‘a clear departure from their honored customs’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0951820712467895">35</xref></sup> and thought it was ‘impious to throw humans to wild beasts for the pleasure of spectators’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0951820712467895">36</xref></sup> Judeans at Rome may have been curious about the amphitheatre built with Judean money and perhaps even by enslaved Judean men, but their presence at these inaugural games as spectators might have been considered gauche or even illegal under Judean law, as the Mishnah later explains, by someone as fastidious as Josephus, who lived in Rome at this time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0951820712467895">37</xref></sup> This does not, however, preclude Judeans attending as spectators.</p>
<p>Though Martial makes no explicit reference to Judea or its people in the <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic>, we might instead look for a metonymic reference and propose that some of the animals in the arena that are described in an anthropomorphic fashion could very well represent not only the actual animals that appeared in the spectacles but also the defeated Judeans. Coleman has detected three cases of anthropomorphism in the collection: one in an epigram about a lion and two in epigrams about a sow. We shall now look at these instances more closely.</p>
<p>The first blatant anthropomorphism that Coleman detects in the collection occurs in epigram 12.1, where ‘<italic>Laeserat ingrato leo perfidus ore magistrum</italic>’ (‘a treacherous lion had wounded its keeper with its ungrateful maw’).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0951820712467895">38</xref></sup> Coleman explains that interpreting ‘<italic>ingrato</italic>’ hinges on understanding the rules of <italic>amicitia</italic> that have been violated by the lion,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0951820712467895">39</xref></sup> and with regard to the epigram as a whole, she suggests: ‘Martial draws the moral that the emperor's subjects are bound to co-operate with a ruler who can impose his will even upon wild animals’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0951820712467895">40</xref></sup> If, as Coleman states, ‘the paradigmatic value of animal behavior is often adduced in popular philosophy’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0951820712467895">41</xref></sup> then one can perhaps read from the Roman perspective that the lion of Judah<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0951820712467895">42</xref></sup> has recently bitten the Roman hand that fed it (i.e. the Judeans, who were Roman provincials, had rebelled, even though, from the Roman perspective, they were enjoying the benefits of Roman peace), and that the Judean people (and all other Roman subjects) should learn how to behave themselves under an emperor (12.6: ‘<italic>quos decet esse hominum tali sub principe mores</italic>’). Also, Martial's description of the lion as ‘<italic>perfidus</italic>’ in line 1 finds its echo in the later Christian label of ‘<italic>perfidus Iudaeus</italic>’ (‘perfidious Jew’), which was used in a Good Friday prayer in Roman Catholicism until Pope John XXIII ordered it to be removed in 1959.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0951820712467895">43</xref></sup> It is entirely possible that this Roman labeling of Judeans as ‘treacherous’ in the political sense, since they had raised a rebellion (and would do so again sixty years after the first one was stamped out), helped inspire later Christian liturgical rhetoric about the ‘perfidious’ Judeans supposedly being responsible for the death of Christ.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0951820712467895">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Soon quite literally to burst onto the scene in the book's arena two epigrams later is a pregnant sow,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0951820712467895">45</xref></sup> whose death coinciding with the birth of one of her offspring repeats itself in a triptych of poems that grow more telegraphic in their successive retellings of the strange event.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0951820712467895">46</xref></sup> These three epigrams interrupt a train of epigrams (11–13) featuring a rhinoceros, a bull, the ungrateful lion just examined, and a bear; a boar (a male pig) is the first victim of the famous <italic>bestiarius</italic> Carpophorus in 17.2, which serves as the thematic bridge from the sow in three epigrams (14–16) back to the other animals in the collection.</p>
<p>The first of these three on the sow, <italic>Spect</italic>. 14, reads:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Inter Caesareae discrimina saeua Dianae</italic></p>
<p><italic>fixisset grauidam cum leuis hasta suem</italic>,</p>
<p><italic>exiluit partus miserae de uulnere matris</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>O Lucina ferox, hoc peperisse fuit?</italic></p>
<p><italic>pluribus illa mori uoluisset saucia telis</italic>,</p>
<p><italic>omnibus ut natis triste pateret iter</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>quis negat esse satum materno funere Bacchum?</italic></p>
<p><italic>sic genitum numen credite: nata fera est</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0951820712467895">47</xref></sup></p>

<p>It is very possible that Martial (and his Roman audience) would be cruel enough to make a mockery<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0951820712467895">48</xref></sup> of the suffering of the Judeans by equating it with the slaying of the mother sow yielding a little piglet leaping out, still alive (line 3)—a diaspora (line 6: ‘<italic>triste</italic> … <italic>iter</italic>’) catalyzed by death, with one surviving while the rest of the anthropomorphically labeled ‘<italic>natis</italic>’ (line 6) perish.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0951820712467895">49</xref></sup> If this sow had been a pregnant woman, the Romans would have tried to avoid such a Caesarean-section spectacle (line 1), as the account of the martyrdom of Felicity in early third-century Carthage makes clear,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0951820712467895">50</xref></sup> but with the sow being a ‘beast’, the show can go on, and Martial describes the scene in such a way that a Roman reader could see the sow (who becomes a ‘<italic>mater</italic>’ in epigram 15) and her anthropomorphized offspring as human beings. Among the many criminals who died in spectacles, Judeans certainly suffered arena deaths after the war: Josephus has the Judean rebel leader Eleazar bemoan at Masada that, ‘others [i.e. Judeans], half-eaten by wild beasts, have been kept alive to be a second meal for them, after providing laughter and sport for their enemies [i.e. the Romans]’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0951820712467895">51</xref></sup> How better for Martial to represent the Judeans who had rebelled unsuccessfully against the Romans than to make them the pigs that everyone knew they abhorred by law?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0951820712467895">52</xref></sup> Just as the Judeans provided ‘laughter and sport’ for the Romans in the arenas of the empire after the Judean War, so Martial provides more humor for Romans, again at the expense of Judeans, in the arena of his epigrams.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0951820712467895">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>Sows, however, were not automatically equated with Judeans in the symbols of the Flavian age. The Flavians did associate themselves with the image of a sow and piglets on their coinage, and Kondratieff has argued that the denarii of both Vespasian and Titus that were issued in 77 and 78 with a sow and piglets were part of ‘a narrative group recalling the legends of Rome's first foundation’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0951820712467895">54</xref></sup> Here in the arena of the <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic>, however, Martial's sow is hardly the fat and happy one suckling thirty white piglets at the future site of Aeneas’ Lavinium (Vergil, <italic>Aeneid</italic> 8.43–45).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0951820712467895">55</xref></sup> Instead, she is hunted prey, something that the spectators and now readers presumably enjoy seeing suffer in the arena since they are there to watch, and her surviving offspring has been downgraded from one of the anthropomorphized ‘<italic>natis</italic>’ to a ‘beast’ two lines later (14.8: ‘<italic>fera</italic>’).</p>
<p>What is especially striking in this first epigram on the sow is the comparison of this birth-in-death to the birth of Bacchus<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0951820712467895">56</xref></sup> (14.7: ‘<italic>quis negat esse satum materno funere Bacchum</italic>?’, ‘Who denies that Bacchus was brought forth by his mother's death?’). Besides the obvious mythological parallel to the birth of Dionysus, at this time, we should note that some Romans thought the Judeans had worshipped Bacchus in their temple at Jerusalem before it burned in 70, a misunderstanding that, as Tacitus explains, probably stemmed in part from ‘<italic>uitisque aurea templo reperta</italic>’;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0951820712467895">57</xref></sup> Josephus corroborates this when he describes a huge golden vine with grape clusters ‘the height of a man’ that decorated the temple's gilded front gate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0951820712467895">58</xref></sup> Tacitus knows of this grapevine at the temple, but rejects the idea of Judeans worshipping Father Liber ‘<italic>quippe Liber festos laetosque ritus posuit, Iudaeorum mos absurdus sordidusque</italic>’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0951820712467895">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, Josephus in his <italic>Bellum Judaicum</italic> also supports a connection between Bacchus and the Judeans, since he makes literary allusions to Euripides’ <italic>Bacchae</italic> when depicting a mother's cannibalism of her infant during the siege of Jerusalem (<italic>B.J</italic>. 6.199–219), a key episode that provokes Titus's verbal denunciation of the Judeans (<italic>B.J</italic>. 6.215–19) and ushers in the subsequent destruction of the temple (<italic>B.J</italic>. 6.249ff.).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0951820712467895">60</xref></sup> Given that Josephus claims to have written his <italic>Bellum Judaicum</italic> at least in part for a Roman audience (<italic>B.J</italic>. 1.16), a Roman reader could be expected to accept a literary association being made between the behavior of a Judean mother and Euripides’ description of the power of Bacchus (and not just tales of a grapevine and Bacchic worship at the temple in Jerusalem). One can, therefore, at least consider that a literary allusion to the Judeans and their fate at the hands of the victorious Titus (14.1: ‘<italic>Inter Caesareae discrimina saeva Dianae</italic>’) could exist in this epigram on the hunted sow.</p>
<p>Coleman explains anthropomorphism in the <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic> twice with regard to two of the three epigrams on the sow: ‘<italic>natis</italic>’ at 14.6 for the sow's litter and ‘<italic>mater</italic>’ at 15.1 for the sow itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0951820712467895">61</xref></sup> Unlike the mother in Book 6 of Josephus's <italic>Bellum Judaicum</italic>, however, this ‘mother’ dies, while ‘her progeny’ (16.3: ‘<italic>partus</italic>’), the piglet, survives through ‘<italic>ingenium</italic>’ (16.4). This strange birth-in-death surely could have happened in the arena during the inaugural games, but the prominence of these three epigrams with their anthropomorphized animals at the center of the <italic>Liber</italic> also invites reflection on how creatures, including humans (such as the Judeans), can survive against great odds. As Eric Gunderson observes, ‘But the broader point is that, yes, the arena is a factory of meaning, that the shows are a collection of clever circumstances, and that the job is to apply our <italic>ingenium</italic> to read and respond to the <italic>ingenium</italic> that is already there’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0951820712467895">62</xref></sup> The very invocation of <italic>ingenium</italic> tips the audience to Martial's play with Ovid's poetry, and as Stephen Hinds aptly remarks, ‘Make no mistake about it: this upstart epigrammist has the capacity, if he is so inclined, to reinscribe the <italic>Metamorphoses</italic> as nothing more (or less) than <italic>quindecim libri spectaculorum’</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0951820712467895">63</xref></sup> What I am asking here is that we allow Martial full range to explore Ovid's theme of metamorphosis in the arena of his epigrams, with animal-human transformations operating in multiple forms, as the rules of <italic>ingenium</italic> allow.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0951820712467895">64</xref></sup></p>

<p>In <italic>Spect</italic>. 36, we may find double meanings and commentary on the <italic>uirtus</italic> of those living under Roman <italic>imperium</italic>, and not just <italic>uirtus</italic> in the arena:</p>

<p>This epigram's opening words, ‘<italic>cedere maiori</italic>’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0951820712467895">70</xref></sup> provide the flip-side of Anchises’ formula for Roman success in <italic>Aeneid</italic> 6: ‘<italic>parcere subiectis et debellare superbos</italic>.’ The epigram mentions the winner but focuses even more on the yielding of the loser, the ‘<italic>minor hostis’</italic>. If we read the Judeans here for ‘<italic>minor hostis</italic>’, which is possible since <italic>hostis</italic> has a militaristic ring usually referring to an enemy in battle,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0951820712467895">71</xref></sup> we can then consider another meaning for the ‘<italic>grauis palma</italic>’. Since the palm-branch normally only went to the <italic>winner</italic> (or, in an unusual moment, to two gladiators who have tied—see <italic>Spect</italic>. 31.9–12),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0951820712467895">72</xref></sup> and certainly not to the loser (‘<italic>minor</italic>’) who has yielded, the ‘<italic>grauis palma</italic>’ could very well point to the palm tree, which was the symbol of downtrodden Judea depicted on the reverse of some the heavier Flavian coinage advertising ‘<italic>IVDAEA CAPTA</italic>.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0951820712467895">73</xref></sup> (A sestertius was worth one quarter of a denarius but was about eight times heavier, thus it was on the ‘<italic>gravis</italic>’ end of the spectrum for the weight of Roman coins.) If this connection to the Roman coinage minted to celebrate victory in Judea is apt, then we might even see in this epigram a commentary on the shameful Judean obligation in the Flavian period to pay two denarii (or eight sesterces) into the <italic>fiscus Iudaicus</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0951820712467895">74</xref></sup> which Martial crudely refers to later in 7.55 with ‘<italic>damnatam modo mentulam tributis</italic>.’ This possible reference in <italic>Spect</italic>. 36.2 to money paid after the war by the losing Judeans stings even more if one remembers that ‘monetary rewards were typically forthcoming’ for victorious gladiators, along with ‘a palm branch and perhaps a crown’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0951820712467895">75</xref></sup> Martial has managed to encapsulate tremendous Judean losses, both military and fiscal, in just two economical lines.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic>, Martial engages in a strategy of virtually silencing the Judean people ‘<italic>de Solymis</italic> … <italic>perustis</italic>’ (‘from Jerusalem burned down’, as the poet says in 7.55), whose pillaged property built the Colosseum. This may, in part, be a result of the blending of epigrams from the reigns of both Titus and Domitian into a revised <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic> featuring a single ‘Caesar’ who represents both emperors. Since Domitian never fought in the Judean War, Martial avoids—or has removed during revision—overt comments about victory in the Judean War. It is up to the reader, therefore, to find the Judeans quietly and ignominiously metamorphosed into animals to be punished in his text's arena, and ultimately, as losers who pay the price for rebellion. Given that Martial composed the <italic>Liber spectaculorum</italic> to celebrate the amphitheatre built by all three Flavian emperors, the first two of whom had subdued the rebellion of the Judeans, looted the Jerusalem temple, and then used the booty from the war to aggrandize Rome and their own dynasty with monuments, it seems sensible to read these epigrams for allusions to these circumstances.</p>

Feldman (1993: 26) argues: ‘Likewise, the presence of theatres and amphitheatres in such cities as Jerusalem and Jericho is hardly evidence that sizable numbers of Jews attended them, because Josephus (<italic>Ant</italic>. 15.268) describes theatres and amphitheatres as ‘alien to Jewish custom’. Schürer (1979–87: 55) had argued to the contrary: ‘Despite this theoretical objection, Judaism was nevertheless unable to prevent the pageantry of the pagan games from developing in the Holy Land itself from the Herodian period onwards and it should not be assumed that the mass of the Jewish population did not frequent them. In Jerusalem, Herod built a theatre and an amphitheatre, and introduced, as in Caesarea, four-yearly games in honour of Caesar. The implication must have been that a stadium and a hippodrome existed there as well, and in fact the latter is once explicitly mentioned’. Barclay (1996: 250) observes that Herod's construction of Caesarea, a Greek city complete with amphitheatre, gymnasia, statues, and temples, must have aroused anger among those who considered this territory part of the ‘holy land”, but he does not discuss the venues in Jerusalem; Barclay's chart on p. 93, showing ‘Assimilation (Social Integration)’, places ‘attendance at Greek athletics/theatre’ in the middle of the spectrum, but considering this passage in Josephus we might place it closer to the ‘abandonment of key Jewish social distinctions’.</p></fn>
