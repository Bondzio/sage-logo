<p>This is the second of four (e-) volumes containing a selection of papers presented at the International conference organized by the Centre for Interdisciplinary Gender Studies (CIRSDe) of the University of Turin in February 2011. Given the wide net spread by the conference organizers, with regard both to topics and disciplines, the number of papers and issues discussed at that conference were broad and diverse. This particular volume presents a selection of the papers presented in the section focusing on the possible links between globalization and gender violence.</p>
<p>The papers cover a variety of topics and of theoretical approaches. The authors are mostly, but not all, Italian. I will not attempt to give an overview of all of them. Rather, I will pick some of the themes that offer food for thought in the ongoing debate and research on gender violence, and, in doing so, I will follow the four sections in which they were grouped. The first section (‘Tra violenza di genere e <italic>agency</italic>: vecchie e nuove sfide per le teorie femministe’ [Between gender violence and agency: old and new challenges for feminist theories]) includes papers which address the tension between women as victims and women as actors in violent contexts and relationships. The paper by Giovanna Camino (‘Violenza contro le donne e violenza di genere: ripensamenti di teoria femminista tra sovversione e uguaglianza’ [Violence against women and gender violence: rethinking feminist theory between subversion and equality]) is an up-to-date state of the art discussion of two distinct issues: that concerning what is specific about gender violence and that of the empirical and theoretical fallacies involved in seeing women only as potential victims of violence and not also as capable themselves of gender and other kinds of violence. The discussion by Selmi of the feminist debate around prostitution and of how this debate is somewhat displaced and reframed by the growing phenomenon of sex trafficking is particularly insightful (‘Prostituzione o <italic>sex work</italic>? Riflessioni femministe in bilico tra violenza e <italic>agency</italic>’ [Prostitution or sex work? Feminist insights between violence and agency]). This theme is taken up also by Palumbo in the second section of the volume. Palumbo, in particular, points out the risks involved in treating sex-trafficked migrant women merely as victims of sex abuse and exploitation. This important, but narrow, focus, in fact, risks hiding other forms of violation of these women’s rights ( as non-EU migrants).</p>
<p>The papers in the second section (‘Violenza di genere e migrazioni: verso un vocabolario transculturale’ [Gender violence and migrations: towards a transcultural vocabulary]) address the link between gender violence and migration from multiple theoretical and methodological perspectives, but with a specific focus on the Italian context. Franca Bimbi argues that there are many similarities in the way women’s bodies are accessible in a more developed society such as Italy, with its rhetoric of self-determination and emancipation, and in the less developed, ‘traditional’ countries from which some (but not all) migrants come. This very insightful paper would have been strengthened by a systematically empirically grounded approach. It is not clear, in fact, whether and to what degree the author considers Italy to be representative of ‘modern’ societies as such and whether all ‘modern societies’ are alike with regard to forms of regulation of access to women’s bodies (i.e. with regard to contraception, reproductive technologies, use of the female body in advertisements and so forth). In addition, the conceptualization of ‘migrant cultures’ seems rather stereotypical and unilateral. The risk is that, while trying to expose the limits of the ‘modern’ versus ‘traditional’ dichotomy, the author actually reinforces this same dichotomy by giving insufficient consideration to differences within the two poles. The same risk may be found in the more empirical papers of this section, which are based on studies on how violence is defined and perceived by migrant compared to autochthonous women. Although focusing on the ‘migrants’ perspective’, these papers, in fact, tend to underplay the differences within groups of migrant women of various ethnic, educational, social class, cultural background.</p>
<p>The third section (‘Violenza di genere e guerre … nel tempo e nello spazio globale’ [Gender violence and wars … in global time and space]) includes papers that analyse national cases, from India to Mexico to Palestine. The focus is both on the use of violence against women as a means of political, nationalist action, and on the opportunities national conflicts may open up for women to redefine their positions.</p>
<p>Finally, the fourth section includes two papers that, reversing the perspective, address the issue of how peace is conceptualized by men and women and what kind of cultural change is necessary to contrast the development of violence at all levels.</p>
<p>In her rich introduction, as well as in the choice of how to structure the text, Balsamo attempts to show the connections between very different theoretical approaches. The result is an insightful essay that helps to guide and support the reader not to get totally lost. All the papers reflect upon the tension between victimization and agency in the experience of violence, highlighting the role of women as actors, although only one, Schiavone’s, explores the taboo surrounding women as actors in violence – gender or other. There are some other shortcomings of the volume. For example, the concept of globalization is little discussed and its role in the various papers is not fully clear. Both in the introduction and in some of the papers it seems that globalization happens mainly through migration and more or less forced interculturalism. This is certainly an important aspect of globalization, but not the only one. Furthermore, this specific aspect is considered only from the perspective of the country where people migrate to, not where they come from, as if migration and interculturality did not also affect these. If scholars from these countries had been present at the conference, this one-sidedness might have been corrected.</p>
<p>These limitations notwithstanding, the papers in this collection are engaging and open quite novel perspectives in Italian scholarship, which serve to connect it to international debates and literatures.</p>
