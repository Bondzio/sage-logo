<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Asthma is a common condition and often influences social and work life. Prevalence rates vary depending on how asthma severity and asthma-related symptoms are registered. In the European Community Respiratory Health Study (ECRHS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812449079">1</xref>], prevalence rates ranged from 3.5% (asthma medication) to 20% (wheeze) in adult populations aged 20–44 years. The United States National Surveillance for Asthma has disclosed prevalence rates of current asthma of around 7% for adults, with the highest rate in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812449079">2</xref>]. Current asthma may be underestimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812449079">3</xref>]. As asthma often has an early debut, considerable influences on personal life and national economy related to working life might be expected. “Cost of illness” studies have demonstrated substantially increased direct and indirect costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812449079">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812449079"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812449079"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812449079">7</xref>]. Studies have shown excessive costs from asthma related to work life for insurance companies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812449079">8</xref>] and employers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812449079">9</xref>]. Quality of life (QoL) investigations have demonstrated negative associations with job performance relating to different psychosocial factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812449079">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812449079"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812449079"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812449079">13</xref>]. Job-related factors can generate special problems for asthmatics making it difficult for them to remain in the labour market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812449079">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812449079"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812449079"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812449079"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812449079">18</xref>].</p>
<p>More detailed investigations of personal work-related consequences of asthma present less congruent results compared with evaluations of national and personal costs. The direct impact on working life can be described in terms of sick leave, modification in job choice, different grades of work disability and reduced job performances. Unemployment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812449079">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812449079"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812449079">21</xref>], sick leave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812449079">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812449079">23</xref>], choice of job [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812449079">22</xref>] and work disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494812449079">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494812449079">25</xref>] related to asthma have been studied. The ERCHS results are summarized by Accordini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812449079">26</xref>], who reported that the burden of asthma on working life is substantial in Europe, and is associated with obesity, frequent respiratory symptoms, low lung function and chronic cough, with non-atopic females at particular risk. Generally, the heaviest burdens were associated with severe symptoms and poorly controlled asthma, where the affected individuals accounted for a high proportion of the asthma burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494812449079">27</xref>].</p>
<p>In Denmark all public transfer payments are registered in a national database with information automatically reported from different public authorities. The purpose of this study is to compare the consequences of asthma on working life with regard to unemployment, welfare, sick leave and disability in a randomly selected population of asthmatics and non-asthmatics using reliable registered data on public transfer payments. To our knowledge this is the first study of this kind based on independent register data.</p>

<title>Study population</title>
<p>In the RAV (Risk factors for Adult Asthma) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494812449079">28</xref>], a random sample of 2,000 persons, 20–44 years old from each of five Danish counties was selected and stratified by sex and five-year groups. The ECRHS II screening questionnaire was mailed to the study population in the period from December 2002 to June 2004 with a response rate of 72.7% (7,271). From this population, only the 7,141 individuals remaining in Denmark for the whole study period were included. Current asthma was defined by an affirmative answer to one or more of the following questions: 1) “Have you had an attack of asthma in the last 12 months?“, 2) “Are you currently taking any medicine (including inhalators, aerosols or tablets) for asthma?” or 3) the combination of an affirmative answer to the question “ Has your asthma ever been confirmed by a doctor?” plus an affirmative answer to one of the following questions “Have you experienced wheezy breathing at any time during the last 12 months?”, “Have you woken up with a feeling of chest tightness at any time during the last 12 months?” or “Have you woken up with an attack of breathlessness at any time during the last 12 months?”. Information about the onset of asthma was obtained from the question “How old were you when you experienced your first attack of asthma?”</p>

<title>Socioeconomic data</title>
<p>The National Labour Market Authority (Arbejdsmarkedstyrelsen) administers a cumulative database, DREAM, including all public transfer incomes. The DREAM database contains data from the Ministries of Employment, Social Affairs, Education and Integration as well as from the Danish municipalities and Statistics Denmark. DREAM includes all persons with a Danish civil registration number (CPR), and records all social benefits or any other transfer income week by week received since July 1991. The DREAM database comprised 104 different codes for transfer incomes. For this study the numerous transfer income classes were reduced to two labour-market-related benefit groups and two health-related benefit groups. The labour-market-related groups comprised: unemployment, which is made up of persons who receive benefit from an unemployment insurance institution (DREAM codes 111–113) and welfare, which includes social assistance administered by the municipal social service department if a person is out of work and not eligible for benefit from an unemployment insurance institution (DREAM codes 731–739) as well as work-related subsidies to unemployed persons (DREAM codes 211–298;). The health-related benefit groups are municipally administered and comprise: sick leave benefits (DREAM code 891) and disability. The latter group comprises disability pension (DREAM code 793), vocational rehabilitation (DREAM codes 758 and 791–792 and various benefits for individuals with certified permanent partial health-related limitations (DREAM codes 741–749, 761–769 and 771–779).</p>
<p>The type of transfer payment is recorded for a week even if the person had just received the benefit for one day during that week. A consequence of this mode of registration is a necessary ranking of transfer payment codes because only one code can be registered per week. Relevant to this study disability is the highest ranking level followed by sick leave, unemployment compensation and compensation for welfare, which is the lowest level. A consequence of this mode of registration is that it is difficult to interpret the flow between different transfer income categories, because some categories over-rule others in spite of all being relevant. The first two weeks of sick leave were paid by the employer and thus only sick leave exceeding two weeks was reimbursed by the local county and registered in the DREAM database. Sick leave periods of two weeks or less could not therefore be included in this study. The right to unemployment benefits requires membership in an unemployment insurance institution as well as employment for at least one year prior to receiving unemployment benefits. If out of work and not eligible for unemployment benefits economic support through welfare legislation is possible. In the DREAM database there are several welfare-related codes, which in this study were aggregated into one classification, welfare. Persons without any registered data in the DREAM database had not received any transfer income during the study period. These individuals were either at work, studying or voluntarily staying at home and formed the reference group. The reference group accounted for 3,897 non-asthmatic individuals (60% of non-asthmatics) and for asthmatics the figure was 428 (64.7% of asthmatics). Periods of maternity leave or receiving educational benefits were treated as periods with no transfer payments.</p>

<sec id="section9-1403494812449079">
<title>Occupational classification</title>
<p>For all 7,141 participants, the present or last held job at the time of answering the questionnaire was registered using ISCO-88 (International Standard Classification of Occupations). Blue collar workers were defined as ISCO categories 5000 or more. White collar workers were defined by categories less than 5000.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1403494812449079">
<title>Analyses and statistics</title>
<p>The date of answering the questionnaire was individually established as the point of reference in relation to outcome data from the DREAM database. Data were grouped individually in exact years (365 days) backwards and forwards from this date. For all individuals complete data was available for two years before and three years after the date of answering the questionnaire. DREAM outcome data were grouped in six classifications: no transfer payment, unemployment, welfare, sick leave, disability and deceased. Periods when individuals lived abroad were registered and excluded from the analysis. A summation of weeks registered in the different classifications was performed on an individual basis year by year for the five-year period. A longer study period was not possible due to transfer income category changes. Following this study period only sick leave over four weeks was registered.</p>
<p>For statistical purposes data from the five classifications were categorized into discrete logical time frames. This resulted in a more even distribution of data: disability (successive 52 week groups (year-groups), sick leave (&lt;2 weeks, 2–4 weeks, 5–11 weeks, 12–24 weeks, 25–50 weeks and &gt;50 weeks) and for welfare and unemployment (&lt;13 weeks, 14–26 weeks, 27–52 weeks, 53–104 weeks, 105–156 weeks and &gt; 156 weeks).</p>
<p>Descriptive analyses of transfer income distributions were performed with non-parametric analysis (Kruskal-Wallis) both on the actual number of weeks per individual per transfer income classification and on data after grouping in logical time periods. Regarding possible skewed distribution of outcome variables the statistics on the actual number of weeks were compared with results using categorical variables and demonstrated equal distribution of outcome variables.</p>
<p>Parametric analysis eliciting associations from different factors on the transfer incomes were performed on data after time-period grouping with the exclusion of the reference group necessitated by fixed total numbers of possible weeks in the study period creating interdependence between time-groups. Influencing factors were smoker vs. non-smoker defined by ever smoking more than one pack-year and adult vs. childhood onset asthma (debut at 16 years or more vs. 15 years or less). Durations of the different transfer income periods were skewed, but when grouping into logical time periods, homogeneous groups allowing for parametric statistics occurred. Negative binomial regression statistics of the different transfer income categories were performed. The basic model included time of asthma debut, work type, gender, smoker status, county and age groups. Backward elimination analyses were preformed eliciting parameters for the final model. All analyses were performed using STATA Statistical Software, Release 10. (College Station TX, USA).</p>

The overall prevalence of current asthma was 9.3%. Females were over-represented in both the entire population and the group of asthmatics, accounting for almost 2/3 of the asthma cases. Job type differed more between gender than between asthmatics and non-asthmatics, and there was a tendency for females to have more white collar work than males. Age at first asthma attack had little influence on the type of work.</p>

<p>Based on data from the DREAM database, the number of weeks receiving the four groups of transfer incomes the study population was analyzed for each calendar year in the five-year study period in order to evaluate possible substantial socioeconomic fluctuations over time. No exceptional changes occurred over the five study years. Only a slight and expected rise in annual number of weeks receiving disability, a permanent social benefit, was seen.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494812449079">Table II</xref> presents the overall association with current asthma as well as the association with gender and type of work on types of transfer incomes in comparison with non-asthmatics. Current asthma was highly significantly associated with periods of welfare, sick leave and disability. Significant associations were demonstrated with welfare and disability for both genders and for the females on sick leave. Both in white and blue collar workers current asthma was related to the welfare and disability categories, while significant association with sick leave was seen for blue collar workers only.</p>

Data are presented separately for each gender and compared with the non-asthmatic population (data presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494812449079">Table II</xref>). Generally, there are only marginal differences between childhood-onset asthma and non-asthmatics. No significant associations are seen with unemployment. Adult-onset asthmatics had more weeks receiving all four types of transfer income compared with both childhood-onset asthmatics and non-asthmatics. Compared with non-asthmatics significant differences were seen for both genders in respect to welfare and disability, and for males in the sick leave category. For asthmatic females the transfer income periods for disability (<italic>p</italic>=0.00) and welfare (<italic>p</italic>=0.04) were significantly longer for adult-onset than for childhood-onset asthma.</p>

Adulthood-onset asthma was associated with increases in all transfer income categories except for unemployment. Childhood-onset asthma was marginally significantly related to disability and welfare, but was unrelated to sick leave and unemployment. An association to smoking was demonstrated on all transfer income categories except disability. However an analysis of the non-smoking population led to similar results, suggesting that smoker status might not be a confounder.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have demonstrated that current asthma is negatively associated with the probability of having and keeping a job. These associations are mainly seen in health-related benefits and welfare and to a lesser degree in unemployment. Adult-onset asthma seems to have many more social consequences than growing up with asthma. Female blue collar workers received more social benefits than male white collar workers. The unadjusted analyses demonstrated an overall significant association with current asthma on all transfer income categories except for unemployment even after gender stratification with a marginal but non-significant association with sick leave for males. In the multivariate analyses the association of childhood-onset asthma with labour market attachment seems to be minimal. An association was only seen for females in the welfare category. Blue collar workers had significantly increased risks of receiving transfer payments for welfare, sick leave and disability in comparison with white collar workers, but no significant associations were observed with unemployment payments.</p>
<p>In studying the consequences of current asthma on job absenteeism and job retention, the registration of reliable and minimally biased outcome parameters is essential. To our knowledge, the evaluation of consequences of asthma based on independent and validated registry data has not previously been reported. The DREAM database used in the present study offers a unique opportunity because it presents individual weekly data on transfer incomes registered systematically and completely independent of any study aim. With regard to job absenteeism and job retention no questionnaire data with the possibility of recall bias have been used in this study. DREAM data are documentation for legal transfer incomes. The validity of the DREAM database has been studied by Hjollund [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812449079">29</xref>]. DREAM data correlated well with survey data and to some extent demonstrated more reliable information concerning directly refunded costs to employers, which the employee had not necessarily registered or remembered. Data on transfer income could be influenced by annual fluctuations in national economic conditions, but unusual changes in transfer income over the five calendar years in the study period were not observed.</p>
<p>Transfer income parameters in DREAM are registered as legally based economic subsidies. The employer paid the first two weeks of sick leave benefits. Sick leave was only registered after this two-week period. Thus only the third and subsequent sick leave weeks were registered. Sick leave due to asthma is often relatively short. Therefore we have probably underestimated the true associations between asthma and sick leave. The mean total number of weeks on transfer income was 86.5 weeks in asthmatics and 57.9 weeks in non-asthmatics, corresponding to 33% and 22% respectively of the total study period. In comparison the rate of employment in 15–64 year olds in Denmark in 2004–2007 was around 76–77%, leaving nearly one quarter of the labour force out of work and eligible for receiving some kind of public transfer payment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494812449079">30</xref>].</p>
<p>The study population was derived from a random sample of young adults with a 9.3% overall prevalence of current asthma. This was slightly higher than that reported in comparable population-based surveys in Denmark. In a Danish public health study from 2005, self-reported asthma prevalence in adults (age 16+) was 6.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1403494812449079">31</xref>]. The higher prevalence in the present study could be due to the relatively low response rate (73%), because the asthmatic participants may be more motivated towards answering the questionnaire and thereby increase the proportion of asthmatics. Our classification of asthmatics was adapted from the ECRHS study of the social-economic burden of asthma in Europe by Accordini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812449079">26</xref>] and based on self-reported data on attacks, medication use and doctors’ diagnoses of asthma. Since the study did not include older subjects, misclassification of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as asthma should be negligible.</p>
<p>In concordance with other studies, we found a female predominance of adult-onset asthma and a male predominance of childhood-onset disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1403494812449079">32</xref>]. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1403494812449079">Table III</xref> women had more disability, sick leave, welfare and unemployment. A number of factors may explain this gender difference. Asthma can worsen during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1403494812449079">33</xref>]. For the same level of obstruction women report more symptoms and seek more medical care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1403494812449079">34</xref>]. In addition it is most often the female who takes major responsibility for the home and family.</p>
<p>Smoking was associated with additional sick leave, unemployment and welfare. Smoking makes asthma more difficult to treat. Lower social classes with less education usually smoke more. Thus it is not surprising that smokers have more difficulty in finding and keep a job.</p>
<p>The demonstrated associations of current asthma with transfer incomes are in accordance with other studies. Studying previously employed asthmatics with severe disease Blanc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494812449079">24</xref>] observed a 19% increase in disability over a five-year period and reported complete cessation of work due to asthma in 7%. Eisner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812449079">26</xref>] reported a 14% disability level in working age asthmatics with severe disease, and 38% had partial work disability among those currently employed. Yelin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812449079">22</xref>] demonstrated an association with future employment after a follow-up time of four and a half years. Among adult asthmatics who had been unemployed at the time of diagnosis, only 29% were still working compared with 68% of the asthmatics who were working at the time of diagnosis. Few studies have focused on unemployment and only a few have included non-asthmatics as controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812449079">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812449079"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812449079">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812449079">23</xref>]. Eisner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812449079">20</xref>] reported non-significantly reduced employment status among asthmatics compared to individuals without chronic disease, but similar to levels seen in other chronic diseases, except for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Similar to these studies, we found a minimal association with unemployment, but significant risks with being on welfare. A combination of additional social problems and asthma severity may explain why welfare recipients generally have a much weaker attachment to the labour market. Unfortunately we could not evaluate asthma severity with our data.</p>
<p>The minimal association of childhood-onset asthma with labour market attachment in the present study is in accordance with other studies. Despite respiratory problems in school and later at work, individuals with childhood-onset asthma after 25 years of follow-up experienced no adverse associations with educational attainment, employment or social class in comparison with non-asthmatics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812449079">19</xref>]. No difference in unemployment was seen in current asthmatics with childhood asthma at age 23 compared with controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812449079">23</xref>], but asthmatics had a greater risk of being outside the work force. In a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812449079">21</xref>], results from a longitudinal follow-up of a French cohort of male asthmatics (aged 37–52 years) were reported. Unemployment was not higher among asthmatics than in controls at baseline or five years later in spite of a higher rate of sick-leave among current asthmatics. A selective association with job choice was suspected due to the negative association between being a blue collar worker and having childhood-onset asthma. They suggest that this could be explained by childhood asthmatics selecting non-blue collar jobs. However, it might also be explained by a biased study sample. Their random sample was based on patients seen by 380 volunteer occupational health physicians. Blue collar workers with well-treated childhood asthma would be less inclined to seek medical attention. A similar selection association was not seen in our study. The distribution of white and blue collar workers was similar in asthmatics and non-asthmatics in our study. However, both blue and white collar male asthmatic workers had considerably more childhood-onset disease than female asthmatics. Adult-onset asthma was particularly associated with receiving additional welfare and disability benefits. More severe disease, poorer accommodation to asthma or reduced compliance may be partial explanations. Perhaps those with childhood-onset asthma had better adjusted to their disease and chose more suitable training and jobs. Blue collar workers had significantly increased risks of receiving welfare, sick leave and disability compensations. Thus the type of job also seems to be an important factor.</p>
<p>Work-related consequences in subpopulations of asthmatics are usually studied in comparison to the general population and to a lesser extent to a matched control group. Data regarding absenteeism and disability have usually been obtained through interviews or questionnaires, and have never been based on independent register data as in this study, as far as we are aware. Thus our results ought to be robust due to this independent and validated outcome source. Unfortunately this study lacked data enabling analysing the influence of socioeconomic factors and disease severity, which might better have described the subpopulation of current asthma bearing the exaggerated amount of transfer incomes. Another important disadvantage of this study is that the first two sick leaves were not registered. Thus it was not possible to include shorter sick-leave periods. Many mild asthmatics will have shorter sick leave periods. Unfortunately we were not able to control for effects from other diseases. However, as this study is based on a random population sample, other diseases would be expected to be similar in the study and control groups.</p>
<p>This register-based study has demonstrated significant impacts of asthma on absenteeism and job retention. Associations were seen regarding disability and welfare, with minimal associations with unemployment. The observed gender differences may be explained by gender differences in choice of work. A greater negative impact was associated with adult-onset asthma. Our results suggest that additional efforts are needed to help asthmatics, particularly adult-onset asthmatics, to find and keep the right job. Proper treatment and workplace accommodation are important.</p>
