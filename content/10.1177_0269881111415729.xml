<abstract>
<p>Studies have shown that anxiety can positively or negatively affect performance with respect to focusing of attention or distractibility, subjective workload and effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881111415729">Humphreys and Revelle, 1984</xref>). The inhalation of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is associated with physiological and psychological effects of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881111415729">Bailey et al., 2005</xref>) but its effects on performance have rarely been reported. The studies reported here looked at the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation on physiological and subjective measures and performance on two tasks. Eight healthy male participants completed a tracking task with a reaction time component, and 12 healthy participants (six male) completed a complex target identification task. Tasks were performed during 20-min inhalations of 7.5% CO<sub>2</sub>/21% O<sub>2</sub>/71.5% N<sub>2</sub> mixture or medical air. Continuous heart rate and blood pressure measures were taken, in addition to subjective measures of mood and workload. In comparison with air, CO<sub>2</sub> increased heart rate and blood pressure, increased subjective scores of panic, anxiety, fear, and tension, and reduced subjective scores of relaxation and happiness. Attention was focussed when inhaling CO<sub>2</sub> during the simple task, and central demand was greater when inhaling CO<sub>2</sub> during the complex task. Therefore, inhalation of 7.5% CO<sub>2</sub> produces effects on task performance which are consistent with anxiety.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Information processing and performance can be affected by individual differences in addition to task-related factors. It has been established that anxiety can hinder or improve performance depending on the specific conditions of the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881111415729">Gur et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881111415729">Spielberger, 1962</xref>), and the type of anxiety experienced (for example somatic versus cognitive anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881111415729">Morris and Liebert, 1970</xref>)). Cognitive anxiety has been suggested to interfere with performance by diverting some of the brain’s processing capacity to task-irrelevant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881111415729">Deptula et al., 1993</xref>). These effects have been clarified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881111415729">Eysenck et al. (2007)</xref> in their attention control theory, which suggests that anxiety can lead to inhibition and shifting of attention, but may not impair performance effectiveness (quality) when compensatory strategies are used (e.g. effort). If effectiveness can be protected from anxiety, detriments may show in other ways. For example, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881111415729">Bishop (2009)</xref> found highly trait-anxious participants showed reduced prefrontal activity and slower target identification in a response conflict task.</p>
<p>To determine the effects of fear and anxiety on task performance, controls are required over these variables through the use of an objective physiological induction of anxiety. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) inhalation challenges can assist in the study of anxiety because they produce (in naïve volunteers) a form of unconditioned primitive anxiety, free from the complications of learned anxiety and the variants seen in clinical anxiety disorders. CO<sub>2</sub> inhalations have been shown to have physiological and psychological components mirroring anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881111415729">Forsyth et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881111415729">Nutt and Lawson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881111415729">Wientjes and Grossman, 1994</xref>) that can be controlled, and show good test–retest reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881111415729">Poma et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>There is evidence for links between cognitive anxiety and the effects of a CO<sub>2</sub> challenge. The inhalation of CO<sub>2</sub> has been postulated to trigger the noradrenergic (NA) system, which may mediate anxiety and related performance decrements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111415729">Bailey et al., 2003</xref>). CO<sub>2</sub> can have a direct effect on the firing of NA neurones in the locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881111415729">Pineda and Aghajanian, 1997</xref>), and stimulation of the locus coeruleus may enhance arousal and attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881111415729">Aston-Jones et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881111415729">Foote et al., 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881111415729">Nieuwenhuis et al. (2005)</xref>, among others, suggest that NA improves the signal-to-noise ratio within cortical neurones, meaning an increase in NA can improve focus of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881111415729">Smith and Nutt, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In healthy volunteers, a study of the inhalation of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> showed no negative effects on reaction time, tracking or short-term memory for digits and letters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881111415729">Sheehy et al., 1982</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881111415729">Manzey and Lorenz (1998)</xref> showed an increase in ambient CO<sub>2</sub> (normally 0.04% in air) by 1.2% CO<sub>2</sub> caused impairment on a tracking task. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111415729">Harter (1967)</xref> measured the effects of 5 min exposure to 0–7.9% CO<sub>2</sub> on the electroencephalograms and reaction times of five healthy subjects. He found alpha frequency (associated with relaxed wakefulness) and reaction times were slower under 7.9% CO<sub>2</sub> compared with 0–5.5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>It is possible that these effects are motoric without a cognitive component. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881111415729">Henning et al. (1990)</xref> found some evidence for a post-exposure effect of 6% CO<sub>2</sub> on postural sway and tremor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881111415729">Hopko et al. (2003)</xref> tested arithmetic and lexical decisions under 7% CO<sub>2</sub> and found no effects of the gas mixture. They did, however, show CO<sub>2</sub> increased heart rate, skin conductance and some subjective ratings of anxiety, panic, arousal, discomfort and adversiveness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881111415729">Hopko et al. (2003)</xref> concluded that CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation manipulates emotionality (somatic arousal) but not ‘worry’. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881111415729">Bailey et al. (2005)</xref> found 7.5% CO<sub>2</sub> increased subjective reports of anxiety, fear, and tension, and decreased feelings of being relaxed and happy, demonstrating that 7.5% CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation can affect emotional response. Also, a cognitive component was demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881111415729">Sayers et al. (1987)</xref> who used increasing concentrations up to 7.5% CO<sub>2</sub> (each breathed for 20 min) to show effects on AB logic problems, subtraction, digit span, long-term recall (remembering a passage before inhalation to recall later during inhalation) and long-term registration (remembering a passage during inhalation to recall later after inhalation). They found subtractions and logic problems took longer under 20 min of 6.5–7.5% CO<sub>2</sub> than lower concentrations, but there was no effect on accuracy.</p>
<p>Mechanisms may be unclear but, as demonstrated in several studies, inhalations of low concentration CO<sub>2</sub> are suggested to be a good model for cognitive anxiety as an impairment to performance, although few effects are seen below 6% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881111415729">Sayers et al., 1987</xref>). The choice of task in anxiety and performance experiments is crucial, as different tasks are reported to affect effort, distractibility, attention, arousal and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881111415729">Hogan, 2003</xref>). There were no differences between healthy high and low-anxiety participants in the digit symbol substitution task or choice reaction task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881111415729">Garcia et al., 1998</xref>), both of which include an element of speed, indicating the effects of anxiety on performance is either task specific, or dependent on the severity of the anxiety experienced. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881111415729">Mueller (1992)</xref> suggested that impairment is task specific, in that anxiety would have a detrimental effect on the performance of complex tasks but not on easy tasks (perhaps even benefiting the latter). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881111415729">Humphreys and Revelle (1984)</xref> suggested that an easy task provokes arousal rather than cognitive anxiety, as an explanation of the difference. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881111415729">McDowd and Craik (1988)</xref> suggested that division of attention can effectively increase the complexity of a task. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881111415729">Humphreys and Revelle (1984)</xref> stated that performance decrements can occur when there is more than one task or when the task is prolonged.</p>
<p>To further investigate CO<sub>2</sub> as a model of anxiety, and to evaluate the effects of anxiety on performance, an inhalation of 7.5% CO<sub>2</sub> was used in two performance tasks of varying complexity: firstly, a simple tracking task with a reaction time measure and, secondly, a complex task with division of attention. Findings and theories suggest mechanisms can be employed to maintain effectiveness of performance but possibly to the detriment of efficacy. For example, reaction time tests can elucidate central processing capacity, in that a delay or slowing can indicate demands on central processing capacity and/or attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881111415729">Crombez et al., 1994</xref>). The simple tracking task was chosen to investigate this suggested trade-off between accuracy and speed. The second task was chosen as a ‘real world’ task which uses different cognitive systems and modalities.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Experiment 1 included eight healthy male participants aged between 21 and 40 years (mean age 27.0). Experiment 2 included 12 healthy participants (six male and six female) aged between 19 and 32 years (mean age 23.6). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881111415729">Table 1</xref> shows basic demographic information about participants. All participants passed strict medical inclusion/exclusion criteria and signed written informed consent before participation. Prior to inclusion, participants were given a physical examination, including an electrocardiogram, and medical histories were taken. Participants were interviewed by a psychiatrist to ensure no history of significant mental disorder, or first-degree relatives with severe anxiety or panic disorder. All were judged to be within normal ranges of the Spielberger Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI). Participants were asked to avoid alcohol for 36 h prior to testing, and this was checked with a breath alcohol test on arrival. A urine sample was given by each participant to test for drugs of abuse. Participants were also asked to avoid caffeine for 12 h prior to testing. Compensation was given for the participants’ time, and all ethical permissions were provided by the University Hospitals Bristol NHS Trust Research Ethics Committee.</p>

<title>CO<sub>2</sub> inhalations</title>
<p>Delivery of gas was via a nasal–oral exercise face mask (Hans Rudolf, Kansas) which was connected via tubing to a 500 L reservoir bag filled with CO<sub>2</sub> mixture (CO<sub>2</sub> 7.5% / O<sub>2</sub> 21% / N<sub>2</sub> 71.5%) or medical air. The reservoir bag was filled via cylinders which were covered to ensure single-blind delivery and to help ensure similar levels of anticipatory anxiety in all participants. In experiment 1, air was always presented first, before CO<sub>2</sub>, to reduce the possibility of carry-over effects. This order was not revealed to the participants, who believed the order was random. In experiment 2, the delivery of CO<sub>2</sub> or air was counterbalanced. The CO<sub>2</sub> challenge consisted of 20 min inhalation of medical air, followed by a 30 min rest period, then 20 min inhalation of CO<sub>2</sub>. Two experimenters remained within sight of the participant during inhalations as a safety measure. Participants were able to terminate the inhalations at any point, and remained in the testing room until they were deemed well enough to leave.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269881111415729">
<title>Physiological measures</title>
<p>Beat-to-beat systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) were measured continuously throughout the inhalations using the Finapres (Ohmeda, Englewood, CO, USA). Participants wore a finger cuff with a photosensitive cell connected via a servo-controlled pump, which inflated the cuff to maintain a constant pressure in the finger (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881111415729">Coupland et al., 1995</xref>). During each gas inhalation the hand was rested in one position in order to minimise movement.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269881111415729">
<title>Subjective measures</title>
<p>For the Visual Analogue Scales (VAS), participants were presented with cards, each showing a line labelled from 0 (not at all) to 100 (the most ever) which measured the following feelings: alert, fearful, relaxed, happy, feel like leaving the room, and paralysed (and ease of task in experiment 1). Participants were asked to give a number from 0 to 100 to describe how they were feeling. These scales have been used previously to demonstrate the subjective effects of CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881111415729">Bailey et al., 2005</xref>). Assessments of current feelings were made at 30, 20 and 10 min before the first inhalation, plus directly after and 10 min after each inhalation. Immediately after each inhalation, participants also rated how they were feeling during the peak effects of the gas.</p>
<p>The Panic Symptom Inventory (PSI) was administered at baseline, at the end of each inhalation, and for peak effects of inhalation. This consists of 34 panic symptoms (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881111415729">Clark and Hemsley, 1982</xref>), and was used to rate panic anxiety and the associated symptoms of autonomic arousal, with the option of rating symptoms as 0 = not at all, 1 = slight, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = very severe.</p>
<p>The state subscale of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (SSAI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881111415729">Spielberger, 1983</xref>) was used in experiment 1 before each inhalation, and it was used in experiment 2 to measure state anxiety at baseline and 10 min after the end of each inhalation period. Baseline measures of mood in the participants were achieved using the trait subscale of the STAI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881111415729">Spielberger, 1983</xref>) and the BDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881111415729">Beck and Steer, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>The Defence Research Agency Workload Scales (DRAWS) were used to assess workload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881111415729">Jordan and Farmer, 1995</xref>). Participants rate the demands of the task associated with a) receiving the information necessary to perform the task; b) performing mental operations on this information; c) making responses; and d) the time pressure associated with the task. The DRAWS were used 10 min after the end of each inhalation period in experiment 2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269881111415729">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This was a single-blind, within-subjects design. The independent variable was the type of gas (CO<sub>2</sub> or air). Dependent variables included HR, SBP and DBP, VAS, PSI, and SSAI. Experiment 2 also included DRAWS. Performance measures of experiment 1 included the root mean square error (RMS) and number of edge violations of the primary tracking task, and the response time, correct, late, missed and false responses to the secondary task digit input task. Performance measures of experiment 2 included the percentage of new target and information correct responses, mean reaction time (RT) for all new target and information correct responses, percentage of targets identified and audio correct responses, and mean RT for all targets identified and audio correct responses. Participants attended the research facility for one screening session, followed by one test day, and also received a follow-up telephone call a day after testing to check their health. In experiment 2, participants also completed a task familiarisation session 5–21 days prior to test day (without gas inhalations). All data were analysed using SPSS version 11.5 for Windows.</p>

<title>Computerised tracking task</title>
<p>Continuous tracking and digit input tasks were performed from 3 min before inhalation until 3 min post-inhalation. The primary task was a joystick operated single-axis compensatory tracking task that required the participant to maintain the position of the cursor between two vertical target lines. The secondary task was a target digit recognition RT task which appeared above the tracking line. Here, digits 0–9 appeared, and participants were required to press the spacebar on their keyboard each time the number 7 appeared. Approximately 10 min of joystick practice time was provided before experimentation.</p>

<title>Task data</title>
<p>Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks tests were performed on the following variables: RMS error, standard deviation (sd) of the RMS error and number of edge deviations (primary task), number of correct, late, missed and false responses and RT for response (secondary task). Data are expressed as a mean of the 16-min period (two blocks combined) for the primary and secondary task. The number of participants included in the analysis was seven due to missing data. There were no significant differences between CO<sub>2</sub> and air in the primary tracking task. A large effect was found for RMS error, in that error was reduced under CO<sub>2</sub> compared with air. In the secondary digit RT task there were significantly more correct responses (<italic>z</italic> = 2.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and significantly fewer late responses (<italic>z</italic> = 2.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) under CO<sub>2</sub> than air. There were no significant differences between the CO<sub>2</sub> and air conditions for false and missed responses, although there was a large effect of more missed responses under CO<sub>2</sub> compared with air. Mean RT was significantly slower under CO<sub>2</sub> than air (<italic>z</italic> = 2.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).

<title>Radar task</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0269881111415729">Figure 3</xref> shows the radar task. This task was provided by QinetiQ Ltd., a defence and security company, developed for the study of performance under circumstances such as fear. Participants were presented with a circular radar display on the left of the screen. In the centre of the radar was an orange dot which represented the home position. The objective of the task was to detect and identify targets which appeared on screen as small dots. Firstly, targets would appear as green dots, on which a left mouse button click would reveal information about the target. On the right of the screen was a panel where this information was entered via a drop-down menu. Not all required information was available until the target approached. When new information was available, the target would turn blue, and the new information could be accessed again via a left mouse button click. When all the information had been entered, participants could click an ‘Identify’ button. This showed a three-letter code in the ‘Contact type’ box, and when this box was double-clicked, the target was identified on screen. Once identified, a threat value was calculated based on speed and type of target, and the target was then added to a threat list. After targets had left the screen, participants were required to remove them from the threat list. A secondary task was also used, where participants were required to respond to audio prompts using keyboard presses. The audio prompts were questions regarding the task (e.g. ‘how many hostile targets on screen?’) to which participants had to type their answers into a response box.</p>

<p>There were six priorities on this task, namely to click on new targets as soon as they appeared, to click on targets as soon as they changed colour, to enter information as soon as it became available, to calculate the threat for each target, to delete targets when they had moved off screen, and to respond to audio prompts.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of these studies was to investigate the use of the 7.5% CO<sub>2</sub> challenge as a model for studying the effects of fear and anxiety on performance. A clear physiological effect of the CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation was observed, as HR and blood pressure (BP) were increased in the studies where they were measured. These physiological effects replicate findings from other CO<sub>2</sub> studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881111415729">Bailey et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881111415729">2007</xref>). This may be due to a NA effect of CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation, as noradrenaline is associated with an increase in BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111415729">Bailey et al., 2003</xref>), and the locus coeruleus is implicated in hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881111415729">Singewald and Philippu, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Subjective effects of CO<sub>2</sub> were shown in both studies, with increases in feelings of fear and anxiety, reported as maximal directly after inhalation. Scores for panic symptoms and state anxiety were higher under CO<sub>2</sub> than air. This indicates that the CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation provokes anxiety rather than simply being viewed as a ‘challenge’ by participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881111415729">Zvolensky and Eifert, 2001</xref>). CO<sub>2</sub> also decreased reported feelings of being happy, relaxed, and alert, the latter only in the radar task. It is interesting that feelings of alertness in this task were reduced as CO<sub>2</sub> is thought to be arousing. The task may have been too monotonous, and perhaps the complexity of the task may have been unintentionally lessened by dividing the information in the task between visual and auditory modalities. However, BP, whilst completing the task, was relatively high even during the air inhalation condition, indicating that the task was demanding rather than monotonous. Also, workload DRAWS scores showed increased central demand during the CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation, which may indicate that the task did require cognitive effort in an attempt to compensate for the effects of the CO<sub>2</sub>. This increased central demand and greater cognitive effort may be due to increased control processes required to compensate for an automatic (unintended) appraisal of threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881111415729">Mogg and Bradley, 1998</xref>). Although automatic, these processes may still require low-level resources, which may result in interference with other operations. An example is the slowing in reaction times on the colour-naming Stroop task, where semantic content interferes with naming the colour the word is written in. The subjective effort of breathing CO<sub>2</sub> may be using up resources, as anxiety has been shown to, indicating CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation may share mechanisms with anxiety. However, it is unclear as to whether the consumed resources are due to anxiety itself or the physical discomfort of the inhalation.</p>
<p>In the tracking experiment, no performance decrements were noted in the tracking task, supporting the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881111415729">Sheehy et al. (1982)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881111415729">Garcia et al. (1998)</xref>. In fact, a larger sample may have shown an improvement in tracking under CO<sub>2</sub> compared with air. However, significant detrimental effects were seen in the secondary digit response task. More correct responses and fewer late responses were made during the inhalation of CO<sub>2</sub>, but this was achieved by sacrificing speed of response. This may be indicative of practice effects, as gas presentation was not counterbalanced, but participants viewed the task as equally ‘easy’ under air or CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation. Another explanation might be reduced attentional resources, but the findings can also be interpreted as increased focus on the ‘core’ aspect of the task when under CO<sub>2</sub> with subsequent reductions in cognitive resource (and hence performance) for the secondary tasks.</p>
<p>A focussing of attention would support the idea that simple ‘thoughtless’ tasks, which do not involve memory, can be improved by arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881111415729">Humphreys and Revelle, 1984</xref>), supporting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881111415729">Mueller’s (1992)</xref> conclusion that anxiety may improve performance in certain tasks. The slowed performance combined with improved task measures may again indicate a focussing of attention on accuracy rather than a distraction away from speed, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881111415729">Eysenck et al. (2007)</xref>. Similar findings were reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881111415729">Sayers et al. (1987)</xref> using 6.5–7.5% CO<sub>2</sub>, where RT was slowed but accuracy was unaffected, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881111415729">Harter (1967)</xref> found slowed reaction times using 7.9% CO<sub>2</sub>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881111415729">Bailey et al. (2007)</xref> showed that more correct answers on the Manikin task (a learning task where participants must cognitively manipulate a humanoid shape to determine in which hand a paddle is held) were achieved on placebo during a 7.5% CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation compared with placebo during an inhalation of air. A focus of attention may be due to NA effects of the CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881111415729">Bailey et al. 2003</xref>), as increases in noradrenaline have been shown to reduce attentional flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881111415729">Smith and Nutt, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881111415729">Alexander et al. (2007)</xref> proposed that it is ‘noise’ which provides cognitive flexibility (the ability not to make a dominant, non-flexible response), meaning those under stress may be inflexible.</p>
<p>If not simply reduced resources, research indicates that CO<sub>2</sub>-induced anxiety performance decrements may be due to inappropriate focus of attention rather than distractibility. If any task-irrelevant factors are attended to, then performance on the key task will be impaired. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881111415729">Ververs and Wickens (1998)</xref> found pilots focused on their display to the detriment of other sources of information, which led to a decrease in situational awareness and vulnerability to error. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881111415729">Recarte and Nunes (2003)</xref> studied the effects of mental load, visual search and decision making in a simulated driving task. They found that as workload increased, there was less scanning of non-central task features. Increases in noradrenaline and cortisol can increase emotional information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881111415729">Coull et al. 2004</xref>), which may also distract from the task in hand. Research has shown that anxiety can impair performance because of threat-related attentional biases, meaning anxious individuals will show increased attention to threat-related stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881111415729">Bar-Haim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881111415729">Mogg and Bradley, 1998</xref>). CO<sub>2</sub>-induced attentional biases are yet to be explored fully, and further research into the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation on emotion and threat paradigms is required. To date, two studies have investigated emotional bias during a CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881111415729">Cooper et al. (2011)</xref> used emotional faces during a dot-probe task and a 7.5% CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation, and found results too inconsistent for conclusion. However, in a second study by this group, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881111415729">Garner et al. (2011)</xref> found a 7.5% CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation induced erroneous eye movements towards negative images on antisaccade trials, showing that the inhalation elicited the threat-related attentional bias seen in anxiety.</p>
<p>In addition to those already mentioned, there were some limitations to the current experiments. The numbers of participants were small, particularly in the first experiment, and our findings should therefore be interpreted with caution if the experiments were underpowered. However, the effect sizes in experiment 1 were large. The gas presentation in the first experiment was not counterbalanced and therefore some habituation effects to the inhalation procedure may have occurred, and there was a general reduction in alertness as the session progressed. Some encouraging effects were found, and replication with a larger sample with more design controls is advised. Other tasks need to be employed, and a more sophisticated experiment may provide more insight into task-specific (cognitive system specific) effects. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881111415729">Ziemann et al. (2009)</xref> have demonstrated a direct effect of CO<sub>2</sub> on the amygdala, opening the possibilities for the use of CO<sub>2</sub> inhalations in fear memory research.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest the 7.5% CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation may have produced the anticipated effects of a focussing of attention. It is difficult to conclude whether, with respect to task performance, CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation affects cognitive anxiety or somatic anxiety (arousal) alone. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881111415729">Humphreys and Revelle (1984)</xref> concluded that easy tasks can be affected more by arousal than anxiety, whilst difficult tasks can be affected more by anxiety than arousal. This conclusion is demonstrated by the experiments reported here. The accuracy of the RT component in the tracking task was improved, perhaps due to focussing of attention. This indicates that the inhalation of CO<sub>2</sub> produced arousal effects in this simple task. In addition, the increase in central demand and lack of performance decrements in the more complex radar task indicates that the inhalation of CO<sub>2</sub> leads to anxiety, and that effects are not simply due to arousal. Cognitive components may be manipulated by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation, supporting the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881111415729">Bailey et al. (2005)</xref>.</p>
