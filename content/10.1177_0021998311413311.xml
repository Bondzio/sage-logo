<abstract>
<p>OLS were incorporated in various amounts (0.1 to 5 wt.%) in VE. The intercalants of synthetic fluorohectorite were TMDA and OAE, respectively. The latter quaternary amine was expected to support the intercalation/exfoliation of the silicate by participating in the crosslinking reactions. Both OLS types became intercalated based on X-ray diffractograms. DMTA displayed a slight increase in the stiffness by adding OLS. The glass transition temperature did not change practically with the OLS type and content. Fracture mechanical tests were performed on CT specimens. Both the fracture toughness (K<sub>c</sub>,maximum improvement ca. 45%) and fracture energy (G<sub>c</sub>, maximum improvement ca. 100%) increased with increasing OLS content. As expected, OAE proved to be a more suitable intercalant than TMDA in respect to the overall property profile. The failure mode of the specimens was studied in a SEM and discussed. The fractographic inspection revealed that the composites contained abundant OLS microparticles triggering crack pinning and crack bifurcations.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311413311" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vinyl ester (VE) resins are widely used in various application fields, for example, aerospace, construction, automobile, etc. due to their favorite performance/cost balance. From the viewpoint of mechanical performance, thermal, and chemical resistances VEs are located between unsaturated polyester and epoxy resins. VE resins, like all thermosetting resins, are brittle and their ability to absorb energy during fracture is limited. Incorporation of inorganic fillers into VE leads to improvements in various physical, mechanical, and thermal properties, such as significant enhancements in modulus or strength, reduced moisture absorption, improved thermal stability, and upgraded flame resistance. These improvements are the result of a complex interplay between the properties of the individual constituent phases: the polymer, the filler, and the interfacial region. Filler characteristics such as the particle size, structure, and aspect ratio have a large influence onthe physico-mechanical performance of polymer composites. Organophilic clays (when based on natural products) and layered silicates (OLS – organophilic layered silicates – when based on synthetic products) were seldom used to modify VEs compared to epoxy resins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311413311">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311413311">6</xref></sup> The organophilic modified clays (‘organoclays’) used were mostly commercial products containing saturated quaternary amines as intercalants. Attempts were, however, already made to use also such organoclays containing intercalants (modifiers) which are capable in the peroxide-initiated crosslinking reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311413311">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311413311">9</xref></sup> In our companion paper dealing with vinyl ester-urethane hybrid resins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311413311">9</xref></sup> it has been emphasized that a co-reactive intercalant of the layered silicate does not necessarily yield better properties than a non-reactive one. On the other hand, the toughness of the corresponding resin could be well improved by adding OLS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311413311">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our interest was focused to study the effects of OLS with non- and co-reactive intercalants on the dynamic-mechanical and fracture properties peroxide-initiated styrene-crosslinked VE resins. Two quaternary amines (with and without double bonds) served as organophilic modifiers (intercalants) of the synthetic layered silicate. The former version was expected to support the intercalation/exfoliation of the silicate, being able to participate in the free radical-induced crosslinking process, and thus to guarantee better properties.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021998311413311"><title>Experimental</title>
<p>A commercial bisphenol-A based bismethacryloxy type VE (Daron® ZW6148; styrene content: 30 wt.%), a product of DSM Composite Resins (Zwolle, The Netherlands), was selected for this work. The recipe of VE was as follows: 100 parts VE, 1.5 parts dibenzoylperoxide initiator, and 0.1 parts N,N-diethylaniline accelerator. The pristine layered silicate was a synthetic sodium fluorohectorite (Somasif® ME-100 of Co-op Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) with a cation exchange capacity of 100 meq/100 g and an intergallery distance of 0.95 nm. For its organophilic modification – via cation exchange–trimethyl dodecylamine chloride (TMDA) and octadecylamine – N,N-bis[allyl(2-hydroxypropyl) ether] hydrochloride (OAE)–were selected. Their chemical composition is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311413311">Figure 1</xref>.
<fig id="fig1-0021998311413311" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Chemical composition of the intercalants TMDA and OAE used. Note that OAE bears double bonds and thus prone to participate in the peroxide-induced crosslinking process.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311413311-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The organophilic treatment of the fluorohectorite was performed by the group of Prof. Mülhaupt in Freiburg, Germany. The intergallery distance and silicate content of the TMDA- and OAE-modified OLS were 1.86 nm and 80 wt%, and 2.85 nm and 65 wt.%, respectively, according to X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). OLS was incorporated in the VE resin in 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 2.5, and 5 wt. % amounts. The nanocomposites were produced and cured as described below. First, OLS was added to the VE resin under mechanical stirring (speed: 2000 rpm, time: 10 min). After homogenization the mixture was subjected to repeated degassing to expel the air bubbles. The mixture was left overnight. Then the peroxide was added, followed by the activator, and the mixture was homogenized by stirring at 150 rpm for less than 1 min. Afterwards the mixture was degassed and poured into open molds manufactured from polytetrafluoro ethylene (PTFE). Note that the time to dose all crosslinking agents along with the resin homogenization was less than 15 min. The PTFE molds were put in a thermostatic oven and cured at the following cycle: 50°C–15 min, 80°C–30 min, 140°C – 30 min, and finally 180°C–60 min. The molds were then cooled to ambient temperature overnight and the specimens removed.</p>
<sec id="sec3-0021998311413311"><title>Nanocomposites characterization</title>
<p>XRD spectra were collected in reflection mode using Nifiltered CuK<sub>α</sub> radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm) by a D500 difractometer (Siemens, Munich, Germany) operating at 40 kV and 30 mA. The samples were scanned in stepmode (5 s/step, step = 0.05°) in the range of 2θ = 0.6–10°. XRD spectra from the OLS powders and VE-OLS systems were taken.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0021998311413311"><title>Testing</title>
<p>The thermo-mechanical performance of the nanocomposites was studied by dynamic-mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. DMTA traces (storage modulus, E’; the mechanical loss factor, tan δ; vs. temperature) were determined by an Eplexor 25 N device (Gabo Qualimeter, Ahlden, Germany) in flexural mode at 10 Hz frequency. The scan rate set for a broad temperature range (T = -100°C &gt; + 300°C) was 1°C/min. DSC traces were recorded by a DSC821 device of Mettler Toledo (Gießen, Germany) at 10°C/min heating rate in the temperature range of 25°C–300°C. For the glass transition temperatuire (T<sub>g</sub>) of the resins the mid point of the glass transition step was considered. The fracture toughness (K<sub>c</sub>) and fracture energy (G<sub>c</sub>) were determined on the compact tension (CT) specimens (dimension: 35 mm × 35 mm × 3 mm). The CT specimens were produced by pouring the resins to open PTFE molds and their curing occurred in a thermostatic oven as described above. The CT specimens were notched by sawing and the notch root sharpened by razor blade tapping prior to testing on a Zwick 1445 machine (Zwick, Ulm, Germany) at room temperature with crosshead speed v = 1 mm/min. K<sub>c</sub> and G<sub>c</sub>, assumed to represent plane strain values, were computed in accordance with theESIS testing protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311413311">10</xref></sup> and the related standard.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311413311">11</xref></sup> The CT specimens underwent typical brittle fracture (characterized by sharp triangular shape load-load line displacement curves), eventually with limited small-scale yielding (very small deviation in the linearly increasing load prior to brittle fracture). Accordingly, the CT specimens fractured under plain strain condition. The fracture surface of the CT specimens was inspected in a scanning electron microscope (SEM; JSM-5400 of Jeol, Tokyo, Japan). Prior to SEM the fracture surfaces were sputtered with a Pt/Pd alloy to create a conductive cover layer.</p></sec></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311413311">Figure 2(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311413311">b</xref>) display the XRD spectra taken from selected VE + OLS(TMDA) and VE + OLS(OAE) systems. The related figures also contain the XRD spectra of the original OLS powders.
<fig id="fig2-0021998311413311" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>XRD spectra of the a) VE+OLS(TMDA) and b) VEUH+OLS(OAE) nanocomposites. Note that the XRD spectra of the OLS types, used in powder form, are also included.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311413311-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The XRD spectra in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311413311">Figure 2</xref> suggest that both OLS types have been exfoliated when added in 0.5 wt.%. This may be, however, an artifact linked with the very low amount of OLS in the VE. It will be shown later in the fractography section that hardly any exfoliation of theOLS happened. At 5 wt.% OLS contents pronounced intercalation phenomena can be resolved. The initial intergallery distance (d<sub>001</sub>) of OLS(TMDA) has been increased from 1.86 to 3.00 nm (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311413311">Figure 2(a)</xref>). A similar, however, a relatively smaller change in the XRD spectrum has been noticed for the OLS(OAE): the initial d<sub>001</sub> value increased from 2.85 to 3.57 nm owing to intercalation with the molecules of VE. As expected, the initial intercalant (modifier) OAE proved to be better than TMDA.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0021998311413311"><title>DMTA behavior</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311413311">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311413311">4</xref> depict the E’ vs. T and the tan δ vs. T traces for the VE + OLS(TMDA) and VE + OLS(OAE) nanocomposites, respectively, at selected OLS contents. The incorporation of OLS in lesser amounts than 0.5 wt.% had a negligible effect on the stiffness vs. temperature response. In general, a small improvement in the stiffness (i.e. E’) was observed for all the VE + OLS systems when comparing them to the pristine VE. In particular the OLS(OAE) yielded the most significant stiffness increase, in a given temperature interval. This may be derived from the fact that OAE possess double bonds (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311413311">Figure 1</xref>), similar to VE, which is thus involved in the crosslinking reactions between VE and styrene. The small improvement in the stiffness suggests that OLS is mostly present in microparticles. This will be confirmed by fractographic results (see later).
<fig id="fig3-0021998311413311" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>E vs. T and tan δ vs. T traces for selected VE + OLS(TMDA) systems.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311413311-fig3.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig4-0021998311413311" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>E vs. T and tan δ vs. T traces for selected VE + OLS(OAE) systems.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311413311-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Regarding the tan δ vs. T traces one can observe that the modification with OLS affected marginally the T<sub>g</sub> of the nanocomposites. The OLS type and amount did not reduce significantly the T<sub>g</sub> unlike to organoclay modified epoxy resins. Note that in the latter systems the T<sub>g</sub> reduction is usually explained by absorption phenomena being affected also by the onium intercalant (altering the stoichiometry locally). The fact that no shift in the T<sub>g</sub> occurred is a further hint for the presence of a microcomposite. It is noteworthy that the conversion of VE might have also been affected by the OLS which was, however, not studied in this work. It can be observed that the intensity of the T<sub>g</sub> peaks of the VE + OLS(OAE) composites is moderately lower than those of VE + OLS(TMDA). This suggests that OLS(OAE) works as a better reinforcement than OLS (TMDA). This is confirmed when one compares the E’ vs. T traces of VE + OLS(TMDA) and VE + OLS(OAE) – cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311413311">Figures 3</xref> and<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311413311">4</xref>.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0021998311413311"><title>Fracture mechanics and failure behavior</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311413311">Figure 5</xref> shows the changes in fracture toughness (K<sub>c</sub>) and fracture energy (G<sub>c</sub>) values as a function of OLS types and contents. Observing the graph, it is clear that the addition of OLS to VE affected positively both K<sub>c</sub> and G<sub>c</sub>. For both OLS types a clear tendency is noticeable, viz. the fracture toughness and fracture energy are enhanced with increasing OLS content. Small deviation from this tendency – see the K<sub>c</sub> and G<sub>c</sub> values of VE + OLS(TMDA) at low OLS contents – is probably due to heterogeneity issues. This is confirmed by the enlarged scatter ranges (cf. VE + OLS(TMDA) 0.25). It is noteworthy that OLS(OAE) acted as more suited ‘toughening agent’ than OLS(TMDA). The increments in K<sub>c</sub> and G<sub>c</sub> with 5 wt.% OLS(OAE) were found at about 45% and 100%, respectively (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311413311">Figure 5</xref>).
<fig id="fig5-0021998311413311" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Fracture toughness (K<sub>c</sub>; hatched bar) and energy (G<sub>c</sub>; white bar) values of the VE + OLS systems as a function of OLS types and amounts.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311413311-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The fracture surface of the unmodified VE, displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311413311">Figure 6</xref>, is smooth and mirror-like confirming its brittle behavior (being quantified by very low K<sub>c</sub> and G<sub>c</sub> values). The mechanism of toughening is well represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311413311">Figure 7</xref>. It is clearly observable that crack pinning, that is, provisional stopping (‘bowing’) at the silicate particles and reunification of the crack front after passing the particles, is responsible for the improved toughness of the OLS-modified systems compared to the initial VE. The silicate layers, as observable in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311413311">Figure <bold>7</bold></xref>, are present in agglomerated stacks, the layers of which are intercalated according to XRD. With increasing OLS content, larger agglomerates in higher amounts can be resolved. Furthermore, the higher the OLS content is, the more intense the crack pinning associated with marked deviations from the final crack plane.

<p>Based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311413311">Figure 8</xref> one can observe the differences between the two OLS types intercalated by TMDA and OAE, respectively. Both composites containing the same OLS content (= 5 wt.%) failed via crack pinning associated with crack bifurcation caused by the large OLS agglomerates. The OLS(TMDA) is a bit finer and more uniformly dispersed than the OLS(OAE). As a consequence, the fracture surface of VE + OLS(TMDA) appears smoother than that of VE + OLS(OAE). On the other hand, according to the well accepted rule of thumb, the rougher the fracture surface is the higher are the related fracture mechanical parameters. This is in line with the achieved results, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311413311">Figure 5</xref>.

<sec id="sec9-0021998311413311" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This work was devoted to study the effects (type and amount) of OLS on the structure and fracture properties of VE. As intercalants synthesized fluorohectorite a non-reactive TMDA and a co-reactive modifier OAE were used. Based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn:</p>
<p>• modification with a co-reactive modifier OAE resulted in a slightly better intercalation of the silicate than with the non-reactive TMDA according to XRD results. However, SEM inspection of the composites’ fracture surface revealed the presence of agglomerated silicate stacks. Their size and amount increased with increasing amount of the OLS.</p>
<p>• The OLS type and content had small effects on the dynamic mechanical thermal (viz. stiffness, glass transition temperature) properties. By contrast, the fracture toughness (K<sub>c</sub>) and energy (G<sub>c</sub>) were markedly improved with increasing OLS amount. The co-reactive OLS(OAE) outperformed the non-reactive OLS(TMDA) in respect to fracture mechanical data. The failure mechanisms of the VE + OLS nano/microcomposites were the same: crack pinning along with crack deviation.</p></sec>
