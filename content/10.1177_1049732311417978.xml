<p>Autoethnography is a method with roots in anthropology. The branches extend to humanities, other social sciences and, increasingly, the health sciences. Chang and Muncey articulate the methodology of autoethnography while illustrating the method. The authors take readers on markedly different routes. This comparative book review is one example of how very different approaches stem from a similar sociocultural framework.</p>
<p>Chang’s book is divided into three parts. The historical and theoretical concepts of culture and self are discussed in great detail in the first two chapters. Her anthropological background shines through as she connects culture, self, and the other to qualitative research. This discussion makes way for her articulation of why self-narratives are not enough when doing autoethnography. Section one concludes with a historical and theoretical discussion of autoethnography, followed by the benefits and pitfalls of choosing this method. Before moving to the next section, Chang cautions that the “mixed bag labeled autoethnography” (p. 56) refers to a variety of narrative inquiries, and has created much confusion among researchers and readers. She suggests researchers define their choice clearly to avoid confusion. This section concludes with Chang describing the book’s focus on cross-cultural autobiographical data with ethnographic methodology and intent.</p>
<p>As a professor who directs a qualitative methods seminar, I appreciate how Chang methodically lays out how to do autoethnographic research. The first chapter in section two begins with how to find a research topic and ends with a discussion of ethical issues. The ethical section is brief, but gives the reader enough information to consider beforehand how to negotiate the identities of people who may become intertwined in the autoethnography. She writes, “As you play a multi-faceted role as researcher, informant, and author, you should be reminded that your story is never in a vacuum and others are always visible or invisible participants in your story” (p. 69).</p>
<p>The keywords that best describe the second section are <italic>validate, triangulate, self-observational</italic>, and <italic>self-reflective data</italic>. Each chapter has a list, chart, graph, or exercise to assist the autoethnographer with everything from how to find a topic to how to collect self-observational and external data. Data collection is described at the macro and micro levels. Collecting, evaluating, and organizing data is described as a multilayered activity that paves the way for analysis and ultimately interpretation. The primary exercise involves prioritizing items from categorized themes. Although Chang suggests the data collection process is messy, the steps she provides are tidy.</p>
<p>Section three pushes the autoethnographer to begin writing. The first chapter discusses data management, whereas the second explains analysis and interpretation. Here again, keywords are helpful: <italic>label, classify</italic>, and <italic>refine</italic>. Chang echoes Norman Denzin and Yvonna Lincoln when she writes that there are no quick and easy results in autoethnography. She goes on to remind readers that “autoethnographic data analysis and interpretation involve shifting your attention back and forth between self and others, the personal and the social context” (p. 125). The zooming in and out of collected data approach to analysis and interpretation is much like the micro and macro approaches to data collection. Zooming in, according to Chang, allows the researcher to focus on one data set at a time. She describes zooming out as the “birds-eye view to the data, which enable you to see how your own case is related to others, and how your case is connected to its context, and how the past has left traces in the present” (p. 129).</p>
<p>Chang constructs and contextualizes how data analysis and interpretation in autoethnography make sense in a social science field. The section that solidly contextualizes this as a guide for quantitative researchers coming to autoethnography, or more generally, qualitative research methods, is titled “Frame with Theories.” She writes,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The term “theory” in this strategy does not imply a hard core “tested hypothesis” in a scientific sense. Rather, I use the term casually to refer to a conjecture or postulate that explains a social phenomenon. Theories, therefore, are considered as explaining tools. (p. 137)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This section effectively explains to a novice qualitative researcher how autoethnography is more than autobiographical, and has a theoretical framework which comes from a body of relevant literature.</p>
<p>The final chapter outlines autoethnographic writing typologies. Chang gives details about four writing styles: descriptive-realistic, confessional-emotive, analytical-interpretive, and imaginative-creating. She then encourages the reader to develop his or her own writing style. The appendices supply an extensive bibliography of self-narratives, including autoethnographies, memoirs, and autobiographies, along with useful writing exercises and examples. Overall, Chang’s <italic>Autoethnography as Method</italic> tells the reader how to conceptualize, develop, analyze, interpret, and write an autoethnographic project.</p>
<p>Tessa Muncey shows the reader how to craft an autoethnography through her stories. <italic>Creating Autoethnography</italic> is written in a conversational style. She seamlessly marries her stories with social issues, theory, and the challenges of doing autoethnography. Each of the seven chapters begins with a preview list and ends with a bulleted summary list and a box containing further readings.</p>
<p>The first chapter not only introduces the reader to the author, but the concepts of how and where to find a research topic. Muncey discloses how she came to her research and how autoethnography has emerged as a qualitative research method. She explains:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I rarely come across people who set out to do autoethnography but I do rather meet many people who resort to it as a means of getting across intangible and complex feelings and experiences that somehow can’t be told in conventional ways, or because the literature they are reading is not telling their story. (p. 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Recognizing that autoethnography is not linear or neat, Muncey uses her earlier drafts and ultimately published works to display how subjectivity enhances the research, can effectively disturb the dominant social discourse, and can bring about policy change.</p>
<p>The self is taken up largely in the next two chapters. Sense of self and reflexivity dominate Chapter Two, whereas Chapter Three engages the reader in how to make sense of individual experience. Muncey takes the reader on a journey through her personal, academic, and professional experiences. Here, she shows us how she arrives at the material that becomes contextualized through a theoretical framework grounded in psychology and social theory. The stories are interwoven with popular literature, music, and poetry. These too weave through the theoretical framework in a way that puts her story together in a narrative that represents “a flow of experiences, actions and events, a distillation of life so far coupled with an anticipation of the future” (p. 23). Yet, Muncey is clear that the self, the individual, is ever-changing; that reflexivity is paramount to one’s view of self in the world.</p>
<p>The messy world is where self, society, and autoethnography collide. In Chapter Three Muncey argues that “in our attempts to achieve internal validity in research at the expense of ecological validity, the complexity of individual experiences gets lost in the wash” (p. 28). She goes on to explain how autoethnography resides in what Rapport et al. refer to as the Edgelands. Muncey broadly describes four autoethnographic approaches. Not unlike her stories, the approaches are not bulleted or subtitled, but briefly described in a manner that leaves room for reader interpretation. This does not mean that the definitions are not clear. The citations and examples leave little to question about each approach. What are missing are labels that I suspect the author would have seen as meaningless. Rather than explain to the “uninitiated” reader the methodology of autoethnography, Muncey uses others’ stories to illustrate current debates and paradigmatic concerns. She also addresses other methods that overlap and intertwine with autoethnography. Creativity takes center stage in the chapter on planning an ethnographic account. Muncy writes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is our capacity for reflexivity, the awareness of being aware, that allows us to represent and re-present the products of our imaginations in a variety of ways. I would even go so far as to say we have a destiny to be creative. Unfortunately, we have a tendency to label our creative endeavours as hobbies and struggle to keep the serious world of work/research in an objective style. (p. 55)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What follows in Chapter Four are examples of creative, artistic, and simplistic tools and tactics. Photographs, poetry, “manufactured” artifacts, and stories of how these may be used are eloquently displayed. The chapter concludes with reflections on starting to write as well as descriptions of writing phases. Muncey shares a diary entry, asks who we are writing for, and closes with a discussion of voice.</p>
<p>Chapters Five and Six prepare the reader for what one may expect after writing an autoethnographic account. In “Making Sense of Autographic Texts” she articulates how “producing text for an audience will always invite critical review” (p. 107), including questions related to memory, legitimacy, coherence, and self-indulgence. It is at the end of this chapter that Muncey initially makes explicit mention of ethics. She invokes Adams’ overview of narrative ethics (p. 106) to argue that ethics is a “continually negotiable set of responsibilities between the author the story and the author and the reader” (p. 108). I would argue that whereas Muncey sees Chapter Six as separate and apart from the previous five, it is an example; a template of how and why Chapter Five is necessary.</p>
<p>The last chapter is dedicated to songwriting. Muncey pays homage to the “exquisite synchronicities” that have guided the book’s development through song. Sharing the spotlight with David Carless and a host of autoethnographers, she sets out to illustrate how autoethnographers can learn about process from songrwriters. Unlike the previous chapters, this one contains multiple voices in the writing of the chapter. The text is messy and asks more questions than reveals answers. What a creative way to end the process. For now.</p>
<p>The author of each text takes a different approach to autoethnography. Chang calls for a “disciplined” artistic dimension of autoethnography as a way to systematically collect and analyze data rather than rely “merely on personal impressions and reflections” (p. 130). Muncy makes no such claims, but instead reveals to readers the mistakes she made and lessons learned while doing and writing autoethnography. There are other nuances that set the authors apart. Chang refers to “others” in an autoethnographic text as <italic>subjects</italic>, while Muncey privileges the terms <italic>participant</italic> and <italic>informant</italic>. Finally, there is an ongoing discussion concerning autoethnography and the anonymity of primary, secondary, and tertiary figures in an autoethngraphic text. Although the authors have markedly different opinions on the subject, they agree that the responsibility lies in part with the author. Chang argues that the author and the institution (i.e., a university institutional review board) must protect subjects, whereas Muncy posits a moral stance. Ultimately, both authors admit that perfect protection of privacy is not always possible.</p>
<p>Both books, in summary, are informative and effective texts for researchers coming to autoethnography. Chang’s <italic>Autoethnography as Method</italic> is a how-to guide for curious quantitative researchers, and an introductory guide to graduate students who are contemplating autoethnography. The appendices make the text much like a workbook for novice autoethnographers. Muncey’s <italic>Creating Autoethnographies</italic> is slightly advanced for the “uninitiated,” but an excellent read for qualitative researchers with some knowledge of autoethnography and a desire to begin doing autoethnographic work.</p>
