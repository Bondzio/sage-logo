<abstract>
<p>In analyzing peace processes in postconflict societies, scholars have primarily focused on the impact of prosecutions, truth-telling efforts, and reconciliation strategies, while overlooking the importance of individual demands for reparations. The authors argue that normative explanations of why reparations are granted in the aftermath of regime change are useful in understanding a need for reconciliation, but inadequate for explaining victim demands for compensation. The authors extend this research to study civil war settlement. In the aftermath of civil war, when some form of reparation is offered giving individuals the opportunity to seek redress of grievances, what types of loss and political and socioeconomic characteristics are likely to lead some individuals to apply for reparations but not others? Using primary data, collected through a public opinion survey in Nepal, the authors investigate individual-level demand for reparations. The findings suggest that understanding loss and risk factors may be important to civil war settlement and reconciliation.</p>

<p>Nepal went through a decade long civil war, beginning in 1996, in which 13,000 people were killed, over 50,000 displaced, and thousands “disappeared.” The conflict involved periods of violent clashes between an armed Maoist insurgent group, led by the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoists (CPN-M), and the national army, until it ended with the signing of a Comprehensive Peace Accord (CPA) on November 21, 2006. The CPA included a provision to establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) that would recommend reparations for people impacted by the conflict. A political battle ensues over whether or not to create a truth commission to investigate atrocities committed by the rebels and the state during the conflict, and to date a TRC has not been established. In the meantime, the Government of Nepal instituted a program in early 2007 to provide partial reparation (specifically compensation) in the form of a monetary relief package to victims of the decade-long civil war. Although the transitional justice process stipulates that a reparation program needs to be holistic and comprehensive, including restitution, rehabilitation, and compensation to repair harms to victims and restore human dignity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022002711421594">United Nations 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022002711421594">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022002711421594">Magarrell 2006</xref>), the Nepali government took a first step by prioritizing compensation for individuals it believed were most in need. Somewhat surprisingly, by the summer and fall of 2008, we found that only 28 percent of over 1,800 respondents who were impacted by the war and potentially eligible for the funds had come forward to request the compensation being offered by the government. This research is motivated by this puzzle: why do some individuals impacted by civil conflict seek reparations when they are offered, while others do not?</p>
<p>Existing literature on transitional justice highlights the importance of reparations as a mechanism for addressing past atrocities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022002711421594">de Greiff 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022002711421594">Roht-Arriaza 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022002711421594">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022002711421594">Teitel 2000</xref>), describing the types of reparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022002711421594">Minow 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022002711421594">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022002711421594">Magarrell 2006</xref>) and the process of instituting TRCs  across countries during different time periods in history as a means of providing reparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022002711421594">Hayner 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022002711421594">Minow 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022002711421594">Elster 2004</xref>). Others explain the development of the field of transitional justice as a legal response by newly established democracies to the wrongdoings of past repressive regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022002711421594">O’Donnell and Schmitter 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022002711421594">Teitel 2003</xref>). Additionally, some researchers have focused on analyzing the success of TRCs in countries where one has been instituted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022002711421594">Gibson 2004</xref>). While this literature is important for providing a historical background for the development of transitional justice as a subject of inquiry, emphasis has largely been placed on understanding reparations in the context of transitions from autocratic regimes to democracy.</p>
<p>Other research on reparations explains why such measures are necessary to remedy historical injustices inflicted upon societies, particularly focusing on the crimes committed during World War II, and crimes stemming from slavery, racism, colonialism, and autocratic rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022002711421594">Barkan 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022002711421594">Powers 2007</xref>). This literature has been very useful in making a normative argument as to why atrocities committed in the past need to be rectified to provide justice to victims and reduce the potential danger of their repetition in the future. However, little work has been done on developing theoretical tools for explaining who is likely to be compensated in the aftermath of political transitions and wars. If reparations are important for civil war settlement and reconciliation, it is important to understand the factors that predict whether or not individuals will come forward and seek reparations when they are offered.</p>
<p>Drawing insights from existing literature on civil war and transitional justice, we argue that traditional explanations of when and why reparations are granted are useful but inadequate for explaining when citizens will seek compensation from governments. We extend existing research to an empirical study of civil war settlement. In the aftermath of civil war, what types of loss, and political and socioeconomic characteristics are more likely to lead individuals to seek reparations and what role does risk play in affecting demand? Specifically, using primary data collected in the aftermath of the decade-long civil war in Nepal, we investigate individual-level demand for reparations in a context where the government has offered compensation in the absence of a TRC and under a political situation that is still politically very fragile. In the next section, we discuss the theoretical framework and hypotheses, followed by our research design and empirical results. The findings suggest that understanding individual-level loss and risk factors may be important to the process of civil war settlement and reconciliation.</p>
<sec id="section1-0022002711421594">
<title>Theoretical Argument and Research Hypotheses</title>
<p>The main puzzle this research seeks to address is what motivated only a fraction of the victims of the Maoist revolution in Nepal to file for reparations over a year after the CPA was signed and the government and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) began helping and making the availability of compensation known to victims. We are primarily interested in identifying factors that predict why some victims of civil war seek compensation while others do not. As the field of transitional justice remains undertheorized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022002711421594">Elster 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022002711421594">Grodsky 2009</xref>), we draw insights from existing research on war and reconciliation to build our theoretical framework, focusing primarily on explaining variation in individual-level demand for existing reparations.</p>
<p>We argue that wars inevitably cause destruction and harm, which take the form of <italic>material</italic> and <italic>personal</italic> loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022002711421594">Elster 2004</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022002711421594">1</xref>
</sup> Material loss could occur due to seizure or destruction of tangible or intangible property such as land, homes, crops, animals, and the loss of the appreciated value of such property over time. Wars also “kill and maim people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022002711421594">Ghobarah, Huth, and Russett 2003</xref>) or subject them to various forms of physical or mental suffering that constitute personal loss. Personal losses are those that arise as a result of physical suffering, such as the murder or disappearance of a family member, or the abduction or incapacitation of an individual. Many people die during the course of conflict because they are either accidentally or deliberately killed by rebels or state armies. Together, these losses make up a set of <italic>conflict-induced grievances</italic> (CIGs) that provide individuals with a reason to come forward and seek compensation.</p>
<p>However, the existence of a CIG does not automatically imply that an individual will seek redress. Seeking compensation may also impose a cost on individuals, especially in the aftermath of a devastating civil war. For example, publicly identifying oneself as someone with a grievance can subject individuals or family members to further violence or persecution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022002711421594">Kalyvas 2006</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022002711421594">2</xref>
</sup> The fact that not all people with CIGs seek compensation when it is offered in the aftermath of a conflict suggests that there is likely a cost associated with such actions, particularly if there is ongoing political instability in a country and a lack of an institutional mechanism to guarantee personal security. After all, the demand for compensation may be interpreted as nothing more than a legally recognized version of the demand of “an eye for an eye” by the victim from the wrongdoers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022002711421594">Elster 2004</xref>, 166).</p>
<p>Under such conditions, certain factors, such as an individual’s caste or political party affiliation may impact their level of risk, particularly in civil conflicts where neighbors are pitted against each other and where political and socioeconomic factors are a source of conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022002711421594">Kalyvas 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022002711421594">Laplante and Theiden 2007</xref>). By seeking compensation for material and personal loss, victims are publicly identified: they “lose anonymity”, they may risk potential “stigmatization” from society, and they may suffer “attacks from armed groups” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022002711421594">Ibáñez and Velásquez 2009</xref>, 436). Individuals are also likely to view the state with “suspicion especially since it failed to protect them during the years of political violence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022002711421594">Laplante and Theidon 2007</xref>, 243). Under such situations, the presence of social networks such as a community organization may play a role in protecting the rights of the victims and aiding them in seeking compensation. Research has shown that “when the state and its institutions have often broken down, or turned against its citizens—informal networks gain in significance” in helping civilians in numerous ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022002711421594">Harpviken 2009</xref>, 1). Civil society also plays a crucial role in the transitional justice process (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022002711421594">Hayner 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022002711421594">Bell and Keenan 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022002711421594">Smith 2006</xref>). The presence of social networks in the form of NGOs may help mitigate such risks (costs) to individuals (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022002711421594">Harpviken [2009</xref>] for the case of Afghanistan and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022002711421594">Buford and Van der Merwe [2004</xref>] for the case of Namibia).</p>
<p>In sum, if one thinks of an individual as choosing between seeking or not seeking reparations in the aftermath of a conflict and if the decision to apply or not apply would be influenced by the individual’s assessment of the risk of applying versus not applying, then the probability of seeking reparations is a function not only of CIGs, but also of the perceived risks associated with exposure. We argue that there is variance in how individuals assess grievance and risk in making a decision of whether or not to seek reparations. The cost associated with the risk of applying for reparation is likely to impact an individual’s choice of whether or not to apply. Individuals are more likely to seek reparations when the benefits outweigh the perceived risks. In the following we develop our research hypotheses to investigate the causal mechanisms leading to variation in the demand for reparations.</p>
<sec id="section2-0022002711421594">
<title>Personal Loss</title>
<p>A demand for compensation is more likely to come from individuals who experienced personal loss during the conflict than those who did not. Personal loss can take several forms, including physical harm or abuse, abduction, physical and mental torture, sexual harassment, a demand to quit the national army, and forced participation in political activities against one’s will. Though the compensation being offered by the Nepali government did not directly focus on personal loss, grievances of any kind are likely to drive individuals to seek whatever compensation is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022002711421594">Adhikari and Hansen 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>During the conflict in Nepal, villagers were often tortured either physically (such as beating and forcing them to carry items for the insurgents or the security forces) or mentally (such as interrogation and psychological terror). Many more were abducted for forced conscription and families of those serving in the national army were asked under physical threat to call their family members back to their villages. All of these acts involved physical assault (or threat thereof), and also frequently caused people to flee their homes. Over time, such losses lead to an accumulation of grievances against the state, inducing individuals to seek compensation. This leads to our first hypothesis:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 1:</italic> Grievance in the form of personal loss is positively associated with the likelihood that an individual will apply for reparations.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0022002711421594">
<title>Material Loss</title>
<p>In theory <italic>material loss </italic>should play an important role in people’s pursuit of reparations. A root cause of the recent civil conflict in Nepal is the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few privileged classes. Villagers who were relatively better off than the rest, in terms of the amount of land owned, crops produced, and animals raised, were systematically targeted by the Maoists. In the process, family-owned lands were seized and given to the landless, forcing the families to flee. Others were asked to contribute crops in the form of a seasonal tax. Many were also asked to contribute animals to feed the armies of both the state and the Maoists. Those who defied Maoists’ orders often had their homes destroyed and were forced to leave from the villages. According to the estimates of the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction, around 500 homes belonging to individual families were destroyed during the conflict, and many more damaged. Nepal is an agrarian country, where over 70 percent of the population lives on subsistence farming. As such, land, crops, and animals are the most critical assets of a villager. If any or all of these assets are either seized or destroyed, a family is likely to suffer a crippling economic loss and to be forced to leave their home. Together, these losses constitute grievances that can only be addressed by compensating the victims. Individuals suffering from such grievances are more likely to apply for compensation. This leads to the following hypothesis:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 2:</italic> Grievance in the form of material loss is positively associated with the likelihood that an individual will apply for reparations.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022002711421594">
<title>Social Networks</title>
<p>Demanding reparations is likely to expose individuals to a variety of risks. This is especially likely in rural areas where most people live in villages and can easily be identified. Against such a backdrop, a demand for reparations is likely to be costly.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022002711421594">3</xref>
</sup> Not surprisingly, civil society organizations such as NGOs and community groups, who play an instrumental role in documenting human rights abuses during civilian conflicts, have also been the most vocal advocates of the transitional justice movement worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022002711421594">Hayner 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In the case of Nepal, civil society organizations have played important roles in educating people about fundamental human rights and in promoting justice in the country both during and after the conflict period. For example, Advocacy Forum Nepal, established in 2001 by a group of lawyers, has been active in providing free legal services to conflict victims seeking reparation for atrocities committed during the conflict. A partner organization for the International Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ) in Nepal, the Advocacy Forum (AF) also works in collaboration with many other national and international human rights organizations in the country, such as Accountability Watch Committee (AWC), Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC), Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Asian Federation Against Enforced Disappearance, International Commission of Jurists, Asian Human Rights Commission, International Coalition Against Enforced Involuntary Disappearance, World Organization Against Torture, to name a few. As of December 2007, AF was present in four (of the five) development regions and nine (of the seventy-five) districts of the country and has continued to expand.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022002711421594">4</xref>
</sup> The presence of civil society organizations may create a dense social network that facilitates the flow of information on human rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022002711421594">Keck and Sikkink 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022002711421594">Tarrow 2005</xref>). The fact that NGOs play a crucial role in making the transitional justice process more successful has been well documented (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022002711421594">Hayner 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, social networks are likely to provide individuals with a sense of security, even in extreme conflict situations like Afghanistan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022002711421594">Harpviken 2009</xref>). One of the most prominent community organizations operating at the village level in Nepal is the Community Forest Users Group (CFUG).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022002711421594">5</xref>
</sup> The CFUGs created a social cohesion among villagers during the conflict and played an important role in acting as a channel of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022002711421594">Adhikari 2012</xref>). Operating at the Village Development Committee (VDC) level, which is the smallest administrative unit in Nepal, the CFUGs transmitted information during the conflict and helped to educate villagers about human rights during and after the conflict, including their right to reparations. Members of this community organization are villagers, who go to the forest together to collect firewood, timber, and other forest products, hold regular meetings to discuss management of the forests and other social issues, thus forming a strong social cohesion that provides a sense of oneness among the members and facilitates transmission of information to the community. The increased flow of information combined with the added sense of security provided by social networks leads to the following hypothesis:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 3:</italic> Individuals located in a village where social networks are present are more likely to apply for reparations than individuals in villages with no such network.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022002711421594">
<title>Awareness</title>
<p>While a CIG may provide motivation to seek compensation, an ability to read and write is likely to enable individuals to seek compensation by giving them access to information and reducing their costs of applying. Nepal is a least developed country, and most official business is still carried out using handwritten documents. Only around 54 percent of the population ages six and over is literate (Central Bureau of Statistics [CBS] 2006). Against such a background, illiterate individuals may be unable to apply or may be reluctant to apply for fear of exposure. For more educated individuals, the cost may be minimal as they can pursue their demands on their own and not have to include a second party that might expose a victim to additional risk. We use literacy as a control measure and hypothesize that literate individuals will be more likely to have the awareness and capacity to come forward and apply for reparations:</p>
<list list-type="simple">

<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 4:</italic> People who are literate are more likely to apply for reparations.</p>

<sec id="section6-0022002711421594">
<title>Sociopolitical Factors</title>
<p>Nepal is a complex society with over a hundred different castes or ethnic groups that speak more than ninety different languages. Historically, a few privileged castes (mostly belonging to the upper castes: Chettries, Brahmins, and Newars) have occupied the most coveted positions in politics, as well as having access to better economic opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022002711421594">Whelpton 2005</xref>). One of the oft-cited causes of the civil war in Nepal was the accumulation of resentment over its past feudal system (United States Institute of Peace [USIP] 2007). This was the result of a failure on the part of the ruling elites to address socioeconomic problems faced by minority ethnic communities. During the initial phase of the civil war, the Maoists promised elimination of all forms of discrimination based on caste, gender, access to landed property and other “social evils.” This encouraged the historically disenfranchised groups, mostly ethnic minorities and <italic>dalits</italic> (untouchables), to join the Maoist army. While people from the privileged castes were systematically victimized by the Maoists as “enemies of the people’s war,” many minorities were tortured by the state army, which alleged that they were “Maoist sympathizers.” Under these conditions, many minorities joined the Maoists and started targeting people from the privileged castes. It is these targeted upper caste individuals that should be more likely to file for compensation; however, the fear of losing anonymity or the social stigma attached to such exposure may deter them from doing so.</p>
<p>A second phenomenon that is closely related to the caste system in Nepal is the highly skewed distribution of wealth. Because of a history of over 230 years of feudal oligarchy, coupled with direct rule by a royal dynasty, wealth (mainly land) came to be concentrated in the hands of the elites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022002711421594">Whelpton 2005</xref>). This landed class was labeled as “feudal” and was targeted by the Maoists during the initial phase of the conflict. They were asked to either surrender their land or leave. People who agreed to surrender their land frequently fled to the cities anyway to escape further victimization. Others who defied the Maoist’s call to give up land frequently became the main victims of physical and mental abuse during the conflict. Under these conditions, we include an individual’s wealth, measured in terms of their current self-reported income, as a control to capture both need and possible victimization.</p>
<p>The third element that contributed to the outbreak and escalation of conflict in Nepal is the party system. The first democratic government of the 1950s, which lasted for only one decade, was led by the Nepali Congress (NC) party. When democracy was reinstated in 1990, the NC reemerged as the largest party forming the new government. In both instances, however, the party failed to remain in office for a full term, mainly because of fighting within the party for leadership, which caused frustration in the general public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022002711421594">Thapa and Sijapati 2003</xref>). On the other hand, the NC was strongly in favor of a constitutional monarchy in Nepal until the reign of Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev, the last king of Nepal, who was forced from his palace in May 2008. When the Maoists launched their people’s war in February 1996, with the major objective of abolishing the monarchy, the NC was in power. Acting on the information concerning preparation for an armed conflict by the Maoists, the government at the time mobilized police forces in November 1995, under the name of “Operation Romeo,” to suppress the Maoists. The operation resulted in gross human rights violations, including, rape, arrest, disappearances, and illegal detention of hundreds of left-leaning but mostly innocent villagers in Rolpa district (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022002711421594">Karki and Seddon 2003</xref>). This incident encouraged many villagers to join the Maoists, and members of the NC came to be included in the list of the “enemies of the people’s war.” Similarly, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), which was formed after the reinstatement of democracy in 1990 by those who used to be in the king’s court during the Panchayat regime were also openly targeted by the Maoists and often forced to flee their homes.</p>
<p>In short, people from the privileged castes who had comparatively greater wealth, and those who were affiliated with either the NC or the RP parties, came to be known as “class enemies” during the Maoist-led conflict. As the state itself was busy fighting the rebels, families from this group were left on their own to cope with the conflict. This led to a general atmosphere of frustration among citizens from the affluent class, directed against the state. We expect these groups, who were the primary targets of Maoists, to be the ones more likely to have grievances, but the costs associated with exposure makes the likelihood of applying ambiguous. We make the following hypothesis:<list list-type="simple">

<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 5:</italic> Individuals that have greater perceived risk will be less likely to apply for reparations.</p>

<title>Displacement and Children</title>
<p>According to INSEC, over 50,000 individuals were internally displaced during the conflict in Nepal. Many of the internally displaced persons (IDPs) went to the capital, Kathmandu, while others moved to district headquarters. IDPs are frequently survivors of multiple gross human rights violations and displacement may give them a more immediate claim on compensation. In the absence of employment opportunities, many displaced people were forced to rely on handouts or seek government assistance. By design, 72 percent of the total 1,804 individuals surveyed for the present study had been displaced from their homes at least once during the conflict in Nepal. While 51 percent of the IDPs had returned home at the time of the survey, the rest were still in limbo. We expect IDPs in general and especially those in limbo to have more grievances and be more likely to apply for reparations. On the other hand, we expect returnees to be less likely to apply for a number of reasons: (1) they are likely to have received their land and property back; (2) they have likely already received help from the government, NGOs; or INGOs to return, and (3) they may simply have chosen not to apply due to risk factors such as fear of reprisal from their neighbors, some of which may have displaced them in the first place.</p>

<title>Research Design, Data, and Measures</title>
<p>Data for the present study come from field research conducted two years after the end of the decade-long civil war in Nepal. Over 1,800 individuals were randomly selected from eleven districts most affected by the conflict in terms of casualties and displacements, along with the capital of Kathmandu (See the Appendix for further details on the sample and survey method used for this study.). In the absence of a TRC, the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction with support from donor agencies started providing compensation to victims who applied with priority given to the following types of victims: families of dead/missing/disappeared persons, persons wounded/disabled or displaced persons whose property was destroyed or seized, and people who were abducted. While our data do not allow us to test people’s knowledge of the availability of compensation offered by the government, extensive efforts were made by the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction, as well as the local Offices of the Chief District Officer (CDO), to inform eligible individuals about the reparation program. In addition, many civil society organizations became involved in informing individuals about the availability of compensation.</p>
<p>We focus on the determinants of reparation claims pursuits for a random sample of individuals impacted by the conflict, but also consider IDPs’ reparation pursuits in particular. IDPs may suffer mass human rights violations, like torture and rape similar to other victims, but also the additional grievance of displacement. These victims may be considered more vulnerable because they have been forced from their homes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022002711421594">White [2009</xref>] for the case of Peru). IDPs, especially those who are still in limbo, pose a threat to political stability, particularly if their land was seized and given to other citizens during the conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022002711421594">Bradley 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022002711421594">2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Three types of relief packages were developed for assisting those impacted by the conflict in Nepal, covering (1) expenses for food and travel for IDPs returning home; (2) livelihood support for 120 days, support for repairing or rebuilding homes, and a onetime educational subsidy for school-age children; and (3) a five-year interest-free loan for entrepreneurship development. All three packages were provided in the form of cash. In the absence of a TRC, this monetary compensation is as far as the government has gone to date in offering any kind of reparation to those impacted by the war.</p>
<p>A relief package offering compensation is an example of one form of reparation. Since official reparations thus far only encompass compensation, we expect CIGs, claimed by 91 percent of our sample, to be a primary factor in predicting who has applied for reparations. In addition, all IDPs, by definition, were eligible and targeted for the relief offered by the government, since these are individuals who fled their homes due to the conflict. It is very likely that all individuals in the districts under study were impacted by the war in some way and have legitimate claims to reparations, and research suggests that monetary compensation is the most important form of relief demanded by all types of victims (Adhikari and Hansen, 2011; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022002711421594">Laplante and Theidon 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-0022002711421594">
<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>Our dependent variable is a dichotomous measure of whether or not individuals reported that they had applied for relief (<italic>SEEK</italic> <italic>COMPENSATION</italic>) from the government by the day of the survey. Responses are coded 1 for yes and 0 otherwise. In addition, respondents were asked an array of questions, including the reasons why they might have applied for compensation (e.g., destruction of home, land seized, family member disappeared, displacement), their experience during the war, and so on. While only 28 percent of the total sample said they applied for compensation, 40 percent of IDPs and 32 percent of the returnees in the sample reported having applied for reparations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022002711421594">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>We measure personal loss with a dichotomous variable (<italic>PERSONAL LOSS</italic>), coded 1 if the respondent experienced any of the following: physical threat, abduction, physical and mental torture, sexual harassment, quit the national army under threat, and forced participation in political activities such as protest rallies, mass gatherings, and indoctrination against one’s will, otherwise 0. Eighty-five percent of the individuals in our survey suffered from at least one of these forms of personal loss. In the empirical analysis, we also separate these losses and use different measures, such as a count of the number of personal grievances, as well as factor analysis that combines the types of losses into a single factor.</p>
<p>We employ three different variables to measure material loss. Crop and animal loss (<italic>CROP/ANIMAL LOSS</italic>) is a measure of whether an individual’s crops, animals, or both were forcefully seized during the conflict. About 27 percent of our respondents reported that their animals were forcefully taken, 42 percent were forced to give crops, and 26 percent lost both. No loss is coded 0. A positive loss of crops or animals is coded 1, and a loss of both is coded 2. In the empirical analysis, we also discuss the impact of these factors individually as well as combined.</p>
<p>The variable <italic>LAND LOSS</italic> measures the amount of land forcefully seized during the conflict. Land is treated separately from crop and animal loss because it is the primary source of livelihood in rural Nepal. The variable, which is measured in square meters, has been logged to control for the highly skewed pattern of land ownership in Nepal. Respondents that had a greater amount of land seized should be more likely to apply for compensation. In addition, in Nepal any loss of land can be detrimental to a family’s livelihood, no matter the amount, so we also test our models using a dummy variable for land loss. Finally, as mentioned, many villagers lost their homes during the conflict. Their homes were either intentionally destroyed by the rebels or in the cross-fire between the rebels and the state security forces. The variable <italic>HOME-DESTROYED</italic> is a dichotomous measure of whether or not a subject’s home was damaged or destroyed during the conflict. In all, 28 percent of our respondents reported that their land was seized and 17 percent had their homes damaged or destroyed during the course of the conflict.</p>
<p>We use a measure of the presence or absence of a community organization at the village level to test the impact of social networks on providing information and mitigating the risk of seeking compensation. The presence (1) or absence (0) of the CFUG (<italic>COMMUNITY FOREST USER GROUP)</italic> is used as a proxy for the degree of village-level social networking to test the impact of community-level organizations on the likelihood of seeking compensation. The presence of this community organization in a village is expected to have helped villagers learn about the relief package provided by the government and encouraged them to apply for it, as well as mitigated risk associated with exposure; hence, a positive relationship is expected. In addition to CFUGs, there were many preexisting community organizations working at the community level. We use the variable, <italic>OTHER COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION</italic>, to capture an individual’s knowledge of the presence or absence of any other community organization operating in their village. In addition to CFUG, this measure is used to assess the impact of social networks more broadly on individuals’ decisions to apply for compensation. About 58 percent of our respondents reported that the CFUG was present in their village, 26 percent cited the existence of other community organizations, and 21 percent acknowledged the presence of both.</p>
<p>We use a dummy variable (<italic>LITERATE</italic>) that indicates whether the respondent self-identified as literate (1) or not (0).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022002711421594">6</xref>
</sup> Fifty-eight percent of our respondents reported that they are literate. We also use a dummy variable to capture caste-based differences, with <italic>UPPER CASTE </italic>coded 1 if the respondent self-identified as belonging to the Brahmin, Chettry, or Newar castes, and 0 otherwise. Fifty-one percent of respondents self-identified as upper caste. We have two measures of political party affiliation. The variable <italic>MEMBER OF TARGETED POLITICAL PARTY </italic>is a dichotomous measure of whether or not an individual self-identified as being affiliated with either the NC or RPP at the time of the survey. Thirty-two percent of respondents reported such an affiliation. As an alternative to membership, we use a dichotomous measure of whether or not an individual respondent reported voting for the NC or RPP parties during the 1999 general election. About 32 percent of respondents reported an affiliation, while 36 percent said they voted for one of these targeted parties. We measure annual household income (<italic>INCOME</italic>) in terms of Nepali Rupees, measured on a 6-point scale where 1 belongs to less than 25,000 and 6 above 100,000 annual income categories. The modal income level among our respondents was under 25,000 Nepali Rupees. The mean and the median are between 25 and 35 thousand Nepali Rupees. About 10 percent reported an income over 75,000.</p>
<p>The variable <italic>IDP </italic>is a dichotomous measure of whether the respondent was ever displaced from his or her home (1) or not (0). Displaced persons are more likely to apply for reparations. The variable <italic>RETURNEES</italic> is a dichotomous measure of whether (1) or not (0) the respondent has returned home. Thirty-seven percent of all respondents were returnees, representing 51 percent of the IDPs.</p>
<p>In addition to being displaced, many IDPs were accompanied by children below the age of eighteen when they fled. One of the purposes of the relief package was to send children back to school. The variable <italic>CHILDREN</italic> is a count of the number of children below the age of eighteen an individual family had on the day of the survey. Sixty-six percent of the respondents reported that they had a child below the age of eighteen, with the number of children in the sample totaling to 3,206. Respondents with more children are expected to be more likely to apply for financial assistance to send their children back to school. Given that the compensation package specifically offered educational support, the variable <italic>CHILDREN</italic> is used as a control in the model.</p>

<title>Empirical Analysis</title>
<p>We use binary probit models to analyze the determinants of an application for compensation offered by the government of Nepal. We use a binary model because our dependent variable is a dichotomous measure of whether or not individuals reported applying for reparations. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002711421594">Table 1</xref> reports the results from our empirical analysis. Our initial analysis uses the full sample, but we also test our model using only the subsample of IDPs. We focus on IDPs in model 2 because our data revealed that only 11 of the 500 non-IDPs (people who stayed in their villages throughout the conflict) applied for compensation. As mentioned, the relief package consists mainly of monetary assistance. Many non-IDPs did not suffer a direct financial/material loss, but a physical or a psychological one. Only eleven non-IDPs applied for compensation, seven of which experienced a family member who disappeared. In the absence of the TRC, there is no provision for broader forms of reparations at this time, and the relief package does not directly compensate for personal loss or psychological damage. Although people who were not displaced frequently suffered some kind of atrocity during the conflict, the relief package being offered in the absence of a TRC did not target them as victims and is likely not adequate to compensate their loss. It is very possible that non-IDPs self-selected not to apply for the type of relief package the government has offered. In model 2, we focus on IDPs, all of whom have a clear claim to the relief package being offered, and ask why some applied for this relief while others did not.</p>

<p>The empirical results reported in both models 1 and 2 support our major hypotheses—that CIGs are important determinants of demand for compensation, and social networks seem to play a significant role in reducing risks associated with individuals’ decision of whether or not to apply. As can be seen in Model 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002711421594">Table 1</xref>, the coefficient for <italic>PERSONAL LOSS</italic> is significant at the 5 percent level. The marginal impact of personal loss, holding all other variables at their mean (or mode for dichotomous variables), is .13, implying that individuals who incurred a personal loss are 13 percent more likely to file for reparations than those who did not.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022002711421594">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In addition, we try alternative measures for personal loss. If we unpack our measure of personal loss into its components, physical threat is the most significant predictor, but strong correlations between the components of our personal loss measure make prediction problematic due to multicollinearity. When we replace our dummy variable for personal loss with a count of the number of physical assaults experienced by each individual, ranging from zero to six, the coefficient for the count measure is significant at the .054 level, with a marginal impact of 2, meaning that each additional loss increases the likelihood of seeking reparations by 2 percent, holding all other variables at their mean (or mode for dummy variables). Inclusion of this alternative measure does not alter the significance of the rest of the variables in predicting individuals’ demands for reparation. To further investigate the existence of a latent component of our individual measures of personal loss, we conducted factor analysis on the six observed variables that capture personal loss. The factor analysis indicates that the components form a single factor, with physical threat, abduction, and mental torture having the strongest loadings. When we include the factor instead of our measure of personal loss, the results are similar to those reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002711421594">Table 1</xref>, with the factor significant at the .02 level.<sup>

<p>Turning to material losses, expressed in terms of crops or animals seized, land seized, or home destroyed, individual victims are significantly more likely to apply for compensation. The positive and statistically significant coefficients for <italic>CROP/ANIMAL LOSS</italic>, <italic>LAND LOSS</italic>, and <italic>HOME DESTROYED</italic> provide strong evidence in support of this proposition. Again, holding all other variables at their mean or mode, the impact on the likelihood of victims applying for compensation increases by 24 percent if an individual’s house was destroyed. For crop/animal seizure, the marginal impact is 5 percent.<sup>

For each additional logged square meter of land seized, the likelihood of applying for reparation increases 1 to 2 percent, all other variables held at their mean or mode. If we use dummy variables for all three measures of material loss, the models behave similarly. In model 1, the marginal impacts on the likelihood of applying for reparation are 24 percent for home destruction, 11 percent for land seizure, and 5 percent for crop/animal seizure. When we use only IDPs in model 2, the impacts are 28 percent, 14 percent, and 7 percent, respectively. Finally, when we combine our three measures of material loss into one variable indicating any such loss, it is significant at the 1 percent level, with a marginal impact of 17 percent.</p>
<p>Civil society organizations, especially community organizations, were hypothesized to be instrumental in mitigating risks and increasing the likelihood that individuals apply for compensation. The positively signed and statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) coefficient for <italic>COMMUNITY FOREST USER GROUP </italic>in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002711421594">Table 1</xref> confirms Hypothesis 3. Individuals who said the CFUG was present in their village were 11 percent more likely to apply for reparations. Additionally, the presence of any other community organization in the village is significant at the 10 percent level (Model 1) and 5 percent level (Model 2) in explaining an individual’s decision to apply for compensation. The coefficient for literacy, a measure used as an additional factor for the capacity to apply and the mitigation of risk, has the expected positive sign, but is insignificant.</p>
<p>The empirical results for our individual-level characteristics are mixed as expected, but also interesting. The results provide strong evidence in support of our argument that members of the targeted pro-monarchist parties (<italic>NC</italic> and <italic>RPP</italic>) who were systematically victimized by the Maoists during the conflict are more likely to apply for compensation. Holding all other variables constant, members of these parties are 6 percent more likely to apply. If we use the alternative measure of who reported voting for one of these targeted parties in the 1999 general elections, the coefficient is significant at the 10 percent level, with no change in the significance of the other variables.</p>
<p>We posited (Hypothesis 5) that members of the privileged castes, <italic>Brahmin, Chettry</italic>, and <italic>Newar,</italic> were more frequently victimized by the Maoists during the conflict. We expected them to be more likely to come forward for the relief packages based on their greater likelihood of victimization, but recognize the risk of exposure. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002711421594">Table 1</xref>, the coefficient for <italic>UPPER CASTE</italic> is negative and statistically significant. The empirical results also indicate that individuals with higher incomes are significantly less likely to apply for compensation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022002711421594">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We believe that a number of possible factors are at play behind the results with regard to the caste and income variables discussed above. This may be an indication that costs or risk matter more for some individuals. Upper caste or wealthier individuals as a group may be more vulnerable because they were targeted during the conflict. The perceived cost of an application in terms of the potential risk of being identified as someone with a grievance could be higher for this group as compared to the rest because they will have more to lose if conflict resumes. Since the signing of the CPA in November 2006, the political situation in Nepal has remained unstable. Human rights organizations have reported that people are still being kidnapped and killed across the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022002711421594">INSEC 2010</xref>). Moreover, as Nepal is headed toward a federal structure, divided mainly on ethnic grounds, the likelihood of upper castes being victimized is still high. It is also possible that victims of elite castes are more likely to have had a regular income earning job (hence, less of a need for compensation) that they were able to transfer to a city. Finally, it is possible that they might actually be waiting for justice under an official TRC.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022002711421594">11</xref>

</p>
<p>Turning to Hypothesis 6, the empirical results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002711421594">Table 1</xref> provide strong evidence in support of the argument that those individuals who were forcefully displaced from their homes, and those who are still languishing in limbo, are more likely to apply for reparations. As can be seen, the coefficient for the variable <italic>IDP</italic> in model 1 is significant at the 5 percent level in explaining individuals’ decisions to apply for compensation. The marginal effects indicate that grievance generated by displacement has the greatest impact on an individual’s decision to apply for reparations. If an individual is displaced, the probability of an application for compensation increases by 31 percent, holding all other variables constant. On the other hand, if the individual has returned home, he or she is significantly less likely to apply for reparation. The marginal effects for the variable <italic>RETURNEES</italic> suggest that if an IDP has returned home, the probability of him or her applying for reparations decreases by between 6 and 8 percent (models 1 and 2), keeping all other variables constant. The results also indicate that individual families with children below the age of eighteen are significantly more likely to apply for compensation. As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002711421594">Table 1</xref>, the coefficients for the variable <italic>CHILDREN</italic> are significant at the 5 percent level in both models 1 and 2. The marginal effect for this variable indicates that the probability of an application increases by around 2 percent for every additional child in the family. We note that the other coefficients in the models are virtually unaffected by the exclusion of this control.</p>
<p>In addition to the empirical results reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002711421594">Table 1</xref>, we reestimated all the models excluding the eighty individuals who did not claim to have experienced a CIG using our measures of material or personal loss. If we drop these eighty individuals from the analysis, none of the results change in significance. It is worth noting that none of these eighty individuals sought reparations. Finally, using the full sample, we test for the effects of macro level measures of violence, namely, district level per capita casualties and displacements, and estimated cost of damage caused by the war by district (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022002711421594">Adhikari 2012</xref>). Using probit analysis and mapping district level data to an individual’s home district, we find that per capita displacement and the cost of war damage are both negative and significant predictors of the probability of seeking reparations, with no significant changes in the individual-level predictors. These results imply that individuals from districts more impacted by the war were less likely to seek compensation. This finding suggests that in addition to individual level grievance and cost factors, the severity of the war in an individual’s district has a dampening effect on his or her likelihood of seeking reparations. Again, given the current unstable political situation in Nepal, risk may be a factor.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>While the civil war in Nepal ended four and a half years ago and the previous insurgents are now part of the mainstream political process, the country is still mired in skirmishes of violence perpetrated sometimes even by groups previously unknown. Although the monarchy has been put to rest, which was a main objective of the insurgents, failure on the part of the various political parties to agree on major political agendas, such as integration of the previous militants into the national army and a federal structure for the country, continues to cast doubt on the peace process. Nepal is an interesting case in another respect as well. Transitional justice literature argues that reparation programs, if not accompanied by “steps to ascertain the truth about past violations,” tend to be counterproductive as they “may be perceived as an effort to buy victims’ silence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022002711421594">Magarrell 2006</xref>, 2). The fact that the Nepali government started providing monetary compensation to some victims in the absence of a formal settlement raises important questions regarding postconflict policy. Is Nepal setting a new trend by granting reparations without instituting a TRC, or are the responsible parties trying to block the potential for prosecutions?</p>
<p>International norms hold that victims of all human rights violations are entitled to reparations. Transitional justice literature has made a significant contribution toward the normative argument that reparations should be supplied to victims. However, scholars have failed to theorize more broadly about the determinants of the demand for reparations. If the normative argument is that reparations are meant to provide reparative justice, we argue that it is important to better understand individual demands for justice and specifically their willingness to seek compensation when it is offered in order for civil war settlement to be successful.</p>
<p>Civil wars destroy lives and property, leading to a variety of CIGs. However, there is variance not only in the types of grievances individuals suffer but also in their political and socioeconomic characteristics as well as the environment in which they live, which impose different circumstances and costs or risks for seeking reparations. An understanding of the demand for reparations must include not only identifying losses but also the risks associated with seeking redress for those losses, and the means by which such risks can be mitigated. The issue of reparations as a means of civil war settlement may be more complicated than simply recognizing individual rights to justice.</p>
<p>This study provides interesting theoretical and empirical insights into the factors affecting individuals’ decisions to seek one form of reparative justice, compensation, offered by the government. CIGs, measured in terms of personal and material loss, are important as determinants of demand for compensation. Individuals with greater grievances are more likely to seek reparations. We find that IDPs, followed by individuals who had their homes destroyed and individuals who suffered some form of personal loss like physical threat, are more likely to demand compensation. Material loss, particularly loss of one’s home is as important if not more important than personal loss in an individual’s likelihood of seeking reparations.</p>
<p>Beyond distinguishing between personal and material loss, there are other important factors which can affect individuals’ demands for reparation. Political and socioeconomic factors that increase an individual’s risk of exposure can affect demand. For example, individuals from upper castes were less likely to seek reparations, suggesting several possibilities, including a lack of need, social stigma, fear of reprisal, or expectations beyond simple monetary compensation. The Nepali experience also suggests that wealthier victims are less likely to apply for reparations in the form of compensation. The perceived social stigma attached to refugee or IDP status, or the link between status and the conflict, may be deterrents to reparation pursuits for such victims, as well as a lack of need. Victims not in immediate need of assistance may be waiting for the adoption of a TRC or justice that goes beyond mere monetary compensation. Finally, civil conflicts are frequently political in nature, thus an individual’s political affiliation can impact demand. In Nepal, members of the targeted parties or individuals who voted for such parties were found to be more likely to seek reparations.</p>
<p>The risks involved with seeking redress should not be overlooked. Even among the Nepali IDPs who were targeted and technically all eligible for compensation, only about 40 percent reported filing a claim, indicating that there may be a cost associated with making such demands. Our research suggests that a strong social network can be an important risk mitigating factor. We find that well-established community organizations play an important role in increasing the likelihood that individuals seek reparations, suggesting that the pursuit of justice may involve risks. For example, the presence of the Community Forest User Group that is deeply rooted in many villages throughout Nepal had a significant impact on the likelihood of seeking reparations, suggesting that its role in providing information and/or protection to village members is important.</p>
<p>Individual grievances in the aftermath of a civil war are many and varied, including both personal and material losses. When full compensation for all documented human rights violations is not practically possible, our results suggest that greater attention to individuals’ grievances and risks may be an important aspect of civil war settlement. Were the current government of Nepal to offer broader reparations, further research would be needed to understand the relative importance of compensation for personal versus material loss. Our findings suggest that further studies are necessary to understand how grievance and risk influence the pursuit of reparations and affect the process of reconciliation in the aftermath of a civil war. Offering reparations for victim grievances may not be enough to ensure justice to all victims if the risks associated with demand are not also acknowledged and addressed. It is hoped that the findings will make a significant contribution toward understanding important factors underlying civil war settlement globally.</p>

<title>Data and Sampling</title>
<p>Data for this study come from field research conducted in Nepal. The full data set used in this study consists of a national sample of 1,804 respondent households from fifty-six village development committees (VDCs) drawn from eleven of the seventy-five districts of Nepal, plus the capital of Kathmandu. Households were selected from 226 sampling units, called wards, from across these eleven districts. The sample represents all the five development regions (east, central, west, mid-west, and far-west), three topographical zones (mountains, hills and plains), and both rural and urban parts of the country. The survey was also administered in Kathmandu where many of the internally displaced persons (IDPs) fled. The districts are further divided into 3,914 VDCs, each with nine wards for a total of 35,226 wards. A weighted multistage cluster sampling technique was used to go from region, to VDC, to ward level and then two samples were randomly drawn—one of individual household at the ward level and another of IDPs originating from those wards. The IDPs were randomly sampled from a list generated by the Informal Sector Service Center (INSEC) according to their ward of origin. Use of wards as the sampling units has the advantage of offering a paired design of individuals who decided to stay and those who decided to leave within the same contextual environment. In addition, Nepal is a very mountainous country, very poorly served by road networks; it can take several hours simply to walk between wards. Cluster sampling down to the ward level and then randomly sampling within wards made the project feasible given time and financial constraints.</p>
<p>The sampling method involved multiple stages because it sought to ensure that the sample represents (1) districts that were hard-hit during the conflict, (2) all three topographical regions, (3) all five development regions, and (4) both rural and urban parts of the country. In addition, given resource and logistic constraints the method aimed at ensuring that samples would be drawn from areas that produced IDPs as a result of the conflict. In the first stage, all districts that had recorded at least 500 casualties or 500 displacements during the conflict were selected. The selection criteria were based on secondary data provided by INSEC on the number of people killed and displaced from each district. A total of nineteen districts met this threshold. Four of the five economic development regions contained exactly two districts that met our threshold, and varied topographically, so these eight were chosen. The remaining eleven districts were in the midwestern region where the fighting originated; three of these eleven districts were chosen, one in each topographical region. This resulted in a total of eleven districts, plus Kathmandu, being retained for sampling. Given resource constraints, the total number of interviewees was set at 1,500 for the eleven districts, with a target of 1,000 IDPs and 500 non-IDPs, with the remaining 304 interviewees coming from the capital. The number of IDPs was further divided into two groups: 500 respondents still displaced and 500 who had returned home. In each of the eleven districts, the target number of respondents was determined by the proportion of IDPs identified by INSEC in each district. This captures the dynamics of conflict as well as the economic and geographical variance in the country.</p>
<p>Each district is divided into VDCs, with each VDC further subdivided into nine wards. Only VDCs with ten or more IDPs were used in the sampling of interviewees. From each district, five VDCs meeting this threshold were randomly selected, and the targeted number of interviewees was determined by the proportion of IDPs in each of the VDCs. Next, the targeted numbers of respondents from each of the five VDCs were randomly sampled from the wards in proportion to the number of IDPs in each ward. IDP respondents were randomly selected from a list of all IDPs originating from the wards. This list was maintained by INSEC at the ward level throughout the conflict. The 500 non-IDP respondents were randomly selected from the same districts/VDCs/wards in which the IDPs originated. Target numbers of non-IDPs from each ward were based on the same proportions used for sampling the IDPs.</p>

<p>The literature on transitional justice suggests that conflict may lead to three different categories of loss—“material, personal and intangible” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022002711421594">Elster 2004</xref>, 168).

<p>Among a subsample of 289 individuals interviewed in Kathmandu, 30 percent of the 103 individuals who did not seek reparation at the time of the interview cited that they would be more likely to do so if their safety could be guaranteed; risk, indeed, appears to be a factor affecting individuals’ decisions.</p>

<p>The democratic government of Nepal passed a new forest Act in 1993 that categorized forest into national and private forests. With support from international organizations and donor agencies, management of the national forest began to be handed over to the villagers through the formation of local community user groups called “community forest user groups” (CFUG). By the end of 2008, a total of 14,389 user groups had been formed across the country with a participation of 1,654,529 households in them. As a modus operandi, the groups meet routinely, usually once a month, and discuss issues related to the conservation of forests in their community and sharing of benefits arising from it. In addition, the group members discuss social issues and strategies to combat problems facing their community. The overall activities of the communities are overseen by the national secretariat of the Federation of Community Forestry Users, Nepal (FECOFUN), which is registered as an NGO. For our purpose, the CFUGs represent a form of social network operating at the village level. They function as a medium for connecting families within the community, facilitating flow of information among the members.</p>

<p>In addition to personal and material loss, many individuals suffered from the murder of a family member during the conflict in Nepal. Over 13,000 individuals were killed during the conflict and 11 percent of the respondents in our survey reported that they lost a family member. We test the impact of having a family member murdered as a separate personal loss factor influencing individuals’ decisions to apply for reparations. To our surprise, the results (not included in the table) are insignificant. We believe that the absence of a TRC and self-selection (see the following for further discussion on this possibility) on the part of the victims could be reasons not to apply for compensation. For example, around 1 percent of respondents in the survey verbally reported that they did not apply due to “fear of Maoist retaliation.”</p>

<p>Alternatively, wealth could be measured by land ownership. If we include the log of the amount of land owned by individuals as a measure of wealth, the coefficient is positive and significant at the 10 percent level, while the rest of the results are unaffected. Similarly, if we replace income with amount of land owned, it is positive but insignificant.</p>

<p>It is also likely that the non-upper-caste groups, who are also the poorest of all communities in Nepal, were the ones that suffered the most during the conflict and were at the mercy of the government. The non-upper-castes include minorities (Magar, Tamang, Gurung, Rai, Limbu, Tharu, and others) as well as dalit (untouchables). Comparing these upper and lower caste groups, we found that while similar percentages were displaced (73 percent upper caste vs. 70 percent lower caste), a lower percentage of the upper caste applied for reparations (26% upper caste vs. 33% lower caste).</p>
