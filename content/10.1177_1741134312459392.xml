<p>Today, when some of the richest countries in the world are experiencing one of the most severe financial crises of the last decades, the critical role played by generic medicines has become more evident than ever before. Based on a recent IMS Health analysis, generic utilization, which has reached about 80% in the United States, is responsible for savings of approximately US$1.07 trillion over the past 10 years. In 2011, savings generated by the use of generic drugs accounted for US$192.8 billion (Savings - $1 Trillion over 10 Years. Generic Drug savings in the U.S. (Fourth Annual Edition: 2012).</p>
<p>As stated in one of the articles in this issue of the Journal, the importance of pharmaceuticals is growing in government budgets. In the European Union in 2010, for instance, the market for prescription and non-prescription medicines for human use was worth over 220 billion Euros at retail prices, which amounts to approximately 1.8% of the European Union annual GDP during that period.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in this context in which finding ways to increase generic utilization is paramount, generic companies find themselves fighting unfair battles due to delay tactics pursued by originator pharmaceutical companies. This forces them to engage in unnecessary litigation and delays the entry of generic products into the market, thus hurting those companies as well as consumers and health care payers.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the articles mentioned above and included in this issue entitled “Delay in Generic Entry Should Remain a Concern to Competition Authorities” states that the Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry conducted by the European Commission found that “on average citizens waited more than seven months after patent expiry for cheaper generic medicines, costing them 20% in extra spending”. Furthermore, the Inquiry identified a number of practices to delay the entry of generic competitors.</p>
<p>Another articles published in this issue also addresses problems that follow-on-biologics are likely to face due to the absence of clear legislation which may also lead to delays in the entry of follow-on biologic drugs and unnecessary and expensive litigation. Avoiding unnecessary delays in the market entry of generic medicines and follow-on drugs is a goal shared by consumers, health care payers and governments and requires a joint effort from legislators, regulators and competition authorities to end these wasteful and unfair practices.</p>
