<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Use of online materials to supplement clinical exposure and lecture-based teaching is recognized as an essential aspect of modern medical education, including for undergraduate and postgraduate psychiatry training, and for continuing professional development (CPD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856212455253">1</xref></sup> The use of computer-based technology (e-learning) as one facet of a curriculum is referred to as ‘blended’ learning. One of the many challenges involved in the use of e-learning as part of a blended curriculum is the production of high-quality materials. We have developed a series of cases in psychiatry and other disciplines that can be used by medical educators in teaching medical students through to trainees, and which may also be valuable for CPD. All materials are available for use, with no charge, to medical educators. Sixteen medical schools in Australia are currently accessing the cases. The materials are being used for formative learning, and data are currently being collected in order to benchmark performance (defined as the number of correct multiple choice and short answers given within and between cases) across Australian medical schools. To access sample cases, visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.emedici.com">www.emedici.com</ext-link>. To access all cases for use in teaching and learning activities, contact Professor Peter Devitt, <email>peter.devitt@adelaide.edu.au</email> or Dr Edward Palmer, <email>edward.palmer@adelaide.edu.au</email>.</p>
<p>By way of background, in 2009 the <italic>eMedici</italic> team (Palmer, Devitt, Chur-Hansen and Crabb) were awarded an Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) grant in order to produce clinical case material to be used online, in the areas of Psychiatry, Ophthalmology, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Cardiology and Health Psychology. The platform, <italic>Medici</italic>, had already been successfully used for over a decade in the area of Surgery at the University of Adelaide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856212455253">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In order to decide upon which areas in psychiatry cases should be written, the Australian Curriculum Framework for Junior Doctors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856212455253">3</xref></sup> was consulted, and a list of areas relevant to psychiatry constructed. In order to determine which areas were most important to be addressed, 32 domains (for example, delirium, psychosis, child abuse) were ranked by three consultant psychiatrists in order of perceived importance.</p>
<p>A request was made via the University of Adelaide Discipline of Psychiatry email list for consultants interested in writing cases based on the highest-ranking domains identified by the three consultant psychiatrists. Twelve consultants offered to write cases, for which they were reimbursed AUD$400 per case. A ‘case’ involved approximately six screens of material, each comprising a block of information, a question (single selection, multiple selection or short answer) pertaining to that information, and feedback on each of the answers, both correct and incorrect, so that the learner receives formative feedback as they work through each screen.</p>
<p>In order to peer review the content of each case, a two-day weekend workshop was held. The workshop members were an external medical education consultant, the <italic>eMedici</italic> team, three consultant psychiatrists from around Australia, three general practitioners with expertise in mental health and medical education, and two final-year medical students interested in psychiatry as a possible career. All had been given paper copies of the cases to read prior to the workshop. At the workshop, each case was viewed online within eMedici, and recommendations for improvement made. In this way, the process was as with peer review for a journal publication, with a list of required changes or suggestions for improvement sent to the author of the case. Once these changes had been made, the cases were then sent out for blind review to two reviewers, who were reimbursed AUD$50 for each review. Any required changes recommended from the blinded peer reviews were again addressed. Cases were not made publically available in eMedici until they were deemed by the peer reviewers to be of outstanding quality.</p>
<p>In total, 19 cases were completed. These cover a number of areas, including assessment and management of psychosis, suicidal behaviour, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and eating disorders. Also covered in cases are ethical issues, capacity, childhood abuse, domestic violence, somatoform disorder, cross-cultural competence, the mental status examination, ‘difficult’ patients, assessment of cognition and consciousness, medication interactions, including alternative medications, and the differentiation between grief and depression and physical and psychological disorders.</p>
<p>Colleagues who are interested in using these existing cases, or who are interested in producing new cases, are warmly invited to contact us.</p>
