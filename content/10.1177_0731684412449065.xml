<abstract>
<p>Three-dimensional woven textile reinforced composites allow the optimisation and tailoring of specific material properties into the final component. The objective of this work is to investigate the processing characteristics of Cyclic Butylene Terephthalate (supplied by Cyclics Corporation) that polymerises to form a thermoplastic, Polybutylene terephthalate, and to impregnate a multi-layer carbon fibre three-dimensional woven angle interlock fabric to produce a three-dimensional woven thermoplastic composite. Through adjustments in process cycle, the significant processing parameters have been identified, which optimise the production of thermoplastic Polybutylene terephthalate composite parts. Three-dimensional multi-layer reinforcements were manufactured on a modified textile loom to produce fabrics with fibres orientated in the warp, weft and through-the-thickness directions. Thermal and mechanical tests were conducted on the thermoplastic composite and comparisons were made to an epoxy composite with the same weave architecture. It was discovered from thermal analysis and optical microscopy that a highly crystalline matrix was developed as a result of the standard fabrication process with microcracks formed throughout the matrix. Reprocessing and annealing of the 3DCFCBT laminate reduced the crystallinity of the polymer structure.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0731684412449065" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>There is currently an increasing demand for large, one-piece structural composite components. Although thermosetting resin systems can be processed at lower temperatures than thermoplastic polymers, thermosets may emit harmful volatiles during processing and create difficulties associated with exothermic reactions. New thermoplastic polymer systems have recently been developed, which have a number of advantages over thermoset resin systems including improved toughness, damage tolerance, ease of recycling, speed of processing and no emission of harmful volatiles during processing; there is also no associated exotherm as is present in thermoset materials. One such low-viscosity thermoplastic matrix system is Cyclics Corporation cyclic butylene terephthalate (CBT) monomers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412449065">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412449065">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Radusch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412449065">3</xref></sup> states that the properties of thermoplastic polybutylene terephthalate (PBT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412449065">Figure 1</xref>) are strongly dependent on the crystalline portion and on the resulting morphology after processing. The bulk properties of crystalline thermoplastic composite materials are usually influenced not only by individual properties of the polymer matrix and fibre reinforcements but also the processing conditions (time and temperature). Earlier studies by Brunelle et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412449065">4</xref></sup> indicated that polymers synthesised from cyclic oligomers displayed higher enthalpies of melting (60–80 J/g) hence, higher degree of crystallinity, Xc as compared to the conventional counterpart with enthalpies of melting ranging from 35 to 50 J/g. Thus the nature of the polymerisation (i.e., ring-opening polymerisation versus polycondensation) plays a crucial role in determining the crystalline structure of the resulting PBT.
<fig id="fig1-0731684412449065" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Chemical structure of linear poly (butylene terephthalate).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412449065-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The presence of tetramethylene (linear butylenes) units on the backbone of the PBT molecule results in rapid crystallisation, and this can be very beneficial in allowing short cycle times. However, this rapid rate of crystallisation means that the morphology and hence the physical properties of the material are very sensitive to thermal history. Two distinct forms of crystal type are known to form in PBT, depending on the crystallisation conditions used. Stein and Misra<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412449065">5</xref></sup> showed that when crystallisation takes place above 180°C, α-type spherulites that melt at 227°C are formed, while crystallisation below 180°C results in less stable β-type crystals that melt at around 223°C. Ludwig et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412449065">6</xref></sup> found the yield stress and microhardness of the α-type crystal to be in the region of 8%–10% higher than the β-type. However, while the α-form can impart a high level of stiffness and a high yield strength to a part, at high levels of this crystal type embrittlement of a part can occur.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731684412449065">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>In earlier work, a melt temperature of thermoplastic PBT ranging from 222 to 230° was observed via Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731684412449065">8</xref></sup> More recently, work by Mallon et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412449065">9</xref></sup> which looked specifically at the ‘in-situ’ polymerisation of CBT, used DSC to characterise both the pre-polymer (CBT) and the polymer (PBT). A crystallisation peak for the polymer was observed at 178°C during cooling. This information suggested that the temperature at which the resin is polymerised and crystallised, should be above 178°C, which agrees with the material supplier’s recommendations. They also found that the melt temperature was 216°C. Further work by Parton and Verpoest,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412449065">10</xref></sup> which also looked at the ‘in-situ’ polymerisation of CBT, showed that the melt temperature was approximately 220°C. They also highlight a multiple melting peak resulting from the melting and recrystallisation of imperfect crystals, indicating poor crystal quality in the composite part. This phenomenon is often seen during DSC and is thought to be either indicative of the two crystal types or as a result of the complex melting and recrystallisation behaviour that occurs in this material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684412449065">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a previous study by Archer into the cure monitoring of CBT® using dielectric analysis (DEA), it was noted that annealing of the part can result in lower levels of crystallinity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731684412449065">12</xref></sup> This approach has been used in a number of works including Durai Prabhakaran’s, where after the CBT composite was polymerised, it was then subjected to a temperature of 230°C for a period of 45 min.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684412449065">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>The processing time of CBT can vary from 10’s of seconds to many minutes depending on the catalyst used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731684412449065">14</xref></sup> Post-processing can provide a safety margin that allows the morphology of the polymer to be redesigned and controlled while achieving a high molecular weight PBT thermoplastic. Should a high degree of crystallinity be present in the composite, the crystals will be disordered during the annealing stage and the component can then be subjected to rapid cooling to achieve a lower degree of crystallinity, similar to injection moulded PBT. Durai Prabhakaran found that if the CBT resins are crystallised from a random melt at a sufficiently high cooling rate (greater than approximately 7.5°C/min), they will have the same characteristics as conventional injection moulded PBT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731684412449065">13</xref></sup> Parton also states that the materials ductility can be improved through crystallisation from a truly random melt and then using a similarly high cooling rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412449065">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Woven textile reinforced composites allow the introduction of specific material properties into the final component that can provide a reduction in manufacturing cost. However, woven composites materials are susceptible to transverse impact loading which causes laminas to become delaminated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731684412449065">15</xref></sup> Various methods have been developed to improve the impact tolerance including z-pinning, stitching, selective interlayers, hybrids, protective layers or resin toughening; one method that is becoming increasingly prevalent is to reinforce composites with a fibre that connects the layers together running from the upper to lower surface of the laminate. Mouritz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412449065">16</xref></sup> stated that three-dimensional (3D) woven composites have higher ballistic damage resistance and impact tolerance than two-dimensional (2D) materials, higher tensile strain and strain-to-failure values, and also higher interlaminar fracture toughness. Ding et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412449065">17</xref></sup> showed that 3D composites performed significantly better in fatigue than 2D composites. Quinn<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731684412449065">18</xref></sup> also points out a fundamental difference and advantage that 3D reinforcements have over 2D plied lay-up. With a 2D lay-up the orientation of the plies is carried out during the loading of the cure tool. Therefore, care and considerable time must be taken to ensure the correct orientation of the final part. With 3D woven reinforcement, the orientation of the tows is controlled by the design of the fabric, which Mouritz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412449065">16</xref></sup> state can create complex near net shape fabrics that can be less expensive and simpler to manufacture than 2D reinforced composites.</p>
<p>It is proposed that by combining the properties of thermoplastic matrix material and 3D woven fibre, an enhanced composite system could be developed. However, due to the high viscosity of most thermoplastic resins, and the interlocking of the layers in a 3D woven fabric, the deployment of such composites has been limited. This paper reports an investigation of the in-situ polymerisation process cycle of CBT and angle interlock 3D woven carbon fibre fabrics. For comparison an epoxy form of the material was processed under vacuum on a flat plate heated mould by VaRTM. The CBT used was a one part powder system that comprised CBT oligomers with a tin-based catalyst.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0731684412449065"><title>Resins</title>
<p>CBT monomers are low molecular weight oligomers (with between two and seven butylgroups) with a processing viscosity that can be as low as 0.02 Pa s (water-like). During composite manufacture this low viscosity allows complete wet out of the fibre reinforcement before the in-mould polymerisation reaction causes a substantial increase in molecular weight. Until recently, viscosities in this range were only achievable with thermosetting resins, as the melt viscosity of most molten thermoplastics is in the order of 100–10,000 Pa.s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684412449065">19</xref></sup> The entropically driven ring-opening polymerisation reaction is activated by a tin-based transesterification catalyst (butyltin chloride dihydroxide), causing the CBT oligomers to open and connect (i.e. polymerise). This forms a high molecular weight PBT thermoplastic without exotherm or off-gassing. The PBT polymer produced has a melt temperature of around 220°C, which is considerably higher than the processing temperature, ranging from 170 to 200°C. This enables parts to be removed from the mould with minimal cooling. For this work, Cyclics Corporation CBT160 powder was used. A comparison was made with epoxy Araldite LY564 and Hardener HY2954 cured at 100°C and post-cured at 140°C.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0731684412449065"><title>3D multi-layer fabrics</title>
<p>3D multi-layer woven reinforcements were designed using the X-Sectional design system to provide a representation of the structure, detailing the relative positions of the yarns and also generating the lifting plan to operate a Jacquard controlled loom. Fabrics were then manufactured on a conventional textile loom with mechanical modifications to allow the addition of z-binder yarns and limit fibre damage; reinforcements with fibres orientated in the warp, weft and through-the-thickness directions were produced. The loom used was a DATAWEAVE loom with Jacquard controller incorporating 1152 hooks. The weave architecture consists of continuous lengths of tows for maximum strength in the 0/90° directions and angle interlock binding configurations in order to suppress delaminations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412449065">Figure 2</xref>). Comparatively, this structure possesses very low levels of crimp in the warp stuffer and weft filler tows. The 3D fabric has four layers of warp and five of weft, while maintaining a 1:1 warp to weft ratio, with the binder running in the warp direction (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412449065">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731684412449065">2</xref>). The warp and weft fibres where high tenacity fibres with improved mechanical performance (HTS) whereas the binders were baseline high tenacity fibres (HTA).

<p>Optical microscopy was carried out on the unconsolidated fabric and consolidated composite samples in order to ascertain the geometric characteristics of the fabric in the ‘off-loom state’ compared the consolidated composite that was compressed at 100 kPa during vacuum processing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0731684412449065"><title>VaRTM manufacture of epoxy 3D woven composite (3DCFE)</title>
<p>3D woven composite epoxy plaques were manufactured using the VaRTM method. A caul plate was used in conjunction with a flexible membrane to consolidate the fabric reinforcements under full vacuum, prior to the injection of resin by peripheral gating at a tool temperature of 75°C. Araldite LY564 and Hardener HY2954 (based on bisphenol A epoxy and a cycloaliphatic amine hardener) was mixed at 2.86:1 by weight before degassing under vacuum and transfer of the resin into the mould. After injection, a ramp at 1°C/min was applied up to 100°C. The temperature was held isothermal for 60 min; the composite plaque was then de-moulded and post-cured for a further 180 min at 140°C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0731684412449065"><title>Manufacture of thermoplastic 3D woven composite (3DCFCBT)</title>
<p>An electric hotplate consisting of 4 × 1 kW ceramic insulated strip heaters was used to provide conductive heating and a faster ramp rate to process the CBT oligomers more efficiently than a convective oven. The heating strips were fastened to an aluminium base plate as it has good thermal conductivity to help rapidly transfer the heat to the tool plate.</p>
<p>The multi-layer woven fabric was weighed using laboratory scales and the powder was prepared to a fibre volume fraction of 48%. The powder was manually dispersed on the top surface of the fabric and sealed within a vacuum bag assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412449065">Figure 3</xref>). The method employed is similar to the one described in the patent filed by Doyle et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412449065">20</xref></sup> The assembly was dried in the oven (90 min at 120°C) whilst the hotplate was preheated to ensure the highest ramp rate could be achieved. (It is known from literature that CBT is very sensitive to moisture and as such it must be dried prior to processing.) When the assembly had completed the drying period it was placed on the hotplate to reach 190°C and isothermally processed for 1 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412449065">Figure 4</xref>). The assembly was cooled slowly (approximately 3°C) to reduce polymer shrinkage and cracking.
<fig id="fig3-0731684412449065" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Manufacture procedure for 3DCFCBT laminate production.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412449065-fig3.tif"/></fig>

<p>A ramp rate of 11°C/min was achieved whereby the part temperature was raised from 87.43 to 190°C in 9.31 min. Visual inspection of the 3DCFCBT laminate suggests that the processing conditions were successful with only minor defects present. The laminate would therefore be suitable for comparison against 3DCFE and thus characterisation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0731684412449065"><title>Annealing (3DCFCBT(A))</title>
<p>It is the objective of this work to develop a 3DCFCBT composite with a reduced crystalline structure; therefore a small section of the laminate was also reprocessed at higher temperature (annealing) and further analysis was conducted. When the sample laminate was reprocessed it was heated to 235°C for 5 min and then annealed by cooling at 16.4°C/min. This specimen was then characterised by DSC and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) to observe any change in crystallinity. These materials were vacuum moulded in the same way as 3DCFCBT was but a higher temperature grade of Kapton<bold>®</bold> polyimide film was used as bagging material.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0731684412449065"><title>Micrographs</title>
<p>Micrographs were taken of specimens to provide qualitative analysis of the laminate microstructure, and the results obtained from the processing method implemented. Each specimen was surface polished to 0.05 µm using a Struers TegralPol-31. Visual inspection of the micrographs revealed characteristics of each fabrication process, such as the level of permeation of the resin through the fibre reinforcement. Imperfections within the composite laminate can also be identified such as voids, porosity, delamination and matrix cracking.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0731684412449065"><title>DMA</title>
<p>DMA was conducted using a TA Instruments Q800 to determine the mechanical properties of the composite materials under strain as a function of time, temperature, and at 1 Hz frequency. The properties retrieved from the DMA for this study include the storage modulus and the glass transition temperature T<sub>g</sub> of the composite. A minimum of three samples were required for the test procedure as per ISO 6721-1:2002.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412449065">21</xref></sup> The samples were cut to 60 mm × 12.5 mm to mount on to the dual cantilever clamp. A dynamic temperature program was used to heat the c-PBT specimens at 2°C/min up to 200°C. The temperature program was adjusted to 2°C/min up to 250°C for the epoxy-based specimen. The strain displacement was set at 15 µm during all analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0731684412449065"><title>DSC</title>
<p>DSC was conducted using a TA Instruments Q100. The DSC is used to provide properties such as the melt temperature (T<sub>m</sub>) and the polymer’s degree of crystallinity. A nitrogen purge gas was applied to the DSC chamber at a rate of 50 ml/min during scans to prevent oxidation of the test sample. Approximately 10 mg of each material was heated at a ramp rate of 10°C/min from ambient to 260°C. The heat of fusion (<italic>Δ</italic>H) was obtained by integration of the area under the curve. The percentage crystallinity was calculated using a value of 142 J/g for 100% crystalline PBT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412449065">22</xref></sup></p>

The test was conducted on the 3DCFE and 3DCFCBT composites for comparison. The materials were prepared as specified in ISO14130:1998 whereby the specimen length was 10 times the material thickness. Similarly the width of the specimen was five times the thickness and the span was five times the thickness. Samples were tested in the warp direction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0731684412449065"><title>Flexural testing</title>
<p>The test procedure followed for this experiment was the flexural test based on four-point bending as per ISO 14125:1998<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731684412449065">24</xref></sup> with span being 27 times specimen thickness. The test was conducted on 3DCFRE and 3DCFRCBT composites for comparison using a Zwick Z100/TL3A with a cross head speed of 5 mm/min. A fixed LVDT was used during the test to measure the deflection of the specimens under loading. Samples were tested in the warp direction.</p>

<p>When comparing the loom state fabric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0731684412449065">Figure 5</xref>) to the VaRTM manufactured composite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412449065">Figure 6</xref>) for the angle interlock fabric, there appears to be a change in tow cross-sectional shape in both the warp and the weft directions. The compaction applied during composite manufacture causes the tows to become flattened, and in general, the warp and weft tows remain straight although the weft filler exhibited more crimp in the composite than the warp stuffer.

<p>The compressed samples illustrate how the compression of the fabric causes reorganisation of the tows within the structure. The weft tows have the freedom to move within the binder points in the structure and this movement can be affected by characteristics of the fabric structure, namely, the frequency of the binder yarns within the structure.</p>
<p>It is clear that the warp stuffers are very straight with little crimp. However, the weft fillers exhibit crimp to a greater extent. It is thought that this is due to a lack of tension exerted during the weaving process with the insertion of the weft yarn by the loom rapier. This lack of tension in the weft direction accommodates the nesting effects caused by the binders, which cross over the weft yarns at the surface layer of the fabric, bending the weft yarn down under compression from the caul plate during composite manufacture. Resin rich areas were also observed between warp stuffers in the space that is occupied by the binder on other weft layers. These resin rich areas will be difficult to eliminate with this design of fabric due to the binder pitch.</p>
<p>The 3DCFCBT laminate exhibited a highly crystalline matrix with microcracking throughout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412449065">Figure 7</xref>). A large crack also propagated through multiple layers of the laminate and crimping can be seen with the warp weaver yarn displaying a stepped effect over the filler yarns as it passes from one surface to the opposite. It has been discussed in previous studies how this crimp can lead to a reduction in tensile strength in the x-axis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731684412449065">25</xref></sup> A void be can seen in the cross-section; however, it seems to be formed as a result of the shrinkage of the c-PBT polymer, as the void present has formed between two microcracks and it does not contain the physical characteristics of conventional voids (caused by gas entrapment) that are generally spherical or ellipsoidal in shape.

<sec id="sec15-0731684412449065"><title>Crystallinity</title>
<p>An important distinction within the thermoplastic group of materials is related to whether they have a crystalline or an amorphous structure. The amount and type of crystallinity present is very dependent on the thermal history, the processing conditions used to produce the moulded article and the molecular configuration. In general, plastics have a higher density when they crystallise due to the closer packing of the molecules. It is also accepted that the fatigue properties will increase with greater crystallinity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684412449065">26</xref></sup> As stated earlier, the bulk properties of crystalline thermoplastic composite materials are usually affected not only by properties of the polymer matrix and fibre reinforcements but also the processing conditions of time and temperature. The higher the crystallinity the lower is the ultimate strain at failure, indicative of a more brittle material. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412449065">Figure 8</xref> show the DSC plots for both the 3DCFRCBT and the 3DCFRCBT(A).
<fig id="fig8-0731684412449065" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>DSC of 3DCFCBT and 3DCFCBT (A). DSC: differential scanning calorimetry.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0731684412449065-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The melt temperature of 3DCFRCBT was found to be 228°C, which agrees well with the work of Mohd Ishak (227°C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684412449065">27</xref></sup> but not as well with that of both Mallon et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731684412449065">9</xref></sup> and Parton and Verpoest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412449065">10</xref></sup> who found the melt point to be 216°C and 220°C, respectively. In the work by Parton and Verpoest a very distinct double melt peak was reported, which they attributed to the fact that polymerisation did not taken place below the polymer melting point to allow sufficient time for cold crystallisation. The graph for 3DCFCBT in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412449065">Figure 8</xref> does exhibit a slight shoulder at 214°C but it is not as pronounced as the double melting peak observed in other research. This may suggest that the method used in this study gives a better crystal structure than the RTM process used by Parton and Verpoest. In other work the double melting peak was observed, which is indicative of imperfect crystals formed after the initial crystal structure;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731684412449065">28</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731684412449065">30</xref></sup> Parton discovered the double melting peaks when polymerisation took place at 220°C, which she believes indicates a poor crystal quality in the composite due to the dwell window used for crystallisation. This double peak was not observed by Parton when polymerisation took place at 190°C. Another explanation may be that the samples in this work were cooled at a low cooling rate allowing large perfect crystals to be formed, with small distribution of sizes. Faster cooling on the other hand results in the formation of smaller crystals with lower melting points, and a broader distribution of the crystal sizes. The smallest and least perfect of the crystals will then melt at a lower temperature and show up as the first melting peak, followed by the larger more perfect crystals as a second melting peak. The 3DCFCBT was found to give 53% crystallinity. This value is significantly higher to the expected values of 35%–40% for thermoplastic PBT but this result agrees well with the findings of Mohd Ishak (48%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684412449065">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>When annealed at 235°C, the crystallinity was reduced further by 8% down to an average of 49%, which would indicate a more amorphous structure as was anticipated. This reduction in the crystalline structure of the polymer should provide better ductility, toughness, and impact performance. It can also be seen from the traces that as the polymer was annealed, the melt temperature was 230°C and only a single melting peak (α-type spherulites) was observed. Mohd Ishak observed a reduction in heat of crystallisation value from 70 J/g to 56 J/g when the sample was annealed at the higher temperature of 250°C under a heating and cooling rate of 5°C; this is a larger reduction in crystallinity than observed in the current study. However, unlike the current study the resultant crystalline structure exhibited the dual peak,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684412449065">27</xref></sup> which they attributed to the melting of small and defective crystals, followed by their immediate recrystallisation into more stable structures and their subsequent melting (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731684412449065">Table 3</xref>).

<p>Based on the results of the ILSS test and the micrographs previously taken; it can be concluded that the cause of failure to the 3DCFCBT specimen occurred as a result of defects within the matrix. A significant quantity of microcracks formed throughout the matrix as a result of residual stresses formed during the crystallisation process. It is believed that these cracks reduced the tensile strength of the matrix and caused localised stresses on the surface of the test specimen as the load member was applied, initiating the failure of the specimen. It was also noted that the carbon fibre material used in this study was coated with a sizing agent that was optimised for epoxy.</p>

<p>A suitable processing method has been developed for the manufacture of 3DCFCBT composite structures using the follow parameters:
<list id="list1-0731684412449065" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Dry assembly under vacuum at 120°C for 90 min</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Elevate temperature to 190°C at approximately 10°C/min</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Isothermally process for 60 min</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Elevate temperature to 235°C and hold for 5 min</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cool rapidly &gt;14°C/min to room temperature and demould</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The samples fabricated were characterised through thermal analysis and mechanical tests that were compared against an epoxy-based specimen. The mechanical properties of the 3DCFCBT relative to the 3DCFE laminates were similar to previous work investigating 2D composites. It was discovered from thermal analysis and optical microscopy that a highly crystalline matrix was developed as a result of the standard fabrication process with microcracks formed throughout the matrix. Reprocessing and annealing of the 3DCFCBT laminate reduced the crystallinity of the polymer structure. Although this is expected to improve toughness, it was found to have a detrimental effect on the composite stiffness measured using DMTA and flexural tests and lead to reduced melting temperature.</p>
