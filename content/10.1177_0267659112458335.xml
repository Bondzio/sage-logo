<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the past several decades, cardiovascular disease has been one of the main reasons for the death rate in China. Presently, about 230 million people suffer from cardiovascular diseases in China and about 3 million people die of cardiovascular diseases annually.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112458335">1</xref></sup> Cardiovascular operation under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is the most commonly used way to treat cardiovascular diseases such as coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, rheumatic valvular heart disease and congenital heart disease, etc. Each year, about 8 million patients should receive cardiovascular operations in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112458335">2</xref></sup> and more operations are expected to be performed in the future. Furthermore, the great improvement in cardiovascular operation techniques, such as heart transplants, brings more hope to patients with critical cardiovascular conditions. Thus, the development of CPB is necessary to meet the increasing demand and to tackle the difficulty of cardiovascular operations. The study of Chinese hospitals which performed CPB and cardiovascular operations from 2003 to 2010 provides us with, not just a review of the development, but rather an overview of CPB enterprise in the future in China.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was conducted using MS excel 2007 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Microsoftstore.com">http://Microsoftstore.com</ext-link>) as follows: annual constitutions of cardiopulmonary operations on-pump and off-pump; application details of imported membrane oxygenators, domestic membrane oxygenators and domestic bubble oxygenators; the constitution of perfusionists countrywide in 2005.</p>
<p>According to the number of cardiovascular operations, hospitals in this research were divided into 8 grades: above 1000 cases, 800-1000cases, 600-800 cases, 400-600 cases, 200-400 cases, 100-200 cases, 50-100 cases and less than 50 cases. The market share of the hospitals in each grade were calculated for the year 2003 and the year 2010 (the market share of the hospitals in each grade = the number of operations in each grade ÷ the total anumber of operations countrywide).</p>

<p>Fuwai Cardiovascular Hospital holds the No.1 position in both the number of cardiovascular operations (4915 operations in 2003, 7007 operations in 2007 and 9384 operations in 2010) and the number of CPB cases (3931 cases in 2003, 5900 cases in 2007 and 7394 cases in 2010) in China for the past 8 years. Other hospitals, such as Anzhen Hospital and Xijing Hospital are also among the first grade which performed over 1000 cardiovascular operation cases annually.</p>

<sec id="section11-0267659112458335" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In our opinion, the development of CPB is crucial to the development of cardiovascular surgery to meet the increasing demands of cardiovascular operations. CPB has advanced quite a bit in the past few years, dealing with patients with serious and complicated cardiovascular conditions, including heart transplantation operations. Nonetheless, CPB is a new topic, with a history of only several decades in China. It still has a lot of potential and has a long way to go. Therefore, it is very important to analyze the development, find out the challenges and to come up with constructive suggestions on CPB in China.</p>
<p>Both the number of cardiovascular operations and the number of operations with CPB increased significantly in China in the past 8 years. About 171,000 cardiovascular operations and about 138,000 cases with CPB were performed in 2010. The ratio of operations on-pump increased from 2003 to 2007 and reached the highest point at 83.42% in 2007. However, it decreased from 2007 to 2010 and reached 80.18% in 2010. This may be the result of the increase in off-pump coronary artery bypasses performed in the past 3 years. However, an article on the long-term follow-up results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112458335">4</xref></sup> revealed that the chances of stroke, hospital re-admission, and cerebrovascular events in patients who received cardiovascular operations off-pump are higher than those receiving operations on-pump. So we predict that cardiovascular operations on-pump will be more important than operations off-pump in future. This also indicates that there is a lot of potential for the development of CPB in China.</p>
<p>As far as oxygenators were concerned, imported membrane oxygenators were mostly used and the usage ratio increased gradually. On the other hand, the usage ratio of bubble oxygenators decreased significantly because of their disadvantages, such as large priming volume, blood destruction, etc. Though membrane oxygenators are more expensive than bubble oxygenators, they have many advantages, such as a reduction in the priming volume, less blood destruction, improvement of the quality of CPB in long perfusions, an increase in the success ratio of cardiovascular operations, a reduction in complications post-operation, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112458335">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112458335"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112458335"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112458335"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112458335">9</xref></sup> These advantages were even more outstanding with the use of heparin-coated techniques in the CPB setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112458335">10</xref></sup> On the other hand, more and more Chinese people became richer in recent years. So, we predict that membrane oxygenators will be used prevalently and bubble oxygenators will gradually be eliminated through selection or competition in China. Furthermore, the usage ratio of domestic membrane oxygenators increased significantly due to the improvements in design, materials and performance. With the pricing competitiveness, domestic membrane oxygenators will be able expand their market share in the future.</p>
<p>There is a gradual increase in both the number of hospitals capable of performing cardiovascular operations and the number of operations performed by each hospital in recent years. Although the number of hospitals which performed over 1,000 cases of cardiovascular operations was three times as that of 2003, most of the other hospitals (529 hospitals) performed fewer than 200 operations annually, among which 255 hospitals performed fewer than 50 cases. As far as the market share was concerned, hospitals that performed over 1000 cases annually owned the biggest market share and their market share increased gradually to 43% in 2010, while the market share of 255 hospitals that performed less than 50 cases annually decreased gradually to 3% in 2010. This situation indicates that many new hospitals carried out cardiovascular operations and all these hospitals should improve the quality of the surgery. Moreover, the resources of cardiovascular patients should be more effectively leveraged. The development of cardiovascular surgery and CPB relies on accumulating experience through practice. It may be a waste in resources for hospitals that performed fewer than 100 operations annually, let alone gain enough experience to achieve expected improvements. Therefore, we suggest that resources on cardiovascular surgery and CPB in China should be concentrated so as to improve the countrywide level quickly in the future.</p>
<p>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a new cardiopulmonary support technique that may save patients with severe heart failure or respiratory failure. ECMO was introduced into China in 2004. Hospitals that carried out ECMO and cases of ECMO increased significantly during the past 7 years. ECMO brings Chinese CPB enterprise into a new field, including the improved expertise of perfusionists and an improvement of CPB locations. It is worth mentioning that ECMO helped save quite a number patients with flu of the H1N1 type in 2009.</p>
<p>The prospect of CPB in China is very promising because of the advancement in cardiovascular surgery techniques. Heart transplantation techniques have improved gradually and cases of CPB increase significantly. In this study, both progress and problems pertaining to CPB in China have been revealed. It is believed that progress in future can be made by concentrating resources on cardiovascular surgery and CPB, providing professional training to perfusionists and strengthening the cooperation of cardiovascular surgery teams.</p>
