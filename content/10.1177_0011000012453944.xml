<abstract>
<p>This article explores how the <italic>TCP</italic> Major Contribution, “Multicultural Clinical Supervision and Benchmarks: Empirical Support Informing Practice and Supervisor Training,” can be applied to the refining of competencies for the profession of psychology. It examines the major contributions’ thoughtful conclusions regarding effective supervisor behaviors, including the focus on the supervisory working alliance, provision of feedback to supervisees, supervisor use of self, empowering supervisees, supervisor as a competent clinician, and multicultural competencies. Implications for research and practice to enhance the profession and protect the public are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>As the profession of psychology has made significant progress defining competencies for itself, much attention has been focused on how we train and supervise in order to transmit these competencies to the next generation of psychologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012453944">Falender &amp; Shafranske, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012453944">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000012453944">Rodolfa et al., 2005</xref>). The articles in this Major Contribution describe how to implement benchmark competencies in training programs. Specifically, this Major Contribution focuses on multicultural supervision competencies.</p>
<p>One benchmark competency, the ability to create meaningful relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012453944">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>), is emphasized in all the articles in this Major Contribution. This emphasis makes sense, as the current supervisory literature highlights that the quality of supervisory relationships is measured via supervisory working alliances. The supervisory working alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012453944">Bordin, 1983</xref>) correlates with supervisees’ learning and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012453944">Bernard &amp; Goodyear, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000012453944">Ladany, Ellis, &amp; Friedlander, 1999</xref>) and results in less supervisee nondisclosures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011000012453944">Mehr, Ladany, &amp; Caskie, 2010</xref>), decreased supervisee work-related stress, and increased supervisee work satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012453944">Gnilka, Chang, &amp; Dew, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000012453944">Sterner, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>More importantly, the supervisory relationship is related to increased client benefits. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012453944">Bambling et al., (2006)</xref> investigated clinicians in a specific type of therapy by assigning them to one of three conditions: alliance-process supervision, alliance-technique supervision, and no supervision. Clients who worked with supervised clinicians, regardless of supervisory approach, reported a better working alliance with their therapist, more pronounced decrease in symptoms, increased retention, and increased satisfaction. While this study was conducted in Australia, these results speak eloquently to the impact of alliance-focused supervision on client outcomes.</p>
<p>The Benchmarks do not mention supervisory working alliance specifically, but they do describe the Elements, Goals, Bonds, and Tasks, posited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012453944">Bordin (1983)</xref>. The Expectations and Roles portion of the Supervision competency are akin to Bordin’s Goals. Similarly, the Processes and Procedures are akin to Bordin’s Tasks. Bordin’s Bond is broadly addressed by the benchmarks’ Skills Development—“Engages in professional reflection about one’s clinical relationships with supervisees, as well as supervisee’s relationships with their client” (p. S22) —as well as the Awareness of Factors Affecting Quality that states the clinical supervisee is “able to engage in reflection on the role of one’s self on therapy and in supervision” (p. S22).</p>
<p>The three studies that shared the common method of asking supervisees about their helpful supervisor behaviors agreed that a focus on the relationship was an important component of clinical growth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012453944">Ladany, Mori, and Mehr’s (2013)</xref> suggest the working alliance in supervision is key to fostering trainee learning. Their findings indicate that the best supervisors (as described by their supervisees) build strong supervisory relationships. These findings also provide some empirical evidence for the supervision benchmark competency Skills Development. Furthermore, their results suggest that implementing this benchmark includes the use of empathy and encouragement to enhance the relationship. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011000012453944">Wong, Wong, and Ishiyama (2013)</xref> found much support for the importance of the supervisory relationship, and indeed labeled a category of helpful supervisory behaviors the “relationship.” Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012453944">Burnes, Wood, Inman, and Welikson (2013)</xref> identified a cluster of Supervisor Variables that focus on the relationship dimension, including the Supervisor Use of Self in the Supervisory Relationship subcluster and the Supervisor Action/Intervention subcluster.</p>
<p>Ladany et al. found that the best supervisors provide positive and challenging feedback. This effective behavior operationalizes the Processes and Procedures supervision benchmark and exemplifies Bordin’s Tasks of Supervision. Burnes et al. described how supervisors found it helpful to decide with the trainees the tasks to be accomplished, thus emphasizing the collaborative nature of the supervisory relationship. Furthermore, reinforcing Ladany et al.’s findings, Wong et al. highlight how clear constructive feedback accompanied by guidance and debriefing was very helpful to supervisees. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011000012453944">Son, Ellis, and Yoo (2013)</xref> suggest providing even more feedback to South Korean supervisees than to U.S. supervisees, due to cultural differences where South Koreans emphasize formality and hierarchical relationships.</p>
<p>In addition to the supervisory working alliance, the findings of all three independent studies provide empirical evidence for the overlapping concepts of supervisor use of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012453944">Burnes et al., 2013</xref>) and supervisor disclosure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012453944">Ladany et al., 2013</xref>). Wong et al. provide a specific description of supervisor self-disclosure as one example of the Relationship category. All three research teams agree that the concept of supervisors’ self-disclosure for the benefit of the trainee contributes to enhanced trainee self-efficacy. Burnes et al.’s findings suggest it can even help promote exploration of professional identity. In other words, “engaging in reflection on the role of one’s self in therapy and in supervision” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012453944">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>, p. S22) is not sufficient; rather, the judicious use of self-disclosure by supervisors was very helpful to supervisees.</p>
<p>Another commonality between the three studies is the importance of empowering supervisees. What Ladany et al. describe as encouraging autonomy and openness to trainees’ ideas corresponds to both the Feminist, Theoretical Variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012453944">Burnes et al., 2013</xref>) and the Personal Attributes of the Supervisor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011000012453944">Wong et al., 2013</xref>). All three studies offer similar definitions of “educational praxis” (under benchmarks Skills Development, p. S22) and Burnes et al.’s findings indicate that supervisors’ ability to reflect on their roles and power is particularly helpful to supervisees.</p>
<p>Three concepts—Competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011000012453944">Wong et al., 2013</xref>), Supervisor Action/Intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012453944">Burnes et al., 2013</xref>), and Demonstration of Clinical Skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012453944">Ladany et al., 2013</xref>)—emphasize the importance of the supervisor as a competent or expert clinician. While Son et al. do not explicitly speak of the supervisor as a competent clinician, their recommendation that supervisors use a more eclectic theoretical approach with South Korean supervisees would likely enhance supervisees’ view of their supervisors’ expertness. Similar to these findings, during a recent discussion of supervisor competencies by the Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards, the taskforce emphasized the necessity of the supervisor being competent in the services being provided as well as in supervision itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000012453944">Schaffer, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Professionalism was mentioned by Wong et al. and Ladany et al. Both Wong et al. and Burnes et al. found that cross-cultural competencies in supervisors were helpful, including an understanding of how intersections of identity are salient in the supervision context. While Ladany et al. did not list cross-cultural competencies among best supervisors’ behaviors, they do list lack of awareness of multicultural issues in counseling as an example of Insufficient Knowledge and Skill Development. Similarly, Wong et al. found that lack of supervisor cultural competence is harmful to supervisees of color. These findings support the connection between supervisor multicultural competence and supervisory working alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012453944">Inman, 2006</xref>). Son et al. help increase supervisor multicultural competence by providing knowledge regarding working with South Korean supervisees and suggest these results may be tentatively extended to international Asian supervisees. Furthermore, these findings dovetail with the Skills Development section of the benchmarks supervision competency as well as the overall benchmarks competencies describing competent clinicians. Thus, it behooves supervisors to take specific steps to enhance their cultural competencies, as many studies including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000012453944">Gatmon et al. (2001)</xref> found that supervisors may be less competent in cross-cultural issues than their supervisees.</p>
<p>Ethical behavior is foundational to overall clinical competence and two of the studies explicitly address ethics. Burnes et al. identify a subcluster of Ethical, Relationship-Centered Variables, and Wong et al. listed the ethical supervisor as an example of the Competence category. While Ladany et al. do not specifically include ethical behavior as an effective supervisory skill, they do indicate that “inappropriate boundaries” is an ineffective supervisory behavior. Furthermore, Ladany et al. suggest studying supervisor ethical adherence as a variable. Much has been written about the foundational nature of ethics (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012453944">Goodyear &amp; Rodolfa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000012453944">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000012453944">Poe &amp; Vasquez, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000012453944">Rodolfa et al., 2005</xref>) and the need for supervisors to frame and model ethical behavior for supervisees. These current studies highlight the necessity of supervisors maintaining boundaries and not only aspiring to but adhering to the profession’s ethical principles and code of conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012453944">American Psychological Association [APA], 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Wong et al. advocate for mentorship (a specific type of relationship) as a particularly effective approach for trainees of color. Participants were recruited from five Canadian and two U.S. universities. They propose the Person-Centered Mentoring Model, which provides a useful description of what supervisees of color needed from their Caucasian supervisors. Despite similarities between the Canadian and U.S. cultures, we cannot assume that results of research done with Canadian people of color are applicable to people of color in the United States, but evidence from research done in the United States supports the idea that mentoring is beneficial to U.S. trainees of color as well (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000012453944">Maton et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-0011000012453944">
<title>Implications for Research</title>
<p>The Major Contribution provide valuable empirical data to validate several of the benchmarks. One gap in the literature that could benefit from additional research is studying supervisor training. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000012453944">Falender, Burnes, and Ellis (2013)</xref> discuss, the benchmarks appear to assume that supervisors have attained all foundational and functional competencies. However, the articles of this Major Contribution indicate that supervisors do indeed have ineffective behaviors and at times lack competency in some of the benchmark areas. Continuing to gather empirical evidence that describe useful supervisor training would be immensely helpful to the profession and the public we serve. As supervision improves, the service to clients can only improve.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000012453944">Ladany et al. (2013)</xref> believe that their study does not support developmental levels since supervisees of all developmental levels generally agreed on the content of effective and ineffective supervisory behaviors. This is a significant finding in the context of the current thinking about the development of a psychologist, where many view psychology trainees’ growth resulting from the progression through a number of stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000012453944">Loganbill, Hardy, &amp; Delworth, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000012453944">Stoltenberg &amp; McNeil, 2010</xref>). Additional research on the utility of developmental models may further dispute or validate their theoretical basis, but until then, it appears important to have a supervision model to guide the supervisor’s interaction with supervisees.</p>
<p>The benchmarks document provides a model that highlights needed competencies for supervisor development. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012453944">Falender and Shafranske (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012453944">Bernard and Goodyear (2008)</xref> provide supervisory structures based on extensive reviews of the literature rather than focusing on developmental issues. Nevertheless, additional research could help determine whether there is a developmental progression to becoming a psychologist and, if so, how the supervisor can best facilitate the supervisees’ growth.</p>
<p>It will also be useful for supervisors to understand differing cross-cultural competent behaviors when working with the diverse cultural subgroups lumped under the term <italic>international students</italic>. Unlike the link between supervisory working alliance and supervisee self-efficacy in several of the studies in this Major Contribution, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000012453944">Ng and Smith (2012)</xref> did not discover this correlation among international students and their supervisors. Instead, an acculturation variable (specifically language use) predicted counselor self-efficacy. Additional research is needed to understand whether supervisory working alliance is less important with international students or whether international trainees need to reach a certain level of language proficiency before the supervisory working alliance can impact their self-efficacy.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that further research is needed beyond the White supervisor–supervisee of color dyad. More studies that include supervisors of same and different ethnicities than that of supervisees of color are much-needed additions to the literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000012453944">Jernigan, Green, Helms, Perez-Gualdron, and Henze (2010)</xref> started some of this work by examining how racial identity development impacts supervision dyads where both members are people of color. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000012453944">Lowe and Davis (2010)</xref> edited a special issue in <italic>Training and Education in Professional Psychology</italic> titled “Sharing Wisdom: Ethnic Minority Supervisor Perspectives.” These works highlight the utility of bringing voice to a variety of supervisory perspectives and the need to bring additional research to bear of the breadth of supervisor and supervisee experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0011000012453944">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>There is an arbitrary division between research and practice, as investigating the research suggestions above will improve the practice of supervision. However, we wish to emphasize that the application of the benchmarks to the supervisory context means focusing on the functional competency of supervision as well as focusing on the breadth of competencies the supervisee is honing with the guidance of the supervisor. This is a tall order for supervisors as the benchmarks encompass 15 different competencies, three more than the cube model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000012453944">Rodolfa et al., 2005</xref>) on which it is based. Perhaps the benchmarks are too complicated. Many other professions, including psychiatry, focus on approximately six areas of competency. Is psychology more complicated than other professions, or is there another model that would be helpful to trainers and educators?</p>
<p>The Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012453944">ASPPB, 2010</xref>) published the results of their practice analysis in validating the Examination for Professional Practice in Psychology (EPPP). The ASPPB developed its model based on the views of the subject matter experts and a subsequent survey of approximately 1,500 practicing psychologists. They developed a model with six core competency clusters. The six competency clusters are scientific knowledge, evidence-based decision making/critical reasoning, cultural and interpersonal competence, professionalism/ethics, assessment, and intervention/supervision/consultation.</p>
<p>APA has also simplified the benchmarks into six overarching clusters (Professionalism, Relational, Science, Application, Education and Systems) to reduce the redundancy and enhance the consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012453944">APA, 2011</xref>). We applaud both these efforts as we believe that simplification of the competencies will facilitate implementation by academic programs, training agencies, as well as licensing boards, who will ultimately test and decide whether a student has the competencies to practice independently as a psychologist.</p>
<p>We do, however, caution the leaders who are making efforts to simplify the competencies of the profession to do so while providing sufficient guidance describing the needed behavioral exemplars of the competencies. For instance, the current benchmarks provide a helpful roadmap of the various multicultural competencies, including awareness, sensitivity, and skills about self, others, interaction of the two, and applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012453944">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>). The ASPPB Practice Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012453944">ASPPB, 2010</xref>) infuses a multicultural competency framework throughout its competency statements and exemplars including a strong knowledge basis, self-reflection, skills, self and other monitoring, and professional interactions to understand social context are explicitly described.</p>
<p>For supervision competencies, the benchmarks delineate expectations and roles, processes and procedures, skill development, awareness of factors affecting quality, participation in supervision process, and ethical and legal issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012453944">Fouad et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012453944">ASPPB (2010)</xref> supervision competency emphasizes the roles and responsibilities of the supervisor, self-monitoring, understanding supervisory models, maintaining boundaries, appropriate mentor supervisees, and evaluation to determine the effectiveness of the supervision.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The articles in this Major Contribution continue our profession’s evolving dialogue on competency. In particular, the articles operationalize numerous benchmarks and provide a specific pathway to help supervisors become increasingly multiculturally competent. As a result, these articles assist psychologists to enhance their ability to provide effective supervision to the diverse students who are entering the profession of psychology.
