<p><italic>Big Ideas for Little Kids</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477878512437461">Wartenberg, 2009</xref>) is a wonderful little book, exactly the kind of book I wish had existed when I first starting thinking about philosophy for children. While I was in graduate school, I ventured with a fellow student to Montclair, New Jersey, for a workshop offered by the Institute for the Advancement of Philosophy for Children (IAPC) program. While I was very impressed with the creativity and comprehensiveness of the curriculum created by Matthew Lipman, I left feeling a bit unsure about the IAPC novels. I loved the translation of difficult philosophical issues into accessible stories, but because each novel was so <italic>packed</italic> with philosophical ideas, I didn’t feel drawn to the arc of the stories. The characters weren’t fully developed, so I didn’t find myself really caring about them. I wanted compelling and richly developed stories <italic>and</italic> great philosophical content.</p>
<p>That combination is what Tom Wartenberg delivers in this book. The third section of the book provides a marvelous collection of children’s stories that contain the seeds of philosophical puzzles, and excellent ideas for helping young students to begin to grapple with them. Each chapter achieves an admirable balance of accessible background on the relevant area of philosophy with detailed connections to the story at hand. This is the kind of handbook that will give comfort to the philosophically green teacher or student who is interested in helping her students talk philosophically but is understandably nervous about how to do so. Many of my students who take our philosophy for children seminar (and lead discussions in local schools) are already very grateful for the service Wartenberg has provided here (as well as on his website, which contains a real treasure trove of lesson plans linked to philosophical literature for children).</p>
<p>So, broadly speaking, I am a huge fan of the book. Nonetheless, there are at least two points that Wartenberg addresses in the introductory chapters of the book about which I have potential concerns: one is the question of who can lead a good philosophy discussion with children, and the other is about the benefits that come from doing philosophy with children, and how we assess them.</p>
<sec id="section1-1477878512437461">
<title>Who is qualified to lead philosophy discussions?</title>
<p>Wartenberg starts the book reassuringly, arguing that anyone can help children to do philosophy – teachers, non-philosophy majors, and parents are all invited to make use of the techniques described in the book, and encouraged to see themselves as perfectly capable of doing it. On the one hand, I agree that everyone can think philosophically and serve as an umpire of sorts for a philosophical discussion. On the other hand, doing that job <italic>well</italic> – like being a <italic>good</italic> umpire – might require more than is acknowledged in the book.</p>
<p>Knowing the rules of the game is a necessary condition for serving as an umpire. Of course, one need not know every possible rule in order to serve as a good-enough umpire in a baseball game. Perhaps certain situations arise so rarely that one need not be fully apprised of the particular rules to do a good job. But knowing the most pertinent rules is not a sufficient condition for being a <italic>good</italic> umpire. One also must be able to exercise sound judgment in implementing the rules, even as the game is ongoing. In baseball (to use Wartenberg’s analogy), this might mean that an umpire needs to be able to distinguish balls from strikes even when the pitch is fast, has a curve, or drops late. In philosophy discussions, the facilitator needs the six general rules that Wartenberg very nicely elaborates (state your position clearly, after taking time to think; figure out if you agree or disagree with what’s been said; present a real example of an abstract issue; think of counterexamples to the proposed claim; consider whether the claim can be revised in light of criticism; always support your view with reasons: 29–32). But the facilitator also needs more than that. She needs a philosophical ear. She needs to be able to hear when something proposed by a student has real promise, and when it is just another example or another way of saying the same thing.</p>
<p>Wartenberg certainly agrees with this, and highlights the importance of the facilitator providing ‘markers’ (58) to show progress made in the discussion. Still, I’m not sure that the difficulty of gaining the <italic>skill</italic> necessary to do this well is fully acknowledged. Knowing when a discussion is not moving forward, and having a clear idea of how it might be nudged appropriately is very important for a facilitator, but also one of the most difficult skills to acquire.</p>
<p>How does one gain the skill of excellent philosophical facilitation? Surely a significant part of it has to do with simple experience in considering philosophical issues, so that one feels comfortable with the open-ended nature of the discussions <italic>and</italic> has some sense of the range of positions that might be raised regarding a particular topic. Part of this presumes that one can cultivate something like <italic>philosophical sensitivity</italic> (Jana Mohr Lone’s term for this awareness) through attention and effort. No doubt some people who have never studied philosophy can have highly attuned philosophical ears; others who have training may nonetheless continue to have difficulty picking up on good philosophical content when they hear it. I’m open to the idea that one need not have significant background in the history of philosophy to lead a good philosophical discussion with children, but doing so takes more than just a simple grasp of basic rules of engagement.</p>
<p>One of the dangers of <italic>not</italic> facilitating philosophical discussions well – one that Wartenberg recognizes in the book (58) – is that students will end up frustrated, with the sense that they’ve gone nowhere, and that philosophy is not really helpful in understanding the world more fully and richly. Of course, some philosophical discussions will inevitably end in that fashion – not every discussion forges ahead, and sometimes even when we think we’ve cleared some conceptual space, we end up realizing it’s even more complicated than we’d imagined. But, on the whole, we want philosophical discussions to offer a sense of making intellectual progress. In that way, it is somewhat unlike the game of baseball to which Wartenberg compares it – it is not simply an idle pastime, a group of kids spending time in a fun pursuit with some made-up rules, but a quest for deeper understanding (that also happens to be fun). Also, to the extent that teachers fully take up the learner-centered model of education, they will need to be ready to <italic>hear</italic> new philosophical issues bubbling up, ones they might not have noticed in their initial reads (as Wartenberg confesses happened to him in reading the Frog and Toad story ‘The Dream’ and realizing it might have more to do with the morality of bragging than with the question of skepticism about the external world: 43).</p>
<p>I agree with Wartenberg that kids really do seem to be ‘natural-born philosophers’ (16), who need help in learning to discuss philosophy but not necessarily in learning to care about and appreciate it. But offering that help, I think, requires more than grasping and applying the simple rules of engagement. Having some training in philosophy would help significantly, and this may be one reason to argue in favor of having students with at least some philosophy experience in the classroom working with the teachers, at least initially.</p>

<sec id="section2-1477878512437461">
<title>What are the benefits of doing philosophy with children, and how do we assess them?</title>
<p>In the book, Wartenberg mentions many of the benefits of doing philosophy with children: keeping students engaged in their education by taking seriously their questions about the world, improving critical thinking, educating for democracy, and more. Students who develop philosophical skills learn how to think logically, express abstract ideas clearly, and creatively imagine alternatives. These skills should translate readily into other academic endeavors, as well as serving useful purposes in all arenas of life. Furthermore, done the way Wartenberg proposes, philosophy need not be an ‘add-on’ subject, but can simply enrich and more fully explore subject matter that is already in the curriculum.</p>
<p>I agree with all these claims, but one is left wondering why <italic>anyone</italic> would be opposed to including philosophy in our schools. Perhaps, as Wartenberg explicitly acknowledges, it is because philosophers (young and old) can be real ‘pains in the butt’ (12). Philosophers want to stop and analyze everything, and we regularly insist on answers supported by good reasons. We can split metaphorical hairs as well as lawyers, and often in areas that seem to have less practical import.</p>
<p>Our thinking about thinking can be stimulating and perplexing and profoundly rewarding to us and those doing it with us, but to others, who would like to ‘get on with it’, we can be incredibly vexing. Those others, I now realize, include many parents. There’s something to said for ‘getting on with it’ when one has classes to teach, deadlines to make, meetings to attend, and the impending morning bell for the school day. Wartenberg, I am sure, would agree. Perhaps all that matters is that we help children (and adult philosophers) see that sometimes we need to move forward on a practical matter, even if some of our philosophical musings remain unsettled. Putting the philosophical issue aside for later contemplation and discussion is not the same as treating it as irrelevant or unimportant. Furthermore, we do want children to question whether adults are always right in thinking that any particular matter must be decided immediately for practical purposes. Still, if I were a school teacher, I can imagine being a bit intimidated by the idea that we want all children to become ‘more assertive, more intellectually independent, and less pliable . . .’ (139). With 28 of them in a room, I might at least question the wisdom of that plan.</p>
<p>Given that I am generally on board with the project, this concern only means that I think we need to be clear just what will be given up, and what the reasons are for thinking it is a trade-off worth pursuing. I am in favor of developing philosophical skills and questioning authority, but only with the addition of a cultivated capacity for judgment.</p>
<p>One final note on assessment merits a mention. Those who lead philosophy discussions with children generally find them incredibly rewarding, and we notice the ways that children develop important skills in the process. But proving that to others may be more difficult. This problem has moved some members of the philosophy for children community to think carefully about how to <italic>assess</italic> the benefits of doing philosophy with children. Wartenberg’s only comment related to assessment occurs on page 19:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Because the dialogue that emerges from this process of joint investigation is itself evidence that learning is taking place – or failing to – there is no need for imposing a punitive style of assessment on the learning process. The success of an investigation can simply be registered through a careful examination of the discussion itself as well as by the students’ own reflection on it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I am less sure about that. Like Wartenberg, I am inclined to think that standardized testing is not very well-suited to demonstrating what children learn through doing philosophy. On the other hand, simply inviting students to reflect on their own discussion may also not suffice. I would like to hear much more about what might count as evidence that learning did <italic>not</italic> take place. This relates back to my concern about training facilitators, for we might worry that a philosophy discussion group that regularly stalls out in example-land, because the facilitator is not helping to move the discussion forward, could qualify as a failure of learning. Students may be somewhat dissatisfied with the discussion when they reflect back on it, but they might also suggest that they have learned something nonetheless, and that they are content with that. We would want some further way of judging the accuracy of their reflections on the discussion, and that is something the broader philosophy for children community should begin to address more carefully.</p>
<p>All in all, this is a splendid book, and I recommend it highly.</p>
