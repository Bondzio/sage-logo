<abstract>
<p>In this qualitative study we examined the experience and perception of hope of 10 Israeli soldiers with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with the goal of achieving an understanding of the manners in which hope intertwines with trauma. The results indicate that hope is an integrative, changing, multidimensional phenomenon which plays a unique role in the individual’s life. Viewing hope as a crucial aspect of human life was further evident when participants referred to the traumatic event. Hope and trauma are interconnected phenomena. The form of hope a person possesses thus shapes the manner in which the traumatic event is perceived, whereas the trauma clearly reshapes the individual’s form of hope. We discuss practical implications for treatment of chronic PTSD, based on the important role of hope at times of trauma, as well as on the interrelation between hope and trauma.</p>

<p>Interest in hope increased markedly during the late 20th Century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312458184">Snyder, 2000</xref>). Although it is conceptualized differently across different disciplines, there is broad agreement on the value of hope for people in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312458184">Cheavens, Michael, Snyder, &amp; Elliott, 2005</xref>), and for individuals in crisis in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312458184">Berendes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312458184">Bergin &amp; Walsh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312458184">Elliott &amp; Oliver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312458184">Glass, Flory, Hankin, Kloos, &amp; Turecki, 2009</xref>). Hope is perceived as essential for individuals’ well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312458184">Herth, 1995</xref>), and as an effective psychosocial resource for coping with difficult life experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312458184">Ai, Cascio, Santangelo, &amp; Evans-Campbell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312458184">Ho et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312458184">Holtslander &amp; Duggleby, 2009</xref>). However, the manner in which hope assists in overcoming difficult life situations, and especially the perspectives of individuals who have gone through difficult, traumatic life experiences with reference to the way hope is intertwined in the process, has not been clarified to date.</p>
<p>Our study was grounded in the premise that research from the perspective of individuals who experienced a traumatic event can increase the applicability, practicality, and usefulness of hope theories in guiding research and shaping practice that meets the needs of such individuals. Our goals in this qualitative research were therefore to (a) reveal the perceptions of hope of individuals who had gone through a traumatic life experience, and (b) examine ways in which hope was intertwined with the traumatic event.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312458184">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>The concept of hope is complex, multifaceted, and multidimensional, such that it is difficult to apply a single definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312458184">Morse &amp; Doberneck, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312458184">Stephenson, 1991</xref>), because this could lead to oversimplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312458184">Hopper, 2001</xref>). Hope is described as an emotion, an experience, a need, a characteristic, a state, or a dynamic process with affective, functional, contextual, temporal, and relational dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312458184">Default &amp; Martocchio, 1985</xref>). Such a definition emphasizes the need to address hope not as a single concept, but rather as a phenomenon: the phenomenon of hope.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312458184">Morse and Doberneck (1995)</xref> identified seven abstract and universal components of the phenomenon of hope: a realistic initial assessment of the predicament of threat, the envisioning of alternatives, the setting of goals, a bracing for negative outcomes, a realistic assessment of personal resources, the solicitation of mutually supportive relationships, the continuous evaluation of signs that reinforce the selected goals, and a determination to endure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732312458184">Stephenson (1991)</xref> described four attributes of hope: the object of hope is meaningful to the person; hope is a process involving thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and relationships; there is an element of anticipation; and there is a positive future orientation that is grounded in the present and linked with the past. The necessity and the dynamism of hope in times of crisis are emphasized in these descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732312458184">Verhaeghe, van Zuuren, Defloor, Duijnstee, &amp; Grypdonck, 2007</xref>), thus making the phenomenon of hope especially relevant for people experiencing traumatic life events. Methodologist scholars have highlighted the relevance of examining individuals who have experienced the phenomenon under study in its extreme (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312458184">Patton, 1990</xref>). We therefore aimed at revealing the manner in which hope was perceived by individuals diagnosed with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1049732312458184">1</xref></sup> and the way hope intertwined with their traumatic experience.</p>

<sec id="section2-1049732312458184">
<title>Hope and Psychotherapy</title>
<p>Researchers have found negative correlations between hope and various mental illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312458184">Haynal, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312458184">Johnson et al., 2001</xref>), as well as positive correlations between hope and psychiatric recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312458184">Schrank, Stanghellini, &amp; Slade, 2008</xref>). Hope was further recognized as a central concept in predicting the outcomes of interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312458184">Cheavens, Gum, &amp; Burns, 2010</xref>), including therapeutic interventions with victims of traumatic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049732312458184">Yohani, 2010</xref>). These researchers recognized that hope is important and relevant for the therapy process and for therapists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732312458184">Ward &amp; Wampler, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312458184">Frank (1968)</xref>, for example, claimed that a patient will not come for therapy in the first place, or that he (or she) will not stay long unless he (or she) has hopes that the therapist can help him (or her). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312458184">Cooper, Darmody, and Dolan (2003)</xref> asserted that the treatment outcome will be more positive if the therapist can uncover hope, instill hope, or enable clients to express hope. Hanna identified hope as a precursor for change and possibility: ‘‘It inspires both action and courage, and it paves the way for the realization of dreams, whether simple or sublime’’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312458184">2002</xref>, p. 93).</p>
<p>Literature on the role of hope in overcoming emotional difficulties such as depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312458184">Cheavens et al., 2010</xref>), anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312458184">Arnau, Rosen, Finch, Rhudy, &amp; Fortunato, 2007</xref>), and traumatic life events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312458184">Jacoby &amp; Keinan, 2003</xref>), as well as the specific role of hope in treatments for PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312458184">Husain, 2005</xref>), does not present the perspectives of those who are involved—mainly patients. Academic discourses can be enriched by understanding the views of those who actually have experienced the phenomenon. In the following we provide an in-depth account of how hope was perceived by Israeli soldiers with chronic PTSD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732312458184" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The current research was a qualitative investigation based on the in-depth semistructured interview as a method of data collection and the thematic method as a means of data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312458184">Patton, 1990</xref>). Qualitative research is the method of choice when the underlying theories are not formulated, the existing theories are questioned or, as in this case, when the phenomenon has received minimal empirical examination and requires an exploratory descriptive approach. Furthermore, qualitative research is especially suitable for studying individuals’ subjective experiences and perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312458184">Daly, 1992</xref>), as in this case: the perceptions of hope of soldiers with chronic PTSD.</p>
<sec id="section4-1049732312458184">
<title>Research Context and Participants</title>
<p>Israeli citizens are at a disproportionately higher risk of experiencing traumatic events than other comparable populations because of their prolonged exposure to political violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312458184">Hamama-Raz, Solomon, Cohen, &amp; Laufer, 2008</xref>). Nationally representative samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312458184">Bleich, Gelkopf, &amp; Solomon, 2003</xref>) have shown that Israeli citizens tend to report trauma- and stress-related mental health symptoms, the most frequent symptoms being avoidance/numbing (55.5% of the participants), followed by hyperarousal symptoms (49.4%), and reexperiencing trauma-related scenes (37.1%). These symptoms are often associated with the participants’ reports of feeling depressed or gloomy (58.6%, out of which 28% reported feeling “very depressed”).</p>
<p>Likewise, Israeli soldiers are prone to experience difficult/traumatic events during their military service. Those soldiers diagnosed with PTSD are eligible for psychological treatment. Because this population of chronic PTSD victims is cared for and receives ongoing treatment, we chose to recruit participants for the current study from this population. On approval from Tel Aviv University’s Institutional Review Board, ten soldiers who were in regular or reserve military service volunteered to participate in this study. All participants were diagnosed with PTSD according to the criteria of the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312458184">American Psychological Association, 2000</xref>) at least 1 year prior to the beginning of the research, following their exposure to a traumatic event during their military service. The participants were exposed to different types of traumatic events: war; being taken prisoner; operational activity in Lebanon, Judea, Samaria, or Gaza; or terrorist attacks. All participants were treated at the Stress Reaction Unit of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Mental Health Center.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732312458184">
<title>The Interview Process</title>
<p>Data were obtained through in-depth semistructured interviews (in Hebrew) by the first author, a social worker who serves as an IDF mental health officer. Most of the interviews were based on one session (<italic>n</italic> = 6), whereas others involved two (<italic>n</italic> = 3) or three sessions (<italic>n</italic> = 1) with the participants. This variation was based on the participants’ requests to halt the interview and continue within a few days. Four participants were interviewed at their homes, and the rest at the IDF Mental Health Center, according to the participants’ preferences. The interviews lasted between 3 and 5 hours; they were audiotaped and fully transcribed.</p>
<p>All interviews opened with the same two questions: How do you define hope? What is the meaning of hope for you? After addressing these general questions, the interviews proceeded to reveal the role of hope in the participant’s life before the traumatic event, at the time of the traumatic event, and after the traumatic event. The interviews were conducted in a flexible manner, because the questions were phrased based on the flow of the interview and the participant’s answers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312458184">Drew, 1993</xref>), while connecting the participant’s life events that were raised during the interview to the phenomenon of hope and its role in times of crisis and trauma.</p>
<p>The interviews and most of the analyses were completed in Hebrew, and data were translated into English only at the reporting stage. Extensive efforts were made to accurately represent the spirit of the informants’ meanings by consulting dual-language speakers, native English speakers, and native Hebrew speakers. This process was especially challenging, because participants often used slang, black humor, and metaphors that do not translate neatly into English. These language- and culture-specific quotations were too often untranslatable and, therefore, we did not use them. Nonetheless, an attempt was made to provide the reader with as close a sense of the original as possible throughout the Results section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312458184">
<title>Thematic Analysis Procedure</title>
<p>We read and reread each transcript at least three times to gain a comprehensive sense of the participants’ important ideas. Only after reaching a holistic, global sense of the data did the analysis task begin. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312458184">Glesne and Peshkin (1992)</xref> outlined several steps in the process of thematic analysis in qualitative research: “Writing memos . . . developing analytic files, applying rudimentary coding schemes, and writing reports” (p. 128). The analysis began by once again reading and rereading the transcripts and stories, highlighting words, phrases, and sentences that appeared to have thematic significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312458184">Patton, 1990</xref>). At this point we made notes in the margins of the text without taking connections between the stories into account. We later used these notes in the process of outlining and naming the themes; for example, the initial note, “differences in the amount of hope people hold” was later conceptualized as “hope as a quantifiable phenomenon.”</p>
<p>As we worked through each of the stories, we began to develop coding schemes to help identify sections that related to each other and to specific themes: “As the process of naming and locating . . . data bits proceeds . . . categories divide and subdivide” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312458184">Glesne &amp; Peshkin, 1992</xref>, p. 13). Definite connections between meanings were found among stories, which allowed us to put “like minded pieces together into data clumps” (Glesne &amp; Peshkin, p. 133). In this process the note described above was further examined and an additional characteristic of the phenomenon was added to it. This process resulted in the subtheme titled “hope as an idiosyncratic quantifiable phenomenon,” which was part of the first identified theme describing the participants’ definitions of hope. After countless readings of the stories, highlighting significant elements, and coding and categorizing these pieces into data clumps, we examined this collection of categories to determine how they fit logically with one another. We were able to develop four general themes: definition of hope, sources of hope, various levels of hope, and clashes between the trauma and hope.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732312458184">
<title>Credibility and Transferability</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312458184">Guba and Lincoln (1994)</xref> clarified that in naturalistic inquiry, the equivalent terms for internal and external validity are credibility and transferability. The methods used to enhance the credibility and transferability of the research included interviews of long duration. The use of those methods allowed for checking consistencies in meanings expressed by informants over time, and the conduct of interviews in ways that would fairly represent the realities and perspectives of the people interviewed. No attempts were made to push participants toward any way of thinking. Also, many opportunities were provided for clarifying what people said, pursuing what they meant, and checking for accuracy in interpretations. A detailed description of the analysis is provided so that readers can evaluate the process by which the results were obtained.</p>
<p>The analysis was conducted by three researchers with different academic backgrounds, at different stages in their lives, and with different professional involvement with chronic PTSD victims. The data were therefore examined from a variety of perspectives at all stages of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312458184">Guba &amp; Lincoln, 1994</xref>). Direct quotes are presented so the reader can critically evaluate our interpretations of the participants’ voices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312458184">Rosenblatt &amp; Fischer, 1993</xref>). Finally, the results were read by all research participants, who provided encouraging feedback concerning the accuracy of the analysis.</p>

<sec id="section8-1049732312458184" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Findings and Discussion</title>
<p>Hope was perceived as a crucial part of the trauma experience and was prominent in every participant’s story. The perception that hope exists and can be reactivated was the main reason the participants “hung on” at the time of the trauma and especially shortly after the event was over. Understanding the ways in which hope is intertwined at times of traumatic events requires attention to the manner in which it was part of the participants’ lives before their respective traumatic events, as well as their definitions and conceptualizations of hope. Thus, understanding hope from the perspectives of soldiers diagnosed with PTSD requires attention to four themes: (a) definition of hope, (b) sources of hope, (c) forms of hope, and (d) clashes between hope and the trauma.

<title>Definition of Hope</title>
<p>Hope is a universal, ongoing, idiosyncratic, dialectic human experience that allows one to continue living because it involves an optimistic view of the future. The phenomenon of hope has both conscious and unconscious aspects. The conscious dimension involves a dominant cognitive part based on setting goals and making efforts to accomplish these goals. The unconscious dimension is recognized as a helpful tool at times when a person is unable to think rationally. Overall, the participants recognized five dimensions that constructed their definitions of hope: (a) hope as a source of life; (b) hope as a means for accomplishing personal goals; (c) hope as an idiosyncratic quantifiable phenomenon; (d) hope as a desirable yet unattainable end state; and (e) talking about hope. These dimensions included cognitive theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312458184">Snyder, 2000</xref>) and the psychodynamic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312458184">Mitchell, 1993</xref>) to perceptions of hope.</p>
<sec id="section10-1049732312458184">
<title>Hope as a source of life</title>
<p>Hope can be defined as a positive prospective outlook which enables the individual to maintain life and continue coping even in the most difficult life situations: “Hope is an optimistic perspective which is characterized by an urge and a desire to live, to go on living”; “Hope is the drive for life; it is the drug of life. . . . Hope allows you to stay in those difficult situations, to keep your head above the water. It prevents you from sinking.” The understanding that hope is a source of life, necessary for life itself, was previously addressed in studies on bereaved individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312458184">Cutcliffe, 2004</xref>), as well as among philosophers who clearly claimed that without hope, an individual will die (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312458184">Frankl, 1962</xref>).</p>
<p>The essential aspect of hope in human existence was addressed in its conscious as well as its unconscious forms. The participants described an unconscious element of hope which exists within the individual without the need to think about it:
<disp-quote>
<p>Yes, this [hope] is something unconscious. . . . It sits here inside unconsciously and simply envelops me and accompanies me in any shape, usually when I walk in it. That is, this is something that I don’t have to think about, to connect with. It simply exists in me and that’s it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hope was described as a subjective possession of the individual, one that is highly important at times of crisis or trauma and has relevance for therapeutic processes. In the next dimension, attention is given to the hoper and implies active occupation of the hoper as an additional definitional element of hope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312458184">Elliott &amp; Oliver, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049732312458184">
<title>Hope as a means for accomplishing personal goals</title>
<p>A common aspect of the definition of hope was in the context of future attempts to achieve desirable aims and goals. Within this domain, hope serves as a buffer against challenges the individual has difficulties in achieving. This characteristic of hope as a resource for accomplishing goals enabled Israeli soldiers to “hang on,” to “keep fighting” in times of adversity:

<p>First of all hope is when I can aspire to something, I can set goals for myself, ambitions, which I know I will eventually realize . . . meaning when it comes to hope—it is a mission that I need to accomplish.</p>
<p>Hope helps to aspire . . . in setting goals and in reaching these ambitions and goals in different ways.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Within the current domain participants emphasized not only the cognitive aspect, but also perceived hope as an intrapsychic force, a drive which motivates individuals in the process of achieving their goals: “Hope is also something that comes from the inside, part of your willpower; it is an inner part of yourself. When you have willpower or internal forces to do something, to achieve, this is hope.” “Hope is the fuel that drives and motivates you to accomplish what you wish for.”</p>

<title>Hope as an idiosyncratic quantifiable phenomenon</title>
<p>“Different people have different goals,” stated one of the participants. Thus, hope is an idiosyncratic phenomenon. It differs from one individual to the other, yet it is universal, because it is essential for life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312458184">Levi, Savaya, &amp; Liechtentritt, 2011</xref>). It is also a continual, changeable phenomenon, as indicated by the participants’ recognition that people can have various forms<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1049732312458184">2</xref></sup> and amounts of hope at different stages of their lives:
<disp-quote>
<p>Hope differs from one person to the other. There are people with more hope and people with less hope; there are people with higher aspirations, and there are people who aspire for less.</p>
<p>Hope is a process, a continual one. There is always hope in your life, It never stops, yet it can change and alter, which might be perceived by others as if hope does not exist in their life anymore, but this is not the case.</p>

<title>Hope as a desirable yet unattainable end state</title>
<p>Hope can be a concrete resource which assists the individual in reaching his or her goal, yet it was further described as a more abstract component that requires people to continue and develop while recognizing that hope cannot be entirely fulfilled or accomplished:
<disp-quote>
<p>Hope is this huge thing you have, which pushes you to go on. It is endless, because what you hope for will never be completely fulfilled. It is something intangible, abstract, that you hold on to because it is a useful tool that helps you cope with life’s difficulties. My hope is to be at peace with myself. I know that to be fully at peace with oneself is unattainable. This is why I talked about hope as abstract, unattainable. It is endless, unfulfilled by reaching some concrete goals, hope is never fully fulfilled. Hope[s] are those big ideas to which you aspire.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section14-1049732312458184">
<title>Talking about hope</title>
<p>The last aspect concerning the definition of hope is the perception of patients with chronic PTSD in the ways they talked about hope. Participants compared and contrasted hope with various concepts, including motivation, optimism, goals, aspirations, and values, as well as with the lack of hope—hopeless situations and despair. Consider, for example, one participant’s distinction between optimism and hope:
<disp-quote>
<p>Optimism is a sense that good things happen in the world and good things can happen to you. Hope is something much bigger, global, that covers many areas and aspects of your life, and you might not sense any positive outcomes, although you hope that something good will happen to you.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While examining each of these concepts, the participants concluded that hope is a wider, more comprehensive and more valuable possession of the individual. The importance of hope is evident not only in the participants’ comments but also by the manner in which they chose to present their perspectives, because they often drew on common metaphors regarding hope. Metaphors are representations of an important aspect of human beings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312458184">Orange, 2011</xref>). Thus, hope was perceived as an essential and valuable possession for human existence. Furthermore, it was perceived as being quantifiable, meaning that the individual can also experience “no hope.” Long and profound experiences of hopelessness were associated with the absence of a drive for life.</p>

<sec id="section15-1049732312458184">
<title>Sources of Hope</title>
<p>The participants recognized several sources of hope that might be described by adopting a developmental perspective: from the moment of birth until the establishment of one’s own nuclear family, the current developmental stage of most of the research participants. These sources of hope were perceived as important prior to the traumatic event as well as afterwards: (a) one’s own genetic charge; (b) parents; (c) additional socialization agents including educational figures and peer-group members; (d) experiences in the military service; and (e) work environments and the establishment of a new nuclear family.</p>
<sec id="section16-1049732312458184">
<title>The genetic charge</title>
<p>The first source for hope is present at the moment of birth. The participants acknowledged that a child comes into the world with a specific genetic prototype which includes “seeds of hope.” These seeds are supposed to develop and blossom throughout the cycle of life:
<disp-quote>
<p>Hope is built into your personality. It is something you are born with. You are born with it and then hope develops throughout your life.</p>
<p>Hope is an internal phenomenon, a grain, part of the core we are born with. Everyone is born with some levels of hope, and this is what carries you throughout the difficulties you experience. I think I was born with this amount of hope [shows a relatively large amount with his hands], but this was reduced dramatically because of the events I experienced.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1049732312458184">
<title>Parents</title>
<p>The second source of hope, which was perceived as a natural continuation of the first, was the child’s parents: “I believe the mother is very influential in the child’s development of hope . . . her influence on hope is powerful.” The mother’s care is a crucial component for the child’s development of hope. Parental care, characterized by positive, nurturing, encouraging experiences, will enable the child to continue to develop hope with reference to his own strengths as well as his perspective of the world around him. The mother is important during the infancy years; she is the one who fulfills the basic needs the child so desperately needs. This is the time when the child develops his self-confidence; this is when he meets the world for the first time. This is why the mother is so influential in determining how the child’s hope will develop and be shaped: “Through the fulfillment of the basic needs the child develops his ability to trust others, which in turn increases his level of hope.”</p>
<p>The participants also paid attention to the father’s role in the development of the child’s hope. Whereas the mother’s role was emphasized as a source of hope in the first years of the child’s life, when the infant grows up both parents’ reactions were perceived as potential sources of increasing (or decreasing) the level of hope:
<disp-quote>
<p>Both parents play an important role in the development of hope. I think parents complement one another in that sense . . . each has a different role, and their importance alternates throughout the childhood years.</p>
<p>There are developmental stages in which the mother is the central figure . . . there are years in which the father’s role is more dominant. . . . My father taught me how to dream, to aspire, to hope, to believe in myself and in a better future.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When both parents are attentive, available, and responsive to the child’s needs, the child’s hope can increase and develop. Parents contribute to hope not only in a direct manner. The parents’ roles in teaching the child about cause and effect processes further contributes to the enhancement of hope. These linear explanations enable the child to learn how to achieve aspired outcomes, thus increasing the sense of hope:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is obvious that parents are most influential. The ways they care and educate their children will determine the child’s faith in himself, his ability to aspire, to set goals and make efforts to achieve them. . . . These are things you obtain from home. . . . You will see a direct reflection of the home’s atmosphere in the child’s view of the world, as well as his perception of himself and his self-worth.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The parents’ positive feedback and encouragement, which contribute to the child’s self-confidence and sense of control, further indirectly assist the continual development of hope:
<disp-quote>
<p>Parents who are sensitive to the child’s needs will allow him to try new things . . . they will be there with them. . . . There are parents who are attentive, helpful, assisting, provide you with self-confidence and security. They are the ones who allow their children to develop a positive sense of hope.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The intuitive understanding of individuals about indirect ways of promoting hope is partially evident in empirical research which revealed, for example, that higher-hope individuals feel more positively and have more positive thinking than those with lower hope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312458184">Danoff-Burg, Prelow, &amp; Swenson, 2004</xref>). High-hope children are able to associate themselves with positive events in their environment and distance themselves from negative events. For children, this ability correlates with coping in that it increases their feelings of competence and decreases their feelings of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732312458184">Snyder, Michael, &amp; Cheavens, 1999</xref>). Hope is also a significant factor in the realm of problem solving and coping. Those with higher hope scores are better at problem-focused coping than those with lower hope scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732312458184">Snyder et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1049732312458184">
<title>Teachers and members of the peer group</title>
<p>As the child grows, hope changes and is influenced by additional socialization figures, including teachers and the child’s peer group:
<disp-quote>
<p>Your preschool teacher . . . the teachers you had, the children with whom you went to kindergarten and to school. . . . These are very influential people who shaped your identity, your perception of yourself, and the ways hope develops in you.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teachers play an important role in helping children exercise setting goals and realizing them. The establishment of such a task-oriented approach is important for the continuity of hope. Furthermore, as stated by one of the participants, teachers strongly shape the manner in which the child perceives himself. Teachers’ perceptions of the child as capable, resourceful, and skillful further contribute to the development of hope:
<disp-quote>
<p>I believe the manner in which I coped with captivity had a lot to do with the way hope was instilled in me. . . . A huge potential to the development of hope exists in the manner in which teachers treat you. It is important that teachers be aware of their role in that regard. . . . I believed in myself in the most difficult situation partly because I always knew that adults perceive me as a capable, highly intelligent individual.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In preadolescence and adolescence, the peer group plays an important role in the child’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312458184">Erikson, 1963</xref>). Interactions with the peer group are a potential source of hope:
<disp-quote>
<p>We were a group. They were like role models to me; we each provided the other with a sense of hope. . . . Friends are very important because you talk with them about your hopes . . . you observe them, see what they are doing to cope, to maintain and increase hope.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants talked at length about the direct as well as the indirect role group members play as an important source of hope, especially at times of crisis and trauma. The indirect manner in which the peer group contributes to hope was named “group hope.” Group hope is a source of hope that exists in the interaction among group members, not held by any particular individual but rather perceived as a group asset:
<disp-quote>
<p>[Friends] provide you with hope, because you feel you are obligated to them not to break down, to continue. . . . We did not allow any of us to “fall down,” to break.</p>
<p>This sense of belonging to a group of people who care about you, it’s an important strength, an enormous amount of hope. . . . We were the four of us there [in captivity] together, and at the darkest moments we drew on each other and on the group as a whole for hope.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1049732312458184">
<title>Military service</title>
<p>Military service is an additional source of hope. Military service is mandatory in Israel and is perceived as an important aspect in the development of young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312458184">Levi, 2008</xref>). During their military service, participants were forced to set complicated goals which necessitated use of sophisticated strategies for achieving them, the involvement of others, as well as their own physical strengths and mental capacities. Succeeding in these multiple-task processes served as a source of their own hope:
<disp-quote>
<p>The military service . . . gave me hope that I can succeed and help others, that I can overcome challenges and improve.</p>
<p>From the very first days of my military service I felt the change. I improved the manner in which I cope with people who are different, with authorities, with stressful situations. . . . In that sense, my hope developed and increased.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1049732312458184">
<title>Work environment and the establishment of a nuclear family</title>
<p>The last sources of hope were based on the participants’ current life situations. Informants discussed their work environment and the establishment of a new nuclear family as relevant sources of hope. Unlike the previously discussed sources of hope, these last bases of hope were perceived as secondary sources: “This place [work] cannot be the first that allows you to develop hope, but if you have a good base it can be an uplifting experience, an additional source of hope.” Discussing the role of work as a source of hope was mainly through work demands which had the potential, if successful, to promote hope:
<disp-quote>
<p>The place you work, this is an additional source of hope because the work environment pushes you to set goals and forces you to do all that is in your power to achieve these goals. . . . The work environment is the best platform to develop aspirations, set challenging goals, and find unique strategies for achieving these goals.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The founding of a new nuclear family, which includes the individual’s acceptance of a parental role, provides an additional source of hope. Participants further perceived this developmental stage as an indicator for the existence of one’s hope.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>At my age the main source of hope is the establishment of my own family, which is a translation into a deep, existential sense of hope. Someone who does not have hope will not choose to bring children into this world.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Within their respective new nuclear family, the participants frequently mentioned their spouse as an important source of hope: “She is the source of my life. The well from which I drink. The water that gives me life. She is hope.” “I see my wife as a source of hope; she has enormous inner strength that anchors hope within her.” These last quotations clearly reveal that hope is affected by interpersonal interactions, as well as the importance of relationships with reference to hope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312458184">Benzein, Norberg, &amp; Saveman, 2001</xref>). Hope is something we do with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732312458184">Weingarten, 2000</xref>). Others, in the views of this study’s participants, includes various influential people in their lives (parents, peer group, teachers, wife) who are able to nurture (or harm) the individual’s hope. It is worth noting that although all participants were involved in a therapeutic process, none talked about his therapist or the therapy as a source of hope.</p>

<sec id="section21-1049732312458184">
<title>Forms of Hope</title>
<p>Hope is inherent in the human condition, yet there are various formulae of hope, and life events can change the forms of hope one possesses: “Hope is something intangible, abstract, that is turned into different forms at each stage.” The initial form of hope is the infancy-survival hope, which incorporates the hope for “good enough” parental care that will enable the child to survive:
<disp-quote>
<p>During infancy hope centers mostly on issues of sleeping and eating: the basic needs that must be fulfilled to survive. . . . When you reach your childhood years it is mainly an issue of attachment: the hope to be able to attach and communicate in positive forms with other people, mainly your parents.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although the participant quoted above summarized the childhood form of hope in one sentence, examining his statement reveals the differences between the first form of hope (infancy survival) and the second. The childhood type of hope includes a positive and warm attachment to the parent that enables the child to continue his or her developmental tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312458184">Bowlby, 1982</xref>). The third form of hope described by the participants was adolescent hope, characterized by a higher level of sophistication that is needed to have a mutual relationship with peer group members while planning and preparing for adult life tasks:
<disp-quote>
<p>In adolescent years hope is mainly about being part of a group, relating to people your age. . . . It is also the time you start thinking about life. . . . Hope at this stage involves the wishes and efforts to succeed in school and army’s tasks.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The adolescent form of hope incorporates the potential for the next structure of hope—the mature and realistic form of hope associated with adult life: “In adulthood, hope is mainly about success in life: having a profession that will allow me to make a living, establishing my own family, having a meaningful life. . . . Doing things that are meaningful and being healthy.”</p>
<p>Hope develops and changes until it reaches what the participants perceived as an adult form of hope, which incorporates the hope to succeed in the development tasks relevant to adult life: gaining a profession and having a family. An adult form of hope recognizes the limitation of the individual and is therefore perceived as more rational, suited, and mature:
<disp-quote>
<p>The child’s hope is characterized by a feeling that he can overcome everything. The child does not worry about breaking into parts, about losing it . . . but this sense of omnipotence passes as you grow up. When you are an adult you realize that anything can happen. . . . The sense of security, the idea that you are safe that hope creates among children, changes. An adult hope is not infinity; it is much more realistic. . . . I think this process of being sober, being hopeful in a different way, is more realistic and therefore a change for the better. We should not hold an unlimited optimistic view. Hope should have limits, boundaries; it should be bound by reality.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section22-1049732312458184">
<title>Clashes Between Hope and Trauma</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My hope was sky high . . . the skies were my limit. . . . After the injury, my hope was colored in gray. . . . There is life before the injury and life after; likewise, there is hope before and after. Before it was pink, but it is no longer that cheerful.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Experiencing a traumatic event that results in PTSD changes one’s hope. The participants described a sudden and dramatic change in the availability, forms, and level of hope because of the traumatic event. Trauma diminishes the accessibility of hope, decreases the level of hope, and changes its form. Thus, the clashes between trauma and hope result in a qualitative and quantitative change in the hope available to the individual:
<disp-quote>
<p>At that time [during the traumatic event] you are disconnected. You do not know or feel a thing. You are like a zombie. When it is over, hope is like you are holding a rope that should have taken you out of the ditch, but it does not really exist. Your hope is missing. You no longer believe it is real or present, so once again you feel detached.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participants described a sense of having no hope during the traumatic event, the experience of hopelessness while associating the sense of “no hope” with the proximity of death: “The traumatic event rocks your world. It rocks and cuts off the foundations you were educated and grew on, and of course it cuts off, crushes hope.” “Everything crushed. That’s it. The crush of hope. . . . I felt how everything is falling apart on me, how death is approaching. That’s how it feels.”</p>
<p>In spite of the strong feeling that trauma could crush any sense of hope, regardless of how hopeful and optimistic the person was, all research participants indicated that hope was one of the first things they searched for after the event was over. Several (<italic>n</italic> = 4) recognized a sense of hope shortly after the traumatic event, a sense which they perceived as meaningful for their ability and decision to go on living:
<disp-quote>
<p>It immediately came into action and led me to think, to plan things to survive, and always look at the bright side, which is also the meaning of hope.</p>
<p>Hope is first of all what let me get out of the fall—from the hole. To survive. To climb and get out of the hole.</p>
<p>When you come to your senses a bit, you understand the dimensions of the disaster, the catastrophe you are in, and you say, just a moment, it can’t all be gone, that I don’t have that inside power, that hope, I mean. It’s something that’s inside.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The need to be hopeful again, to experience some level of hope, further results in attempts to turn to others who will provide hope. The use of others as sources of hope corresponds with the literature addressing the importance of social support during times of trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312458184">Grills-Taquechel, Littleton, &amp; Axsom, 2011</xref>), and further emphasizes that hope has an interpersonal component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312458184">Nugent, Amstadter, &amp; Koenen, 2011</xref>). Within the interpersonal aspect of hope, it should be noted that various forms of communication (e.g., speech, gestures) can affirm and reinforce a sense of hope:
<disp-quote>
<p>You look for reinforcement and for someone who will reconnect you, who will tell you what is going on, like you have to go on, like, “I have hope and I’m keeping it right here for you.” . . . I think what caused this was his matter-of-fact approach, the commander’s, right after the event. The caring, the warmth, along with the pride, these are the things that filled me again with hope.</p>
<p>In the moment of crisis you look for something on the outside to hold on to, like your mother, your wife. Until you rearrange the strengths from inside . . . in crisis people turn to look for their hope in the outside environment.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The most effective form of restoring hope is when both internal and external sources of hope are available to the individual, as stated by one of the participants: “The external hope completes the internal hope, together; it’s two circles that complete one another.” The ability to restore hope by internal resources and strengths was subject to two factors: (a) the initial form of hope that existed within the individual prior to the traumatic event, and (b) the characteristics of the event. All participants characterized their initial hope as “high levels of hope,” and regarded it as “mature hope”: “What is clear is that in my case the basis of hope was good, so it stood at my disposal.” “Hope that developed up to the event is what nourishes hope from that point forward.”</p>
<p>The participants further distinguished between a single traumatic event, in which the beginning and the end of the event were limited, and a more prolonged trauma, such as in the case of captivity. In the latter, the process of bringing back hope occurred in short, limited, partial moments which resulted in a new form of hope—a form lacking continuity and stability:
<disp-quote>
<p>In captivity, in the interrogations, you have perhaps two seconds to experience hope. It’s a kind of horizon, a kind of hope that you are not used to, you are not trained for. It is very difficult to hold a two seconds’ hope. . . . It’s a kind of segment of hope, because there is no continuity: a little, and it is cut off, a little and it is cut off.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In agreement with the literature addressing the role of hope in coping with stressful situations, such as during natural disasters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312458184">Johnson, 2008</xref>), illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312458184">Milne, Moyle, &amp; Cooke, 2009</xref>), or death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312458184">Elliott &amp; Oliver, 2009</xref>), it is evident that hope is active, almost automatically, in the long and agonizing process of trying to recover from the trauma. Thus hope, which was recognized by the participants to diminish at the time of the event, is again available to the individual during the process of overcoming the trauma:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the end hope is a means, not an end. It is a means for coping with difficult situations. Hope actually gives you the possibility to stay up, to go through it [the crisis]; it is a condition for it.</p>
<p>Hope accompanied me in the process of recovering from my injury. For me it was mainly a tool, not concrete, but with practical aspects. . . . It was a very meaningful tool. . . . The wind behind my motivation to recover and fulfill all I want in life.</p>
<p>It is the “thing” that helped me survive and recover—this hope it was my hope, and although it was hurt from the event, because the whole personality is hurt, it was the most meaningful thing in my coping.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participants recognized the important role of hope in the early phases of the traumatic event, because it helped them “continue,” “carry on fighting,” and “survive.” Hope was further discussed with reference to the long process of overcoming and healing after the traumatic event. Finally, the participants recognized that to overcome trauma, hope itself increased and improved during the process of utilizing hope:
<disp-quote>
<p>In my recovery, there was a process of general strengthening, and in it also hope’s strengthening. . . . My basic hope is much stronger. . . . The trauma strengthened it. Every time you keep hoping after a crisis, you become mentally stronger, and that is thanks to hope. Hope gets stronger and it strengthens your soul.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The results indicate the integrative, multidimensional characteristics of the phenomenon of hope, focusing on its subjective meaning among people suffering from chronic PTSD. The development of knowledge in this area is critical, given the complex construct of hope and the importance of hope to individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder, as was revealed in this research. Furthermore, based on the continual findings that have shown that many people who were exposed to a traumatic event have developed symptoms of PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312458184">Bleich et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732312458184">Sundin, Fear, Iversen, Rona, &amp; Wessely, 2010</xref>), these results acquire special meaning.</p>
<p>The findings presented expand our perception of the phenomenon of hope in general by integrating several dimensions, some often perceived as contrasting, such as the unconscious abstract dimension and the conscious cognitive-behavioral dimension of hope. These dimensions receive theoretical attention with reference to hope, but often in a divided manner. The abstract dimension is customarily discussed in relation to psychoanalytical and philosophical treatment, whereas the behavioral-cognitive dimension is often associated with quantitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312458184">Mitchell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312458184">Snyder, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The ability to draw away from the theoretical polarization and to reach an integrative, multidimensional perception of the phenomenon is derived from focusing on the participants’ words and their subjective experiences. This process revealed additional dimensions of the phenomenon, such as the relational one, that have received limited attention in the literature. Thus, although these research findings do not support a specific theory of hope, they are linked to two basic theories of hope in psychotherapy: the cognitive-behavioral model and the dynamic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312458184">Mitchell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732312458184">Snyder, 2000</xref>). They highlight the need to move beyond existing theoretical perspectives in understanding human experiences toward a more inclusive, extensive view that allows the combination of various theoretical viewpoints while recognizing the relevance of each theory to the discussed phenomenon.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the results strengthen the perception that hope is especially important for individuals when personal resources are exhausted or when they are in a threatening situation with an uncertain outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312458184">Elliott &amp; Oliver, 2009</xref>). Following this understanding, hope was found to be important in cases of trauma and in the recovery of people with PTSD. The results of this study are very meaningful for the treatment of patients with chronic PTSD by professionals in general, and by psychotherapists in particular (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312458184">Hobfoll et al., 2007</xref>). Awareness of the sources of hope and the different forms of hope can lead to a deeper understanding of the creation of treatment relationships and potential space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312458184">Levi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049732312458184">Wigren, 1999</xref>), as well as the transference and countertransference processes pointed out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312458184">Mitchell (1993)</xref>.</p>
<p>The current work suffers from several limitations alongside its contribution. First, the study included a small number of patients with chronic PTSD; all were in therapy, and from Israel. It is possible that Israeli patients with chronic PTSD have different perspectives than victims who live in other countries. Moreover, hope is a phenomenon that develops and changes over time; the one-time interviews had limited potential for capturing these developments. Notwithstanding these limitations, to our knowledge this research is the first to examine hope from the perspective of patients with chronic PTSD and allows the reader to realize the role hope has at the time of crisis and afterwards.</p>

<p>PTSD is a severe anxiety condition that can arise after a traumatic event. It is characterized by distressing memories or emotions about the trauma, avoidance of trauma reminders, and elevated arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312458184">Herman, 1992</xref>).</p>
