<abstract>
<p>In postconflict settings, a substantial number of injuries and related disabilities are caused by land mines and explosive remnants of war. This article reviews the literature on the prevalence of these injuries and subsequent disabilities in Cambodia and Lao PDR. Three major electronic databases were systematically for publications on the prevalence of these injuries. Six studies met the inclusion criteria. Five of these were in Cambodia and 1 in Lao PDR. None of these studies could estimate national prevalence rates of these injuries; only 2 considered the broader impact of related disabilities. The different methodological approaches and limitations of the studies prevented statistical synthesis. The studies reviewed suggested accurate estimates of the prevalence of war injuries and consequent disabilities are missing. There is a need for a comprehensive epidemiological research to quantify the burden that results from such injuries.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cambodia and Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR) are in the process of rapid economic, demographic, and epidemiological transition. Progress has been made on reducing communicable diseases but, as with other countries in the region, the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases and injuries is increasing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539513478149">1</xref></sup> Severe nonfatal injuries can result in permanent disability, as well as increase the risk for noncommunicable diseases. They can lead to economic burden on individuals, households, communities, and thereby exacerbate poverty and impact on national economies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539513478149">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539513478149"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539513478149">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Global burden of disease methodology is the benchmark for estimating burden from injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539513478149">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539513478149">5</xref></sup> Central to the global burden of disease methodology is the concept of the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), which is a metric used to summarize burden. The DALY is the sum of premature mortality (years of life lost [YLL]) and disability (years of life lived with a disability [YLD]).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539513478149">4</xref></sup> The YLLs are produced using mortality data. The YLD component is the product of the incidence of the injury, the duration of that injury, and the disability weights of that injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539513478149">4</xref></sup> Many types of injuries do not have disability weights. This could result in an underestimation of the burden of injuries. This needs to be rectified to ensure appropriate policy development and resource allocation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539513478149">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>A substantial proportion of the burden of civilian morbidity and mortality from unintentional injuries in Cambodia and Lao PDR is because of land mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO), which include antipersonnel cluster munitions and other explosive remnants of war (ERW).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539513478149">6</xref></sup> This systematic review was undertaken to identify the burden of land mine and ERW injury within the civilian population in Cambodia and Lao PDR.</p>

<sec id="section2-1010539513478149">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Lao PDR and Cambodia continue to have extensive land mine and ERW contamination as a result of the 1968-1975 Indo-China War. In Cambodia, it is estimated that 648.8 km<sup>2</sup> of land was contaminated with antipersonnel mines, including cluster munitions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539513478149">6</xref></sup> A total of 63 815 land mine/ERW injuries were registered in the country since 1979.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539513478149">6</xref></sup> Lao PDR remains the most heavily bombed country in the world with a ERW-contaminated area of approximately of 8750 km<sup>2</sup> contaminated with unexploded cluster munitions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539513478149">6</xref></sup> Most of the contamination is in rural areas with the poorest sections of the population, whose health is already compromised, often the most affected. Despite international and national decontamination efforts since the mid-1990s, contamination continues to be significant, and it is estimated that there have been 20 008 civilian casualties between the ages of 15 and 35 years since the war.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539513478149">6</xref></sup></p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-1010539513478149">
<title>Selection Criteria</title>
<p>A systematic search of literature was undertaken to identify sources dealing with the nature, prevalence, and disability resulting from postconflict land mine/ERW injuries in Cambodia and Lao PDR. The Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and PubMed databases were searched for literature published between 1990 and the end of 2011. The year 1990 was chosen as it was only after the end of the Cold War that land mine/ERW contamination was recognized as a humanitarian issue following the United Nations’ call for funding for demining and victim assistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539513478149">7</xref></sup> The definition used for a land mine/ERW casualty was someone who directly or indirectly sustained a fatal or nonfatal injury due to the explosion of a land mine or explosive ordnance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539513478149">8</xref></sup> Study inclusion criteria were (<italic>a</italic>) set in Cambodia or Lao PDR, (<italic>b</italic>) related to civilian/noncombatant injuries, (<italic>c</italic>) published between 1990 and 2011 (inclusive), and (<italic>d</italic>) helped address the question “what is the burden of disease within the civilian population, from land mine and ERW injury?” In addition, studies were excluded if they were (<italic>a</italic>) a review or an opinion article or (<italic>b</italic>) limited to military personnel/combatants or professional deminers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1010539513478149">
<title>Search Strategy</title>
<p>The search used the following terms: [“Lao*” or “Vietnam” or “Cambodia”]; [“Explosive remnants of war” or “Land mines” or “Unexploded ordnance” or “Bombs” or “Mines”]; [“Burden” or “Impact” or “Mortality” or “Disability” or “Injury” or “Cost”]. No limitations were observed with regard to gender or language. Reference lists of key articles were reviewed to identify additional relevant studies. One reviewer (JD) assessed the titles and abstracts of all the retrieved references to identify the studies that met the inclusion criteria and to retrieve the full text of eligible articles.</p>
<p>The following study information were extracted into a Microsoft Excel database: citation, survey, year of survey, survey age range, sample size, sampling method, coverage, outcomes studied, and a statement of strengths and weaknesses. The statement of strengths and weaknesses and the risk of bias in the studies retrieved were assessed using a risk of bias assessment tool.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539513478149">9</xref></sup> A summary rating was given for the overall risk of bias for each study, based on the rater’s (JD) subjective judgment of the responses obtained to the preceding 10 items. This approach is consistent with the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) and Cochrane approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539513478149">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539513478149">11</xref></sup> As this review is not a meta-analysis, all studies were included regardless of their overall risk of bias. Nevertheless, the results of those studies with high risk of bias will have to be interpreted with caution.</p>

<title>Search Results</title>
<p>The electronic database search yielded 47 results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1010539513478149">Figure 1</xref>). Irrelevant titles (n = 36) were excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. For example, some of them failed to address the research question, whereas others were either opinion articles or they did not pertain to Lao PDR or Cambodia. The exclusion thus left only 11 eligible titles. Of these, 6 abstracts were relevant. In addition to these, 3 more abstracts were identified from inspection of the reference lists of included articles. The full articles of the 9 abstracts were assessed and 3 of them were excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. One was excluded as it pertained to professional deminers, one was an opinion article, and the other was related to combatant injuries.</p>

<title>Incidence and Prevalence</title>
<p>To measure the amount and distribution of injuries and their health consequences in a population, the individuals injured need to be related to a population base. The mortality rate represents the proportion of deaths in this case from land mines/ERW injuries, for a given population at risk over a specified period of time. The major indicators of morbidity at the population level are incidence (number of new cases of a disease in a given time period) and prevalence (number of individuals with existing disease at a given point in time).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539513478149">18</xref></sup> None of the available studies could estimate the incidence or national prevalence of land mine/ERW-related morbidity. Only the Lao survey could estimate the mortality rate in Xieng Khouang province, based on population estimates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539513478149">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539513478149">16</xref></sup> This retrospective, cross-sectional village survey, in 3 districts of Xieng Khouang, one of the most ERW-contaminated provinces, collected ERW injury data from village heads during the 22 years following the end of the war. The study reported a total of 870 noncombatant injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539513478149">16</xref></sup> Of these, 70% were sustained by males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539513478149">16</xref></sup> and 46% (n = 397) by children younger than 15 years. The case fatality rate was estimated for each of the 3 included districts using person-years of the districts as the denominator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539513478149">16</xref></sup> The mortality rate for males per 1000 person years was estimated at 0.24 for Koune district, 0.29 for Pek district, and 0.22 for Kham district. The mortality rate for females was estimated at 0.01 for Koune district, 0.10 for Pek district, and 0.11 for Kham district. The difference between case fatality rates of males and females was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .026), but not the one between adults and children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539513478149">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a cross-sectional cluster survey of 38 communities and a sample of N = 6090 households in Cambodia, 7% (n = 432) of households were found to have been affected by land mine injury, 31% (n = 136) of them being fatal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539513478149">14</xref></sup> Almost all the casualties were suffered by males between the ages of 15 to 44 years (51.3:1000) years. The second highest rate of land mine injuries was recorded in the +45-year-old group of males (29.4:1000), followed by the younger than 14 years age-group (4.0:1000). The number of female casualties was much less (14 years and younger = 0.4:1000; 15-44 years = 2.3:1000; 45 years and older = 3.7:1000).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539513478149">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The review of a trauma register in a facility in Battambang, Cambodia, for the period between November 2003 and January 2006, revealed that 356 patients received injuries during the previous 24 hours.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539513478149">15</xref></sup> Of these, 26.4% (n = 94) were sustained by children younger than 16 years (mean age = 11.6 ± 2.8 years). Most of the children (61.7%) were injured by ERW and adults (72.1%) by antipersonnel land mines. Mean time from injury to admission was approximately 6 hours and it did not differ between adults and children or between males and females.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539513478149">15</xref></sup> A retrospective review of hospital data in provincial hospitals of heavily mined provinces in Cambodia (Battambang, Pursat, Banteay Meanchey) revealed that 842 patients were hospitalized with land mine injuries between January 1990 and June 1993. Most of them were old working males (85%), whereas female adults accounted for 7% and children aged 15 years or younger for 8%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539513478149">17</xref></sup> An assessment carried out on the chronic pain among land mine survivors with severe injuries using a modified version of the Revised Trauma Score,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539513478149">19</xref></sup> revealed that at least 1 year after the incident (n = 25), 12 patients reported chronic pain syndromes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539513478149">13</xref></sup> The mean age of the patients was 36 years and most of them were males and farmers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539513478149">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>Injury Patterns</title>
<p>Three injury patterns were identified. One was traumatic amputation of one or both legs, usually caused by an antipersonnel land mine. In Cambodia, where most of the contamination was land mines, Andersson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539513478149">14</xref></sup> found that to be the most common pattern of injury (39%, n = 172). The second pattern was multiple lacerations caused by fragmentation of land mines or ERW resulting in multiple fragments of body (n = 94, 21%). The third pattern was traumatic amputation of an arm (n = 6, 27%), blindness (n = 21, 5%), or head injury (n = 23, 5%).</p>
<p>Other injuries included loss of foot, toes, or fingers (n = 97, 22%). The mean number of operations was 1.3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539513478149">14</xref></sup> Most of the children (61.7%) among the 356 patients included in the hospital-based prospective study by Bendinelli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539513478149">15</xref></sup> were injured by UXO, and adults (72.1%) by antipersonnel land mines.

This difference is also reflected in the patterns of injury between children and adults: most children received upper body injuries and most adults received lower limb injuries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539513478149">15</xref></sup> Pediatric cases involved mostly head, neck, upper limbs, or trunk injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539513478149">15</xref></sup> In-hospital parameters, such as length of hospitalization and number of operations, did not differ significantly between children and adults. The proportion of transfused patients and mortality rates, however, were higher among children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539513478149">15</xref></sup> Loss of vision was common (adults 9.5% and children 21.2%); bilateral blindness was observed in 4 children and 3 adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539513478149">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a hospital-based study of bilateral blindness between January and September 1994 in Cambodia, 453 blind adults were identified. Of them, 4% (n = 17) were blind as a result of bilateral trauma, and 14 of the injuries were caused by land mine explosions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539513478149">12</xref></sup> All the casualties were of males between 15 and 35 years old. In the 3 provinces of Xieng Khouang, Lao PDR, where the contamination was mainly ERW, particularly cluster munitions, most of the injuries were multiple lacerations due to fragmentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539513478149">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Economic and Social Impacts of Injuries</title>
<p>For most of the injured in Cambodia, the cost of hospital fees proved a significant economic burden because they had to sell assets (n = 92, 30%), take loans (n = 184, 61%), or incur loss of productivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539513478149">14</xref></sup> In Cambodia, Husum et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539513478149">13</xref></sup> found that 17 out of 25 survivors incurred considerable loss of income, mainly because of chronic pain that limited productivity, a feeling of weakness, or expenses incurred for medical treatment. None of the articles reviewed discussed long-term impacts of permanent disability as a result of land mine/ERW injury.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This is the first systematic review that summarizes the data, though scarce, relating to the prevalence and disability of postconflict land mine/ERW injury in Cambodia and Lao PDR. The review confirms the discrepancy pointed out by the authors between public health literature and in-country data. Most of the available data in the peer reviewed literature are hospital based and suffer from access bias. None of the 6 studies could provide DALYs population estimates or quantify the broader impact of land mine/ERW injuries.</p>
<p>Methodological heterogeneity across studies, limit use of a case definition, and lack of sample representativeness for the larger population, rendered comparisons of studies between countries difficult. More specifically, estimating the incidence and prevalence of land mine/ERW morbidity was problematic as there was no clarity regarding the denominator. For example, no reports are available on the catchment population of the included hospitals, demography, and population estimates of the districts where the hospitals were located, as also of the population at risk. Consequently, the data available are insufficient to calculate common metrics across studies or effect sizes.</p>
<p>The proportion of injured children identified in the reviews is disturbing. Similar results have been found elsewhere, for example, in Nepal (55% of casualties were of children &lt;18 years old),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539513478149">20</xref></sup> Afghanistan (47% of casualties were of children &lt;18 years old),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539513478149">21</xref></sup> and Eritrea (41% of casualties were of children &lt;15 years old).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539513478149">22</xref></sup> Also of interest is the fact that in Cambodia school-going children may be more at risk of UXO injury, and adults of land mines. This is possibly because school-going children spend more time outside the home, thus exposing themselves to hazards within their environment as a function of their risk-taking behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539513478149">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539513478149">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539513478149">23</xref></sup> Risk taking among school-going male and female children in Lao PDR and Cambodia commonly involves intentional exposure to ERW in a bid to either “play” with ERW or harvest the scrap metal for selling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539513478149">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539513478149">25</xref></sup> In one study in Lao PDR, for example, it was reported that children were earning from scrap metal collection, which often included ERW, 7000 to 8000 kip (72-85 US cents) per day, making a substantial contribution to the household income.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539513478149">25</xref></sup> Although both female and male children engage themselves in risky land mine/ERW-related behaviors, the available data do not allow disaggregation of information by gender. Nevertheless, in Cambodia and Lao PDR, the majority of child casualties as a result of deliberate exposure to ERW, were of males.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539513478149">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539513478149"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539513478149">26</xref></sup> This suggests that vulnerability to exposure to ERW is a gender-dependent aspect.</p>
<p>In each of the studies reviewed, the majority of the injured were men of working age. This corroborates the earlier findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539513478149">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539513478149">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539513478149">28</xref></sup> This is mainly because of the present division of labor and the fact that men are more likely than women to deliberately move or tamper with land mines and UXO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539513478149">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539513478149">30</xref></sup> The included studies show that injury patterns generally reflect the type of explosive device used. In Lao PDR, for example, where the contamination was mainly ERW and particularly cluster munitions, the injuries were mainly due to penetration of fragments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539513478149">16</xref></sup> A similar type of injury was reported to be common in ERW injuries in Cambodia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539513478149">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539513478149">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539513478149">15</xref></sup> Land mine injuries reported from Cambodia usually resulted in traumatic amputation of the entire leg, or part of it, which came in contact with the mine; such injury was often accompanied by injury to the other leg and/or perineum. This pattern of injuries, which is common in land mine incidents reported in other studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539513478149">28</xref></sup> suggests that most nonfatal injuries result in permanent disability.</p>
<p>Although not possible to determine based on this review, typically, as a country moves along the continuum of postconflict recovery to development, incidence of ERW injuries declines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539513478149">23</xref></sup> This is partly because of postconflict demining and marking of hazardous areas. Furthermore, as a consequence of living with land mine/ERW contamination, populations begin to develop risk-reduction strategies. Nevertheless, given that most casualties are sustained by the working population and given the severity of nonfatal injuries, the burden of disease will persist for several decades even after the cessation of hostilities. With an estimated life expectancy of 59 years in Cambodia, a male injured at 15 is likely to live for another 44 years with a disability. A medical prosthesis for a child needs to be replaced approximately every 6 weeks, and for an adult every 3 to 5 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1010539513478149">31</xref></sup> Thus, a 15-year-old male land mine survivor in Cambodia will need approximately 11 prostheses. In Lao PDR and Cambodia, out-of-pocket expenses for health care are high; as such, the medical cost of injuries can be devastating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1010539513478149">32</xref></sup> Furthermore, given that most casualties are sustained by the working population, ERW injuries are likely to affect the productivity at both micro- and macroeconomic levels.</p>
<p>The articles reviewed did not pay adequate attention to the broader impact of disability on the economy, although they did make a mention of loss of income and productivity and the need to sell assets or go into debt to meet medical expenses. These factors can result in downward economic mobility and long-term intergenerational effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539513478149">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1010539513478149">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1010539513478149">33</xref></sup> Survivors may also suffer social exclusion and poor mental health outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1010539513478149">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1010539513478149">35</xref></sup> Some studies indicated that social and economic burden of severe injury morbidity outstrips that of fatal injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539513478149">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>This review suggests that, despite more than a decade of clearance of land mine and ERW on humanitarian grounds in Cambodia and Lao PDR, little is known about the burden of injury. Also, standardized methods with clear case definitions were not used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539513478149">6</xref></sup> It underlines the need for public heath methods, which quantify the burden of disease from postconflict ERW and land mine injury in a better manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1010539513478149">36</xref></sup> Burden of disease estimates, such as DALYs, would provide a summary measure that quantifies loss of healthy life due to mortality and morbidity against a benchmark of normal life expectancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539513478149">30</xref></sup> This, supplemented with the broader measures of productivity, household and community burden, and economic impact, would give a more accurate understanding of the burden of land mine/ERW trauma. Besides, it relates to the social and environmental determinants of health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1010539513478149">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Five of the 6 studies included in the review were undertaken in the 1990s, when land mine contamination was often described as an “epidemic” with a high-profile campaign to ban them. This suggests that despite the ongoing ERW contamination from the Viet Nam War and other contemporary wars, the issue has failed to remain on the public health agenda.</p>
<sec id="section12-1010539513478149">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This review had some limitations. First, the literature search was limited to peer-reviewed publications available in 3 major databases. Second, much of the work done in resource-constrained and postconflict settings was neither studied nor published. Thus, the present review is limited to only those studies from which publications emanated. Furthermore, the studies included in the review had several limitations. Five of the studies were hospital-based subjecting them to access bias. The population-based surveys were retrospective subjecting them to recall bias. In addition, the methods and outcome measures used in the studies consulted for this review, inhibited statistical synthesis, thus necessitating a narrative synthesis of their findings.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the absence of enough published research material, only a very crude picture of the overall burden of disease from postconflict land mine/ERW could be drawn. Yet it is evident that land mine/ERW contamination continues to plague Cambodia and Lao PDR and there seems to be discordance between locally collected data and peer-reviewed epidemiological studies. Although the number of injuries due to land mines/ERW typically decreases over time, people continue to be injured for decades after the conflict and many injuries are nonfatal and result in permanent disability. The health needs of injured survivors should be integrated with and made complementary to other health services. This can be done only with a clear understanding of the nature and prevalence of the disabilities resulting from postconflict land mine/ERW injuries.</p>
