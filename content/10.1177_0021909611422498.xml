<abstract>
<p>This paper analyzes the level of natural environment disclosure (NED) in the year ending 2007 annual reports of Chinese-listed companies. Using a simplified NED index that accommodates a developing country setting, the results show a low level of NED. Only 2% of sampled companies make disclosures for all eight basic environmental issues in the NED index. Larger companies and resource companies disclose significantly more NED. Clearly there is scope for Chinese regulators and entities to improve the reporting of natural environmental issues. Strategies are explored to consider how NED might be improved.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Following the studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909611422498">Brown and colleagues (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611422498">Brown (2007)</xref> analyses of natural environment disclosures in the Pacific Island Countries, this paper examines the level and predictors of natural environment disclosures (NED) in the annual reports of Chinese-listed entities for the year ending 2007. NED relates to environmental reporting, disclosing the impact of an entity’s activities on the environment and about the entity’s performance in managing these issues. Calls for additional NED abound from environmentalists, investors, financial analysts, accounting practitioners, the financial press, insurance companies, international multilateral organizations and academics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0021909611422498">Rodrigue, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0021909611422498">Tilt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0021909611422498">Unerman and Bennett, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>It is an important study because little empirical research has been conducted on the environmental disclosure practices of Chinese companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021909611422498">Guo and colleagues (2007)</xref> note a gradual increase in the take-up by Chinese companies of natural environmental disclosures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021909611422498">Baskin, 2006</xref>) in a problematic natural environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021909611422498">Liu, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Chinese economic growth and its material consequence, environmental pollution, are staggering. Western environmentalists have despaired at China’s voracious appetite for natural resources and the ensuing environmental damage. As the <italic>New York Times</italic> investigative series ‘Choking on Growth’ documents, the scale and the scope of China’s impact on the global environment are immense and tragic, whether measures in land, air, water, animals, or people. China has taken about two decades to pollute as much as the West has done from the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century to the present day. In just 20 years of economic growth, China has overtaken America as the world’s leading contributor of carbon emission, in large part because of its manufacturing prowess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0021909611422498">Ziser and Sze, 2007</xref>: 393).</p>
<p>Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021909611422498">Chow (2003)</xref> suggests China’s economic development (including the improvement of well-being, enhancement of civil liberties and free flow of information), and attendant environmental impacts, presents significant challenges for the world economy. While recent economic development will allow China to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of poverty reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021909611422498">Gaiha et al., 2009</xref>), it will also create even greater environmental degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0021909611422498">Liu, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Perhaps the two most pervasive images or stereotypes of the Chinese economy are very impressive dynamism (e.g. the fastest rate of growth over the last two decades) and very horrendous levels of pollution. Most observers probably believe that this combination of the ‘good’ and the ‘ugly’ is far from coincidental. That is, China’s extremely rapid growth since the beginning of Deng Xiaoping’s economic reforms in the late 1970s is itself a primary cause of the nation’s disturbing environmental destruction, setting off processes which have exacerbated the considerable environmental disasters that occurred during the Mao era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021909611422498">Clark, 2002</xref>: 109).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611422498">Fang (2010)</xref> avers that China is attracted to the concept of being a low-carbon economy. This is manifested by the Chinese government’s target to reduce the intensity of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 40 to 45% by 2020, compared with the levels of 2005. However, to achieve these targets, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611422498">Fang (2010)</xref> notes that there needs to be changes to Chinese law and policy and improved development of technology. Currently there are no stand-alone Chinese accounting standards or international financial reporting standards that provide rules on Chinese natural environmental disclosures.</p>
<p>This study empirically assesses the extent of NED in the annual reports of Chinese companies, and addresses three research questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0021909611422498" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>What level of NED is generated by Chinese-listed companies?</p></list-item>

<title>The Importance of NED for Chinese Listed Companies</title>
<p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021909611422498">Table 1</xref>, there are a number of natural environment issues that touch upon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909611422498">Brown et al.’s (2004)</xref> NED index in a Chinese setting. NED comprises eight categories of general environmental conditions, environmental policy, environmental audit, environmental produce and process related, environmental financially-related data, sustainability, environmental aesthetics, and environmental other. The index itself was constructed for a developing country setting, in particular a Pacific Island Country milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909611422498">Brown et al., 2004</xref>) where recent aggregate mean NED on the Port Moresby Stock Exchange (POMSoX) of Papua New Guinea was low (29%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611422498">Brown, 2007</xref>). It is important, therefore, to consider how Chinese listed companies fare in the same disclosing NED index, particularly given both China’s and Papua New Guinea’s transitional emerging country status. Thus differences between the NED rates of Chinese-listed companies and POMSoX entities is conducted. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021909611422498">Table 1</xref> provides a brief explanation of the categories of NED and their application to Chinese-listed companies.</p>

<p>NED is important because it provides stakeholders information for key decision-making, although there are costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021909611422498">Darrough and Stoughton, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0021909611422498">Verrecchia, 1990</xref>) and managerial constraints in disclosing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021909611422498">Deegan, 2006</xref>).

<title>Determinants of Chinese Listed NED</title>
<p>In examining the level and predictors of NED generated by Chinese-listed companies, and following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0021909611422498">Thomas’s (1991)</xref> contingency theory, this paper argues that a firm’s size, leverage, and profit represent three very important organizational attributes that may affect a listed company’s disclosure. In addition, this study avers that the size of the board of directors, percentage of independent directors on the board, top five shareholder concentration, ‘Big 4’ auditing status and dual listing on both the Chinese and Hong Kong stock markets are key factors of a listed company’s business environment that may also affect a Chinese-listed company’s disclosure. Domestic listing, small and medium enterprise (SME) status and industry type are also considered.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0021909611422498">Thomas’ (1991)</xref> contingency theory is closely allied to stakeholder theory which recognizes that stakeholders have a right of account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021909611422498">Gray et al., 1997</xref>). Contingency theory explains natural environmental disclosure practices in terms of how entities respond to the demand of their business environment in which they interact and the control of that environment in order to survive. Although the theory is based on interactive propositions between entities and their business environment, there is generally a ‘lack of an explicit statement regarding the precise mathematical function of the implied interaction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0021909611422498">Thomas, 1986</xref>: 257). Stakeholder theory takes up this interaction with the business environment, proposed by contingency theory, by identifying specific stakeholder groups in the business environment and explaining NED practices in terms of entity and stakeholder relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021909611422498">Henderson et al., 2004</xref>). There are two strains of stakeholder theory: one based on an empirical view of management where stakeholders are identified by the company according to the way each stakeholder furthers its interest and how they might be managed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021909611422498">Freeman, 1984</xref>); and the other based on a normative view, where all stakeholders’ interests are seen as important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021909611422498">Clarkson, 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Size (H1)</title>
<p>Past studies have found a positive relationship between entity size and the level of company disclosures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021909611422498">Ahmed and Courtis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021909611422498">Ahmed and Nicholls, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0021909611422498">Neu et al., 1998</xref>). Stakeholder theory argues that larger companies disclose more information to satisfy the needs of financial market stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611422498">Cooke, 1991</xref>) and avoid political visibility problems. A large company is likely to spend more money than a small company in communicating information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021909611422498">Alchian, 1969</xref>). Company accounting expenses are likely to reduce as a proportion of overall costs as company size increases, whereas smaller firms potentially face financial constraints in disclosing detailed accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0021909611422498">Rahman et al., 2002</xref>). It should be noted that, in a developing country setting, size was not found to be a predictor of NED of Pacific Island Countries’ (PIC) entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909611422498">Brown et al., 2004</xref>) and Port Moresby Stock Exchange companies (POMSoX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611422498">Brown, 2007</xref>), possibly because no one entity in the data-sets represented a very large organization. Both the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) and Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) are much larger stock exchanges that exist in the PIC. Thus the following hypothesis is raised
<disp-quote>
<p>H1: There is a positive relationship between the level of company size and the level of NED of the Chinese-listed firms.</p>

<title>Leverage (H2)</title>
<p>A common practice by companies is to borrow funds to pay for assets to generate income. The funds borrowed incur a debt. Company leverage is seen as the total debts incurred by a company divided by its total assets. Prior studies have also shown that leverage affects the level of disclosure both in a developing country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021909611422498">Barako et al., 2006</xref>) and transitional country setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021909611422498">Gray et al., 2006</xref>). A highly-leveraged company is likely to disclose extensively to satisfy the needs of key financial lenders. Debt providers may be concerned about the assumed responsibility for environmental liabilities on liquidation of entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0021909611422498">Neu et al., 1998</xref>). Entities may seek to legitimize environmental performance through additional disclosure and thereby reduce the need for further scrutiny of its environmental risk profile. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0021909611422498">Malone and colleagues (1993)</xref> observed that leverage was influential in the extent of disclosure by oil and gas companies. As such, the following hypothesis is posed:

<title>Profitability Return on Assets (ROA) (H3)</title>
<p>Profitable companies are likely to release more information in their annual reports in order to present compelling reasons for management compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021909611422498">Cerf, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909611422498">Inchausti, 1997</xref>) and in order to maintain managers’ positions in a firm and their salaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0021909611422498">Owusu-Ansah, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0021909611422498">Wallace and Naser (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021909611422498">Inchausti (1997)</xref> argue that return on assets (ROA) is an important proxy for profitability, a measurement of management accomplishment. With positive information (successful results) companies are likely to be more responsible to the stakeholders than those companies with negative information (sustained losses; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021909611422498">Dye and Sridhar, 1995</xref>). A positive ROA demonstrates a firm’s efficiency and effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0021909611422498">Owusu-Ansah, 1998</xref>). Companies with comparatively larger ROA are more likely to disclose detailed information in annual reports to justify financial performance and to reduce costs. Thus it is hypothesized that:

<title>Board of Directors (H4)</title>
<p>The importance of the board of directors is derived from its contribution to business prosperity, corporate governance and accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0021909611422498">Yong and Guan, 2000</xref>). Corporate governance emphasizes the accountability and fiduciary duty of the directors towards their stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021909611422498">Easterbrook and Fischel, 1993</xref>). Sound mechanisms and guidelines have to be drafted and implemented to ensure effective and reliable management within the corporation and to protect the rights of the stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021909611422498">Balagescu et al., 2005</xref>). Sound corporate governance can make a significant contribution to the prevention of malpractice and fraud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0021909611422498">Zingales et al., 2006</xref>). Yet there is an ongoing concern that in Asia corporate governance is more a matter of form over substance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0021909611422498">Roche, 2005</xref>). The board of directors, which has the power to hire, fire, and compensate management teams, serves to resolve conflicts of interest among decision makers. The board of directors is perceived as an essential component of good corporate governance. Size of the board matters because larger boards are more likely to be associated with an increase in board diversity in terms of experience, gender, nationality and skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021909611422498">Dalton and Dalton, 2005</xref>). Consistent with contingency theory’s emphasis on an entity’s business environment, inadequate disclosures on the natural environment by the CEO or inside directors may arise with smaller boards because there are relatively less board members to check information sets. It is argued that, as the number of directors increases, this power over information verification rises and as such the following hypothesis is posed:
<disp-quote>
<p>H4: There is a positive relationship between the number of directors and the level of NED of Chinese-listed firms.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0021909611422498">
<title>Independent Directors (H5)</title>
<p>As outlined in the previous hypothesis, in the context of corporate governance mechanisms, the board of directors is viewed as an important safeguard for problems arising from an entity’s operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0021909611422498">Strand, 2001</xref>). The existence of independent directors on the board of commissioners may help to prevent collusion among managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0021909611422498">Nam and Nam, 2004</xref>). It is thought likely that any conflict between disclosure and non-disclosure can be reduced by a greater level of independent directors.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021909611422498">Adams and Mehran (2003)</xref> suggest that increases in the proportion of outside directors on the board should increase a firm’s performance as they are more effective monitors of company managers. Therefore, the general expectation is that the more independent the board of directors, the greater the NED of the company. To test the degree of corporate governance as measured by independent directors, the following hypothesis is examined:
<disp-quote>
<p>H5: There is a positive relationship between the level of independence of the directors and the level of NED of Chinese-listed firms.</p>

<title>Ownership Concentration (Top Five Shareholder) (H6)</title>
<p>Shareholders (owners) of an entity have an important role to play in that entity’s operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0021909611422498">Sam, 2010</xref>). Some owners, by virtue of the size of their equity positions, effectively have some control over the companies they own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0021909611422498">Villalonga and Amit, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021909611422498">Berglof and Claessens (2004)</xref> note that, in cases where ownership concentration is held by a very few large shareholders, they have power to manage the majority of activities of their entity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021909611422498">Gilson (2007)</xref> argues that dominant shareholders are keen to maximize their wealth and operate in their own interests. Consequently the smaller-owners’ interests are brushed aside. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0021909611422498">La Porta and colleagues (2004)</xref> show problems associated with high ownership concentration.

<title>Auditor Type (H7)</title>
<p>Auditor type may have a bearing on NED.

Larger auditor firms have incentives to maintain independence from client pressure to limit only certain financial information, because they have to protect their reputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021909611422498">DeAngelo, 1981</xref>). The major auditor firms are thus more likely to encourage their clients to disclose a greater amount of information in published corporate reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021909611422498">DeAngelo, 1981</xref>). Furthermore, larger auditor firms are less likely to be associated with clients that disclose lower levels of information in their corporate reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0021909611422498">Watts and Zimmerman, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>While auditors generally have an important monitoring role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0021909611422498">Tambulasi and Kayuni, 2007</xref>), the larger external auditor firms tend to make sure all material errors are made public and that client companies comply with the relevant regulatory and legal requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0021909611422498">Owusu-Ansah, 2005</xref>). There are reasons for this preference: the major auditor firms have better technical skills, experience and expertise, and ‘Big 4’ auditor firms have an incentive to keep their reputation of high quality audits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0021909611422498">Owusu-Ansah, 2005</xref>).

<title>Methods</title>
<p>For the purposes of determining the level and predictors of NED generated by Chinese-listed companies, annual reports were collected and analyzed from a total of 200 Chinese-listed companies, comprising companies from the SSE and SZSE.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0021909611422498">1</xref></sup> The SSE has a population of 1,562 listed companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0021909611422498">Shanghai Stock Exchange [SSE], 2011</xref>). A random sample of 100 listed companies was selected from the SEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0021909611422498">Shanghai Stock Exchange [SSE], 2010</xref>). A further 100 companies were sampled from the SZSE which has a population of 1,286 listed companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0021909611422498">Shenzhen Stock Exchange [SZSE], 2011</xref>). Of these 100 companies sampled from the SZSE, 50 companies were from the SME section and 50 were from the non-SME section. In other words, from the SZSE 100 randomly-selected companies were sampled such that 50 companies were from the SME section (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0021909611422498">Shenzhen Stock Exchange [SZSE], 2010</xref>). The 2007 annual reports of these 200 companies, representing the total sample, were examined for each of the eight disclosure issues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021909611422498">Table 1</xref>) and the NED score calculated as the number of issues disclosed in each annual report.</p>
<p>NED scores are acquired by companies through a disclosure index which is:
<disp-quote>
<p>A quantitative based instrument designed to measure a series of items which, when the scores for the item are aggregated, gives a surrogate score indicative of the level of disclosure in the specific context for which the devise was created. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021909611422498">Coy et al., 1993</xref>: 122)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the disclosure index, the contents of each annual report of the sample of companies are compared with the benchmark checklist and coded 1 or 0, depending upon whether or not the content conforms to the items listed on the checklist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0021909611422498">Meek et al., 1995</xref>). The benchmark checklist is based on the checklist used in earlier studies, particularly based on reporting standards or guidelines, or discussions with practitioners and experts in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021909611422498">Hossain et al., 1995</xref>).The benchmark checklist used for the eight items of NED for this study was based on the NED checklist used in past studies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021909611422498">Brown, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021909611422498">Brown et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A disclosure index for every entity is calculated as the ratio of total score awarded to the entity divided by the number of times that are applicable to the entity. Disclosure indices may be classified into weighted or un-weighted indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611422498">Cooke, 1991</xref>). In a weighted disclosure index, some disclosure items are given a higher weighting (score) than other disclosure items based on perceptions of importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611422498">Cooke, 1991</xref>). An un-weighted index deems each component of the disclosure index as equally important and thus each item is awarded the same score when it is disclosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0021909611422498">Meek et al., 1995</xref>). The un-weighted index is the most often used in disclosure studies because it is considered more objective than a weighted technique, more relevant to all entities and avoids over-penalizing entities for non disclosure of items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021909611422498">Cooke, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021909611422498">Chavent et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Values of independent variables were also collated from annual reports. These are defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021909611422498">Figure 1</xref>, with values of leverage above 1 truncated to 1 and profit truncated at the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of −0.197 and 1.74 respectively to reduce the impact of outliers.</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics for the dependent variable NED, the independent variables, and regression analysis were performed in SPSS version 18.0. Regression analysis was performed with the general linear model, so the categorical variable industry was coded with three dummy variables distinguishing between the resource industry and each of the other three industries but statistical significance also reported for industry overall, using an F test (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0021909611422498">Joseph and Taplin, 2011</xref>, equation 1). That is, companies in the manufacturing, real estate and services industries received a value of 1 for the corresponding three dummy variables respectively, and zero otherwise. Regression including all independent variables, and after backward eliminations, are presented as well as regressions using each of the independent variables separately.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0021909611422498">Table 5</xref> are the regression results when the NED index is the dependent variable. First, results are presented when each variable is considered as a sole independent variable (three dummy variables were constructed for the four industries). Size of company has the highest correlation with the natural environment disclosure score (<italic>r</italic> = 0.476, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) while profitability (<italic>r</italic> = 0.172), size of the board of directors (<italic>r</italic> = 0.197), ‘Big 4’ auditor (<italic>r</italic> = 0.223) and Hong Kong listed (<italic>r</italic> = 0.225) are also significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Second, we present regression coefficients (B) and <italic>p</italic>-values from a multiple regression using all independent variables simultaneously and lastly the corresponding results from a backward elimination.</p>

<p>Size is highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), with larger companies disclosing significantly more (a company with total assets 10 times larger is estimated to disclosure 1.7 more items on average) and, hence, H1 is accepted.

<p>Industry is also highly significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.016) and, thus, H11 is accepted. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0021909611422498">Table 6</xref> shows the levels of disclosure for each industry. First, the raw mean disclosure scores are presented, showing the resource companies disclosing significantly more than the other industries. Second, the estimated mean disclosure is presented after adjustment for size (so companies with the same size of 9.36, the mean size in the 200 companies, are compared). Although resource companies are still estimated to disclosure more than the other industries the difference is typically smaller because the fact that resource companies tend to be larger explains some of the differences in disclosure between industries. When comparing companies of the same size, resource industries have significantly higher disclosure than service (<italic>p</italic> = 0.011) and financial (<italic>p</italic> = 0.011) companies but only slightly higher disclosure than manufacturing companies (<italic>p</italic> = 0.099). Although financial companies have a relatively high raw disclosure compared to manufacturing and service companies, they are also significantly larger and after adjustment for size their disclosure is lowest.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Summary</title>
<p>The results of the study about the level and predictors of NED generated by Chinese-listed companies show that a relatively low level of NED is produced by Chinese-listed firms. Although Chinese-listed entities’ NED is greater than the very low levels of Port Moresby Stock Exchange entities, six out of eight categories of the NED index had disclosure rates below 50%. It appears the categories of general environmental conditions, environmental policy, environmental audit, environmental financial related data, environmental aesthetics and environmental other are given relatively short shrift by Chinese-listed companies. Despite numerous calls for environmental audits by both accounting professional groups and academics for decades (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021909611422498">Table 1</xref>), only 24% of companies disclose such an audit. Approximately one-third of these companies disclosed audits by both government and an independent party; however, only approximately half of these companies disclosed a non-government audit. This raises relevant questions on the necessity of such an audit and who should conduct this audit.</p>
<p>The low level of disclosure (38%) for general environmental conditions is of particular concern. This issue relates to environmental pollution which is not only a subject of concern within China but also the rest of the world because of the threat of global warming. The majority of Chinese companies makes no mention of the pollution they generate or measures to counter environmental pollution. The focus on economic growth within China without even minimal concern for damage this causes the environmental surely cannot be maintained. This is an issue for all stakeholders and regulators, domestically and internationally. The International Accounting Standards Board, for example, needs to put in place strategies such as education, or even standards, to improve the practice of environmental disclosures.</p>
<p>NED scores for the components of environmental-product and process related and sustainability were relatively higher, suggesting that most Chinese companies are aware of the sustainability and product and process issues but less willing to dwell on environmentally-financial issues (for example, environmental financial related data and environmental audit) and environmentally non-financial issues (for example environmental policy and environmental aesthetics). Domestic regulators, such as SSE and SZSE, need to educate and regulate in this area to encourage Chinese-listed firms to disclose more.</p>
<p>Size (H1) and industry (H11) were found to be the major drivers of NED. The implication for regulators is that as a priority further education and regulation on NED should be focussed on smaller listed Chinese companies. Larger companies appear to make more NED in order to satisfy financial markets and avoid political visibility problems. They may also possess relatively larger amounts of resources to pay for the costs of voluntary disclosures. Contingency or stakeholder theory is unable to explain why some companies make higher natural environment disclosures than others because smaller companies and companies outside the resource industry make very low NED disclosures. An explanation for this is that Chinese society has focussed on economic growth rather than sustainability. This may need to change not only for the sake of environmental conditions within China but also because the threat of global warming is of importance internationally.</p>
<p>Consistent with the commentary by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021909611422498">Fang (2010)</xref>, there clearly needs to be considerable change in the regulations of environmental disclosure if China desires to be a low-carbon economy. Without changes to Chinese law and policy and improved development of environmental reporting, it appears unlikely that Chinese-listed companies will voluntarily generate more information.</p>
