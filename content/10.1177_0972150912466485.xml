<p>A company by the name of Google founded in late 1998 by two Stanford University computer science graduate students (Larry Page and Sergey Brin), which now employs around 20,000 people and operates search engines in 70 languages has changed the world of Internet forever. It would not be an exaggeration, nay, in fact it would be an understatement to say that Google is the most intellectual, fast, reliable, impartial, multifaceted and updated librarian the world has known hitherto. Besides, Google also holds an incredible amount of data about people who use its technology. Larry and Sergey have firmly established new rules of business, created new business models and changed the world of information technology and advertising forever. If Thomas Edison, Henry Ford and James Watt spurred the Industrial Revolution then Larry and Sergey started the Information Revolution.</p>
<p>The superlative tome under review is a mesmerizing odyssey of 12 enthralling and compelling chapters besides the ‘Introduction’ and ‘Afterword’. The ‘Introduction’ sets the tone of the book in 17 pages. It provides brief glimpses into the lives of Larry and Sergey, their working style and a few facts related to Chrome (Google’s new browser), GooglePack (group of applications that can be downloaded for free) and Google’s decision of gaining entry into China.</p>
<p>The book has a consistent approach throughout. Each chapter begins with a meaningful quotation (sometimes quotations), then contains information in a chronological sequence and has several takeaways. At places information is presented in shaded boxes, which normally pertains to the Library at Alexandria. There are no loose threads in the book, which implies that the reader will not be left in a lurch. The first chapter provides glimpses into the lives of the parents of the two protagonists of the book and details the early years of Larry and Sergey and few of their childhood feats, which prove beyond doubt that both were prodigies from their initial days. The early part of the second chapter brings out the truth that Larry took advantage of the interconnected properties of the Internet for creating a search engine. The latter part of the chapter describes the efforts of Sergey in developing a ‘crawler’ program and how the duo (Larry and Sergey) formed a combination. The third chapter delves into the measures adopted by Larry and Sergey to build a scientific and technological playground and a culture of creativity at Google. The fourth chapter examines how the strategies followed by Larry and Sergey helped them in attaining a top-of-mind position although they never followed the typical dot-com strategy. The chapter provides brilliant instances of Google listening to the wants of the customers or users and understanding prospective employees.</p>
<p>The fifth chapter dissects Google’s allegiance and dedication to clean advertising. The sixth chapter is devoted to Google’s public stock offering in 2004 which was supposed to be, but was not, a landmark event of the lustrum, and which earned sound criticism from the press. The seventh chapter brings out the fact that Google is operating in several countries that have antagonistically different ideologies related to freedom of speech. The chapter offers brilliant examples of problems that arose due to the censorship rules prevailing in Germany, United States, Thailand, Turkey and China. The eighth chapter deals with privacy issues, i.e., keeping users’ personal information confidential. Privacy is of paramount importance because Google collects oceans of data and volumes of information about the people who use its services. Collection of information is done by the computers at Google without any human intervention, but even then, there is always the danger of leakage of information due to hackers and government subpoenas. The ninth chapter meticulously dissects the painstaking efforts made by Larry and his team towards building an electronic library of books. It also details the controversies that Google ran into for their books-digitization endeavour. The tenth chapter provides an overview of the complexities that Google faces because it bought YouTube (leading supplier of online video), and Picasa (a picture-sharing site). It also delves into Google’s forays into the domain of cloud computing and a supposedly secret project within Google code-named Platypus. The eleventh chapter is devoted to the telco war (telecommunications war) with many telecom giants pitted against one another. The twelfth chapter delves into the philanthropic arm of Google. It also discusses Project Virgle, to establish the first permanent human colony on planet Mars.</p>
<p>The book lays bare the dirty secret(s) of Silicon Valley and will be a boon to the champions of creativity, innovation, advertising, strategic management, change management, co-branding, data analytics, business ethics, corporate social responsibility, mergers and acquisitions. Google has not been involved in corporate scandals, stock scandals or accounting frauds till date. The book anatomizes the DNA of Google, which has made it a colossus in the list of innovative companies. The book provides cues at certain places with the help of which a researcher can frame several hypotheses to conduct path-breaking research(es).</p>
<p>The book says that the Great Library of Alexandria, created by Ptolemy I—a childhood friend of Alexander the Great—circa 300 BC, was the world’s first great library. But the truth is that the Royal Library of Ashurbanipal was set up much before the Great Library of Alexandria. In fact, according to Wikipedia, Alexander was inspired to create his own library after seeing the Royal Library of Ashurbanipal, a dream that was later realized by his friend and successor Ptolemy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0972150912466485">Wikipedia, 2012</xref>). Nonetheless, analogies drawn from the Great Library of Alexandria serve their purpose well. A dramatis personae should have been provided at the beginning of the book as it would have helped the reader identify the characters and thereby gain a deeper understanding of the book. It would do the reader considerable good if he/she apprises himself/herself of terms and concepts such as ‘Science Citation Index’, ‘data mining’, ‘Dewey decimal system’, ‘venture capitalist’, ‘initial public offering’, ‘red herring’, as these terms have been used in the book.</p>
<p>The book contains startling facts. Sergey had a fondness of picking locks of the office doors in the old Economics Building at Stanford, but he never did anything illegal although he thought of it. Larry and Sergey rented out an entire theatre and took the Google staff so that they could watch the first <italic>Lord of the Rings</italic> movie when it was released in 2001. Sergey refuses to accept advertisements for cigarettes or alcoholic beverages. The book dwells on certain concepts which were conceived almost two millennia ago in Alexandria and which are still being used today. The book does justice to technical jargon such as ‘IRCs’, ‘MUDs’, ‘crawler programs’, which is bound to sustain the reader’s interest and increase his/her knowledge.</p>
<p>Titans of the ilk of William Henry (Bill) Gates III, Steve Jobs, Larry Page and Sergey Brin have etched their names with indelible ink on the firmament of technology and changed the way the world works and businesses operate in innumerable ways ad infinitum. The work under review is a beautifully chiselled gem, which will definitely enrich the reader in more ways than one. At the same time the book emphasizes the urgent need for development of policies and a revision of existing policies related to business and trade at a global level.</p>
