<abstract>
<p>The financial crisis has affected European pensions in both the short and longer term. Members of funded pension systems nearing retirement experienced a sharp contraction in pension wealth as equity markets fell. Market turmoil has damaged public trust in such schemes and has caused employers to revise their pension obligations. Countries running funded schemes based on a share of mandatory contributions are faced with rising transition costs as unemployment rises and tax bases shrink. Pressure on public expenditure has caused some governments to raise pensionable ages and even cut pensions in payment, while reducing future public pension obligations. Thus the crisis has forced politicians to address the consequences of societal ageing while exposing the fallibility of funded schemes as a source of pension security. Fundamental questions about the prolongation of working lives remain to be resolved.</p>

<p>La crise financière a affecté les pensions européens, tant à court qu’à long terme. Les membres des systèmes de retraite financés proches de la retraite ont connu une forte contraction de leur patrimoine retraite à mesure que les marchés boursiers chutaient. Les turbulences du marché ont endommagé la confiance du public dans ces régimes et ont poussé les employeurs à revoir leurs engagements en matière de retraite. Les pays dotés de régimes par capitalisation basées sur une part de cotisations obligatoires sont confrontés à une hausse des coûts de transition que le chômage augmente et que la valeur fiscale rétrécit. La pression sur les dépenses publiques a conduit certains gouvernements à relever l’âge de la retraite et même à réduire les pensions au paiement, tout en diminuant les engagements de pensions publiques futures. Ainsi, la crise a obligé les politiques à faire face aux conséquences du vieillissement de la société tout en révélant au grand jour la faillibilité des régimes par capitalisation en tant que source de sécurité de retraite.

<p><italic>Las implicaciones de la crisis económica de las pensiones y la política de pensiones en Europa</italic></p>
<p>La crisis financiera ha afectado a las pensiones europeas, en el corto y el largo plazo. Los aportantes a los sistemas jubilatorios de capitalización a punto de jubilarse han sufrido una fuerte contracción del valor de las pensiones originada en las caídas en el mercado de valores. Las turbulencias de los mercados han dañado la confianza del público en estos programas y han llevado a los empleadores a revisar sus obligaciones previsionales. Los países con sistemas de capitalización financiados en parte por contribuciones obligatorias están enfrentando costos de transición crecientes a medida que aumenta el desempleo y por lo tanto se reduce la base impositiva. Frente a la creciente presión sobre el gasto público algunos gobiernos han elevado la edad de jubilación, han reducido las obligaciones de futuras pensiones públicas, e incluso han llegado a disminuir el monto de las pensiones. Es decir que la crisis por una parte, ha forzado a los políticos a encarar las consecuencias del envejecimiento de la sociedad, mientras que por la otra, la crisis revelaba la falibilidad de los sistemas de capitalización para proveer pensiones seguras. Cuestiones fundamentales sobre la prolongación de la vida laboral aún quedan sin resolver.</p>

<p>The ‘crisis’ and its impact have seldom been out of the headlines since mid-2007. What started as a credit crisis mutated into a banking crisis, an employment crisis, a crisis of government finance and, more recently, a crisis of European cohesion and of the Monetary Union. Analysts have paid attention to each of these dimensions, and have shown how one phase morphed into the next. Less attention has been paid to the implications of the crisis for pensions in Europe. There has been a widely recognized impending ‘pensions crisis’ in Europe – the consequence of ageing societies. The crisis has, however, forced policymakers to address pension issues more urgently and to initiate reforms that they had contemplated but had seldom had the courage to implement. The first part of this article traces the impact of the crisis on pensions. The second part considers how governments have responded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468018112455633">1</xref></sup> The third part draws some conclusions and makes some recommendations for a more coherent pension policy.</p>
<sec id="section1-1468018112455633">
<title>The impact of the crisis on pensions</title>
<p>One of the first manifestations of the crisis was the sharp fall in equity markets across the industrialized world. This crash had immediate implications for funded pension systems, especially where the pension funds were heavily invested in shares rather than in bonds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468018112455633">2</xref></sup> According to OECD estimates, in 2008 European pension funds lost over 20% in real terms, although this differed substantially between countries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1468018112455633">Figure 1</xref>). There was a strong correlation between the fall and the equity share of investments; in some countries the nature of the equity investments, as much as their existence, was crucial – for example, Ireland, where funds had taken a risk-seeking stance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468018112455633">Stewart, 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1468018112455633">3</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>There are differences between the countries of Western Europe and those of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), reflecting asset allocation. Schemes in CEE states are new and small; in many, the proportion of assets they hold in equities is legally constrained. A high proportion of assets is invested in fixed interest products, primarily government bonds. Hungary is an outlier. Hit by a requirement to expand the choice of plan they offered, from 2008 funds were obliged to increase investments in equities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1468018112455633">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Equity markets rallied in 2009, recovering some of their losses. This improved the value of scheme assets; those funds that had not been frightened out of equity investments did better than those who had. Those who had ‘rebalanced’ and purchased low-priced equities did yet better. However, world markets have remained highly volatile and are still well below the level they had reached at the start of 2007.</p>
<p>Participants in defined contribution (DC) plans experienced the immediate impact of the crisis as the value of their savings pots fell dramatically.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1468018112455633">5</xref></sup> However, only those nearing retirement suffered an unexpected fall in their pension wealth, while the financial services industry and, implicitly, governments offered reassurance that ‘for those [plan] members further away from retirement age, there is the potential for markets to recover and the recovery of equity markets in the last year has partially offset the losses experienced previously’ or that ‘almost all DC systems are relatively young, so the number of older workers affected is small in absolute . . . terms’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468018112455633">CEIOPS, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Defined benefit (DB) plans, which cover many older employees, were also under stress. Generally, benefits for those close to retirement were not touched. However, insofar as the crisis had an impact upon scheme solvency levels, it encouraged DB plan sponsors to reconsider provision for their employees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1468018112455633">6</xref></sup> Plan sponsors had already experienced market volatility. Changes to accounting practices meant that they were required to declare pension fund performance in their balance sheets, thus publishing any difference between liabilities and assets. Moreover, more rigorous standards for discounting liabilities and for valuing assets had been imposed, and these, too, widened deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468018112455633">Bouvier, 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1468018112455633">7</xref></sup> Most importantly, plan sponsors were beginning to appreciate that the estimates of longevity that they employed were dated. Rising longevity increased liabilities. The fall in equity prices, which reduced the value of assets, merely exacerbated scheme deficits. Compared to 2007, the ratio of assets to liabilities fell by well over a third for Irish DB schemes in 2008, by nearly a third for Dutch DB schemes and by a fifth for UK DB schemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1468018112455633">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Even before the crisis, sponsors were reassessing their pension provision. The crisis was, for many, ‘the final nail in the coffin’ (Steyn, 2010, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468018112455633"><italic>Financial Times</italic>, 2010</xref>). In the UK, it accelerated the process of scheme closures and a switch to DC plans. In the Netherlands, the collectively agreed, supplementary DB plans that cover almost all the workforce have a degree of built-in flexibility, as the value of the benefits they pay depends on their funding level. In the first instance, this has an effect on increases made to pensions in payment (‘solvency-contingent indexation’). However, <italic>in extremis</italic>, benefits can be cut. Since 2009, many plans have been frozen and some have even cut payments, so that, in aggregate, benefits have risen much less than expected (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1468018112455633">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-1468018112455633">
<title>From financial markets to the real economy</title>
<p>Although the crisis’s initial impact was on the financial sector, affecting pension wealth and pension fund viability, it quickly had repercussions on the real economy. Company insolvencies put members of employer-sponsored DB plans at risk. Where a pension fund is underfunded or, as in Germany where many occupational plans take the form of ‘book reserves’ and are not funded at all, employer insolvency can lead to plan members, especially those still in work, losing many of their acquired rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1468018112455633">8</xref></sup> In some countries, pension protection schemes ensure that, where a fund or sponsoring employer defaults, at least part of accrued benefits is maintained and current pensioners continue to receive an income.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1468018112455633">9</xref></sup> A mutual insurance scheme for book reserve plans in Germany has a long history. In the UK, a protection fund was established in the mid-2000s, following high-profile cases of people losing benefits they had been promised or were being paid.</p>
<p>The German Pension Security Fund (PSV) reported record payments in 2009 and was obliged to raise the levy it made upon member firms to unprecedentedly high levels – from <italic>c.</italic> 0.3% to over 1.4%. Equally, the onset of the crisis saw a spectacular increase in the number of pension funds recorded as potentially eligible for assistance by the UK Pension Protection Fund – from an average of some five per month to 15 per month by late 2009.</p>
<p>In Ireland, where DB plans dominate occupational pensions, no protection existed for company plan members who were not yet retired. The collapse of a world-famous firm that threatened those made redundant with the loss of their accrued rights, as they stood in line with all other unsecured creditors, led labour unions to initiate legal proceedings against the government for failing to meet EU rules providing adequate treatment of workers in firms hit by insolvency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1468018112455633">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regardless of the form of pension provision, unemployment is likely to impact on retirement income as well as on current income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468018112455633">Chai et al., 2011</xref>). Most public pension systems provide credit for certain periods of non-working. Contributions are made for those on unemployment benefits – although rarely at the level that would have applied had the benefit recipient remained in work.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1468018112455633">11</xref></sup> However, membership of employer-sponsored schemes ceases when the employment contract ends. Unemployment results in a period when no pension is being built up. Where an occupational pension scheme has a long vesting period – in Germany it is as long as five years and, before 2001, it was 10 years – even accrued rights can be lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468018112455633">Rabe, 2007</xref>). Some personal pension plans accept contributions when members are not working, but as income is reduced, continuing voluntary membership is hard. On resuming work, people might restart a supplementary pension, but savings built up in one plan cannot necessarily be transferred into another. Even if they can, the transfer might incur additional costs.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1468018112455633">
<title>Responses to the crisis</title>
<p>The initial response of many Western European governments was to allow traditional automatic stabilizers to take effect and to take steps for sustaining demand. For example, the UK government reduced value added tax (VAT) from 17.5 to 15% for 12 months from December 2008. The German government approved two economic stimulus packages, in November 2008 and in March 2009, and introduced subsidies for short-time working. ‘Car scrappage’ programmes were introduced in Germany, France and the UK.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1468018112455633">12</xref></sup> In CEE states, many governments were trying to control public deficits in order to qualify for Euro membership. Some had already pegged their exchange rates. Their scope either for reflation or for devaluation was often limited.</p>
<sec id="section4-1468018112455633">
<title>Initial reactions in Western Europe</title>
<p>Pension systems, themselves, were mobilized as components of a counter-cyclical response. In Finland, the government gave powers to the state reserve pension fund (VER) to purchase commercial paper (debts) in ‘significant and solid Finnish companies’ to boost national financial markets. In the Netherlands, the government urged pension funds to ‘contribute to the economic recovery by investing in the [Dutch] financial sector’. In Spain, the public social security fund increased its investments in domestic government debt, and reduced its investments in the debt of other European governments, thereby dampening upward pressure on the public borrowing rate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1468018112455633">13</xref></sup> In Iceland, the government permitted people to liquidate their supplementary pension savings to ‘meet pressing financial needs’ without incurring the normal tax penalty. In Denmark, similar, if more temporary, provisions were made. In Spain, where funded pensions were limited, conditions on early drawdown were relaxed for the unemployed.</p>
<p>Steps were also taken to relieve pressures on companies sponsoring DB pension plans faced by additional payments to meet solvency rules. For example, the UK pension regulator relaxed the requirement for underfunded plans to demonstrate a strategy for recovery within 10 years. Subsequently, it reduced the maximum risk levy chargeable on the more vulnerable plans and decided to hold its basic levy constant, although circumstances demanded that this should be raised. The Dutch government extended the period in which underfunded plans are supposed to achieve a minimum funding level from three to five years and has indicated it might go further.</p>
<p>Reducing burdens on employers in a time of economic uncertainty prompted the UK government to introduce a lower price index to be used by DB plan sponsors when uprating pensions in payment and deferred pensions under company schemes (also applied to uprating the state’s supplementary pension). Pension reforms have been delayed. A new supplementary pension scheme into which all employees would be automatically enrolled was supposed to be operative as of 2012. Objections from small firms, which were likely to be particularly affected, led to the decision to phase the scheme in over five years.</p>
<p>The failure to cut public pension payments when calculation formulae required them to fall can also be seen as elements of a counter-cyclical package, even if not presented as such. The German public pension system ties pension increases to a formula that, <italic>inter alia</italic>, reflects movements in wages. In 2009, these were projected as likely to fall: so pensioners would receive lower benefits. In an election year, the government amended legislation to ensure that, whatever the uprating formula, nominal payments would not be cut. Such behaviour was not altogether surprising. In the previous two years, cuts had only been avoided by the suspension of a provision whereby pensions were to be reduced each year to take account of an assumed increase in income from the supplementary private pension scheme the government had promoted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468018112455633">Schmähl, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1468018112455633">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The crisis also meant that public pensions in Sweden should have been cut. The reformed Swedish system includes an ‘automatic balancing mechanism’ that reduces the value of newly paid pensions and of pension increases if the system’s nominal liabilities exceed nominal assets. The onset of the crisis lowered both the rate of growth of wages and the rate of return on reserves. However, applying the full cut was deemed unacceptable. The government, facing elections in 2010, reduced its impact by half (by pushing part of the cuts into the following year). It argued that it was undesirable for large fluctuations in stock markets to result in large fluctuations in pension levels. Closer examination shows that it was only the very high returns available in financial markets in earlier years that had prevented the brake from being applied earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468018112455633">Scherman, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1468018112455633">
<title>The perverse consequences of looser monetary policy</title>
<p>In an effort to increase liquidity and provide more general stimulus, some governments, national banks and the European Central Bank (ECB) took steps to increase the supply of credit or money. Initially the ECB claimed merely to be ensuring the necessary liquidity at a time when interbank lending was frozen. In some cases, the objective was to bring down benchmark interest rates; in others, the consequence of credit creation was that interest rates fell.</p>
<p>While such measures might have been beneficial for the wider economy, they had negative consequences for insurers, for DB pension funds, for pensioners and for people who were retiring. For insurers, low interest rates meant that companies selling pension plans in the form of life insurance policies that guaranteed a minimum rate of return, found meeting these guarantees more difficult. For DB pension plans, the low interest rates raised the discounted value of their liabilities, exacerbating any deficits consequent on falling equity values.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1468018112455633">15</xref></sup> For pensioners, lower incomes were being generated from savings. For those on the point of retirement, the value of assets held in DC savings plans tumbled and pension income from other savings also fell. This is because government bond rates are used to determine the rate at which pension savings are annuitized. In the UK, where DC schemes are relatively important, and annuitization is more or less obligatory, annuity rates have fallen by nearly 40% since the start of the millennium – with half of this occurring since January 2009.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1468018112455633">
<title>Initial reactions in CEE states</title>
<p>The mainly small, very open economies of CEE countries were badly hit by the crisis at an early stage. For many, the only response had been to cut wages and constrain or cut public expenditure. Latvia, Hungary and Romania were forced to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and became actual or potential recipients of special assistance, conditional on their governments adopting retrenchment policies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1468018112455633">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many CEE states had engaged in radical pension reform as part of their transition to a market economy. Such reforms had introduced mandatory funded pension schemes into which a share of contributions was channelled. This incurred ‘transition costs’ – part of the contribution went into individual savings accounts and so was unavailable to pay current pensioners’ benefits – meaning extra resources had to be found. With other revenues declining, some governments reduced, at least temporarily, part of the payments into individual accounts, using contribution income to meet current expenditure needs. Lithuania was the first to take such steps, but others rapidly followed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1468018112455633">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Suspension of contributions was not confined to CEE states. As described above, the UK government delayed its quasi-mandatory supplementary pension scheme. Because tax relief was granted on employee contributions to be paid into individual pension accounts, the delay had positive fiscal implications. Two German states, Thuringia and Bavaria, stopped paying contributions into their civil servants’ pension funds – both citing the financial crisis and consequent pressures on public expenditure as the reason for doing so.</p>
<p>One major reason for the (temporary) diversion of contributions back into the public pension scheme was the strictures imposed on government deficits by the Maastricht criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1468018112455633">17</xref></sup> Countries that introduced funding claimed that they were thereby reducing future levels of public spending but, to reap this benefit, they had to ‘invest’. Investment costs were not, however, recognized. A revised Stability and Growth Pact in 2005 had contained a temporary offset of transition costs that ran over five years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1468018112455633">18</xref></sup> As this period of grace came to an end, eight CEE countries sought an extension or a more permanent revision of the pact.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1468018112455633">19</xref></sup> To date, this has been refused. At best, only those countries that are deemed to show fiscal prudence and are not heavily indebted – for example, Poland – are likely to gain further respite. Hungary went a step further. In an effort to shore up the public finances, the government executed a series of raids on private pension funds with the result that contributions are now being used to fund public expenditure (see Simonovits, this issue).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1468018112455633">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Hungarian government was not alone in viewing pension scheme assets as a source of relief for fiscal shortfalls. In 2008, before the world crisis had hit the country, the Argentinian government nationalized the supplementary pension fund accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468018112455633">Kay, 2009</xref>). At an early stage of the crisis, the Irish government transferred the pension fund of the public universities and certain other public agencies to the exchequer, agreeing to meet future payments out of current expenditure. Equally, in late 2010, the Portuguese government took over the pension fund assets of the national telecom company, and subsequently that of the banks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1468018112455633">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>National pension reserve funds, established to smooth the costs of societal ageing, also attracted attention. In Poland, the relevant fund helped to pay for current state pensions. In Ireland, the government used the universities pension fund assets to prefund the payments it owed to its national pension reserve fund (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1468018112455633">Table 3</xref>). As the economy deteriorated, the reserve fund assisted in the bailing out and recapitalization of the banking sector. By spring 2011, 60% of assets had been absorbed in this way.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1468018112455633">22</xref></sup></p>

<p>Other Western European countries faced pressures to abandon stimulus packages and consolidate their public finances. They too have introduced parametric reforms to their public pension systems, notably to increase the pension age (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1468018112455633">Table 5</xref>). Some had already started: in 2007, the German government introduced a phased increase in the pension age from 65 to 67. In 2008, the UK government followed suit, but raised it to 68; following the election of a new government, the phasing-in period was accelerated. In France, in 2010 the government laid out plans to lift the pension age from the low level of 60 that had been set at the start of the 1980s.</p>

<p>Other than Greece, only certain CEE countries have attempted to cut pensions in payment and not all have succeeded. In two countries (Latvia and Romania), they have been halted by constitutional courts. Swingeing reductions in welfare payments in Ireland affected other benefits, although pension cuts have not been ruled out. Elsewhere, rather than cutting pensions in payment, governments have moderated their increases by reviewing indexation procedures or removing supplements.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in some countries, reforms have been lacking even though demography and public finance apparently demand them. Italy stands out. In 2010 the government announced intentions to raise the retirement age in line with life expectancy; implementation remained vague.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1468018112455633">24</xref></sup> Reforms were only confirmed and reinforced when the poor state of public finance led to the appointment of a technocratic government in 2011.</p>
<p>In some countries, governments have used the requirement to reduce public expenditure to reform privileged public sector pension schemes. Very early retirement available to some public officials in Greece attracted attention to its pension system – in some cases it was possible to retire as early as 53. In France, employees of some public utilities could retire at 50 or 55, but successive governments lacked the courage to force their retirement age up to the level applying to the private sector. Under present circumstances, French civil servants will continue to receive a higher pension than private sector employees. Although the retirement age for public utility employees will be raised to that for all other workers, the process is being delayed. In the UK, public sector pensions remain under scrutiny. Resistance to higher retirement ages for central government employees means they are imposed only on new entrants. However, radical changes are now decided – benefit calculation is switched from final salary to career average earnings thus shifting at least some of the costs of rising longevity from employer to employee.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1468018112455633">25</xref></sup></p>

<title>Assessment</title>
<p>The crisis gave policymakers a wake-up call, prompting them to pay yet greater attention than heretofore to population ageing and how this might be paid for. Pension providers – governments and employers – had to reconsider current practices. As an immediate financial crisis, it revealed the shortcomings of approaches that had sought to place increased emphasis on non-state sources of retirement income. Plan sponsors, as sophisticated investors, became more conscious of the commitments they had made. Participants in private plans became brutally aware that their pensions depended on factors outside their control. Subsequently, as a broader economic crisis developed, the ability or willingness of states to maintain traditional substantial pension programmes was drawn into question. Governments redoubled their efforts to control the growth of public expenditure. Individuals became more anxious about relying on the ‘pension promise’ to which they had thought they were partners. Last, it made clear that privatization did not, per se, make pension schemes immune from political risk.</p>
<sec id="section9-1468018112455633">
<title>The future for private pensions</title>
<p>Indicators of popular disenchantment with financial institutions and equity markets – the fundaments of savings-based systems – are numerous; consistent data series that record this are much less numerous. However, two examples suffice.</p>
<p>Declining confidence is largely recognized (for examples see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1468018112455633">Tables 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1468018112455633">7</xref>). Responses, however, have mainly involved modifying private pension infrastructures, not reducing market-based provision. The European Commission’s Green Paper on ‘adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468018112455633">Commission, 2010</xref>) emphasized superior regulation of financial institutions, i.e. improved accounting rules and solvency directives. It proposed better protection for DC plan members by adjusting asset allocation with age, moving towards more stable bonds and away from volatile shares as retirement age approached. It hinted at building a guaranteed rate of return into mandatory (or quasi-mandatory) savings plans. Last, it intimated that improved consumer education could increase the ability of individuals to manage those risks for which they are increasingly responsible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1468018112455633">26</xref></sup></p>

<p>Improved accounting procedures and solvency rules make DB pension costs more transparent, but increased transparency has accelerated the tendency of employers to cease sponsoring such schemes. Solvency rules that increase the proportion of capital that financial institutions must hold in reserve have been criticized by the latter as damaging their profitability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1468018112455633">27</xref></sup> ‘Life-cycling’ (moving savings into less risky assets as retirement approaches) is superficially attractive. However, simulations show that there would still be vast differences between similar savers that reflected simply the date they started saving/the date they retired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1468018112455633">Antolin et al., 2010</xref>). Calls for savings plan guarantees can be traced to a requirement in the laws of many European countries that life assurance policies pay a minimum return. However, the insurance cost of any guarantee that is above the government bond rate is prohibitive. Neither savers nor governments are likely to accept that cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468018112455633">Casey and Dostal, forthcoming</xref>).</p>
<p>Improved financial education raises the question of funding it. For insurance companies, servicing people who make relatively low savings is unprofitable – they remain critical of government attempts to cap charges on DC plans. Requiring individuals to manage their retirement savings assumes that they can access comparable information across providers – something that regulators have failed to achieve. More importantly, the major challenge lies less in acquiring information than in processing it. Demands are made upon individuals that few have the competence to satisfy. In addition, investor decision-making is considerably less rational than economic theory suggests it should be.</p>

<title>The future for public pensions</title>
<p>Government efforts to reduce levels of public debt have focused attention on age-related expenditures, initially on expenditures on public pensions. In some countries, pension reforms have had an immediate, if small, fiscal impact. However, in most, it will take many years before any benefits will be seen. This is because the crisis, itself, is a short-term, conjunctural event, while population ageing is a long-term, structural development. Responses to the crisis have led some governments to engage in temporary stimuli, whereas elsewhere, automatic stabilizers have pushed up expenditure. However, the crisis itself, as opposed to actions induced by it, should not have any long-term impact upon pension expenditure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1468018112455633">Figure 3</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1468018112455633">28</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>This said, action induced by the crisis is important. Studies by the European Commission and the OECD show how public pension reforms in recent years will cut pension benefits in the future. Although not uniform across all member states, the effect of measures to cut pensions is projected to reduce the overall increase in public expenditure on old age pensions in the EU27 from 4.9% to 2% of GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468018112455633">EcFin and AWG, 2009</xref>). Measures taken since these projections were produced have generated further cuts, not increased generosity.</p>
<p>Ensuring adequate and sustainable pensions became a European objective at the Laeken Council of 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468018112455633">EPC-SPC, 2001</xref>). Almost all recent pronouncements of the Commission have emphasized the second of these intentions. No less might be expected from the Economic and Financial Affairs Directorate General, but responsibility for the Joint Report on Pensions is shared with the Social Protection Committee, and this report monitors progress on the Laeken objectives. The 2010 report made 85 mentions of sustainability and only 53 of adequacy, and acknowledged only in its penultimate section that projected declines in pension benefits might present a ‘challenge’ and that there might be a point ‘where the average pension becomes too low in terms of social and political sustainability’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468018112455633">EPC-SPC, 2010</xref>: 65).</p>
<p>‘Sustainability’ dominated the subsequent EC White Paper on Pensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468018112455633">Commission, 2012</xref>): much emphasis was placed on ‘balancing time spent in work and retirement’. Preliminary estimates indicate that increasing pensionable age by two years between 2010 and 2020, followed thereafter by one or two years for every three years of extra life might reduce public pension expenditure by as much as 1.8 percentage points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468018112455633">EcFin, 2009</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1468018112455633">Table 8</xref>). This is more than the savings obtained by increasing older people’s workforce participation rate by 5 percentage points because those working would build up higher pension entitlements than they would have, had they not worked. Achieving a higher employment rate for all age groups has a similarly small fiscal effect. Nonetheless, improving overall employment rates of older people remains important – if only because without people working up to the current retirement age, few can be expected to work beyond it.</p>

<p>Higher retirement ages are often politically difficult for governments to push through. So too, are cuts in benefits. In some CEE countries, the latter were successfully blocked. In some Western European countries, governments delayed them rather than face their electorates. Nonetheless, since the end of the Second World War, when most current pensionable ages were set, all increased longevity has been absorbed by longer retirement. It thus seems a legitimate proposition, even if it took the crisis for it to be given the credence it deserves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1468018112455633">
<title>Further issues for consideration</title>
<p>Requiring people to work longer involves complementary policies. More employment among older people does not reduce employment opportunities for other groups, except perhaps in the very short term.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1468018112455633">29</xref></sup> However, later retirement requires that the capacity to work in later life also increases. Whether it is increasing, is not certain. In addressing whether extra years of life are ‘good years’, almost all discussion focuses on ‘the frail elderly’, not on ‘older workers’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1468018112455633">30</xref></sup> ‘Life-style induced illness’, such as obesity, might increase morbidity levels for the latter group. Rethinking work organization and the relationship between work and health is needed if the effective age of retirement is to rise.</p>
<p>Equally important are people’s needs once in retirement. It is not only cuts in income consequent upon cuts in pension benefits that challenge the adequacy of income of older people. If people are living longer, they are likely to need social care and they have to be in a position to meet the associated costs. The public expenditure implications of increased care provision are less well understood than those of rising costs of pensions. In all European countries, care services are less of an ‘entitlement’ than are medical services or pensions; fiscally constrained governments are highly likely to reduce provision of them. If older people have to purchase care out of pension income, this will affect their level of wellbeing dramatically. It is not sufficient to consider future pension and future care costs as discrete items. Within limits, public provision of one might substitute for public provision of the other. Equally, plans that enable people to make savings for care are as vulnerable to market failures and market volatility as are pension savings plans.</p>
<p>Last, however much or little fiscal relief higher pension ages might bring, it is not an alternative to deciding about pension benefit levels. The crisis has exposed the fragility of relying upon savings-based schemes to plug the ‘pension gap’ that restraining public expenditure is likely to produce. Nonetheless, it has not reversed prevailing orientations that place greater emphasis on the individual rather than on the collectivity, and on the private rather than on the public. Policymaking has focused far too much on modifying and improving the operations of funded pension systems. Very little discussion to date recognizes that the question of how pensions are delivered is a second order one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468018112455633">Barr, 2002</xref>). The first order question is not <italic>how</italic> societies choose to transfer resources from workers to non-workers but whether they want to do that at all, and, if so, how much they want to transfer. Until this first order question has been answered, pensions will remain in crisis.</p>

<p>Under a funded pension system, contributions build up a savings pot. At retirement, the pot is used to buy a pension (annuitization) or is taken as a lump sum for further investment. Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) systems’ contributions are used to finance current pensions: most public pension systems are PAYG, although some have a reserve fund. Funded systems can be public or private, mandatory or voluntary, collective or individual.</p>

<p>Equity values are determined in the stock market. Bonds pay a fixed rate of return and are redeemable at value if held to term. Equities are presumed to generate higher returns than bonds over the long-term, but the higher rate of return is, itself, compensation for assuming higher risk.</p>

<p>Previously, most second-tier pension insurers had offered only one plan.

<p>The higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of liabilities. In the past, scheme sponsors had been able to choose the discount rate they employed and to value assets using a rate of growth based on assumed investment performance. Now they were required to mark assets to market – reflecting their actual rather than some hypothetical value. The European Commission’s draft Solvency II directive was criticized by DB pension fund representatives because it required liabilities to be valued according to a fixed discount rate or a discount rate based on the expected return on assets rather than a risk-free interest rate (the rate on selected government bonds) that would be much lower.</p>
