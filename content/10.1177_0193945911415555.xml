<abstract>
<p>Do Nurse Residency Programs (NRPs) reflect the professional socialization process? Residency facilitators in 34 Magnet hospitals completed Residency Program Questionnaires constructed to reflect the goals, themes, components, and strategies of the professional socialization process described in the literature. NRPs in 4 hospitals exemplified the complete two-stage (role transition and role/community integration) process. In 14 hospitals, NRPs were of sufficient length and contained components that reflected the professional socialization process. In 16 hospitals, NRPs exemplified the “becoming” role transition stage. What components are most effective in the professional socialization of new graduate nurses? A total of 907 new and experienced nurses, nurse managers, and educators working on clinical units with confirmed healthy work environments in 20 Magnet hospitals with additional “excellence designations” were interviewed. Components identified as most instrumental were precepted experience, reflective seminars, skill acquisition, reflective practice sessions, evidence-based management projects, and clinical coaching–mentoring sessions. Suggestions for improvement of NRPs are offered.</p>

<p>Nursing is a profession now recognized as such by its practitioners, other health care professionals, the public, industry, and government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945911415555">Benner, Sutphen, Leonard, &amp; Day, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193945911415555">Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0193945911415555">Robert Wood Johnson Foundation [RWJF], 2011</xref>). Nurses are knowledge workers and highly skilled professionals who have a central role in coordinating, integrating, and facilitating the continuum of patient care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0193945911415555">Porter-O’Grady, Clark, &amp; Wiggins, 2010</xref>). In 1999, for the first time in more than 30 years, nursing was added to the 20 professions whose practitioners are rated annually by the public for honesty and ethics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945911415555">Gallup, 2008</xref>). In a national forum (RWJF), 92% of leaders from health care, university faculty, government, and corporate reported that professional nurses should have more influence in promoting wellness, increasing quality of care, reducing medical errors, improving efficiency, and reducing costs. Nursing now meets all six of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945911415555">Flexner’s (1910)</xref> criteria by which professional status has long been judged. Its practitioners, prepared in Institutions of Higher Learning, possess a constantly updated, scientifically verified body of knowledge; function autonomously; and are legally and ethically responsible and accountable for providing a needed service to society. These qualities justify the privilege of control and regulation of the profession by professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0193945911415555">Larson, 1977</xref>).</p>

<title>From Occupational to Professional Socialization</title>
<p>Recognizing the critical importance of professional knowledge/practice in meeting needs of increasingly complex, critically ill patients, nurse leaders focused action on instituting <italic>professional</italic> socialization programs for Newly Licensed Registered Nurses (NLRNs). The two-stage (training and orientation) <italic>occupational</italic> socialization model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945911415555">Bullis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0193945911415555">Ostroff &amp; Kozlowski, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0193945911415555">Tradewell, 1996</xref>), characterized by medical dominance, tight hierarchical control, gender and role subordination, and work functionalism based on part-task bureaucratic work principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945911415555">Corwin, 1961</xref>), was no longer adequate for the challenges of patient care today. Nurse leaders responded by instituting what may be the most significant organizational transformation in the history of nursing—Nurse Residency Programs (NRPs). Two questions guide this research: To what extent do NRPs reflect the professional socialization? What components, strategies, and activities of NRP are most effective in NLRN socialization into professional practice?</p>

<title>Overview of Healthy Work Environment, NLRN, and NRP Research Program</title>
<p>The study reported in this article is the fourth in a nationwide research program focused on identification of factors in professional practice environments that are effective in NLRN role transition and role/community integration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945911415555">Brewer, Verran, and Stichler’s (2008)</xref> Systems Research Organizational Model was used to assess the differential impact of Client, Contextual, and Action Focus variables (healthy work environments and stages of NRPs) on six outcomes—NLRN expectations, Environmental Reality Shock, Shock-Related Issues and Dilemmas, nurse-assessed Quality of Patient Care, NLRN turnover, and degree of Community/role Integration. The first study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0193945911415555">Lacey et al., 2011</xref>) focused on the evolution and distinction between nurse’s job satisfaction and nurse’s professional practice satisfaction. The second study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0193945911415555">Kramer, Maguire, Brewer, &amp; Schmalenberg, 2011</xref>) described the “clinical unit healthy work environment” designation process. The third study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945911415555">Kramer, Brewer, &amp; Maguire, 2011</xref>) examined the impact of healthy unit work environments on Environmental Reality Shock and related Issues and Dilemmas of Concern to NLRNs during the professional socialization process.</p>

<sec id="section3-0193945911415555">
<title>Theory and Process of Professional Socialization</title>
<p>Professional socialization is the process of acquiring and internalizing knowledge, skills, values, roles, attitudes, and norms associated with the practice of a profession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0193945911415555">Merton, Reader, &amp; Kendall, 1957</xref>). The process consists of three stages—separation from academia, transition into practice, and identity formation and integration into professional roles and communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945911415555">Gregg &amp; Magilvy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945911415555">Jayne, Egan, &amp; Parker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0193945911415555">Ohlen &amp; Segesten, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0193945911415555">Tradewell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0193945911415555">Trice &amp; Morand, 1989</xref>). Each stage has its own theme: “knowing” for Academic stage, “becoming” through guided practice in “real-life” settings for Transition stage, and “affirming” professional identity and “integrating” into professional roles for Integration stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945911415555">Davis, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945911415555">Duchscher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0193945911415555">Larson, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0193945911415555">Ohlen &amp; Segesten, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0193945911415555">Rutter &amp; Duncan, 2010</xref>). Themes are reflected in goals, activities, and expected role performances for each stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945911415555">Clark, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0193945911415555">Secrest, Norwood, &amp; Keatley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0193945911415555">Tsang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0193945911415555">Wilensky, 1964</xref>). Content is based on issues and dilemmas most problematic for aspiring professionals at each stage.</p>
<p>Most professions have a separate program for each stage beyond academia. Content and names for these programs vary over time as they are constantly updated and improved. For example, in medicine, the “becoming” Transition-stage program has been termed an <italic>internship</italic>. The program for the “affirming/integrating” stage was termed a <italic>residency</italic>. More frequently now, the Transition-stage program is designated as a clerkship or <italic>1st-Year Residency</italic>, and the Integration-stage program is termed the <italic>2nd-Year Residency</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945911415555">Jayne et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>There is no standard nomenclature in nursing for either the stages or for the complete program. Complete programs are variously termed <italic>orientation, internship, residency</italic>, or <italic>fellowship</italic>. Most often, they focus only on the “becoming” theme/stage, although some NRPs do include both “becoming” and “affirming/integrating.” Because there is some common understanding and use of the concepts “becoming” and “transition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945911415555">Duchscher, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945911415555">2009</xref>), in this report, the “becoming” stage of professional socialization will be referred to as the <italic>Transition stage</italic>; the “identity-affirmation and integration” stage will be termed the <italic>Integration stage</italic>. This study and report focuses only on the Transition and Integration stages.</p>
<sec id="section4-0193945911415555">
<title>Transition-Stage Goals, Components, and Expected Role Performance</title>
<p>Goal and characteristics of Transition are that the aspiring professional works with a teacher, guide, preceptor, or master in a <italic>supported, dependent role in a real, natural work environment</italic>. This dependent experience is based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0193945911415555">Vygotsky’s (1978)</xref> “situated-learning” theory, that is, learning in disciplines involving human cognition and skills occurs through interaction with other people in the natural work or practice environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945911415555">Collins, Brown, &amp; Newman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0193945911415555">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>). The learner is viewed as a “cognitive apprentice” who gains knowledge through imitation of the master and through guided practice in cooperative, authentic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0193945911415555">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>). In addition to a guided practice experience, other components of Transition include mastery of skills through guided repetitive practice, group stress-reduction sessions, and opportunity to explore ancillary experiences, practices, or continua of service outside of the main practice environment.</p>
<p>Length of Transition stage is equivalent to length of dependent, guided experience; it varies by profession. In education, medicine, and law, Transition stage is often referred to as practice teaching, internship, or clerkship. In some professions, these Transition stages begin in the last semester of academia. What is essential is not when they commence but rather that the experience is a guided, dependent, situated learning, and cognitive apprenticeship in a real-life setting. Clerkships may extend from 4 or 5 months up to a year. Internships vary with profession but usually last about 1 year; practice teaching usually lasts a semester. Preceptorships in nursing range from 2 to 4.5 months, but the picture is unclear. In some hospitals, the NRP is equivalent to the precepted experience. In other hospitals, the length of NRP recognizes and includes both a Transition and an Integration stage.</p>

<sec id="section5-0193945911415555">
<title>Integration-Stage Goals, Components, and Expected Role Performance</title>
<p>Major Integration-stage goals are as follows: (a) competent, independent, accountable performance of the major/dominant role of the professional as well as beginning competency in peripheral professional roles such as research, teaching, advancement of the profession, and community service and (b) identification, assimilation, and integration into professional communities such as work group, group practice, committees, professional associations, and community service groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911415555">Ferguson &amp; Jinks, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0193945911415555">Wenger &amp; Snyder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0193945911415555">Weresh, 2009</xref>). Specialization may begin in this stage or in subsequent stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0193945911415555">Warren, 2009</xref>). In medicine, labels such as Senior Resident or 2nd-Year Resident are used to designate this stage; Junior Partner or Novice Teacher are used in other professions. Conversion to independent practice and assumption of ethical, legal, responsibility and accountability for one’s own clients are characteristics that define beginning of Integration stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945911415555">Hurst &amp; Koplin-Baucum, 2003</xref>). In law, this is often symbolized by overt payment indicating a binding professional–client relationship. Except in medicine where length of residency (1st year and 2nd year) is stipulated, length of Integration stage is not as clearly demarcated as is length of Transition stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945911415555">Dreyfus, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945911415555">Haag-Heitman &amp; Schedler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0193945911415555">Newhouse, Hoffman, &amp; Hairston, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0193945911415555">Smith, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0193945911415555">Winter-Collins &amp; McDaniel, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Academic-Transition Stress</title>
<p>All professional aspirants experience some value/ethical conflict, “expectation–reality generated” stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193945911415555">Kahn, Wolfe, Quinn, Snoek, &amp; Rosenthal, 1964</xref>), Environmental Reality Shock, or cognitive dissonance as they move from academia into practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945911415555">Clark, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945911415555">Duchscher, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945911415555">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945911415555">Festinger &amp; Carlsmith,1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193945911415555">Kramer, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945911415555">Kramer, Brewer, et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0193945911415555">Page, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0193945911415555">Price, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0193945911415555">Ryynanen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0193945911415555">Sharif &amp; Masoumi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0193945911415555">Toffler, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0193945911415555">Tsang, 2010</xref>). Stress is most severe during Transition, but also occurs during Integration. To achieve goals and performance objectives, aspirants must manage stress and acquire the knowledge and skills needed to effectively embrace the professional practice role. Strategies for alleviation of stress include mentor–mentee relationships, peer group supportive activities, and reflective sessions based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945911415555">Dewey’s (1909/1989)</xref> model of reflective thought and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945911415555">Boyd &amp; Fales, 1983</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945911415555">Festinger and Carlsmith’s (1959)</xref> cognitive dissonance theory.</p>

<sec id="section7-0193945911415555">
<title>Content and Strategies of Transition and Integration Stages</title>
<p>The didactic content and reflective practice components of Transition and Integration are more profession centric than are the goals and themes. These components vary by profession, are dependent on identified issues/dilemmas, and depend upon in which of the two stages the problem/issue occurs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0193945911415555">Schmalenberg and Kramer (1979)</xref> used concerns and issues cited by NLRNs in Stress-Reduction Seminars to build the content for the first NRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0193945911415555">Kramer &amp; Schmalenberg, 1977</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945911415555">Haas and Shaffir (1987)</xref> cited 18 dilemmas common to new physicians during the internship stage; resolution strategies for these dilemmas were the focus of Integration-Stage Reflective Practice sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0193945911415555">Schon, 1987</xref>). A study funded by the American Nurses’ Foundation reports seven life events identified as stressful for new graduate nurses during Transition stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945911415555">Carroll, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945911415555">Kramer, Brewer, et al. (2011)</xref> presented the 10 issues and dilemmas of highest concern to the 2009 class of 468 NLRNs during Transition and Integration stages.</p>
<p>In most professions, specific roles—coach, mentor, or sponsor—constitute the major teaching strategy for goal achievement. Nursing is one of few professions that uses a separate and specific role—that of preceptor—for the Transition stage. The settings, goals, and strategies used by preceptors in nursing are essentially the same as those used by advisers and masters in other professions. Coach and mentor roles predominate during Integration. These roles are <italic>advisory</italic> in nature (in contrast to the <italic>participatory</italic> roles of Transition). Advising may occur before or after the precipitating event. Dominant theories used in coaching are adult learning motivation theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945911415555">Arbinger Institute, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0193945911415555">Whitworth, House, Sandahl, &amp; Kimsey-House, 1998</xref>). The goal of coaching is to advise on practice related to the dominant professional role. Coaches must be expert practitioners; colleagueship is the anticipated and desired end product of effective coach–new practitioner relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945911415555">Arbinger Institute, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945911415555">Boyer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945911415555">Bratt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945911415555">Duchscher, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945911415555">International Coach Federation, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Mentoring is an intense developmental relationship between the professional aspirant and a successful, established professional who provides advice, counseling, and developmental opportunities that shape the protégé’s career experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945911415555">Eby, 1997</xref>). Mentoring focuses on interpersonal and professional development and career guidance, and often includes exposure to peripheral professional roles and role activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193945911415555">Johnson, Geroy, &amp; Griego, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0193945911415555">McKimm, Jollie, &amp; Hatter, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there is some consensus on the definition of mentoring, there are different perspectives with diverse goals according to relationship context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945911415555">Beecroft, Santner, Lacy, Kunzman, &amp; Dorey, 2006</xref>). Limited progress has been made in development of mentoring theory. As a result, mentoring research lacks an integrated research framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945911415555">Burke &amp; McKeen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0193945911415555">Russell &amp; Adams, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945911415555">Bozeman and Feeney (2010)</xref> attributed the persistent problems in development of mentoring theory and corresponding usage of the construct to the fact that mentoring is often used synonymously with socialization and other processes and with other roles such as guide, coach, and sponsor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945911415555">Clark, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0193945911415555">Page, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0193945911415555">Ryynanen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0193945911415555">Schon, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0193945911415555">Toffler, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0193945911415555">Tsang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0193945911415555">Weresh, 2009</xref>).

<p>This review of the professional socialization process highlighted the important goals, themes, theories, and components and serves as the framework to answer the research questions. To what extent do NRPs reflect the professional socialization process that has effectively guided development of practitioners in other professions? What components/strategies do NLRNs, preceptors, and nurse managers/educators engaged in nursing practice on clinical units with confirmed healthy work environments identify as effective in the socialization of NLRNs into professional nurse practice?</p>

<sec id="section9-0193945911415555">
<title>Design</title>
<p>A mixed quantitative/qualitative design was used to answer the research questions. Descriptive, quantitative data obtained from analysis and synthesis of Residency Program Questionnaires (RPQs) completed by the 34 hospitals, were compared with goals, components, themes, theories, and content of the professional socialization process synthesized from the literature. Qualitative data were obtained from digitally recorded interviews with 330 NLRNs, 401 preceptors, 138 managers, and 38 educators.</p>
<sec id="section10-0193945911415555">
<title>RPQ</title>
<p>The 37-item, investigator-developed RPQ began with the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>This questionnaire concerns only special programs for new graduate nurses—residency, internship, fellowships—in their first professional practice employment. In this survey, the term “residency” is used to designate all such programs.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This was followed by a section of questions for each of the four commonly cited components of NRPs—stress-reduction sessions, skills, precepted experience, and content/activities related to management of professional role responsibilities—derived from analysis of NRPs published in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945911415555">Beecroft et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945911415555">Boyer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945911415555">Bratt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945911415555">Halfer, Graf, &amp; Sullivan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945911415555">Hatler, Stoffers, Kelly, Redding, &amp; Carr, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0193945911415555">Krugman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0193945911415555">Newhouse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0193945911415555">Ulrich, 2011</xref>). Prior to dissemination, the RPQ was critiqued and completed by NRP facilitators in three nonparticipating Magnet hospitals. Under each section, NRP facilitators were asked to list content areas, learning activities, teaching strategies, and percentage of time devoted to each component. Additional questions are as follows: (a) time when NLRNs caseload represented 100% in staffing level, (b) observations/experiences in other departments, (c) participation by College of Nursing faculty in NRP, (d) presentation of content and activities of NRP to graduating seniors, and (e) description of any special or unique features of hospital’s NRP not described in this survey. Facilitators had the option of completing the RPQ online or by surface mail. Follow-up emails were exchanged between researchers and facilitators to clarify unique features of hospital’s NRP. Most of the facilitators attached extensive documentation to their completed RPQ.</p>

<title>Site-visit interviews</title>
<p>To obtain data to answer the question regarding components and strategies effective in NLRN professional socialization, site visits of 1.5 to 4 days (average = 2.5 days) were made by one of the three Health Science Research investigators to each of the 20 hospitals from end of October to mid-December, 2009, and from February to mid-June, 2010. Purpose of visit was to interview NLRNs, experienced nurses, nurse managers, and educators working on “best” clinical units in “best/excellent” hospitals. Selection criteria were a minimum of 5 units that had on-boarded NLRNs in 2009 and on which a representative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193945911415555">Kramer, Schmalenberg, Brewer, Verran, &amp; Keller-Unger, 2009</xref>) group of experienced nurses confirmed that they had very healthy unit work environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0193945911415555">Kramer, Maguire, et al., 2011</xref>). (Trial interviews in local hospitals indicated that 5 units were a comfortable number for one interviewer in 1- to 1.5-day site visit.) As there was no shortage of hospitals meeting these criteria, type of hospital, geographical location, and type of NRP were used to obtain a nationally representative sample. Final sample was 174 units, ranging from 5 to 14 units per hospital (<italic>M</italic> = 9 units). Interview samples from these units were as many NLRNs volunteers with at least 6 months of experience as scheduling would permit, and 2 to 4 experienced nurses depending on number of volunteers and size of unit RN complement. Nurse managers from the 174 units were group interviewed as were most of the educators. Number of NLRNs and experienced nurses interviewed ranged from 25 to 76 with a mean of 45 nurses per hospital.</p>
<p>A two-part interview schedule was developed. The first part, the focus of this research, consisted of the question—What person, program, or activity has been most effective and most instrumental in helping NLRNs (you) make the transition from school to a full professional practice? (Results from remainder of the interview questions are reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0193945911415555">Kramer et al., in press</xref>.) The interview schedule was pretested by two investigators in three hospitals. In addition to validating the interpretation and meaning of interview questions, differences in responses from individuals versus small groups (two to four nurses) were evaluated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0193945911415555">Mayan (2001)</xref> recommended focal-group interviews if difficulty in accessing information from participants is anticipated. No differences in spontaneity, in content of responses, or in willingness to share by size of group were noted during pretesting. Preferences for small group (usually two to three nurses) or individual interviews were made by interviewees at the time of scheduling. Groups of NLRNs and experienced nurses from same unit were interviewed separately. Interviews were conducted in a conference room on the unit or in a central location, usually the latter. To accommodate 12-hr schedules, interviews were conducted as early as 6:00 a.m. and as late as 9:00 p.m. In almost every hospital, some interviewees desired to prolong the interview beyond the scheduled time. When this occurred, additional or repeat time was scheduled.</p>
<p>Extensive contextual documentation was gathered from each hospital during and after site visits. Many on-site investigators and interviewees shared with researchers copies of evidence-based practice and evidence-based management presentations that nurses had referred to during the interviews.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>A total of 40 Magnet hospitals that had received hospital-excellence awards—Baldrige, Thomson-Reuters Top 10/Top 100—in addition to Magnet designation, and had established NRPs, were selected. They were divided into two groups—20 hospitals in which NLRNs’ adjustment and degree of professional socialization were tracked over a 1-year period and 20 hospitals in which outcomes—retention and extent of integration into professional roles and communities—were measured. This multistudy research program required survey completions at specified periodic intervals; 34 of the 40 Magnet hospitals submitted sufficient data for valid and reliable aggregation of data to the group (clinical unit) level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0193945911415555">Kramer et al., 2009</xref>). These 34 hospitals constituted the sample to answer the first question: To what extent do NRPs reflect the professional socialization process described in the literature? A total of 20 hospitals, 10 from the professional socialization process group and 10 from the outcome group, were selected for site visits and interviews to answer the second research question—What components/strategies do nurses identify as most effective in the professional socialization of NLRNs?</p>
<p>It was reasoned and expected that NRP components and strategies identified as effective in NLRN socialization would most likely occur on “best units in best hospitals.” It had previously been demonstrated that NLRNs working on units with confirmed <italic>Very Healthy Work Environments</italic> experience less Environmental Reality Shock than do their counterparts on other clinical units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945911415555">Kramer, Brewer, et al., 2011</xref>). To identify “best” units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0193945911415555">Kramer, Maguire, et al., 2011</xref>) in these best Magnet hospitals, 12,233 experienced nurses—working as RN on unit for &gt;1 year—completed the Essentials of MagnetismII<sup>©</sup> (EOMII<sup>©</sup>), an instrument that measures nurses’ perceptions of the health of unit work environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0193945911415555">Schmalenberg &amp; Kramer, 2008</xref>). Healthy work environments are defined as unit work environments that enable nurses to engage in eight work processes/relationships identified by nurses in 14 Magnet hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945911415555">Kramer &amp; Schmalenberg, 2002</xref>) as essential to professional nursing practice, to being able to give quality patient care. These eight processes are as follows: Clinically competent peers, Collaborative nurse–physician relationships, Clinical autonomy, Support for education, Patient-centered culture, Control of nursing practice, Supportive nurse manager relationships, and Perceived adequacy of staffing. These essential work processes and relationships have since been confirmed by several professional groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945911415555">American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945911415555">American Organization of Nurse Executives, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193945911415555">IOM, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0193945911415555">Mensik, 2007</xref>). Best units are those on which experienced-nurse EOMII scores were &gt;1 <italic>SD</italic> above the National Magnet Hospital Profile, the latter is based on EOM and EOMII scores from almost 15,000 clinical nurses in 50 hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0193945911415555">Kramer &amp; Schmalenberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0193945911415555">Schmalenberg &amp; Kramer, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>An on-site investigator appointed by each hospital obtained Institutional Review Board approval. Written and verbal explanations of the purpose of the study and interviews were provided to on-site investigators, nurse managers on “best” units, and potential interviewees prior to site visits. Verbal or written permission to digitally record interviews was obtained before commencement of interviews. All interviewees were volunteers, and they had the choice of individual or small group (two to four) interviews.</p>

<p>All NRPs included the major components of Transition—precepted experience, reflection/debriefing sessions, skill training, and content classes. A third of the hospitals included evidence-based practice projects and/or observation/experiences in other departments. This stage was similar in goals, themes, and components to what is described in the literature for clerkships or internships.</p>
<p>Achievement of Transition-stage goals was facilitated through three strategies/components that were present in all 34 hospitals. These were as follows: (a) guided, supported, dependent, and precepted professional copractice experience also defined as a “situated-learning” clinical immersion experience in the care of patients assigned to the preceptor; (b) Reflective Seminars, Facilitated Debriefing sessions, or Transition Discussion groups primarily for alleviation of stress, restoration of confidence, peer guidance, and sharing of solutions to practice dilemmas; and (c) demonstrations, simulations and computerized programs for skill practice and mastery, and didactic content on delegation and prioritization.</p>
<p>Some hospitals listed additional or Transition-stage goals and content that transcended Transition and Integration. These goals were as follows: (a) “becoming” a nurse—becoming socialized into the work group and into the community of nurses; (b) exposure and mastery of content related to ethical dilemmas/grief, evidence-based practice initiatives, selecting a mentor, constructing a career plan, giving/receiving feedback, critical thinking, and judicious use of resources; (c) conduct of an evidence-based practice project; (d) opportunity to develop a mentor–mentee relationship; and (e) observation of procedures or actual experiences providing patient care in other departments. In three hospitals, this observation/experience was termed <italic>looping</italic> and was described as the opportunity for NLRNs to understand what occurs in other departments as well as the patient care continuum, to meet colleagues in other parts of the hospital, to see and perform skills not possible on home unit, and to better understand what patients and families encounter during the hospital experience.</p>
<sec id="section19-0193945911415555">
<title>Precepted experience</title>
<p>NRP in all 34 hospitals offered precepted experiences. In the 16 Transition-only hospitals where length of NRP equaled length of precepted experience, graduation exercises, 100% inclusion of the NLRN in the unit staffing structure, and/or promotion to Staff Nurse II marked successful completion of the precepted experience and Transition stage.</p>
<p>Qualifications of preceptors were essentially the same in all hospitals—a minimum of 1 year of experience as an RN, has demonstrated clinical competence, is a professional role model, and is interested in and “cares” about new graduates. In all programs, preceptors received from 8 to 16 hr of training and instruction, similar to that described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945911415555">Boyer (2008)</xref>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0193945911415555">
<title>Number of preceptors varied by program, from one to as many as five</title>
<p>In NRPs with Dedicated Transition Units, there were at least two preceptors. Different preceptors often worked with NLRNs on different shifts. Three hospitals had planned 4-week preceptor rotations based on differential preceptor experience and competence levels.</p>
<p>The precepted experience provided guidance and support in putting theory into practice—theory that had been learned in school as well as content acquired in seminars, focus groups, and skill classes/demonstrations. The role of the preceptor was to model, socialize, educate, evaluate, and protect neophyte nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945911415555">Boyer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945911415555">Bratt, 2009</xref>). A core component of the preceptor’s educator role was guiding development of reflective practice and critical thinking skills. As NLRNs were not “counted” in the staffing structure during the precepted experience, they were free to leave the unit for classes, demonstrations, simulations, observations, and experiences in other departments. In four hospitals, RPQ noted that situated-learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0193945911415555">Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991</xref>) and/or the Cognitive Sharing Model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0193945911415555">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>) were used to develop goals and guide preceptors’ interactions and activities.</p>

<sec id="section21-0193945911415555">
<title>Reflective seminars</title>
<p>These confidential sessions consisting of all NLRNs in a cohort were led by a facilitator or guide, were usually 90 min in length, and were held every 3 to 4 weeks during Transition (first 3-4 months post hire). Foci of the sessions were self-care, stress reduction, and facilitated peer coaching. Content, driven by needs of the NLRNs, most frequently included stress, reality shock, conflict resolution, delegation, prioritization, dealing with grief, loss of self-confidence, fear of harming patient, and work life imbalances. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945911415555">Dewey’s (1909/1989)</xref> model of reflective thought and action guided the development and leadership of reflective seminars in three hospitals.</p>

<title>Skill classes/demonstrations/didactic content</title>
<p>RPQs listed a plethora (25-50) of procedures, skills, and care sets in which NLRN received lectures, demonstrations, and lab or simulated practice.

<title>NRPs Evidencing Both Transition and Integration Stages of Professional Socialization</title>
<p>Of the 34 RPQs, 4 provided evidence of multistage residency programs similar to that described in the professional socialization literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945911415555">Clark, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0193945911415555">Merton et al., 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0193945911415555">Schon, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0193945911415555">Tsang, 2010</xref>). One of these was a four-tiered program. The initial 3-month dependent, precepted period was followed by a 3- to 6-month independent specialty- coached tier and then by a 4-month period with goals of NLRN self- and career development and integration into professional communities and practice. The fourth tier (at about 1 year) was a period of support, coaching, and mentoring, while NLRNs strived for certification in a chosen specialty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0193945911415555">Shanahan &amp; Warren, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0193945911415555">Warren, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The second multistaged program was a cross between a Dedicated Transition Unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945911415555">Hatler et al., 2011</xref>) and a Rotating Internship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911415555">Crimlisk, McNulty, &amp; Francione, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0193945911415555">Poduska, 2010</xref>). In this hospital, all NLRNs began their careers in the medical–surgical Resource Pool (67 to 75 nurses who provided auxiliary staffing for eight medical/surgical units). The NRP consisted of 2-week rotations to each of the eight clinical units accompanied by resource pool preceptors. During rotations, NLRNs worked directly with preceptors and with the patients assigned to preceptors, attended scheduled classes, and participated in scheduled educational activities and Reflection seminars. Approximately 4 months post hire, the independent, integration period commenced. NLRNs again rotated to some of the eight units, or they remained on a single unit, but this time they had their own patient-care assignment and functioned independently as float nurses with guidance and support from clinical coaches.</p>
<p>In the third and fourth hospitals with multistage programs, the Transition stage consisted of a 3-month precepted experience, skill mastery, and new graduate seminars, followed by a 6- to 12-month Integration stage. During this stage, NLRNs had their own patient assignments and had clinical coaches available to them. Coaches were expert clinical nurses or charge nurses from whom NLRNs could seek advice, before or after the event, in development of competence in providing care for a multiple-patient assignment and for how to collaborate and work with physicians, peers, and complex families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945911415555">Bratt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945911415555">Halfer et al., 2008</xref>). NLRN in these hospitals also had assigned or selected mentors with whom they met regularly. The role and purpose of mentors was discussion/guidance in setting professional goals, “growing your nursing career,” self- and professional growth and development, contributing to practice improvement of practice through evidence-based practice projects, and identification of experiences to assist achievement of future career goals. Coaches and/or mentors conducted or hosted monthly or bimonthly discussions/presentations that provided guidance, support, and leadership in management of professional role responsibilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0193945911415555">
<title>NRPs With Potential for Both Transition and Integration Stages</title>
<p>In 14 additional hospitals, RPQ indicated that NRPs were of sufficient length—at least 2 months longer (median = 1 year) than precepted experience—and included some components and content related to professional affirmation and integration. These programs did not recognize the movement from dependency to independency that distinguishes Transition from Integration stage. Nor did they articulate or differentiate goals, themes, or expected role performances in the two socialization stages. They did include components such as mentor and/or clinical coaching roles and activities, and had regular sessions for discussion/presentation of content related to development of professional role responsibilities, evidence-based practice and/or management of clinical situations, career development, and role/community integration.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193945911415555">Table 2</xref> illustrates the percentage of time allocated to the three major components of NRPs in the 16 Transition-only and in the 18 Transition + Integration hospitals. Reflection/debriefing sessions and manual–technical skills were much the same in both groups of hospitals. The multistage group allocated twice as much time to Management of Professional Role Responsibilities and associated clinical coaching and mentoring components than did the Transition-only group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-0193945911415555">
<title>Goals, Themes, Theories, and Components of Integration Stage of Professional Socialization</title>
<p>In the hospitals that had defined multistage NRPs or where the length and content of NRP evidenced attention to the Integration stage, goals included competence in providing care and mastery of the clinical situation for multiple patients; participation in peripheral roles of research, teaching, leadership, and precepting of other new graduates; and development of plans to foster self- and professional growth. Activities supporting these goals were as follows: clinical coaching by nurses on the unit recognized as experts and mentor-assisted self- and career development and planning. Monthly mentoring and/or coaching sessions covered topics such as (a) management of clinical situations, including skills related to delegation, prioritization, collaborative practice, constructive conflict resolution, and autonomous decision making; (b) career mapping, professional choices, educational goals, and clinical ladder; (c) performance evaluations; (d) nurse practice act; (e) resources and chain of command; (f) shared governance council/activities; and (g) Magnet concept and societal responsibilities of professionals.</p>
<p>Recognition of and movement from Transition to Integration was celebrated in 10 hospitals by placement of the NLRN’s name on the staffing roster, by change in locker location from Residency area to unit area, and by informal celebrations similar to those held when physicians move from clerkships/internships to residencies. The following comment is typical of many NLRN interviewees:
<disp-quote>
<p>My farewell lunch with my preceptor and having my name by itself on the regular unit assignment means that I have beginning competency. I’m now ready to put it all together and care for a regular 6-patient assignment and dealing with the MDs, lab, pharmacy, home health and everything.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In nine hospitals, completion of both stages of the NRP was marked by formal graduation exercises.</p>

<p>Of the 39% (<italic>n</italic> = 126) of the NLRNs who had pursued a career or occupation for at least 2 years before becoming professional nurses, the largest number (<italic>n</italic> = 22) worked in some aspect of health care; 14 were Licensed Vocational nurses who had worked for periods ranging from 2 years to 19 years. The longest careers/occupations in terms of years were as follows: commodity broker (26 years), child development worker (20 years), manager of fitness program (20 years), and plumber (20 years). A total of 7 NLRNs had administrative experience such as president of a technology firm (12 years) or as administrators of nursing homes (8 years), pharmaceutical (5 years), marketing (<italic>n</italic> = 2; 9 and 7 years), or software (<italic>n</italic> = 2; 6 and 9 years) companies prior to entering their professional nursing program.</p>

Six had earned degrees in languages—French (<italic>n</italic> = 1), Spanish (<italic>n</italic> = 3), or Russian (<italic>n</italic> = 2). A total of 7% of the NLRN were currently enrolled in advanced educational programs such as nurse anesthetist, clinical nurse specialist, or nurse practitioner.</p>
<p>When interviewees were asked whether they had a second degree or had worked in an occupation or profession prior to nursing, more than a third (<italic>n</italic> = 124) responded negatively but in the same breadth volunteered the information that they regularly volunteered for some kind of community service. Fire, search and rescue, diabetic fair, teaching swimming to handicapped children, reading to the blind, volunteers for the Katrina and Haiti tragedies, and health assessment in Homeless Shelters were among the most common, in addition to church and school activities. Respondents also indicated that this volunteer activity was a service to society and was “an expected part of being a professional.”</p>

<p>She lets me go at my own pace . . . easy to work with, guides without making me feel stupid . . . keeps me from making mistakes. She/he teaches without making me feel like a student. There’s not the status difference there was between you and the faculty in school. . . She “draws” the knowledge that you already have out of you and, by the questions she asks, you learn what knowledge is appropriate in particular situations . . . She purses her lips, suggests, smiles crookedly, raises her eyebrows to guide you, to convey that you are thinking straight or that you’re not . . . She never lectures although she does indicate when I need to look something up or look for answers to my questions. . . . .

<sec id="section31-0193945911415555">
<title>Length of precepted experience</title>
<p>Length of precepted experience was cited by many preceptors and NLRNs as a very important factor in NLRNs’ restoration of lost self-confidence.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If it’s too long, it destroys their self-confidence, especially when they feel ready to be on their own and you still protect and coddle them. When we started our NRP, we experimented and found that 3 to 4 months was ideal . . . Another thing we do is tell the new grad that they are to tell us when they think they have accomplished the goals of the precepted period and are ready to be on their own. If she is slow in telling me, I nudge her and say something like: Not ready yet? And you should see the light that comes into her eyes, the smile on her face, the straightened shoulders! It’s beautiful—something to behold! (Preceptors)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nurse managers pointed out that preceptorships longer than about 3 months are not cost-effective:
<disp-quote>
<p>New grads are kept in a dependent, protected role longer than necessary. Better to put them 100% on the staffing roster and let them test and prove themselves. We have plenty of clinical coaches who are available and willing to support them when asked. The difference is that with the coach, the new grad says when she needs or wants to check something out. The preceptor was constantly there to protect.</p>

<title>One consistent or multiple preceptors?</title>
<p>Comments were mixed and about equal as to which was more helpful. This diversity was also reflected within units and within hospitals.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I want one experienced, knowledgeable preceptor who knows the ropes, not someone who knows just a little more than I do . . . Multiple preceptors are great because you see different ways of doing things, of organizing and prioritizing your patients . . . I didn’t like having multiple preceptors; you spend half your time learning how to work with different personalities, meet different expectations, rather than getting involved in learning skills and how to prioritize and make decisions.

<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s “terrific” “magnanimous” that this hospital offers this residency! The entire 4 months that we have a preceptor, we are not counted in staffing! . . . This hospital is paying us while we learn how to put everything together. Isn’t that amazing? . . . I came to this hospital because of the residency program. They presented it at school . . .

<title>NRP located in float pool</title>
<p>Present in only one hospital but identified by almost all interviewees—NLRNs, experienced nurses, nurse managers, and educators—in that hospitals as highly effective in the build-up of NLRNs self-confidence, was a NRP operative in the hospital’s medical–surgical float pool.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We rotate with our preceptor every two weeks to 8 different units. It’s terrific! It’s like you have the opportunity to present a different, <italic>more self-confident persona</italic> every two weeks. Other nurses and physicians treat you differently when you come across as confident than when you present yourself as a “scared rabbit” just out of school. . . I had another nurse ask me: You just came from the ortho unit—how soon after surgery before you ambulate a new hip patient? And I could answer. That’s really bolstered my self confidence.</p>

<title>Number of Steps or Levels to Becoming a Professional Nurse</title>
<p>The next largest group of responses related to the central idea that “the precepted experience alone is not enough; new graduates need continued support when they are on their own, when they are counted in staffing.” The majority of NLRNs and half of the preceptors and managers indicated that “there are at least two levels of accomplishment before new grads can be trusted as complete professionals.”</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There’s before and after—your preceptor. It’s different. When you have a preceptor, in a sense you are working on her license, the same way as in school . . . when you are with your preceptor, you are still a learner, only now it is like being tutored by one person instead of the faculty member overseeing 8 or 10 of us at a time. Someone is always “watching my back,” keeping me from making a mistake or harming patients . . . you are dependent, your preceptor is above you, is your teacher, guides and suggests alternative solutions . . . it’s not until you have your own patient assignment, by yourself, and counted in staffing, others depending upon you, do you become a real professional nurse . . . it’s having to manage care for the 5 patients that I am responsible for. You have to master clinical skills and pick up speed, figure out how you are going to meet the needs of all your patients at the same time . . . I think there’s another higher level and that’s when you can not only give professional care, but you are accepted, respected and trusted by other nurses and doctors and everyone . . . Yes, that’s right! Other nurses ask for your opinion, your advice, your judgment on patient care . . . It’s then that you know that you’re not only part of the group on the unit, but respected as a professional, equal to doctors and therapists in the care that you provide to patients. You are part of the group and you begin to think about committee or council work, or even becoming a preceptor yourself. (NLRNs)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Complete professional nurse practice role performance is not expected in the Transition stage. This is developed incrementally—the dominant role first, followed by peripheral or collateral roles. In nursing, one of the most difficult aspects of the dominant nurse role is management of the clinical situation for each patient. In Academia and Transition, patient clinical situations are managed by faculty and preceptors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945911415555">Duchscher (2009)</xref> maintains that transition shock mediates both the intensity and the duration of the Transition stage and qualifies this second stage of professional socialization.</p>
<p>Movement from the dependent, guided stage to the independent phase was so memorable that many NLRNs could and did cite the exact date, shift and names, age, and diagnoses of the patients in “my first real patient assignment.” On many units, seasoned nurses took NLRNs out for celebrations “after they had made it through their first day as a real nurse.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section36-0193945911415555">
<title>Effective Integration-Stage Strategies and Components</title>
<p>Interviewees did not use phrases such as effective Integration-stage components. Instead, they talked about “What happens after NLRNs outgrow, graduate from their preceptor?” The most frequent response was that they receive support and guidance from clinical coaches and preceptors. In this section, NLRNs describe their confusion about the mentor role and the differences between coaches and mentors.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I still haven’t figured out exactly what my mentor is or does . . . I just found out that my preceptor is now my mentor—something about planning your career and when you should go back to school, and when you should start thinking and talking like a leader . . . I don’t understand the difference between a coach and a mentor, or between them and a preceptor, for that matter. It seems like they all do the same thing . . . On my unit, we all have an expert clinician who works with us in the same pod. I have my patient assignment and she has hers. She doesn’t check on me but lets me know that she’s there to talk or answer questions.</p>
<p>It’s great. I feel supported . . . I’m thoroughly confused about all these different roles . . . I have someone assigned to me from another unit to help me—she said she was my mentor, but she didn’t exactly know what she was supposed to do, but said she’d find out . . . You have to understand. I’d only been here a month and I was still nervous, scared and a little panicky. I had just gotten started with my preceptor and the residency facilitator started talking to me about mentors and leadership and planning my career . . . I had no idea what she was talking about. I just wanted her to go away so that I could take care of my patients . . . .Now, is the time I need a coach—someone on the unit that I can go to, run my thoughts by her before making a decision . . . My coach is great! She said that she was there not to supervise but to help me “maximize my performance.” That sounded real neat, don’t you think? Then she went on to explain that this was the day I was going to start crossing the bridge to becoming a real professional nurse, and that I should look at her as someone standing on the bridge with her hand ready to help, advise, be a sounding board if I needed it. That I was a professional, I knew how to provide excellent care to patients; she was there to help me maximize my potential. That was a tremendous help! (Eight NLRNs)</p>

<p>Five hospitals clearly articulated differences in goals, objectives, and expected role performance during Transition and Integration and between mentors and coaches. In some hospitals, role of mentor was to “identify unwritten workplace policies and practices.” In others, this was the role of the coach as “mentors were frequently nurses from other units and didn’t know the unwritten practices and culture of our unit.” Another problem is that
<disp-quote>
<p>Mentors have to have periodic contact with their mentee—it can be long or short and it doesn’t have to be at the hospital . . . You can’t establish a relationship unless you see and talk with one another, you have to relate. (2 experienced nurses)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The following excerpts from NLRNs, experienced nurses, and nurse managers illustrate the dominant understandings that interviewees have of the goals and functions of these three roles.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The preceptor is a professional role model who provides instruction and support in a structured setting over a Transition period of 3 months. She demonstrates incorporation of theory into practice. NLRN’s relationship with their preceptor is short term and is related to specific goals and outcomes. When you have a preceptor, you don’t have your own patient assignment that you are responsible and accountable for. You take care of the patients in the preceptor’s assignment . . . My preceptor was wonderful—so supportive. I never would have made it past the first or second month without my preceptor.</p>
<p>A mentor is a personal role model, and can be from any unit or department in the hospital. It could even be the CNE! . . . The mentor is a guide, a role model in life-long learning, career planning and professional development. She provides social, political, and educational networking . . . They told us in Residency that we have mentorship here. I didn’t know what that meant and didn’t know enough to ask . . . Mentors have fallen by the wayside. No one exactly knows what they are supposed to do, least of all us (NLRNs) . . . On half of the units, we use them as coaches; and on the other half, they give classes after NLRNs no longer have preceptors. (Nurse managers in a group interview)</p>
<p>A clinical coach is an experienced nurse (on the same unit as the NLRN) dedicated to clinical excellence and development of NLRN competency and mastery of the professional nurse role on that unit . . . Charge nurses make great Clinical Coaches . . .Coaches help NLRNs master multiple patient assignments and the intra-disciplinary teamwork characteristic of the patient care delivery system on this unit . . . It’s different in ICUs where they only have one or maybe two patients but they still have Clinical Coaches—I don’t know exactly what they do there. Clinical coaches wait to be asked; you don’t intrude yourself on the new grad. Part of becoming a professional is knowing when you need help. I explain to new grads that calling on your coach are like “MDs calling in another MD for a consult.” Coaches use skills to champion and help residents meet their clinical goals and promote self-awareness and learning . . . A clinical coach offers advice and counsel. It’s more of a colleague or beginning equality relationship. (Nurse managers)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The timing of the mentor–NLRN relationship is critical. In some hospitals, mentorship was introduced almost immediately post hire; in others, the concept was introduced then but not initiated until the end of the precepted experience—about 3 months post hire. In still others, the relationship did not commence until 4 to 5 months post hire. Although there was a great deal of confusion about the role of mentor, when the concept worked, it worked well. The following excerpt from two different NLRNs illustrates comprehension of the concept of mentor, how mentorship is viewed as supportive, and how observations in other departments enhance NLRNs’ understanding of the health care delivery system and the continuum of patient care.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I selected my mentor about the time that my preceptor took me to lunch to celebrate my Independence Day—the day that I had my own patient assignment. Actually, she’s the one who explained to me what a mentor was and what we were supposed to accomplish. Your mentor advises you on your career. She guides you in seeing all aspects of nursing—teaching, research, charge nursing, precepting other new grads, management and leadership—and helps you with your evidence-based practice project, helps you to look at the broad picture and the totality of nursing. She opened my eyes to all the possibilities and how the things that I was doing now, and the experiences I was having fed into the broader picture, and the contribution I could make to the profession . . . My mentor is the one who helped me understand how tremendous our “looping” program is. During our first 22 weeks, we had the opportunity to go with our patients—or really our preceptor’s patients—off the unit to MRI or CAT Scan or surgery, even to the clinic where they would be going post discharge. It was great! I even sat with the parents while Timmie was in surgery and talked with them about changes that would have to be made when he got home. And they talked about how they were preparing the other kids for what had happened to Timmie. Looping is great; it helps you refocus from tasks and skills to the whole patient and his family.

<title>Results</title>
<p>All NRPs reflected the “becoming”—Transition stage of the professional socialization process that has guided the socialization in other professions since first articulated by Merton et al. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0193945911415555">1957</xref>. Effectiveness of Transition-stage components—precepted experience, skill/demonstrations/practice, reflective sessions, and experience/observations in other departments—were frequently cited in this study and in the nursing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945911415555">Duchscher, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945911415555">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945911415555">Hurst &amp; Koplin-Baucum, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0193945911415555">Young, Stuenkel, &amp; Bawel-Brinkley, 2008</xref>) The precepted, situated learning, or cognitive apprenticeship is well developed; is theory based with clearly articulated goals, activities, and expected role performance; and is cited as the most effective component of the Transition stage.</p>
<p>More nurse interviewees—NRLNs, experienced nurses, and managers—identified the two different stages of professional socialization than were reflected in the RPQs. The two stages were clearly differentiated in RPQ goals, themes, and expected role performances in only 4 of the 34 hospitals.</p>
<p>Many NRPs included components generally found in the Integration stage of professional socialization—reflective practice/debriefing sessions, identification of dilemmas and issues of concern, clinical coaching/mentoring presentations, and discussion sessions. The latter were identified as the most helpful and effective components of integration, but there remains much confusion regarding roles, particularly that of mentors. Goals, objectives, and expected role performances were less clearly articulated in the Integration stage than they were in Transition stage.</p>
<p>The 330 NLRNs in the 20 site-visited hospitals had extensive academic, clinical, and/or work experiences. Almost half had nurse aide/technician, capstone, and/or externship experiences. A total of 40% had worked for 2 years or more in another profession or occupation prior to entering nursing. Almost 30% had earned a degree in another field or discipline before nursing. Moreover, more than a third volunteered their services on a regular basis in some health-related field of benefit to society. Utilization of this wealth of school and life experiences could well enrich the Reflective practice sessions essential to resolution of dilemmas and issues of concern faced by NLRNs when they transition from sheltered care of one or two patients to the care and management of clinical situations for <italic>multiple</italic> patients.</p>
<p>Based on the following evidence, 3 months is a useful benchmark for NLRN achievement of Transition-stage goals and role performance. Transition programs in 16 hospitals where this stage was coterminus with length of NRP, averaged 3.25 months. In 15 of the 18 Transition- + Integration-stage hospitals where NRPs were at least 2 months longer than the precepted experience, length of Transition stage was 3 months. In 9 of the 17 NRPs reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0193945911415555">Park and Jones (2010)</xref> where length of Transition stage equaled length of NRP, NRPs ranged from 2 to 5 months with a mean of 3 months.</p>
<p>NLRNs were about evenly divided in their citations of the benefits and drawbacks of multiple preceptors. Number and qualities of preceptors per NLRN should be related to the goals of the precepted experience. If the goal is guidance and support in putting theory into practice, mastery of manual–technical and critical thinking skills, and provision of safe, quality care to patients, then professional competence and skill in teaching should be the major criteria for selection. If there are many expert clinicians on the unit who desire to precept, then number of preceptors per NLRN would be based on secondary goals that may vary among NRPs. Of importance is that these goals be explained to NLRNs.</p>
<p>Many NLRNs, experienced nurses, and nurse manager interviewees indicated that “becoming a fully functioning, professional nurse” is a two-step process. The goals of each step are different. In Transition, the goal is competence in the total care of one or two patients. During the Integration stage, NLRNs must demonstrate competency in the dominant role of the professional nurse in hospitals. This entails mastery of both the Simultaneity—provision of quality care and management of complex, clinical situations for multiple patients—(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945911415555">Ebright, Patterson, Chalko, &amp; Render, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0193945911415555">Kramer, Schmalenberg, &amp; Maguire, 2010</xref>) and Compression Complexities—multiple peripheral roles demanded of professional, compressed by time—(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0193945911415555">Krichbaum et al., 2007</xref>). The simultaneity complexity is unique to professional nursing practice in hospitals, whereas compression complexity is a challenge to all health care professionals. Increasingly, nurse leaders are recognizing the need for a different kind of support after the Transition stage and are rising to this challenge by reevaluating their NRPs and instituting appropriate changes and additions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0193945911415555">Nelson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0193945911415555">Ulrich, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Integration-stage goals, components, and expected role performance of NLRNs as well as clinical coaches and mentors must be clearly articulated. The mentor role is crucial in self-/career development and improvement, but, if introduced too early and not adequately explained, it leads to additional NLRN stress and might also be a waste of valuable resources. Wise use of resources is a key determinant as to when to effectively introduce the mentor role into NRPs. The use of the same name for multiple roles (e.g., preceptor–mentor) is also very confusing for NLRNs and should be avoided.</p>
<p>NLRNs and experienced-nurse interviewees in several NRPs, where joint coaching/mentoring sessions were the main component of the Integration stage, made a suggestion worthy of consideration. They advised that coaches focus primarily on the dominant nurse role (care and management of clinical situations for multiple patients) and on the use of evidence-based practice to plan and provide such care. Mentors should highlight the importance and necessity of integrating teaching, leadership skills, and evidence-based management practice in resolving dilemmas and reflective practice issues.</p>
<p>The importance of “rites of passage” symbols—full staffing assignments, graduation ceremonies, and on-call assignments—in signifying goal achievement and movement from one stage to another must be recognized. It is suggested that NRP outcomes by stages of socialization be evaluated. Length of the Integration stage in nursing has not been empirically established, although the length of NRPs with demarcated Transition and Integration stages would seem to indicate achievement of Integration-stage goals within 9 months after completion of the Transition stage (total of 1 year). A longer period of time may be required for integration into specialty practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945911415555">Halfer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0193945911415555">Shanahan &amp; Warren, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0193945911415555">Warren, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945911415555">Hurst and Koplin-Baucum (2003)</xref> reported that nurses resign within the 1st year if they are unable to assimilate, identify, and integrate clinically, socially, and professionally. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0193945911415555">Thomka (2001)</xref> noted that lack of support during each stage of professional socialization positively impacts nurse job and career retention. These proposed relationships between stages of socialization and outcomes (perceptual, developmental, and retention) need to be empirically studied. It is only in this way can the true cost-effectiveness and organizational transformation power of NRPs be established.</p>
<p>The organizational transformation power of NRPs could be further developed if nurse leaders refocused their perceptions of NRPs as extended job orientations to conceptualizing them as professional socialization processes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0193945911415555">Park and Jones (2010)</xref> stated that the
<disp-quote>
<p>Goal of an orientation program is to prepare new graduates to be confident and to provide competent and safe patient care . . . Hospitals must make efforts to provide safe and effective environments that foster the integration of graduate nurses into their systems. (p. 142)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>While necessary and laudable, achievement of organizational socialization goals alone is not enough. Patient acuity, complexity, and shortened length of stay require professional nursing practice and commitment to the profession as well as to the employing organization. Hospitals earn the commitment of professional practitioners through provision of professional practice environments that enable professionals to collaborate in providing effective, professional care. Nurse leaders and educators must shift from the 2-stage “Training–Orientation” model to the 3-stage “Scientific/educational preparation–Guided role transition–Integration into professional roles/communities” model.</p>
<p>Increasingly, more and more NLRNs are entering professional practice with professional academic preparation. Almost 80% of the NLRNs in this study had earned baccalaureate, and 5% had earned master’s degrees. NRPs provide excellent Transition-stage professional socialization. In more than half of the 34 hospitals, the full professional socialization process was in effect. This doesn’t mean that improvements in current NRPs are not warranted. The 907 nurses practicing their profession on 174 clinical units with confirmed healthy work environments provided many descriptions of processes and activities that were helpful and instrumental in the NLRN socialization process. These provide direction and opportunity for nurse leaders to initiate and improve NRPs and to continue the significant organizational transformation that these programs have stimulated.</p>

<p>The labels most frequently used to describe Newly Licensed Registered Nurse (NLRN)-specific clinical orientation programs are intern, residency, or new graduate program. Internships usually designate programs in a specialty area such as Intensive Care or Children. In this article, Nurse Residency Program (NRP) will be used to designate all NLRN-specific clinical orientation programs.</p>
