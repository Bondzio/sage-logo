<abstract>
<p>Using a nationally representative sample of 3,058 junior high school students in Taiwan, this study examines a model of how personal traits, family factors, and school dynamics influence school violence committed by students against students and teachers. This model proposed that school violence is directly influenced by personal traits, victimization, and parental monitoring as well as indirectly influenced by personal traits, victimization, and parental monitoring mediated through school engagement, risky peers, and student–teacher relationship. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the theoretical model. The model showed a good fit for the sample as a whole. Similar findings were also found between male and female students. Overall findings suggested that negative personal traits, victimization, and parental monitoring have direct influence on school violence as well as indirect influence mediated through school variables. Implications for theory, policy and practice, and recommendation for future research are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of publications on risk factors for school violence in Western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0044118X12448145">Bosworth, Espelage, &amp; Simon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0044118X12448145">Connolly &amp; O’Moore, 2003</xref>). By contrast, large-scale representative data on risk factors in Asia remain limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0044118X12448145">Chen &amp; Astor, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0044118X12448145">2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X12448145">2010</xref>). There is almost no evidence that the theoretical assumptions from school violence studies in Western countries are relevant to Asian cultures, although significant differences exist between the East and West regarding beliefs and perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0044118X12448145">Nisbett, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, many studies have examined how students’ personal, family, and school experiences that act as “risk factors” directly affect student violence against their school peers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0044118X12448145">Baldry, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X12448145">Chen, &amp; Astor, 2010</xref>). Few studies have focused on how risk factors contribute to school violence against teachers, that are committed by students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0044118X12448145">Khoury-Kassabri, Astor, &amp; Benbenishty, 2009</xref>). Even less is known about organizational or school variables that could be mediators between personal traits, victimization, family factors, and school violence. There is a paucity of empirical evidence that investigates how gender influences patterns of relationships between risk factors and school violence. Using the nationally representative data from an Asian culture, this study will examine if school factors mediate between personal traits and family factors, and school violence perpetration committed by students against peers and teachers in Taiwanese junior high school.</p>
<p>Taiwan is one Asian society where long-standing cultural values and outside influences must be considered simultaneously when examining the relationships between risk factors and school violence. The nation has experienced democratization, rapid industrialization and urbanization, a growing population of immigrants from other Asian countries, and an expanding economy over the past four decades. These factors obviously influence social values and norms. Yet, the Taiwanese are still partially guided by values stemming from a blend of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0044118X12448145">Nisbett, 2003</xref>). Although school violence issues have been a major public concern for many years, for political reasons (China’s lack of recognition of Taiwan as an independent country) Taiwan has never been part of any large-scale cross-national studies on these topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0044118X12448145">Akiba, LeTendre, Baker, &amp; Goesling, 2002</xref>). Yet from an empirical perspective, Taiwan represents a modern, industrial, capitalistic, and pro-Western democracy that is currently and historically part of Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Recently, a handful of published studies have indicated that school violence is far more severe in junior high school than other school types (e.g., elementary school and high school) in Taiwan and suggested immediate attention should be paid to design an effective intervention to alleviate school violence in junior high school (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0044118X12448145">Chen &amp; Astor, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0044118X12448145">2009b</xref>). Furthermore, researchers and school practitioners have argued that effective school violence intervention programs should address specific needs for junior high school students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0044118X12448145">Chen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0044118X12448145">Chen &amp; Astor, 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0044118X12448145">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0044118X12448145">Hu &amp; Lin, 2001</xref>) because previous literature and theories suggested that student psychosocial development, the educational purposes, and school structure in junior high school appear to differ from other types of schools (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0044118X12448145">Astor, Meyer, Benbenishty, Marachi, &amp; Rosemond, 2005</xref>). Thus, this study focuses on examining the patterns of relationships among risk factors in this specific context of junior high school. We believe this kind of examination could provide educators, school psychologist, and social workers with meaningful information to design systematic prevention and intervention programs aiming at mitigating school violence in junior high school in Taiwan.</p>
<p>School violence in this study refers to student perpetration intending to harm other students and teachers or to cause damage to belongings or school property. The definition includes physical and verbal violence, psychological harm, threatening behavior, and property damage. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0044118X12448145">Astor, Benbenishty, Pitner, &amp; Zeira, 2004</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0044118X12448145">Benbenishty &amp; Astor, 2005</xref> for a critical discussion).</p>

<title>Factors Associated With School Violence: East and West</title>
<p>Western studies on school violence clearly indicate that students’ negative personal traits (i.e., aggressive attitudes, poor anger traits, and lack of impulsive control—<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0044118X12448145">Byrne, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0044118X12448145">Connolly &amp; O’Moore, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0044118X12448145">McConville &amp; Cornell, 2003</xref>), low parental monitoring and involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0044118X12448145">Baldry &amp; Farrington, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0044118X12448145">Rigby, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0044118X12448145">1994</xref>), prior victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0044118X12448145">Baldry, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0044118X12448145">Flannery, Wester, &amp; Singer, 2004</xref>), poor school engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0044118X12448145">Haynie et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0044118X12448145">Nansel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0044118X12448145">Natvig, Albrektsen, &amp; Qvarnstrom, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0044118X12448145">Slee, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0044118X12448145">Slee &amp; Rigby, 1993</xref>), risky peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0044118X12448145">Huttunen, Salmivalli, &amp; Lagerspetz, 1996</xref>), and poor interaction with teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0044118X12448145">Junger-Tas, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0044118X12448145">Olweus, 1999</xref>) are strongly associated with school violence.</p>
<p>Empirical studies in Taiwan or other Asian countries have shown that student violence against students in junior high school was related to students’ negative personal traits, parental monitoring, and victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0044118X12448145">Chen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X12448145">Chen &amp; Astor, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0044118X12448145">Hu &amp; Lin, 2001</xref>), poor school engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0044118X12448145">Ando, Asakura, Simons-Morton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X12448145">Chen &amp; Astor, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0044118X12448145">Hu &amp; Lin, 2001</xref>), risky peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0044118X12448145">Ando et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X12448145">Chen &amp; Astor, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0044118X12448145">Hu &amp; Lin, 2001</xref>), and poor interaction with teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X12448145">Chen &amp; Astor, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0044118X12448145">Hu &amp; Lin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0044118X12448145">Ma, Shek, Cheung, &amp; Tam, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0044118X12448145">Wong, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0044118X12448145">Yoneyama &amp; Naito, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, some smaller scale studies in Taiwan have shown that negative personal traits, parental involvement, victimization, and risky behavior in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0044118X12448145">Chen, 1999</xref>), school climate and school engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0044118X12448145">Chen, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0044118X12448145">1999</xref>), and poor student–teacher relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0044118X12448145">Huang &amp; Hsien, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0044118X12448145">Lin, 1986</xref>) were related to student violence against teachers in junior high schools. Because these studies are convenience samples, it is not clear how generalizable these findings are for Asian culture contexts such as Taiwan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a review of the literature indicates that most previous studies on school violence have examined, only in separate studies, how students’ experiences in each ecological context independently affect perpetration of school violence. How multiple ecological risk factors and nested contexts influence student violence against students and teachers has not yet been explored much in either the West or the East.</p>

<title>School Variables as Mediators</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0044118X12448145">Benbenishty and Astor (2005)</xref> recently addressed the lack of theoretical integration surrounding the contexts of school violence. They propose a theoretical model of school violence that is influenced by numerous within-school variables such as school engagement and school interpersonal relationships, and other external variables such as students’ personal and family characteristics. In their heuristic model, the influence of external variables on school violence can be mediated by school factors. In contrast with psychological models that center around the individual, they stress that the school itself as a social context should be the center of the theoretical model.</p>
<p>This model has been examined in case of school victimization across different cultures with Jewish Secular, Jewish Orthodox, Arabic, and American students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0044118X12448145">Astor, Benbenishty, Vinokur, &amp; Zeira, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0044118X12448145">Astor, Benbenishty, Zeira, &amp; Vinokur, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0044118X12448145">Benbenishty &amp; Astor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0044118X12448145">Benbenishty, Astor, Zeira, &amp; Vinokur, 2002</xref>). However, little research has been published with this theoretical orientation on perpetration of school violence (for an example of one, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0044118X12448145">Khoury-Kassabri et al., 2009</xref>). This study examines how these complex patterns between social contexts affect perpetration of school violence in Asian junior high schools. Empirical evidence that establish the degree to which school variables mediate or contribute to perpetration in Asian junior high schools is sorely needed.</p>

<title>Background of Junior High School in Taiwan</title>
<p>Generally, there are three major systems of basic and intermediate education in Taiwan: elementary school (Grades 1 to 6), junior high school (Grades 7 to 9), and high school (Grades 10 to 12). Attending a 9-year compulsory education program from elementary to junior high school is mandatory. A competitive high school entrance exam must be taken if junior high school graduates seek higher education. In 2006, there were about 1.0 million students in 732 junior high schools in Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0044118X12448145">Taiwan Ministry of Education, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, the educational purpose and school structure in junior high school appear to differ from other types of schools. In general, the main goal in junior high school is to prepare the student for a competitive joint high school entrance exam to enter the best high school and, subsequently, college. Thus, academic achievement is highly emphasized in junior high school. In this respect, junior high schools in Taiwan function more similarly to private preparatory schools in the West. While Western students often have multiple teachers with different students in each class, Taiwanese students remain in the same class with the same cohort of students for 3 years, and a homeroom teacher is assigned to each class. The main responsibility of the homeroom teacher is to help students achieve higher academic performance. Teachers are perceived as intellectual experts, and each subject is taught by one specialized teacher in that field. Thus, teachers in academic fields rotate from class to class. To achieve the highest status, most junior high schools encourage teachers to design innovative programs or conduct mock tests to help students succeed. Outstanding teachers are recognized publicly if their class has a high admissions rate for academic high schools.</p>

<sec id="section5-0044118X12448145">
<title>Theoretical Model for Current Study</title>
<p>Based on the above analysis, a model was developed for examining how school variables mediate between personal traits, family experiences, and school violence. Based on previous literature and theory, this study proposes that the perpetration of school violence by students against peers and/or teachers is directly associated with negative personal traits, parental monitoring, victimization, low level of school engagement, risky peers, and poor student–teacher relationships. Most important, in contrast with prior theoretical conceptions of school violence, this model proposes that low level of school engagement, risky peers, and poor student–teacher relationship mediate the association between variables external to the school (i.e., negative personal traits, parental monitoring, and prior victimization experiences) and school violence perpetration. The hypothesis is centered on the theoretical framework put forth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0044118X12448145">Benbenishty and Astor (2005)</xref> that school variables play a significant role that go beyond individual and family experiences.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-0044118X12448145" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The data used in this study was part of a large-scale project of “Prevention and Control of School Violence in Taiwan” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0044118X12448145">Wu, Lee, Yin, &amp; Hu, 2000</xref>). The survey was conducted throughout Taiwan among over 14,000 students from elementary schools (Grades 4 to 6), junior high schools (Grades 7 to 9), vocational high schools, and academic high schools (Grades 10 to 12). Students were given a structured questionnaire in classrooms under the guidance of professionally trained survey monitors. Respondents were assured of anonymity and were encouraged to respond truthfully. Participants were free to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reasons. This study was supported by Taiwan’s National Science Council (NSC). The questionnaires, procedures, informed consent forms, and other ethical concerns were reviewed and supervised by Taiwan’s NSC.</p>
<p>This sample was designed to represent all students from 4th to 12th grades in Taiwan. The students’ response rate was over 98%. The probability sampling method was a two-stage stratified cluster sample. The strata were northern/central/southern/eastern, urban/rural, and elementary/junior/technical/academic. In this article, only junior high school students, Grades 7 to 9, were selected for this study. In first stage, schools were randomly selected from the sampling frame according to those appropriate strata. In the next stage, two classes were randomly selected according to each grade in selected schools. All students in that class were included in sample.</p>
<p>This study examined 3,058 students from 16 junior high schools (Grades 7 to 9). About 48.2% of the students were boys, 49.5% were girls, and 2.3% did not indicate gender; the grade-level distribution was as follows: 30.8% of the students were in seventh grade, 33.9% in eighth grade, 35% in ninth grade, and 0.2% did not indicate grade.</p>
<p>The questionnaire was developed on the basis of current school violence studies and theories from both Taiwan and Western countries, and validated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0044118X12448145">Wu and colleagues (2000)</xref>. It included over 150 items in eight domains regarding students’ basic demographic background and other information in their personal, family, and school experience. Each of the student questionnaires took approximately 30 minutes to complete. Before this survey was conducted, the Mandarin Chinese questionnaire was adjusted and adapted based on two pilot studies conducted in the Tainan metropolitan areas in Taiwan.</p>
<sec id="section7-0044118X12448145">
<title>Measurement</title>
<p>To measure the latent variables in our model, several scales containing a number of subscales were constructed. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0044118X12448145">Table 1</xref> represents the means and standard deviations of the variables included in the model, broken down by genders. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0044118X12448145">Table 2</xref> represents the intercorrelations matrix among the variables. For the purpose of structural equation modeling analyses, several subscales were constructed based on conceptual and theoretical constructs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0044118X12448145">Table 3</xref> lists the domains, questions items, factor loadings, and alphas for the theoretically created subscales.

<title>Analytical Plan</title>
<p>The primary analysis method in this study is latent variables structural equations modeling (SEM) with maximum likelihood estimation using AMOs program. Confirmative factor analysis (CFAs) was first to be conducted to ensure the measurement model as a good fit. Following the CFAs, the final SEM model including the full dataset of all junior high school students was tested. In addition, comparative analyses were conducted to determine whether patterns of relationships and mediating effects are different between male and female students.</p>
<p>The chi-square coefficient has often been used to assess if the data fit the theoretical model. However, due to the sensitivity of the chi-square coefficient to sample size, it is not a preferred fit index for large samples such as those in this study. Indeed, researchers have addressed the chi-square limitation by developing goodness-of-fit indices that take a more pragmatic approach to the evaluation process. More commonly used fit indices include <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0044118X12448145">Bentler and Bonnett’s (1980)</xref> Normed Fit Index (NFI), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X12448145">Bollen’s (1989)</xref> Incremental Fit Index (IFI), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X12448145">Bentler’s (1990)</xref> Compared Fit Index (CFI). Typically, these three fit indices consider a model to be a good fit when the value is above .90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0044118X12448145">Bentler, 1992</xref>), and a superior fit when it is close to .95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0044118X12448145">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>). A common misfit measure, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSEA), is also reported in the SEM analysis. The RMSEA considers a mediocre fit to range from .08 to .10 and a good fit to be below .06 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0044118X12448145">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1999</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0044118X12448145">Figure 1</xref> shows that student violence against students is directly influenced by students’ negative personal traits (β = .24) and prior victimization (β = .24). The variable of risky peers has stronger mediating effects than student–teacher relationships and school engagement on student violence against students for negative personal traits and victimization. By contrast, student violence against teachers is not strongly influenced by negative personal traits (β = .05), parental monitoring (β = .02), and victimization (β = .09). Instead, student violence against teachers is indirectly influenced by negative personal traits and victimization through the strongest mediating variable of risky peers. Student violence against teachers is also indirectly influenced by negative personal traits, parental monitoring, and victimization through the mediating variable of poor student–teacher relationships. Poor student–teacher relationship has a small but important mediating impact on violence against teachers. Together, all of these variables accounted for around one half of the explained variance for student violence against students (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>= .49) and around one third for student violence against teachers (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .32).</p>

<title>Gender Analysis</title>
<p>The gender analysis of this study focused on the inquiry of whether the same theoretical model was applicable to the samples of male and female students. In this analysis, factor loadings, the paths, and the covariances are constrained to be equal to fit the covariance matrices of the male and female subgroups simultaneously to the same model. The analysis provided a good fit to the data, χ<sup>2</sup>(492, <italic>N</italic>: male = 1,475, female = 1,514) = 2,303.46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and with NFI = .92, IFI = .93, CFI = .93, and RMSEA = .04. Thus, the same theoretical model fit the data from both genders well.</p>
<p>Next, the model was tested to find out if releasing equality constraints on the paths could significantly improve the fit. After releasing path constraints one at a time, it was determined that the release of the constraints between negative personal traits and risky peers, between victimization and low level of school engagement, and between victimization and student violence against students yield a significantly better fit to the model; thus, the results for the final model with the three constraints released together were χ<sup>2</sup> (489, <italic>N</italic>: male = 1,475, female = 1,514) = 2259.95, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and with NFI = .92, IFI = .94, CFI = .94, and RMSEA = .04.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0044118X12448145">Figure 2</xref> represents the results of the gender analysis. The beta coefficients for both male and female models exhibit remarkable similarity. However, victimization has stronger direct effect on student violence against students for female students than males (β = .21 for boys vs. β = .29 for girls). By contrast, the strength of the relationship between victimization and low level of school engagement (β = .10 for boys vs. β = .02 for girls) as well as relationship between negative personal traits and risky peers (β = .57 for boys vs. β = .46 for girls) are stronger for male students. Among all factors, the factor of risky peers is the best predictor of both types of school violence for male and female students. Overall, the theoretical model explains a similar proportion of the variance of student violence against students (44% for boys and 49% for girls) and student violence against teachers (31% for boys and 33% for girls) for both genders.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on the nationally representative sample in Taiwan, this study was conducted using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0044118X12448145">Benbenishty and Astor’s (2005)</xref> theoretical orientation to examine how the complex patterns of factors within and outside of the school affect school violence perpetration committed by students against teachers and students in Asian junior high schools. In addition to direct effects, this study proposed that external school variables would have indirect effects on school violence mediated through within-school variables. This study also expected that the model fit male and female junior high school students, but certain paths within the model may differ.</p>
<p>The results of this study show that negative personal traits and victimization not only had a direct influence on student violence against students, but also had an indirect influence mediated through risky peers. In addition, the results show that negative personal traits, parental monitoring, and victimization have weak direct effects on student violence against teachers, but have indirect influence on violence against teachers mediated through risky peers and poor student–teacher relationships. These findings support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0044118X12448145">Benbenishty and Astor’s (2005)</xref> theoretical model that school violence is influenced by a combination of numerous within-school and external-school variables, and within-school variables can mediate contributions from external contexts. These mediation findings also provide empirical evidence to support the school environment as a unique developmental setting to school violence compared with other normative environments such as community and home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0044118X12448145">Astor et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0044118X12448145">Benbenishty et al., 2002</xref>). According to this study, to better understand school perpetration in junior high school, it is important to understand the school context such as how students interact with their school peers and teachers. Our findings also indicate that school perpetration is a unique and context-bounded form of interpersonal violence that should be addressed separately from perpetration in other social developmental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0044118X12448145">Benbenishity &amp; Astor, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, the findings of this model indicate that the variable of risky peer group influences on school grounds showed stronger mediating effects than poor student–teacher relationships and low level of school engagement. These findings imply that school risky peers play a more important role in school context in school perpetration among Taiwanese junior high school students. It is possible that Taiwanese collectivistic culture stresses that individual interests should be subordinated to peer group norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0044118X12448145">Triandis, 1995</xref>). If some Taiwanese junior high school students are alienated due to personal, family, and community experiences, they may then choose to affiliate with risky peers at school. These risky friends may influence them to engage more frequently in school violence. However, this dynamic may not be unique to Taiwan or Asian cultures. The findings also mirror previous theories and research findings suggesting that peer influence is more important than adults to influence adolescent psychosocial and behavioral development (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0044118X12448145">Benbenishty &amp; Astor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0044118X12448145">Papalia, Olds, &amp; Feldman, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, the findings of this study indicate that the variable of poor student–teacher relationships is a significant mediator between external factors and student violence against teachers. However, this is not the case for student violence against students. The quality of interaction between student and teacher plays a more important mediating role in the context of student violence against teachers than student violence against students. It may be that Taiwanese junior high school students’ aggressive acts toward teachers are more impulsive or emotional reactions to some perceived frustration when interacting with teachers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0044118X12448145">Chen &amp; Astor, 2009</xref>). This kind of emotional reaction to teachers was not reflected in their aggressive acts toward their peers.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, low levels of school engagement showed the weakest and almost zero mediational effect to both types of school violence. These are unexpected findings because this variable is an important factor of school violence in previous Western literature and theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0044118X12448145">Natvig et al., 2001</xref>). An explanation for this finding may be due to the comprehensive model, sample, and data-analysis approach in the present study (e.g., other studies are based on smaller convenience samples). Another possible explanation may be a relatively high level of school engagement and stressful academic environment in Asian junior high schools, compared with the Western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X12448145">Chen &amp; Astor, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0044118X12448145">Jang, 2002</xref>). These possibilities should be further explored in future comparative studies.</p>
<p>This study shows that the influence of the personal, family and school variables in this model account for a relatively large amount of the explained variance for student violence against students and student violence against teachers. To maximize effectiveness of school violence intervention programs, interventions must integrate personal, family, and school-level approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0044118X12448145">Ahmed &amp; Braithwaite, 2004</xref>). The findings suggest that interventions for junior high school students in Taiwan should be targeted toward reducing personal victimization and increasing the quality of peers and student–teacher relationships. Interventions focusing on students’ involvement with at-risk peers may lead to the greatest reduction of student violence against students and teachers.</p>
<p>The results show that the overall theoretical model is applicable across both genders. This finding suggests that although male students have higher rates of perpetration in school violence than females, how male and female students’ personal, family, and school experiences affect student violence against students and teachers are quite similar. This finding also indicates that school violence interventions or policy incorporated at a national level could be effective across genders. However, it is interesting to note that students’ negative personal traits have stronger influence on risky peers for males than females. This suggests the variable of negative personal traits has stronger indirect influence for male students on student violence against students and teachers mediated through risky peers. The findings imply that interventions aimed at improving students’ negative personal traits would reduce student violence against students and teachers and would be more likely to affect male students. In addition, female prior victimization has a stronger impact on student violence against students. The finding suggests that interventions aimed at decreasing victimization would reduce student violence against students and would be more effective for female students than for male students.</p>
<p>The overall results of this study show that most of the same relationships between risk factors and school violence reported in studies from Western countries are also found in Asian cultural contexts, especially in Taiwan. The findings provide useful information for school policy makers or clinicians, who are interested in developing new internationally based school-violence prevention and intervention strategies.</p>
<p>Finally, there are some limitations that need to be considered. First, the investigation in this study is cross-sectional. The results of this study may not be used to establish cause-effect inference, which may require longitudinal data. Second, the self-reporting characteristic of the data and the 12-month reporting window may have resulted in students underreporting events due to poor memory or overreporting violent behavior that they assume to be commonplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0044118X12448145">Benbenishty &amp; Astor, 2005</xref>). Future researchers will benefit from collecting information from additional sources such as teacher, parents, or peer reports. Also, future research could apply this theoretical model in other countries to further confirm the similarities or differences across cultures in school violence findings.</p>
