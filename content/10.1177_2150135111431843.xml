<italic>Objective</italic>: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) initiated with high oxygen levels may expose cyanotic children to reoxygenation injury. The ideal method of initiation of bypass to prevent this phenomenon still remains largely unproven. This study tested the hypothesis that controlling oxygenation during initiation of CPB improves early postoperative outcomes. <italic>Methods</italic>: Thirty-one cyanotic children were randomized to two treatment arms of the study. In group A (intervention), CPB was initiated with fraction of inspired oxygen (F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub>) 0.21, and after one minute of full bypass, F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub> was increased at increments of 0.1 per minute to reach 0.6. In group B (hyperoxemic), CPB was initiated using F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub> &gt;0.6. Aortic cross clamp time (minutes), CPB time (minutes), creatine phosphokinase-MB (CPK-MB) levels (U/L), lactate levels (mmol/L), duration of ventilator support (hours), inotropic support (hours), and intensive care unit (ICU) stay (hours) as well as hospital mortality were measured. <italic>Results</italic>: Levels of CPK-MB (group A mean = 59.6 U/L, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 45.9-73.3; group B mean = 82.6 U/L, 95% CI: 66.1-99.1, <italic>P</italic> = .016) and ventilation time (group A median = 16.5 hours; interquartile range [IQR] = 11.25-23; group B median = 27.5 hours; IQR = 17-54, <italic>P</italic> = .045) were significantly lower in the intervention group. Other parameters showed no significant differences: CPB time (group A median = 71.5 minutes, IQR = 64-100; group B median = 95.5 minutes, IQR = 58-145, <italic>P</italic> = .71), cross clamp time (group A mean = 59.2 minutes, 95% CI: 47.6-70.8; group B mean = 66.57 minutes, 95% CI: 47.6-88.5, <italic>P</italic> =.57), lactate levels (mmol/L; group A median = 1.8, IQR = 1.48-2.59; group B median = 2.1, IQR = 1.29-2.62, <italic>P</italic> = 1), inotropic support (group A median = 47.5 hours, IQR = 36-73.75; group B median = 59.5 hours, IQR = 41.75-92.5, <italic>P</italic> = .27), ICU stay (group A median = 59.5 hours, IQR = 48.25-118.5; group B median = 85 hours, IQR = 47.75-137.50, <italic>P</italic> = .21), and mortality (group A n = 2, group B n = 2). <italic>Conclusion</italic>: A controlled oxygenation protocol was associated with significantly lower postoperative CPK-MB levels.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Repair of cyanotic congenital heart disease is increasingly performed in young infants and children. Despite technical improvements, postoperative low cardiac output is still a major problem. It may be attributable in part to reoxygenation injury, which may occur during initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) when it is used in a routine hyperoxemic fashion.<sup>

</sup> Experimental studies in hypoxic immature piglets have suggested that reoxygenation injury occurs with the onset of high oxygen supply during CPB, leading to free radical production, lipid peroxidation, impaired post-bypass contractility, and impaired pulmonary function.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111431843">7</xref>
</sup> The reoxygenation injury has been attenuated in hypoxic immature piglets by initiating CPB with ambient partial pressure of oxygen (P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>), use of antioxidants, or with use of leukocyte filtration.<sup>

<p>Evidence of human myocardial oxygen-free radical injury has been shown in right ventricular biopsy specimens during elective repair of tetrology of Fallot (TOF) even before cross clamping the aorta.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135111431843">10</xref>
</sup> Studies in cyanotic children have shown decreased antioxidant reserve capacity and increased generation of oxygen-free radicals as well as elevated inflammatory markers in response to initiation of hyperoxemic CPB.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111431843">11</xref>
</sup> In clinical studies, reduction of these effects has been achieved by initiating bypass at lower oxygen concentrations, using leukocyte filtration or by maintaining normoxemia during the entire period of CPB.<sup>

</sup> In recent years, reoxygenation injury has been demonstrated in other organ systems and may represent a whole body phenomenon rather than a cardiac-specific phenomenon. Hepatic reoxygenation injury has been demonstrated in experimental animal models.<sup>

</sup> Elevated s100 levels in cyanotic children compared to acyanotic children undergoing hyperoxemic CPB were shown in an observational study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135111431843">15</xref>
</sup> Hyperoxemic CPB in cyanotic children was associated with increased s100 and α-glutamate transferase release compared to normoxemic CPB, suggesting cerebral and hepatic injury.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111431843">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>However, the ideal method of initiation of CPB to prevent reoxygenation injury and associated clinical outcomes in terms of reduced morbidity and mortality remain largely unproven. We tested the hypothesis that controlling oxygenation during initiation of bypass can improve immediate postoperative outcomes in cyanotic children undergoing cardiac surgery.</p>

<title>Patients and Methods</title>
<p>Thirty-one pediatric patients (&lt;13 years of age) scheduled to undergo elective repair of cyanotic congenital heart diseases (only patients with room air saturation &lt;85% were included) in Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research were randomized into group A (intervention) and group B (hyperoxemic). All patients were in stable condition without preoperative ventilatory or inotropic support. Patients with prematurity, genetic syndromes, preoperative inotropic support or ventilatory support, and reoperative procedures were excluded from the study. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the institution. Informed consent was obtained from parents of the patients. Permuted block randomization with block size of four was used. Except for the clinical perfusion technologists, who operated the CPB machinery, the surgical team and the critical care physicians in the intensive care unit (ICU) were blinded with respect to the treatment groups.</p>
<p>All operations were performed under CPB. After induction of anesthesia, all patients were ventilated using a fraction of inspired oxygen (F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub>) of 0.60. Cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated using standard aorto-bicaval cannulation. A membrane oxygenator (Minimax Plus, Medtronic Inc, Heerleen, The Netherlands) and a nonpulsatile roller pump were used. The bypass circuit was primed with blood or occasionally with clear prime depending on the patient’s body weight and hemoglobin level.</p>
<p>Cold (4°C-6°C) St Thomas 1 blood cardioplegia solution was administered every 20 minutes during aortic cross clamping. After the operation, all patients were managed in the ICU by critical care physicians.</p>
<p>The oxygenation strategy associated with initiation of CPB for the two groups were as follows:</p>
<p>group A (intervention)—oxygenation on CPB was controlled in a graded manner by initiating CPB with an F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of 0.21. Blood prime was circulated with room air prior to initiation of bypass. After one minute of full bypass, F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub> was increased at increments of 0.10 per minute to reach an F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of 0.60 at five minutes. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis was done at five minutes and F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub> was adjusted to maintain an arterial P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> in the range of 200 to 300 mm Hg. If the aortic cross clamp was applied during the initial five minutes of the staged step-up process, then cardioplegia solution was delivered using blood from the oxygenator at the F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub> currently in use. Thus, the oxygen content of the cardioplegia solution was variable, depending on the amount of time that transpired following initiation of CPB until the application of the aortic cross clamp.</p>
<p>Group B (hyperoxemic)—oxygenation on CPB was initiated in a hyperoxemic fashion with an F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of &gt;0.6. Blood prime was circulated with F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub> &gt; 0.6. After five minutes of full bypass an ABG determination was done and F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub> was adjusted to maintain arterial P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> in the range of 200 to 300 mm Hg.</p>
<sec id="section3-2150135111431843">
<title>Measurements</title>
<p>Intraoperative characteristics (CPB time, cross clamp time), biochemical parameters (creatine phosphokinase-MB [CPK-MB] levels at 16 hours after reaching ICU and serum lactate levels in ICU), and immediate postoperative clinical outcomes (duration of inotropic support, duration of ventilatory support, duration ICU stay, and in-hospital mortality) were recorded. The timing of multiple postoperative samples for serum lactate level determination in the ICU was directed by the critical care team based on the condition of the patient. The mean/median lactate levels were ascertained for each individual patient. The duration of inotropic support was the time interval during which the patient received any type of inotropic medications after the operation regardless of the dose. The criteria for weaning from mechanical ventilation were stable hemodynamic status with warm peripheries, no ongoing bleeding, and good muscle power with an acceptable ABG. Adverse events recorded included any obvious neurological injury such as stroke or seizures.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Continuous variables were tested for normality. Normally distributed variables were expressed as means and standard deviations. They were compared between the groups using independent samples <italic>t</italic> test. Variables having skewed distribution were expressed in medians and interquartile range (IQR). They were compared between the groups using Mann-Whitney test (nonparametric test). Categorical outcomes (mortality) were expressed as actual numbers and were not subjected to statistical analysis due to the small number of events. SPSS 16 was used for statistical analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2150135111431843">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Thirty-one patients were randomized. Two patients were disqualified from the study as the assigned protocol for bypass initiation was not followed. These two patients had been randomized to the intervention group. Each experienced acute arterial desaturation on the operating table before going on bypass and the operating surgeon preferred to go on bypass at a high F<sc>io<sub>2</sub>
</sc> level. Among the 29 patients studied, 13 were in group A (intervention) and 16 were in group B (hyperoxemic). Diagnoses included TOF (86%), total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC; 10%), and transposition of the great arteries (TGAs; 3%).

<title>Comment</title>
<p>There is a growing body of experimental and clinical evidence to show that reoxygenation injury does exist and it occurs during hyperoxemic CPB in cyanotic children undergoing cardiac surgery. It produces myocardial free radical injury, decreased post-bypass contractility, impaired pulmonary function, and possible hepatic and cerebral injury.<sup>

</sup> In this study, the protocol of initiating bypass with an F<sc>io</sc>

Levels of CPK-MB have been used by others as a measure of myocardial injury during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150135111431843">17</xref>
</sup> Decreased CPK-MB levels in group A (intervention) in this study suggest decreased myocardial injury. This finding is consistent with previously published results of elevated troponin I levels in cyanotic children undergoing hyperoxemic CPB.<sup>

<p>Decreased postoperative ventilation times in group A (hyperoxemic) may be a manifestation of earlier recovery of myocardial function and normalization of cardiac output as well as better preservation of pulmonary function. Studies in hypoxic immature piglets have demonstrated reduced pulmonary function<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111431843">6</xref>
</sup> in response to hyperoxemic CPB and the clinical demonstration of reduced postoperative ventilation time is in agreement with the previous experimental evidence. While we observed decreased postoperative ventilation times in the intervention group, the difference failed to achieve statistical significance when the analysis was restricted to patients with a diagnosis of TOF.</p>

</list>We evaluated a reoxygenation strategy similar to the second one. However, we chose to increase the oxygen content in a controlled staged manner over five minutes, for the following reasons:<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>During the discussion of protocol selection, there were objections raised over keeping the F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub> levels low for even three to five minutes due to fear of cerebral hypoxia, even though there was a paucity of evidence to support this concern. Moreover, a protocol that keeps F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub> levels low for a prolonged period requires online P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> monitoring and some type of cerebral oxygenation monitoring for safety concerns, which may not be available in all centers. Since we did not have online P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> monitors to instantaneously measure the P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> (which can vary with factors like the oxygenator used) during different F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub> level, we considered it a safe alternative to increase the oxygen levels over a period of five minutes in a staged manner. This strategy addresses concerns in the mind of the surgeon about the possibility of hypoxic injury, making this protocol safe and acceptable even for centers with basic infrastructure.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>It has been shown by Zhu et al that graded reoxygenation by starting bypass at F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub> 21% and increasing it in a staged manner to 60% over five to ten minutes can reduce the extent of reoxygenation injury compared to routine hyperoxic CPB and it is an easy, effective, and safe CPB strategy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135111431843">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Gradual step-up of oxygen level may prevent a sudden burst of oxidative stress and may induce synthesis of endogenous antioxidant enzymes. Studies in cultured myocytes from patients with TOF have shown the regulation of myocardial superoxide dismutase and catalase levels by oxygen tension.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150135111431843">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</list-item>
</list>The main advantages of this protocol are safety (which becomes the primary concern while using any new clinical strategy), simplicity, lack of need for additional equipment, no need for frequent or continuous ABG analysis, and no extra cost. A major shortcoming is the uncertainty as to whether the period of five minutes of gradually increased oxygenation is sufficiently long to reliably achieve the reduction of reoxygentaion injury.</p>
<p>The strategy of initiation of CPB at ambient P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> and delaying reoxygenation to higher oxygen levels until cardioplegic arrest<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150135111431843">18</xref>
</sup> has been associated with decreased lipid peroxidation and improved post-bypass contractility in hypoxic immature piglets. However, we did not prefer this method as it had a potential disadvantage of having an immediate step-up of oxygen levels after cardioplegic arrest. This may be safe for the heart, but the oxygen step-up after cardioplegic arrest may not be beneficial for other organs and this may possibly produce reoxygenation injury to them. Clinical studies showing the benefits of this strategy were also scarce. The third strategy described above has been shown clinically to be associated with reduced myocardial damage, oxidative stress, cerebral injury, and hepatic injury.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135111431843">13</xref>
</sup> But this method requires circulation of extra medical nitrogen to the prime and use of an online P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> monitor to match the P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of the pump prime to the P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> of the patient, potentially adding to cost and complexity. Leukocyte filtration and use of antioxidants in the bypass circuit also involve extra cost and equipment. Therefore, we did not prefer these two strategies.</p>
<p>One particular aspect of this protocol is that the time of cardioplegia delivery is flexible, depending on how much dissection the surgeon prefers to perform on bypass before arresting the heart. This gives total flexibility to the operating surgeon, which is important for the acceptability of any new strategy. If the surgeon prefers to arrest the heart in the initial five minutes after going on bypass, cardioplegia delivery was started at F<sc>io</sc>
<sub>2</sub> between 21% and 60% (depending on the time of cross clamp application) and further graded step-up of oxygen on bypass was continued. The cardioplegia delivery takes a few minutes to complete, during which the oxygen levels in the blood cardioplegia solution also follows the same step-up of the whole body perfusate. The heart also receives a graded oxygenation like all the other cells in the body. It is important to understand that the cardioplegia delivery system gets oxygenated blood from the same oxygenator and the P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> is essentially similar and gets stepped up in the same manner during delivery. The only disadvantage of this method is that in case the surgeon prefers to begin cardioplegia delivery in the initial one to two minutes of bypass (which is usually unlikely) and the amount of cardioplegia delivered is less (as in a small child) and it finishes before five minutes, the heart may not receive the full staged step-up compared to other organs. But, it must be remembered that the heart is never subjected to uncontrolled oxygenation or higher oxygen levels anyway, and we believed that this was enough to protect the heart. As mentioned elsewhere, this protocol was designed to prevent reoxygenation injury to all the cells in the body, as opposed to being cardiac specific. In case the surgeon prefers to do some dissection on bypass and prefers to cross clamp and give cardioplegia after five minutes, the heart as well as the entire body would have already received the full staged step-up of oxygen level on bypass, making it safe to give cardioplegia at the steady P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> levels available at that time. An advantage of this protocol is the flexibility, which makes it more practical and acceptable and does not require any waiting period on bypass, thus saving valuable bypass time. Of course, this leaves us with an important question, whether waiting for the full five minutes before cardioplegia delivery in every case or doing it in a flexible manner like this and completing the staging of oxygen delivery to the heart during cardioplegia delivery is more effective. These answers require further comparative studies.</p>
<p>When we analyzed the time interval between CPB initiation and cross clamping of the aorta and cardioplegia delivery as well as the P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> on CPB at five minutes, there was no statistically significant difference in either P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> or time of cross clamp application between the two groups. We feel therefore that it is unlikely that these factors would have influenced the results. Considering that 46% of patients in group A underwent cross clamping and cardioplegic arrest in the initial five minutes when P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> was relatively low, the beneficial effects of arresting the heart at a lower oxygen levels may also have played a role.<sup>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are several important limitations to this study. One of the factors to be considered in interpreting the results of decreased CPK-MB levels and ventilation times in the intervention group is that three patients in the hyperoxemic group had diagnoses of either TAPVC or TGA, with only one in the intervention group. Such differences may occur in small sample sizes, so to evaluate the effect of this factor on the results, we performed a subgroup analysis considering only TOF patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-2150135111431843">Table 4</xref>). Measured differences in CPK-MB still achieved statistical significance, consistent with decreased myocardial injury in the intervention group. Ventilation time remained lower in the intervention group even though the difference no longer reached statistical significance. We believe that this may still be reflective of better preservation of pulmonary function by the graded oxygenation strategy. The loss of statistical significance of ventilation time may be due to two factors: (1) the larger number of patients with TAPVC or TGA in the intervention group would have influenced the result and (2) the loss of significance may be a beta error due to decreasing sample size. Therefore, the clinical benefit of decreased ventilation time requires a study with a larger sample size for its validation.</p>
<p>Simple measurement of CPK-MB was used to assess myocardial injury rather than serial troponin I levels due to cost concerns. The timing of measurement was chosen to be 16 hours after reaching ICU, as 16 to 18 hours is the time CPK-MB level peaks after an acute myocardial infarction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2150135111431843">20</xref>
</sup> There is no evidence to suggest that it is applicable in this setting. Factors like right ventricular incision and muscle resection can certainly affect the CPK-MB levels. Three patients in the intervention group had tranannular patching of the right ventricular outflow tract, as did two patients in the hyperoxemic group. It is unlikely that this impacted the results in an important way. The degree of right ventricular muscle resection is difficult to quantify. Since this was a randomized study, most of these known/unknown factors tend to be distributed equally among the groups. Despite all these issues, when we consider this result in the context of previous studies,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111431843">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135111431843">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135111431843">16</xref>
</sup> we feel it is reasonable to conclude that it reflects a decreased myocardial injury associated with this protocol.</p>
<p>We were not able to demonstrate any difference in other clinical parameters such as inotropic support duration or ICU stay. The lactate levels were measured as an indicator of low cardiac output<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150135111431843">21</xref>
</sup> but were found to be similar among the groups. There is no evidence to suggest that the oxygen step-up time of five minutes chosen for our protocol is adequate for the cells to adapt to oxidative stress or to allow induction of antioxidant enzymes in the face of rising P<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub> levels. The long-term clinical outcomes and the effect on organ systems such as brain and liver were not studied by us. The small sample size is certainly another major drawback of the study. All these issues need to be addressed in future studies conducted on larger sample sizes which incorporate outcome measures specific to organ systems other than the heart and which also evaluate different oxygen step-up times with a goal of determining the optimal strategy to minimize reoxygenation injury.</p>

<sec id="section12-2150135111431843">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This protocol of staged step-up of oxygen levels over five minutes has been associated with significant decrease of CPK-MB levels, suggesting decreased myocardial injury. The demonstration of decreased ventilation times requires further validation in larger studies. Studies conducted on larger sample sizes and measurement of effects on additional organ systems should be planned. Comparative studies evaluating different reoxygenation strategies and oxygen step-up times should be done to decide the best way to reduce reoxygenation injury in cyanotic children.</p>
