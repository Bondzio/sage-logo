<abstract>
<p>Against the background of contrasting religious versus secular norms in immigrant communities and in Dutch society, this study examines how religious identity expression is related to the social integration of Dutch Muslims within (a) Turkish or Moroccan minority groups and (b) Dutch majority groups. Using nationally representative survey data (N = 2,027), we distinguish religious identification from religious practice (worship and dietary practices) and assertion (support for the role of religion in politics and society) as different forms of religious expression. Structural equation models confirm that minority group contact supports and, conversely, majority group contact suppresses religious practice and assertion. In line with religion as social identity, this result is partly because Dutch Muslims with more minority contacts identify more strongly with their religion, whereas those with more majority contacts identify less strongly. As found in a social capital approach, social integration also directly influences religious expression, especially within the most cohesive Turkish minority group.</p>

<p>Muslims represent the prototypical “other” in today’s Dutch society, as in other Western European societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0190272511436353">Allen and Nielsen 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0190272511436353">Foner and Alba 2008</xref>). Their religious identity, values, and ways of life are devalued by large parts of the majority. Not only is the Dutch majority population among the most secularized in Western Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0190272511436353">Gorski and Altinordu 2008</xref>), they also show the highest levels of public hostility against Muslims and Islam in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0190272511436353">Pew Research Center 2005</xref>). Over 50 percent of the Dutch majority hold unfavorable views of Muslims, as compared to a much lower 15 percent and 11 percent who hold unfavorable views of Christians and Jews, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0190272511436353">Pew Research Center 2005</xref>). Ninety-two percent of the native Dutch population feel that Muslim men subordinate women; 81 percent feel they make authoritarian parents; and a little over half feel that Muslim and Dutch values are incompatible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0190272511436353">Dagevos and Gijsberts 2007</xref>). Moreover, negative attitudes toward Muslims have increased in recent years, whereas attitudes toward other groups remained stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0190272511436353">Jaspers, Van Londen, and Lubbers 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>For Turkish and Moroccan Muslim minorities, in contrast, the same religious identity is highly valued as an important source of collective self-worth, shared values, and social support within families and communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0190272511436353">Güngör, Fleischmann, and Phalet 2011</xref>). Importantly, most Dutch Muslims not only have social contacts with minority group members mostly of the same religion, they also engage in social contact with majority group members, for instance as friends or neighbors. Most often, Dutch Muslims who were born or raised in the Netherlands combine their social integration within the Turkish or Moroccan minority group with some degree of social integration in the majority group. This raises the question of how conflicting religious values in majority and minority groups affect Dutch Muslims’ religiosity.</p>
<p>Individual religiosity is, as aptly described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0190272511436353">Warner (1993</xref>:1081), “not set for life but . . . can be affirmed and later denied and vice versa.” The ways in which individuals experience and express their religion are not fixed or uniform, nor are they inherent in the nature of their religious traditions. They are shaped by the prevailing norms and expectations pertaining to religion in the social networks and groups in which individuals are embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0190272511436353">Coleman 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0190272511436353">Greeley 1963</xref>). Our central research question concerns the association between the social integration of Dutch Muslims and the importance and expression of their religious identity: how do minority and majority group contacts affect how often Dutch Muslims visit a mosque or how they feel about the role of religion in politics? To address our research question, we draw on recent large-scale surveys of nationwide random samples from the Turkish- and Moroccan-Dutch populations as major Muslim minority groups. Importantly, immigrant religions in the Netherlands are largely organized along ethnic lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0190272511436353">Buijs and Rath 2002</xref>), and the vast majority of Turkish- and Moroccan-Dutch are self-categorized Muslims (Maliepaard, Lubbers, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0190272511436353">Gijsberts 2010</xref>). Hence, ethnicity and religion almost fully overlap.</p>
<p>Most large-scale surveys of immigrant religion have relied on narrow measures of religious affiliation that are less suited to capture religiosity in Muslim populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0190272511436353">Norris and Inglehart 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0190272511436353">Ruiter and Van Tubergen 2009</xref>). In line with a multidimensional conception of religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0190272511436353">Voas 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0190272511436353">Güngör et al. 2011</xref>), this study defines religiosity more broadly as a social identity and a social practice. Because religion uniquely refers to ultimate meaning and eternal membership, it constitutes an extremely important social identity for many religious individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0190272511436353">Verkuyten and Yildiz 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0190272511436353">Ysseldyk, Matheson, and Anisman 2010</xref>). Taking an interactionist approach of social identity as socially constructed and validated in interactions with significant others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0190272511436353">Postmes et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0190272511436353">Noels, Leavitt, and Clément 2010</xref>), we look beyond the subjective importance of religious identity and focus on its expression in overt behaviors and attitudes that communicate one’s identity to the outside world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0190272511436353">Ashmore, Deaux, and McLaughlin-Volpe 2004</xref>). Specifically, religious identity expression takes different forms across social contexts. Religious practice, such as worship and dietary practices, takes place mostly within family and community contexts, thus communicating one’s religious identity to fellow Muslims. In addition, some Muslims also assert their religious identity in the public domain, such as when they support the role of religion in society and politics. In doing so, they communicate their religion to the wider society. Accordingly, our study relates religious identification to religious practice and assertion as distinct forms of identity expression that communicate one’s Muslim identity to others. Thus, we address the unresolved issue of the association (or dissociation) between distinct dimensions of religious identity, practice, and assertion and ask the hitherto unanswered question of whether social integration affects mainly the outward expression of religious identity or also its subjective importance.</p>
<p>The social integration of Dutch Muslims is the explanatory focus of this study. The analysis of social integration adds to previous research in at least two ways. First, against the backdrop of generally hostile intergroup relations between Muslim minority and Dutch majority groups, our focus is specifically on positive social contacts, such as visiting neighbors or spending time with friends. We know that negative intergroup contact, such as experienced discrimination, reactively reinforces the devalued minority identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0190272511436353">Branscombe, Schmitt, and Harvey 1999</xref>; for an extension of the rejection-identification hypothesis to Muslim identity, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0190272511436353">Verkuyten and Yildiz 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0190272511436353">Fleischmann, Phalet, and Klein 2011</xref>). The impact of positive contact, such as cross-group friendship, on devalued minority identities has been underevaluated since intergroup contact research has mainly studied when and how contact reduces prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0190272511436353">Brown and Hewstone 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0190272511436353">Pettigrew and Tropp 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A second added value of this study is the simultaneous analysis of mixed social contacts with both minority and majority group members. Since existing research on immigrant religion has focused mainly on kinship ties and relations within the ethnic minority group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0190272511436353">Cadge and Ecklund 2007</xref>), little is known about the joint impact of contacts with both majority and minority group members on religiosity. To address this key question, and in line with evidence of biculturalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0190272511436353">Ryder, Alden, and Paulhus 2000</xref>), we do not assume one bipolar dimension of social integration, equating more minority with less majority contact. Instead, self-reported social contacts in both groups distinguish between parallel pathways of social integration in mixed social networks. This distinction allows a more accurate and complete portrayal of the bicultural social reality of many immigrants, especially that of the second generation, which is defined by multiple group memberships of ethnic and religious communities and of the wider civil society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0190272511436353">Verkuyten 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0190272511436353">Deaux 2006</xref>). Formally, immigrants and their offspring are often citizens of the host country with extensive civil, social, and political rights; and they are integrated to varying degrees in mainstream institutions, such as education and the labor market. Also informally, they take part in social networks that may be ethnically mixed or even mainly cross-ethnic. Consequently, both minority and majority groups are relevant reference groups and possible ingroups for Dutch Muslims.</p>
<p>Finally, our study spells out possible connecting processes between social integration and religion. To this end, we draw upon different approaches from social capital and social identity as complementary ways of theorizing social influence in groups. Social groups influence individual group members through shared norms and understandings of reality, which are expressed in norm-relevant attitudes and behaviors. Whereas social capital research in sociology situates group influence in the social context around the individual, social identity approaches in psychology focus mainly on the importance of the group as part of the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0190272511436353">Altschul, Oyserman, and Bybee 2008</xref>). From the perspective of social capital, social groups function by virtue of social norms that regulate the behavior of individual group members through social closure and related processes of social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0190272511436353">Coleman 1990</xref>). As applied to religion, the social capital approach posits that social networks externally regulate religious expression in accordance with prevailing group norms. From a social identity approach, group norms shape individual attitudes and behaviors through the identification of the self with the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0190272511436353">Tajfel and Turner 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0190272511436353">Turner et al. 1987</xref>). Drawing upon approaches from social capital and social identity, this study examines the mediating role of religious identification in connecting the social networks of Dutch Muslims to their religious practice and assertion.</p>

<title>Majority and Minority Group Contact</title>
<p>Social capital research highlights the key role of social control in the enforcement of social norms through external constraints on individual behavior in dense social networks. Religious communities exemplify such dense social networks, where clear prescriptive and proscriptive norms are strongly enforced. Accordingly, religious studies have extensively documented the impact of social integration on individual religiosity, associating primary ties within families and communities with continued religiosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0190272511436353">Iannaccone 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0190272511436353">Sherkat and Wilson 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0190272511436353">Myers 1996</xref>). From a social capital approach, strong ties ensure the normative force of religious rites, rules, and guidelines to regulate individual behavior through the fear of (informal) sanctions or the motive to maintain social relations or status position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0190272511436353">Coleman 1990</xref>). In the migration context, religion may further gain in its directive force as part of a conscious and concerted effort to preserve cultural continuity and social cohesion and to (re)build religious communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0190272511436353">Bankston and Zhou 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0190272511436353">Ebaugh and Chafetz 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0190272511436353">Güngör et al. 2011</xref>). Accordingly, integration in the ethnic minority group is associated with sustained religiosity among immigrants and their children, also in secularizing receiving contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0190272511436353">Sherkat and Cunningham 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0190272511436353">Gorski and Altinordu 2008</xref>). Thus, Dutch Muslims with more coethnic friends engaged more frequently in religious practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0190272511436353">Van Tubergen 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0190272511436353">Phalet, Gijsberts, and Hagendoorn 2008</xref>). We therefore expect that more frequent social contacts with minority group friends and neighbors will be related to higher levels of religious expression (Hypothesis 1a).</p>
<p>Again reasoning from a social capital approach, social constraints on religious behavior are most forceful in tight-knit coethnic networks, where more frequent social contacts between group members generate more norm-congruent behavior. Together, the Turkish- and Moroccan-Dutch groups make up the majority of Muslims in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0190272511436353">Statistics Netherlands 2007</xref>). While both groups share similar migration histories as guest workers, and a number of other characteristics such as relatively strong religiosity and low socioeconomic status, they also differ markedly in their overall levels of ethnic cohesion and retention. As compared to the Moroccan-Dutch group, the Turkish-Dutch group is characterized by relatively high levels of ethnic language and media use, more dense networks of voluntary ethnic associations, and more restrictive parental control. Accordingly, childhood socialization better predicts adult religiosity in the Turkish than in the Moroccan second generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0190272511436353">Güngör et al. 2011</xref>). Similarly, and in line with expectations from social capital, we hypothesize that the positive association of minority group contact with religious identity expression will be stronger in the more cohesive Turkish-Dutch group than in the less cohesive Moroccan-Dutch group (Hypothesis 1b).</p>
<p>Whereas the role of the ethnic community in sustained immigrant religiosity is rather well documented, the influence of social integration in the majority population on religion has not been well studied. In the Netherlands, predominantly secular majority group norms diverge from much more religious norms in the Turkish and Moroccan minority groups. The Dutch majority population is historically Christian and highly secularized, as evident from the steadily declining importance and impact of religion in their personal life and in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0190272511436353">Becker and De Hart 2006</xref>). As in other northwest European countries with a Christian faith tradition, religious practice in the Netherlands is generally low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0190272511436353">Gorski and Altinordu 2008</xref>). In line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0190272511436353">Luckmann’s (1967)</xref> thesis on the privatization of religion, and in spite of formal freedom of religious expression in the public sphere, private religion is the predominant pattern of popular religiosity in the Netherlands. The public recognition and accommodation of Islam has coexisted from the start with public resistance against the presence of Muslims and Islam in Dutch society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0190272511436353">Sniderman and Hagendoorn 2007</xref>). More recently, Dutch public attitudes have become increasingly and overtly negative (Gijsberts and Lubbers 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0190272511436353">Jaspers et al. 2009</xref>). For instance, Muslim schools have been portrayed as hampering the societal integration of Muslim children, and there is widespread public disapproval of other forms of religious expression, such as the wearing of headscarves by civil servants or the refusal by some Muslims to shake hands with persons of the other sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0190272511436353">Shadid and Van Koningsveld 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0190272511436353">Driessen and Van der Slik 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0190272511436353">Hertogh 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Against this background of secular and anti-Islamic majority group norms, we apply the same argument from social capital to the influence of the majority group on the religious identity expression of Dutch Muslims. Specifically, we expect that the social integration of Dutch Muslims in the majority group will negatively affect their religious identity expression through the same processes that engender conformity to religious norms within minority groups. Dutch Muslims who engage in day-to-day social contacts with majority group friends or neighbors are chronically aware of Dutch secular norms and expectations regarding religion, and some degree of norm conformity helps them to maintain their relationships with non-Muslims. We therefore expect that more frequent social contacts with majority group friends and neighbors will be related to lower levels of religious identity expression (Hypothesis 1c).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0190272511436353">
<title>Religious Identification</title>
<p>Social identity research argues and finds that the impact of group norms on individual attitudes and behaviors depends crucially on the importance of a particular group identity to the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0190272511436353">Brown 2000</xref>). For many Dutch Muslims, being Muslim is the single most important identity that powerfully defines their sense of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0190272511436353">Verkuyten and Yildiz 2007</xref>). From the viewpoint of social identity, Dutch Muslims who identify more strongly with their religion are more likely to express their religious identity. Accordingly, highly identified Muslims engage in religious practices more often than those who identify less strongly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0190272511436353">Maliepaard et al. 2010</xref>). We therefore expect that levels of religious practice and assertion will be significantly related to the importance of religious identity for the individual.</p>
<p>Our social relationships shape the way in which we perceive and present ourselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0190272511436353">Stryker and Serpe 1994</xref>). To the extent that identity exists by virtue of its social validation in a particular social environment, close others, such as friends and family, influence the identities that become part of the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0190272511436353">Postmes et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0190272511436353">Noels et al. 2010</xref>). Social interactions with other group members not only serve to consolidate social identities, they also enable the expression of shared identities in coordinated action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0190272511436353">Haslam, Postmes, and Ellemers 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0190272511436353">Postmes et al. 2006</xref>). Thus, close relationships with others who share the same social identity have been shown longitudinally to increase the importance of this identity and of the group norms attached to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0190272511436353">Ethier and Deaux 1994</xref>). From an interactionist approach of religious identity, therefore, Dutch Muslims who engage more frequently in social contacts with minority group members are expected to attach more importance to their religious identity. In turn, highly identified Muslims will also express their religious identity more often. We therefore hypothesize an additional positive indirect path from minority group contacts to religious identity expression through increased religious identification (Hypothesis 2a).</p>
<p>Again we extend the same argument to social contacts with majority group members. As the majority group devalues the religious identity of Dutch Muslims, we argue that social contacts with the majority group will relate negatively to the importance and expression of their Muslim identity. In support of this argument, recent experimental evidence suggests that people cope with situationally salient social stigma by downplaying their membership of the negatively valued ingroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0190272511436353">Owuamalam and Zagefka 2011</xref>). As an identity that is devalued and distrusted by the powerful majority in Dutch society, the religious identity of a Dutch Muslim exemplifies a stigmatized or “spoiled identity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0190272511436353">Kamans et al. 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0190272511436353">Crocker and Major (1989</xref>:609) define stigmatized social groups as “social categories about which others hold negative attitudes, stereotypes and beliefs, or which, on average, receive disproportionately poor interpersonal or economic outcomes relative to members of the society at large because of discrimination against members of the social category.” In view of persistent social disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0190272511436353">Gijsberts and Dagevos 2010</xref>) and widespread public prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0190272511436353">Jaspers et al. 2009</xref>), this definition clearly applies to Dutch Muslims. To the extent that majority group friends or neighbors represent majority group norms devaluing religion in general and Islam in particular, the importance of religious identity should decrease with more frequent contacts with the majority group. Specifically, we expect a negative indirect pathway from majority group contact to religious identity expression through decreased religious identification (Hypothesis 2b).</p>

<title>Samples</title>
<p>We use the 2006 Survey Integration Minorities (SIM) by the Netherlands Institute for Social Research (SCP) to seek responses from among major immigrant minority groups in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0190272511436353">Dagevos et al. 2007</xref>). Minority samples were drawn at random in order to be optimally representative for the different minority populations nationwide. Extensive face-to-face interviews covered detailed questions on socioeconomic attainment, social integration, and religion. From the SIM survey, we use the Turkish and Moroccan Dutch samples (N = 2,163), which consist of participants whose parents were born in Turkey or Morocco or who were born there themselves. Turkish and Moroccan immigrants and their offspring form the largest Muslim groups in the Netherlands, making up an estimated 69 percent of the total Dutch Muslim population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0190272511436353">Statistics Netherlands 2007</xref>). Overall response rates were 60 percent for Turkish Dutch and 50 percent for Moroccan Dutch participants. For the purpose of this article, we leave out participants who did not self-categorize as Muslims (4 percent nonreligious, 2 percent belonging to another religion than Islam), since they did not answer the questions concerning Islamic practice. The percentage of self-categorized Muslims in SIM is similar to the percentages in earlier surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0190272511436353">Maliepaard et al. 2010</xref>). Item nonresponse was generally low (less than 2 percent on most items) with few exceptions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0190272511436353">1</xref></sup></p>

<p>We estimate multigroup structural equation models with AMOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0190272511436353">Arbuckle 2006</xref>) to test the hypothetical associations between the social integration of Dutch Muslims and their religious identity expression across ethnic origin and gender. In a first step, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) is used to test multigroup measurement models of the different constructs (minority and majority group contact, religious identification, practice, and assertion) across four subgroups of Muslims, based on ethnicity (Turkish and Moroccan Dutch) and gender. To establish measurement equivalence, we compare the fit of a factorially invariant model (with equal loadings across groups) to a baseline model where loadings are freely estimated in each group, using the formal chi-square difference test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0190272511436353">Schmitt and Kuljanin 2008</xref>). In case of partial equivalence, one or more significantly different loadings indicate culture-specific or gendered meanings in specific indicators of contact or religion.</p>
<p>In a second step, multigroup path models are estimated to establish hypothetical pathways from minority and majority contacts to religious identity, practice, and assertion across ethnicity and gender while controlling for age, education, and generational status. To test the generalizability of theoretical associations, again a restrictive causally invariant path model is compared to a baseline model where path coefficients are freely estimated in each group. When path coefficients differ significantly, this demonstrates evidence of differential pathways for different Muslim subgroups.</p>
<p>The final model fit is positively evaluated when the χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> ratio ≤ 2, Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) ≥ .90, and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) ≤ .05. Model fit is acceptable when the χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> ratio ≤ 3, GFI ≥ .80, and RMSEA ≤ .08 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0190272511436353">Hu and Bentler 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0190272511436353">Kline 2005</xref>).

<title>Measures and Measurement Models</title>
<p>Religious practice was measured by three indicators that refer to worship and dietary practices, namely, visiting the mosque, fasting during Ramadan, and eating Halal (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0190272511436353">Table 1</xref> for question wordings and descriptive statistics). These practices were reported on 4- and 5-point Likert scales ranging from no practice (never attend the mosque, fast, or eat halal) to strict practice (attend the mosque multiple times a week, always fast during Ramadan, and always eat halal), with higher scores indicating more frequent or strict practice. In support of partial measurement equivalence, a four-group measurement model of religious practice across ethnicity and gender showed partial factorial invariance (with varying loadings of “eating halal”), Δχ<sup>2</sup> (4) = 10.536, <italic>p</italic> = .032. The final model fit was acceptable, with χ<sup>2</sup> (4, 2,027) = 10.54, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 2.63, GFI = .997, and RMSEA = .028.</p>

<p>Religious assertion was measured by four indicators that refer to the role of religion in society and politics (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0190272511436353">Table 1</xref>). Specifically, participants reported their (dis)agreement with the following statements: “Religion should have a strong influence on Dutch politics,” “I think all Muslims should live strictly according to the rules of Islam,” “I think that Turkish (Moroccan) children in the Netherlands should go to Islamic schools,” and “Muslims should convert people in the Netherlands to Islam.” The statements were rated on 5-point Likert scales ranging from (1) <italic>completely disagree</italic> to (5) <italic>completely agree</italic> so that higher scores indicate higher levels of public assertion. Across ethnicity and gender, one correlated error was allowed between the questions about Islam in Dutch politics and about converting Dutch people, which have in common that they directly target the Dutch majority. Next, a test of factorial invariance supported the partial measurement equivalence of our religious assertion measure across ethnicity and gender (with varying loadings of “living strictly according to the rules of Islam”), Δχ<sup>2</sup> (8) = 12.16, <italic>p</italic> = .143. The final model fit was good, χ<sup>2</sup> (8, 2,027) = 12.87; χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 1.07, GFI = .997, RMSEA = .006.</p>
<p><italic>Religious identification</italic> refers to the importance of one’s religious identity as part of the self and to associated feelings of identity threat when others question one’s religious belonging. Identification was measured by three statements (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0190272511436353">Table 1</xref>): “My religion is an important part of myself,” “It hurts when someone says something negative about my religion,” and “Nobody should question my religion.” Answers range from <italic>completely disagree</italic> (1) to <italic>completely agree</italic> (5) on 5-point Likert scales, with higher scores indicating higher levels of identification. A test of factorial invariance supports full measurement equivalence across ethnic origin and gender, Δχ<sup>2</sup> (6) = 9.90; <italic>p</italic> = .129. The invariant model has a good fit, χ<sup>2</sup> (6, 2,027) = 9.90, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 1.65, GFI = .997, RMSEA = .018.</p>
<p>In support of distinct constructs, religious identification, practice, and assertion are revealed as distinct factors in multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Across ethnic origin and gender the three-factor model shows an acceptable fit, χ<sup>2</sup> (143, 2,027) = 439.14, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 3.07, GFI = .957, RMSEA = .032, and it fits the data better than more parsimonious one- or two-factor models, as evident from Δ Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) &gt; 10 (AIC = 882, 734, and 593 for one-, two-, and three-factor models, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0190272511436353">2</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Minority group contact was measured by two items (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0190272511436353">Table 1</xref>): “How often do you have contact with your Turkish/Moroccan friends/acquaintances” and “How often do you have contact with your Turkish/Moroccan neighbors/people in your neighbourhood,” both answered on 5-point Likert scales ranging from <italic>less than once a year/never</italic> (1) to <italic>daily</italic> (5). Majority group contact was measured by the same questions, substituting “Turkish/Moroccan” with “Dutch” friends and neighbors. Higher scores always denote more frequent contact. Reflecting the bicultural social worlds of many Dutch Muslims, about one third of the respondents engaged in social contacts with both the minority and majority group on a weekly or daily basis. Multigroup CFA across ethnic origin and gender supports the distinction between minority and majority group contact as dual pathways of social integration. Specifically, minority and majority group contacts with friends and neighbors are two factors with significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and positive interfactor correlations ranging from .24 for Turkish women to .49 for Turkish men. Participants who report more regular social contacts with minority friends and neighbors also report more majority friends and neighbors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0190272511436353">3</xref></sup> The factorially invariant model supports full metric equivalence across ethnic origin and gender, Δχ<sup>2</sup> (6) = 9.07; <italic>p</italic> = .17. The invariant model has a good fit when the errors of neighborhood contacts are allowed to covary, χ<sup>2</sup> (6, 2,027) = 9.07, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 1.51, GFI = .998, RMSEA = .016.</p>

To assign participants to the four educational levels, the highest level of education completed (either in the Netherlands or abroad) or currently attended (for full-time students) was used.

<title>Results</title>
<p>To test our hypotheses, the specified measurement models were included in multigroup path models using structural equation modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0190272511436353">Kline 2005</xref>) with minority and majority group contact as latent explanatory variables and with religious identification, practice, and assertion as latent dependent variables (controlling for relevant background variables). In addition to the hypothesized direct effects of social contacts on religious practice and assertion (Hypotheses 1a, 1b, and 1c), indirect contact effects through religious identification were also specified, highlighting the role of identification (Hypotheses 2a and 2b). In a first step, all effect parameters were freely estimated in a four-group baseline model across ethnic origin and gender. All direct and indirect effects of social contact on religious identity expression were in the expected direction. Next, equality constraints were imposed on path coefficients in order to test the generalizability of our explanatory approach across ethnic origin and gender. Model comparison supports partial causal invariance, Δχ<sup>2</sup> (23) = 40.44, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .01. The fit of the complete final four-group structural equation model was acceptable, χ<sup>2</sup> (451, 2,027) = 1,232.50, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 2.73, GFI = .938, RMSEA = .029.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0190272511436353">4</xref></sup> Theoretical associations were fully replicated across gender, as all theoretical paths could be set equal for Muslim men and women. In addition, all theoretical paths could also be set equal across Turkish and Moroccan groups with one exception: the effect of minority group contact on religious practice was stronger in the more cohesive Turkish than in the Moroccan minority group, in line with Hypothesis 1b about ethnic differences in minority group influence on religion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0190272511436353">Figure 1</xref> shows the theoretical part of the final model, which will be discussed in more detail in the following (see Appendix A on the SPQ website, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.asanet.org/spq">www.asanet.org/spq</ext-link>, for more complete information on parameter estimates). The explanatory power of the final model ranges from R<sup>2</sup> = .29 (Turkish men) up to .49 (Turkish women) for religious practice and from .41 (Moroccan women) to .47 (Turkish and Moroccan men) for religious assertion.</p>

<p>The effects of age, education, and generational status on religious identification, practice, and assertion were equal across ethnic origin and gender groups. We find no significant net effects of migration generation: the second generation does not differ in degrees or forms of religiosity from the first generation. We also do not find any effects of age on religious identification, practice, and assertion. The role of education is limited to a small negative effect on assertion, indicating that higher educated Muslims are slightly less favorable towards the role of religion in the public sphere.</p>
<sec id="section9-0190272511436353">
<title>Minority and Majority Group Contact</title>
<p>Our first hypothesis predicted opposite effects of minority and majority group contacts on the expression (vs. suppression) of Muslim identity. Across ethnic origin and gender, significantly positive total effects of minority group contact on religious practice and assertion confirm Hypothesis 1a: more frequent social contacts within the ethnic minority group predict the increased expression of their Muslim identity by Dutch Muslims (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0190272511436353">Figure 1</xref>). Conversely, in support of Hypothesis 1c, our findings show significantly negative effects of majority group contact on religious practice and assertion: more frequent contact with majority group members predicts lower levels of religious practice and assertion. The hypothesized opposite influence of majority and minority group contacts should be qualified in light of the much stronger minority group influence on religious practice. Standardized effect sizes indicate that the association of religious practice with minority group contact (Turkish-Dutch β = .45; Moroccan-Dutch β = .25) is, respectively, more than four times and more than twice as strong as the association with majority group contact (β = –.10 for both Turkish and Moroccan Dutch).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0190272511436353">5</xref></sup> Note that minority and majority group influence on religious assertion is equally strong, as evident from similar standardized effect sizes of minority and majority group contact (β around .20 and –.20, respectively, across ethnic origin).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0190272511436353">
<title>Ethnic Differences</title>
<p>In Hypothesis 1b, we argued that there would be differential effects of minority group contact on religious practice for Moroccan- and Turkish-Dutch. As we saw in the model specification, the association of minority group contact with religious practice differed between the two groups. A Wald test indicates that minority group contact is more significantly association with religious practice for Turks than for Moroccans (<italic>z</italic> = 3.2), confirming Hypothesis 1b. This finding qualifies the impact of coethnic social ties in less cohesive communities such as the Moroccan minority group. It suggests that Turkish-Dutch Muslims are most effective in enforcing religious behavior, especially religious practices such as worship and dietary practices that are typically enacted in the presence of ethnic minority group members and hence most readily influenced through social control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0190272511436353">
<title>Religious Identification</title>
<p>To test our second hypothesis about the mediating role of religious identification, we estimated indirect pathways from social contact to identity expression through religious identification. As expected, Dutch Muslims who had more social contacts in the ethnic minority group attached more importance to their religious identity than those with fewer minority group contacts. In turn, highly identified Muslims engaged in religious practice more often and were more in favor of religious assertion. The indirect effects of minority group contact through religious identification were fully replicated (that is, invariant) across ethnic origin and gender. As a rigorous test of mediation, we compared the hypothetical model to a competing model without indirect effects (where the path from minority group contact to religious identification was set to zero). In support of the hypothetical model, the fit deteriorated significantly, Δχ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 28.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001. As hypothesized, mediation is partial, and direct effects remain. After including the mediation path, the direct effect of minority contact on religious practice only declines a little for the Turkish-Dutch (6 percent), but much more strongly for the Moroccan Dutch (35 percent), in line with higher levels of social control in the more cohesive Turkish-Dutch group. These findings support Hypothesis 2a: social contacts within the minority group increase religious practice and assertion among Dutch Muslims, in part through bolstering their religious identity.</p>
<p>In parallel, Dutch Muslims who had more social contacts in the majority group attached significantly less importance to their Muslim identity than those with fewer majority group contacts. In addition, more weakly identified Muslims participated less in religious practice and endorsed religious assertion less. Moreover, the indirect paths were invariant across ethnic origin and gender. Omitting the path from majority group contact to religious identification in a competing model without mediation resulted in a significantly worse model fit, Δχ<sup>2</sup> (1) = 11.47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001. Again, mediation was partial, as expected. After including the importance of religious identity, the direct effects diminished by approximately 20 percent. Mediation was about equally strong for practice and assertion. Taken together, these findings confirm Hypothesis 2b: those Muslims who have more majority group friends engage less in religious practice and endorse religious assertion less, partly because they attach less importance to their Muslim identity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0190272511436353">
<title>Reverse Causality</title>
<p>In our structural equation models, we have specified social contact as a predictor of religious identity expression, following an interactionist approach of religion as social identity. Reverse causation has also been argued, however, so that prior identification influences which social contacts are sought or avoided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0190272511436353">Rutland et al. 2011</xref>). For instance, strictly religious Muslims may avoid cross-ethnic contact and prefer coethnic contact with fellow Muslims instead. To put this competing model to a test, we compare the hypothetical model with a competing model where the direction of causation is reversed, so that the importance of religious identity affects not only religious practice and assertion but also majority and minority group contacts. Since these models are not nested, informal model comparison using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) indicates that the hypothesized model clearly fits the data better than the reverse model, Δ AIC (1,822 – 1,621) = 201. At the same time, the reverse model is also compatible with the data, as apparent from an acceptable model fit, χ<sup>2</sup> (476, 2,027) = 1,550.20, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 3.26, GFI = .910, RMSEA = .033. In sum, while social contacts most clearly constitute religious identity, the association between contact and religious identity expression is most likely a bidirectional process.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In view of contrasting religious and secular group norms in Muslim minority groups and in the Dutch majority group, this study addressed the question of how the social integration of Dutch Muslims in minority and majority groups affects their religious identity. Drawing on large-scale nationally representative surveys of Turkish and Moroccan-Dutch Muslims and using multiple indicators of religious identification, practice, and assertion, we examined how minority and majority group contacts in ethnically mixed social networks jointly shape the religious identity of Dutch Muslims. We were able to fully replicate multigroup structural equation models across gender and ethnicity, showing opposite associations of minority and majority contacts with religious identity expression versus suppression for all these groups. Furthermore, drawing upon theoretical approaches from social capital and social identity, we predict and find that social contacts affect the expression (or suppression) of religious identity directly as well as indirectly through religious identification. The study adds to the research literatures on minority religion and social integration in a number of ways.</p>
<p>First, our findings reveal minority and majority group contacts as simultaneous and countervailing social forces that jointly shape the religious practices and assertions of Dutch Muslims. Those who engage more frequently in social contacts with minority group friends and neighbors attach more importance to their Muslim identity, report more regular religious practice, and endorse the public assertion of Islam more strongly. Conversely, those who engage more frequently in social contacts with majority group friends and neighbors attach less importance to their Muslim identity, tend to practice less, and endorse religious assertion less strongly. Opposite effects of minority and majority group contact on religious identity expression are in line with conflicting religious minority versus secular majority group norms. While the religious identity of Dutch Muslims is highly valued and its expression is generally encouraged in the minority group context, the opposite is the case in the majority group context. In additional analyses, we did not find significant interaction effects of majority and minority contacts. The additive model implies that majority and minority contacts jointly predict religious identity expression, yet the impact of majority contact is not conditional on the degree of minority contact or vice versa. Importantly, most Dutch Muslims engage in social contacts with both minority and majority group friends and neighbors, in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0190272511436353">Berry’s (1997)</xref> integration type of acculturation: about one third reports weekly or daily contacts with both groups. By implication, many Muslims negotiate different religious and secular group norms and expectations as they juggle their dual group membership. It follows that previous research on religion and social integration that focused narrowly on the ethnic community or assumed integration in majority and minority groups would be inversely related falls short of elucidating the social forces that shape immigrant religiosity.</p>
<p>Our findings convincingly show that both minority and majority groups influence religion in different ways. Hence, both group contexts should be included simultaneously in the same study in order to provide a more complete understanding of social integration. In addition, the findings shed light on the underresearched role of positive social contact (like friendship experiences) against the background of generally hostile intergroup relations. Whereas negative intergroup experiences can result in increased identification with a devalued minority group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0190272511436353">Branscombe et al. 1999</xref>), our study shows that positive contact leads minority group members to downplay their devalued identity, in line with expectations from research on stigmatized identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0190272511436353">Crocker and Major 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, our explanatory approach is informed by research on social capital and social identity as complementary perspectives on normative processes in social groups. Our findings confirm the key role of social integration in minority and majority groups, which exert opposite influences on the importance and expression of religious identity. In line with a social identity approach, we replicate a significant and robust indirect pathway from social contact to religious identity expression through religious identification for both minority and majority group contacts and across gender and ethnic origin. In addition, social contacts with both minority and majority group members directly affect religious practice and assertion, in line with expectations from social capital. In the absence of a direct measure of social control in social networks, differential effect sizes, with most minority group influence on religious practice in the most cohesive Turkish community, suggest the key role of social control in dense social networks, as expected from social capital theory.</p>
<p>Finally, our finding that the importance of religious identity depends on people’s social integration resonates with an interactionist perspective on social identity as based in social interactions. Interestingly, the interactionist turn in identity research suggests useful cross-linkages between social capital and social identity approaches of religion through opening up the self to the social world around it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0190272511436353">Oyserman, Elmore, and Smith 2012</xref>). Taken together, the findings highlight the added value of drawing upon complementary approaches of normative processes from social capital and social identity theories.</p>
<p>Importantly, our study distinguishes between different dimensions of religion. Religious practice and religious assertion were examined as related yet separate forms of religious identity expression. Interestingly, the impact of majority group contact in particular appears to depend on the specific form of religious identity expression. Thus, religious assertion is influenced roughly in equal strength by minority and majority group contacts, whereas religious practice is mainly influenced by minority group friends and neighbors and much less—though still significantly—by the majority group. As religious practices usually take place within the minority community, they appear to be less susceptible to normative pressures from the majority group. By implication, with the continuing social integration in the host society of the second generation, along with enduring social relations within the ethnic minority group, only limited decline in religious practices can be expected. In contrast, religious assertions bring religion into the public domain, involving the majority group as a relevant and influential audience. Accordingly, the public assertion of religion was as much influenced by majority and minority contact, though in opposite directions.</p>
<p>There are also some limitations, however. Since we are dealing with cross-sectional data, we are unable to draw firm conclusions with regard to causality. In this article we have treated religious expression as a result of integration in line with an interactionist approach of social identity. The association is probably not unidirectional: very religious Muslims are less likely to engage in friendly social contacts with non-Muslims, though models where the causal order was reversed so that religious identity predicts both social contacts and religious expression showed a worse fit than our hypothetical model. In future research, longitudinal data should be used to separate out selection from social influence, as for instance in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0190272511436353">Ethier and Deaux (1994)</xref> on the reciprocal relation between Hispanic identity and social contacts. Another limitation is that we did not directly ask for the religion of friends and neighbors in addition to their ethnic origin. Because of the almost complete overlap of ethnic and religious membership in the Turkish and Moroccan Dutch groups, however, it is safe to assume opposite religious versus secular norms in minority and majority group contexts.</p>
<p>This research paves the way for further explorations into the relation between social integration and religious identity expression. It is known that social integration facilitates adaptation in fields ranging from employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0190272511436353">Kanas, Van Tubergen, and Van der Lippe 2009</xref>) to identification patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0190272511436353">Mok et al. 2007</xref>), and it seems that this extends to religion as well. Moreover, we have shown that it is important to take both minority and majority group contacts into account, since the religious identity of Dutch Muslims is simultaneously shaped by their dual ethnic and civic memberships. Dutch Muslims may be an extreme case in view of relatively high levels of secularization and current anti-Islamic hostility in the Netherlands. Therefore, future research should test the generalizability of our arguments and findings to other devalued minority groups.</p>

<p>Items with more than 2 percent nonresponse are “Muslims should spread Islam in the Netherlands” and “Islam should play a role in Dutch politics,” with 4.7 percent and 10 percent missing values, respectively. These items are perceived as extreme assertions in the Dutch intergroup context, so that some participants may refuse to respond. They are therefore not missing completely at random. We ran the analysis twice, once excluding all individuals who did not fill out these items, the second time including all respondents, imputing the missing variables by means of the Expectation Maximization algorithm in SPSS. The outcomes were the same both in terms of model fit and magnitude of the effects, so we use the full imputed data set (<italic>n</italic> = 2,027).</p>

<p>Since the one-, two-, and three-factor models are not nested, we use Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC), which penalizes more complex models for informal model comparison. A lower AIC signals a better fit, and differences &gt; 10 are regarded as meaningful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0190272511436353">Burnham and Anderson 2004</xref>).</p>

<p>The positive correlation indicates that besides distinct ethnic components, we also measure a common social component: some individuals are more socially connected than others. Since net contact effects on religion are estimated, the overlap between minority and majority group contact does not influence their associations with religion.</p>

<p>In the final model, only the errors between contact with majority and minority neighbors are allowed to covary.</p>

<p>The effects are fully replicated when the model is estimated with only friendship contact or neighborhood contact (instead of a combination of both) as predictors.</p>
