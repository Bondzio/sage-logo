<abstract>
<p>Canada’s key role in supporting the 2009 coup d’état in Honduras is emblematic of a new Canadian imperialist positioning in world affairs. A close reading of Canadian state responses to the coup and the repression that followed points to the apparent contradiction in its being an outspoken supporter of a violent and antidemocratic regime despite rhetorical commitments to peace and security. The contradiction can be explained in terms of the extent of Canadian economic investment in Honduras and an understanding of Canada as a secondary imperial power committed to imposing and maintaining conditions in Honduras that will protect that investment. The promotion of hyper-neoliberalism in Honduras, then, is representative of Canada’s larger projects for the Global South in a context in which Canadian capital is aggressively expanding its reach.</p>

<p>The assertion that we are living in an age of imperialism is not particularly controversial. Positioned at the center of global capitalism sits the United States, its overwhelming economic and military power giving it a disproportionate ability to set, shape, and sometimes even break the rules of international politics as it sees fit in the defense of what it defines as its national interest. It has become widely accepted that Washington’s willingness to exercise that power is an expression of global and hegemonic aspirations that are no longer defined solely by the direct occupation of territory. Even in mainstream social science, this is increasingly understood as a new form of imperialism. While the Marxian tradition has long maintained that imperialism is a central feature of capitalism, willingness to call the process “imperialism” is now also characteristic of mainstream observers like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0094582X13492129">Niall Ferguson (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094582X13492129">Michael Ignatieff (2003)</xref>, the latter of whom actually championed a version of “empire lite” and ran as a Canadian prime ministerial candidate in 2011.</p>
<p>It is notable that a prominent member of Canada’s elite political class should have produced one of the most significant intellectual justifications of contemporary imperialism. Indeed, this article will seek to demonstrate, using a close reading of the relationship that Canada has established with the military government that has ruled Honduras since the 2009 coup d’état, that this relationship is emblematic of Canada’s new positioning as a secondary imperialist power, one that replicates and adapts the familiar dynamics of U.S. imperialism to its own advantage. I am pointing to a rather controversial claim that there exists an increasingly aggressive Canadian capitalist class that is an independent actor within a broader imperial network and that the Canadian state is establishing itself increasingly as a representative of this class, relying primarily on neocolonial or indirect forms of control in the Global South. To unpack this claim will require a brief sketch of the dynamics of contemporary imperialism and Canada’s position within it, after which I will turn to a detailed analysis of Canada’s relationship to the military government of Honduras.</p>
<sec id="section1-0094582X13492129">
<title>Canada and the New Imperialism</title>
<p>Honduras is a particularly useful case study because it has been subject to many different forms of imperialism, ranging from the direct colonial occupation by the Spanish in the sixteenth century to the neocolonial control exercised by Britain and the United States in the nineteenth century and the regional domination of the cold war American “sphere of influence” in the twentieth. In every case, political and especially economic power were held by the foreign metropole, assisted by a small cadre of local elites, and the levers of state power were twisted to the benefit of metropolitan conquerors and businesses seeking to exploit Honduran land and people in order to extract profits. Honduras, the prototypical “banana republic,” was as often governed on behalf of the United Fruit Company as on behalf of Hondurans themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0094582X13492129">Meza, 1991</xref>: 75–95).</p>
<p>It is with this latter form of imperialism that Canada has increasingly aligned itself. Dubbed “the new imperialism” in its twenty-first-century variety by David Harvey, it is best exemplified by the vigorous and often violent imposition of neoliberal governance on post-Soviet and Global South states by their metropolitan counterparts in an effort to create new spaces of potential profit for overaccumulated capital. As capital repeatedly finds itself unable to feed its desperate desire for dynamic growth and is therefore at risk of slipping into stagnation and slump, it must find “new” sources of profits. The political agents of capital, then, will create these new spaces by dispossessing states and communities, especially in the Global South, of whatever wealth they can so that it can be snapped up and turned into profits for metropolitan capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X13492129">Harvey, 2003</xref>). The privatization of a state telecommunications company in Latin America, for instance, becomes a hitherto inaccessible source of profitable investment for overaccumulated capital in the North, and if enough of these sorts of “fixes” can be created to keep capital growing, then recession and depression—which always carry the prospect of a truly dramatic collapse—can be staved off a little longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X13492129">McNally, 2011</xref>: 1–25).</p>
<p>Naturally, this project is undertaken with the cooperation of local agents, usually from some combination of the local oligarchy and the established political and military apparatus, that are willing to further the imperial project in order to cash in on the benefits of working within what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0094582X13492129">Ellen Wood (2003)</xref> calls the “empire of capital.” Indeed, the idea that capital itself is an imperial overlord rightly points to the fact that, in the context of increasingly worrisome crises, capital finds itself compelled to pursue ever more coordinated forms of class struggle. Neoliberalism, then, can be understood as a class project undertaken by global capital against the global working class, and its architecture (as manifest in the apparatus of international trade laws, the dictates of the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank, or bilateral and multilateral free-trade agreements) is designed to promote the interests of capital, whatever its nationality.</p>
<p>That said, as I will show in the Honduran case, imperialism always operates in specific circumstances, intervening in existing social and political formations, working to reshape them in unique ways by means of identifying and co-opting local allies and enlisting them in its cause. In that sense, it is a general phenomenon with a variety of distinct local manifestations. Moreover, an imperialism that operates largely without direct territorial domination in an era of proliferating nation-states necessarily involves intricate networks of collaboration and degrees of competition with the dominant imperial power. Capitalism is propelled forward only by competition among capitals, even while global capital cooperates to manage its crises, and that competition is still regulated and shaped by politics and geography.</p>
<p>The Canadian state has typically presented its international role as that of a benevolent “middle power” in the world that seeks to promote justice, security, and peace. This discursive construction is reinforced politically by the mythology of Lester B. Pearson and Canada’s legacy of “peacekeeping” and “humanitarian intervention,” a legacy that is not entirely imaginary but tends to be exaggerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0094582X13492129">Gordon, 2010</xref>: 298–301). In the meantime, Canadians’ understanding of themselves is increasingly shaped, in the social and cultural realm, by the “kitschy Canadiana” imagery that emphasizes the idea of a small, well-meaning nation of immigrants who have patched together a tolerant, multicultural society from humble beginnings. This narrative, however, necessarily ignores Canada’s rather troubling historical record, in which racism, colonialism, exploitation, and bloodshed have played a central role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X13492129">Adams, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to the claim that Canada is a benevolent force in international politics, there exists a strong countercurrent that insists that Canada may mean well in the world but is so dependent on the United States that it sacrifices its political autonomy in order to do Washington’s bidding. This position is perhaps best exemplified in Linda McQuaig’s popular <italic>Holding the Bully’s Coat</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0094582X13492129">2007</xref>) and is held firmly by broad sections of the Canadian center-left, including the New Democratic Party, the major trade unions, and the more progressive elements of the Canadian media. Though these critics rightly take issue with Canadian policy when it strays from the old mythologies—as when Canada was implicated in systematic cases of torture in Afghanistan—they maintain that Canada’s bad behavior is a reflection of its dependency on Washington, which impedes Canadian politicians from acting more magnanimously as would, presumably, be their instinct. There is, of course, some truth to the claim that Canadian foreign policy is deeply and increasingly linked to the project of U.S. imperialism and hegemony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X13492129">Albo, 2013</xref>: 241–254). Nevertheless, it overemphasizes the extent to which Canada is an economic dependency of the United States, imagining that its own economic survival relies on the American capital that dominates its industries and upon which Canadians’ jobs and well-being depend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X13492129">Levitt, 1970</xref>).</p>
<p>A third and more compelling framework for understanding contemporary Canadian foreign policy is rooted in acknowledging Canada’s own position as an imperialist power. This position has been most effectively demonstrated in the scholarship that constitutes the new Canadian political economy, including the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0094582X13492129">Jorge Niosi (1985)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X13492129">William Carroll (1986)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X13492129">William Burgess (2002)</xref>,and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X13492129">Jerome Klassen (2009)</xref>, which demonstrates that Canada has its own independent capitalist classes that cooperate <italic>but also compete</italic> with their counterparts in the United States and elsewhere. Importantly, the Canadian capitalist class has been consolidated since the 1970s and has become a major exporter of capital. In 2006 Canada was the ninth-largest source of foreign direct investment flows in the world, and, while some US$500 billion in assets in the Canadian economy were foreign-owned, Canadian firms owned upwards of US$514.5 billion in foreign countries, of which the United States accounted for only 44 percent—the remainder divided between Europe, Asia, and the rest of the Americas, with a small amount in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X13492129">Klassen, 2009</xref>: 177).</p>
<p>All of this suggests that Canada is by no means simply a “dependency” of the United States, and, when one considers the massive foreign direct investment imbalances that Canada maintains with countries in the Global South, it becomes increasingly clear that Canada would better be understood as a secondary component in the new imperial apparatus centered around the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X13492129">Carroll and Klassen, 2010</xref>). In other words, Canada has actively chosen to pursue a strategy that includes deeper integration with the United States for its own aims and with goals that overlap with but are not dominated by those of the United States. From this important starting point, the project has been taken up by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X13492129">Yves Engler (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0094582X13492129">Todd Gordon (2010)</xref> and in an important new collection edited by Jerome Klassen and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X13492129">Greg Albo (2013)</xref>. This new work endeavors to demonstrate that the domestic and foreign policies of the Canadian state are designed in large part to protect and promote the interests of Canadian capital at home and abroad. It is no coincidence, then, that as Canadian capital is floating around the world searching for profitable outlets, Canadian foreign policy is becoming ever more aggressive in creating those spaces, whether in Afghanistan, Haiti, Colombia, sub-Saharan Africa, or Honduras.</p>
<p>Canada continues to strengthen its aggressive military posture in a series of shifts that have taken shape especially since 9/11, beginning with the restructuring of its political and military architecture to facilitate the growth and deployability of the Canadian armed forces. This “revolution in military affairs” was manifest in dramatic increases in military spending throughout the 2000s—as high as US$18.8 billion in 2008—and active military engagements in Afghanistan, Iraq, Haiti, Libya, Mali, and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X13492129">Albo, 2013</xref>: 254–260). It behooves us, then, to sketch the connections between Canada’s particular economic interests in the world and its concrete foreign policies—to trace the trajectory of the imperial relationships that Canada is forging with an increasing number of states in the Global South.</p>
<p>It is my belief that these connections are best exemplified by Canada’s relationship to the violent and antidemocratic military regime in Honduras, and I will use the rest of this article to detail the Honduran case, highlighting Canadian investments in Honduras and the role the Canadian state has played in supporting a coup regime that appears committed to protecting those investments. I will begin with an overview of the coup itself to establish that the social democratic reform process interrupted by the coup had a broad base of popular support—to highlight the fact that Canada’s position is actually opposing and undermining a popular, democratic project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0094582X13492129">
<title>Genealogy of A Coup</title>
<p>The natural starting point for an analysis of the current crisis in Honduras is the kidnapping of the center-left president Manuel Zelaya Rosales on June 28, 2009. Zelaya was arrested at gunpoint and whisked in his pajamas to a U.S. military base and then to exile in Costa Rica, provoking 161 days of uninterrupted popular demonstrations that marked the launch of the Frente Nacional de Resistencia Popular (National Popular Resistance Front—FNRP). After a number of other countries, including the United States, had already condemned the coup and demanded the return of Zelaya, Canada offered a tardy and rather halfhearted rebuke more than 12 hours after the coup. In it, Peter Kent called upon “all parties to seek peaceful resolution to the present political crisis,” misleadingly suggesting that there were two sides engaged in a symmetrical struggle for power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X13492129">DFAIT, 2009a</xref>).</p>
<p>Most North American analyses of the coup, left and mainstream, foreground the social-democratic reforms that Zelaya had put forward as president between 2006 and 2009, which included a dramatic increase in the minimum wage, a moratorium on approving new mining concessions, joining the PetroCaribe oil alliance to reduce energy costs especially for low-income families, resisting further privatization of key state enterprises, vetoing an attempt to ban the morning-after pill, and, most important, proposing to reopen the constitution to a public assembly that could have built significant reforms into the cornerstone of Honduran law. It is therefore imagined that the coup was an interruption of Zelaya’s attempts to reorient the country away from neoliberalism and toward the Bolivarian alternative. Zelaya is credited as the leader of a left populist project of reform, and the dramatic resistance movement that captured international headlines after the coup is read as a spontaneous response to the military’s move against a beloved leader.</p>
<p>This account does capture some of the dynamics at play, but the important reforms undertaken during Zelaya’s term in office would much better be understood as the <italic>culmination—</italic>not the start—of a long period of reorganizing and rebuilding of social movements in a country that had, by the time Zelaya took power, already reached levels of mobilization not seen since the 1970s. After burgeoning social movements were crushed during the U.S. occupation in the 1980s, the rebuilding of Honduras’s social movements began in the mid-1990s in response to the first round of neoliberal measures. The hammer of these structural adjustments, privatizations, foreign concessions, theft of campesino and indigenous land, cuts to social and state services and infrastructure, and other austerity measures had fallen hard on Hondurans already reeling from the violence and insecurity of the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0094582X13492129">Robinson, 2003</xref>: 127–132).</p>
<p>Regional activist networks (indigenous groups in Intibucá, environmental movements in Olancho, women’s collectives in San Pedro Sula, labor and lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender [LGBT] activists around the capital) began fighting back against immediate local problems but soon recognized that any broader challenge to Honduras’s corrupt and inequitable power structures required a national movement. In the early 2000s, regional groups began organizing coordinated events that culminated in a 10-hour blockade of all four major highways into Tegucigalpa in 2003 (Juan Barahona, interview, May 9, 2012). Building upon this strength, the increasingly popular and mobilized movement continued to demand reform, and by the mid-2000s it had found, in Manuel Zelaya, a president who was prepared to listen. As Zelaya’s administration made concessions to the movement, it became increasingly isolated from the oligarchy from whence it came and, instead, found itself relying more and more heavily on popular support. That tension came to a head when Zelaya tried to respond to the movement’s call for a popular assembly to rewrite the Honduran constitution, prompting the June 2009 coup.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0094582X13492129">
<title>Canada and The New Reality in Honduras</title>
<p>The coup interrupted not just a presidential term but also a social movement with a broad base of support across the country. This was especially clear after the coup, as a dramatic and peaceful popular resistance rose up immediately in defiance. It was met with brutal and systematic repression from a military and police apparatus that sought out activists and leaders in the social movements and targeted them for assassination, disappearance, detention, torture, or other forms of violence in a steady, systematic, and personal manner. State terror followed an all too familiar pattern: unidentified cars sitting outside people’s homes, police knocking down doors in the middle of the night, men riding by on motorcycles, death threats by text message, and all manner of physical and emotional violence designed to discourage entire communities from taking a stand or even associating with the resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0094582X13492129">Shipley, 2009a</xref>). Indeed, local human rights organizations that document and disseminate information on state violence regularly report that it has become nearly impossible to keep track of it. In the six months following the coup, some 50 people were assassinated and hundreds of others targeted with other forms of violence—and these numbers are the lowest estimates, since any case that could plausibly be considered not directly politically motivated is not counted. Human rights observers themselves are routinely among the targets of state repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X13492129">COFADEH, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>And yet, throughout this period, Canada continued to avoid significantly condemning the regime. A month after the coup, Peter Kent told the OAS, “The coup was certainly an affront to the region, but there is a context in which these events happened. . . . There has to be an appreciation of the events that led up to the coup” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0094582X13492129">Lacey and Thompson, 2009</xref>). The implication was that Zelaya himself was responsible for the coup, a claim that has been roundly debunked in a variety of places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0094582X13492129">Shipley, 2009b</xref>). Zelaya’s popularity skyrocketed after the coup as Hondurans reacted against the return of military dictatorship, and he made two attempts to return to the country during what remained of his term of office. The first time he was turned back at the airport, and violence was unleashed on the crowd that was there to greet him. The second time he managed to return but was forced to hole up in the Brazilian embassy, guarded by the Honduran military to prevent his leaving, until January 2010, when he was granted passage to the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>Canada’s statements during that period are instructive: Peter Kent consistently chided Zelaya for “recklessly” attempting to reenter the country of which he was the legal head of state and insisted that he and his supporters negotiate a settlement in good faith with the coup regime, again misleadingly suggesting that Zelaya and the coup regime were equally responsible for the crisis and that the regime was in a legitimate bargaining position. When Zelaya was barricaded in the Brazilian embassy, Kent’s statement expressed concern with “the violence that erupted in the aftermath of President Zelaya’s <italic>sudden</italic> return to Honduras” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X13492129">DFAIT, 2009b</xref>, my emphasis). The word “sudden” implies that the irregularity of the situation should be attributed to Zelaya, as if the violence unleashed by the repressive coup government were caused by Zelaya’s “sudden” action rather than by the “sudden” kidnapping of a president and the fabrication and forgery of his resignation letter. This presentation of events was repeated often both in Canada’s international statements and in the domestic media; for instance, in July 2009, Peter Kent told the CBC that Zelaya’s attempts to reenter the country were “very unhelpful,” a remarkable statement given that Canada still recognized Zelaya as the legal president with six months left in his term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0094582X13492129">Rights Action, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In November, while Zelaya was under siege in the embassy, the de facto regime held elections that were widely understood in Honduras to be a farce—an illegitimate and fraudulent process designed to regain international recognition. The elections were held in a climate of state terror and violent silencing of critical media and public protest; liberal international organizations like the Carter Center and the United Nations refused to send election observers in recognition of the ongoing violence and the illegality of the regime, and hundreds of political candidates withdrew their names after experiencing physical aggression and intimidation. Among them was the presidential front-runner Carlos H. Reyes, a union leader running as an independent candidate with Zelaya’s endorsement, who was bludgeoned in the head by a police baton at a demonstration in July 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0094582X13492129">Sharabi, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In the week leading up to the elections, the FNRP called for a nationwide boycott, and, predictably, millions of Hondurans refused to cast their ballots—this despite a campaign of state terror (supported by the mainstream Honduran media, all owned by coup supporters) that was intended to coerce people into participating and to silence their dissent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X13492129">CEDOH, 2009</xref>). Since the military regime was relying on the election process to legitimate its rule over the country, it released fraudulent numbers inflating the total number of ballots cast, though it was obvious in Honduras that the boycott had been successful. Social movement observers across the country consistently reported empty polling stations as the overwhelming majority of Hondurans made it clear that they considered themselves to be living under a dictatorship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0094582X13492129">Shipley, 2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a handful of foreign governments—with Canada taking the lead— ignored or denied the boycott and used the opportunity to heap legitimacy on the coup government. Peter Kent lauded the Honduran people for engaging in “relatively peaceful and orderly” elections, run “freely and fairly, with a strong turnout, and with no major violence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X13492129">DFAIT, 2009c</xref>). A new president, Porfirio “Pepe” Lobo, was inaugurated and soon recognized by Canada and the United States, while repression and violence continued alongside a rejuvenated neoliberal push. On Lobo’s inauguration day, some 500,000 (1 out of every 16) Hondurans took to the streets in protest. Nonetheless, Peter Kent quickly offered Canada’s congratulations, thanked Lobo for “generously” providing once-President Zelaya safe passage to exile in the Dominican Republic, and continued to play down the repressive character of the regime, now calling the military coup a “political crisis” and Lobo’s regime a “unity government” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X13492129">DFAIT, 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>Kent said nothing about the assassination of Walter Trochez, an LGBT activist in the FNRP, shortly before the inauguration. Further, the journalist-turned-minister made no mention of the crackdown on critical media; the few outlets brave enough to defy the <italic>golpista</italic> line were targeted for violence and had their stations and equipment seized or vandalized by state authorities. On the same day that Peter Kent congratulated Pepe Lobo, he released a statement condemning the Chávez government in Venezuela for closing down six TV stations—evidence, he claimed, “of shrinking democratic space” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0094582X13492129">DFAIT, 2010b</xref>). It is a remarkable contradiction that Kent should lament a lack of democratic space in Venezuela given the utter dearth of democratic space he was celebrating in Honduras.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0094582X13492129">
<title>“A Fruitful Visit” to the Banana Republic</title>
<p>A month later, Kent was in Honduras for high-level talks with Lobo and described his visit as follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X13492129">DFAIT, 2010c</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>I have had a very fruitful visit to Honduras, where I had the opportunity to meet with President Porfirio Lobo and personally congratulate him on becoming President of Honduras. We are pleased to see that President Lobo is beginning the process of national reconciliation, including supporting the formation of a truth commission. This is an important step in healing the wounds created by the recent political impasse and for Hondurans to regain a sense of trust in their country’s democratic institutions.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Notably absent from Kent’s statement was any mention of the ongoing violence being inflicted on Honduran civil society. In fact, the weeks leading up to Kent’s “fruitful visit” were particularly bloody in Honduras. While Kent’s statement was released on February 20, it was preceded by the following series of events: On February 3 the body of Vanessa Zepeda Alonzo, an anticoup activist in the Social Security Employees’ Union, was thrown out of a car in Tegucigalpa. On February 15 gunmen on motorcycles killed Julio Fúnez Benítez, an active member of the Union of Aqueduct and Sewer System Workers, outside his home. On February 17 the critical journalist Enrique Gudiel, from Danlí, found his 17-year-old daughter Dara dead. He had already been given a warning to end his critical broadcasts; his daughter had been kidnapped once before. When Gudiel found her the second time, she had been hanged. Strange fruit, indeed, that Canada’s representative was endorsing in Honduras.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094582X13492129">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>As for the Truth Commission, it was widely and immediately discredited within the Honduran social movement as another piece of the broader project of whitewashing the coup regime. Human rights advocate Bertha Oliva asked at the time, “How can there be reconciliation when the crimes are ongoing?” (interview, May 9, 2012). Nevertheless, the commission was supported by the Canadian government, which even provided a commissioner: Michael Kergin, a former member of the Canadian foreign service and then acting legal consultant for Bennett-Jones, a firm that specializes in energy and resource extraction and has represented Canadian companies such as the infamous Barrick Gold. When the commission’s findings were released and found to contain little more than tepid criticism of the regime, Canada responded with enthusiasm; newly appointed minister Diane Ablonczy expressed hope “that Hondurans will never again experience such an ordeal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X13492129">DFAIT, 2011</xref>), ignoring the fact that the ordeal had not ended.</p>
<p>Manuel Zelaya remained in exile until the signing of the Cartagena Accords in 2011, which changed little in Honduras except that it gave Zelaya the full right of return to Honduras and political amnesty while cementing the international legitimacy of the coup government. In fact, it was on the basis of the Cartagena Accords that Canada successfully lobbied the Organization of American States to have Honduras reinstated as a full member. Even before Zelaya had been allowed to return, while Lobo was still largely isolated in the international community, Canada took the opportunity to negotiate a new free-trade agreement with his regime, with Ambassador Neil Reeder bandying about the prospect of US$700 million in new investment if a deal could be reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0094582X13492129">Spring, 2011</xref>). In fact, Canada broke off 10 years of trade talks with the CA4 coalition (made up of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua) in March 2010 (two months after Lobo’s inauguration) in order to focus on talks with Honduras, aware that the far-right military government would be an ideal partner for the kind of trade negotiations Canada wanted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X13492129">DFAIT, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>A few months after the accords were signed, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper went to visit Lobo to sign the free-trade agreement, which is expected to secure the greatest possible freedom and flexibility for Canadian capital in Honduras, to offer incentives for Canadian businesses that choose to invest in Honduras, to protect Canadian investments against disruptions to their profits by keeping labor and social and environmental codes minimal, and to guarantee a security apparatus that will insulate Canadian businesses from strikes, demonstrations, expropriations, occupations, and other redistributive measures. The details of the free-trade agreement have not yet been released, but the above assumptions are not controversial. Rather, they follow the typical pattern established by Canada’s agreements with Chile, Peru, and Colombia, and they are reflected in a 2005 foreign policy statement that specifically prioritizes the facilitation and protection of profitable foreign investments for Canadian firms by supporting foreign governments that “offer a greater measure of security for Canadian investors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0094582X13492129">Gordon, 2010</xref>: 146–147).</p>

<title>Canadian Capital in Honduras</title>
<p>It is here that Canada’s direct interests in Honduras start to become more apparent and its endorsement of a brutal and illegal regime starts to fit into the model of imperialism that I have described. Pepe Lobo’s rule has seen the low-intensity war against the social movement continue unabated, alongside a calculated push to deepen the neoliberal model that the movement was organized to oppose. Canada’s tacit support for the violent and antidemocratic coup and its leaders makes sense only if we consider the Canadian state to be prioritizing the interests of its business owners. Canadian entrepreneurs and investors already have some US$600 million on the line in Honduras, and that investment is set to increase if profitable conditions can be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X13492129">Gordon, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Canada has been the largest foreign investor in Honduran mining since it arrived in 1998, in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, with a US$100 million aid package tied to the rights of Canadian mining companies to acquire concessions and help establish a new set of mining codes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X13492129">Holly, 2009</xref>). Since that time, Canadian operations have been responsible for some of the country’s worst environmental and public health crises. Aura Minerals’s San Andrés mine has been poisoning the Río Lara water system with cyanide runoff since the early 2000s, and its deforestation projects have virtually destroyed the agricultural base for neighboring communities by rendering the soil infertile and vulnerable to erosion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0094582X13492129">Orellana, 2009</xref>). The combined effects of waterborne epidemics and the collapse of sustainable community food production have made the communities around the mine dependent on the company, and people have, in increasing numbers, taken on the dangerous and poorly paid work that the mine provides.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Goldcorp’s now closed San Martín mine has, in the words of activist Carlos Amador, “condemned the Siria Valley to death” with its cyanide leaching and other toxic contamination of the land and water systems (interview, May 8, 2012). During my last visit to Honduras, the renowned doctor Juan Almendares led a medical brigade to the region and met with people who were drinking water laced with poisonous chemicals, among them arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium, magnesium, chromium, and nickel. Almendares’s patients were suffering from skin diseases and hair loss, and in fact more than 80 percent of the 42,000 people living in the communities surrounding the mine had developed diseases related to Goldcorp’s activities (interview, May 4, 2012). A social-movement-led health tribunal found Goldcorp guilty of massive health violations in 2011, at the same moment that the company was lobbying Canadian MPs to support its operations by participating in a redrafting of Honduran mining laws favorable to the company. Goldcorp, a company currently worth some US$30 billion, has been consistently listed in the Canadian media among its most “socially responsible” companies.</p>
<p>These two cases are reflective of Canada’s broader record on mining in Honduras and, indeed, across the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X13492129">Moore, 2012</xref>). The environmental and public health crises they create are just the beginning; it is worth adding that these concessions are often granted without—or with dubious forms of—consultation from the local, often indigenous communities on whose land these crises fall (Carlos Amador, interview, May 8, 2012). What is more, the work itself is typically brutal and exploitative and falls to underpaid locals who are often met with punishing violence if they try to defend themselves, as in the terrible cases of workers who have been assassinated in retaliation for trying to form unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0094582X13492129">MiningWatch Canada, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Canadian companies like Goldcorp, Aura Minerals, and Breakwater Resources hold an overwhelming majority of Honduras’s mining concessions and had some 150 new concessions ready to be approved when President Zelaya imposed the moratorium (Pedro Landa, interview, May 4, 2012). The coup regime has, predictably, been moving toward lifting the moratorium, and Canada has been invited to help rewrite the mining laws that are a necessary condition for lifting the ban. The new proposals are less progressive than the previous code; they protect the legality of open-pit cyanide-leaching mining, remove environmental protections, reduce taxes on mining companies, limit the scope of public consultations, and restrict public access to information about the operations. But a Canadian government report on the proposed mining code declared, “Honduras is in the process of transformation from the anti-mining Zelaya administration to the pro-sustainable mining and [socially responsible] Lobo government” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X13492129">Moore, 2012</xref>). Indeed, a year earlier, Canadian Ambassador Neil Reeder and Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) representative Daniel Arsenault were in Honduras for meetings with Breakwater Resources about how to influence the direction of the new mining code, and presumably they were successful in their endeavor. Canadian firms are also actively pursuing concessions for other environmentally destructive mega-projects including some two dozen hydroelectric dams on formerly protected rivers.</p>
<p>Canada also has a dominant presence in the Honduran garment industry; Montreal-based Gildan owns Honduras’s largest maquiladoras and is the country’s largest private-sector employer, with more than 18,000 employees. It has also been investigated and accused of systematic sexist, violent, and inhumane treatment of its largely female workforce for well over a decade. Maria Luisa Regalado of the Colectiva de Mujeres Hondureñas (Honduran Women’s Collective—CODEMUH) reports that these women often work up to 11-hour shifts and avoid getting up to go to the bathroom for fear of not meeting their quotas, which are reinforced by dividing the women into “teams” responsible for a certain level of production and punishing them collectively if that level is not met. The result, predictably, is that the women are encouraged to discipline one another to work harder, and as many of them develop serious health problems they are routinely injected with painkillers by company doctors in order to prolong their ability to work. As their bodies collapse and their productivity falls, they are dropped into lower wage categories. When the painkillers are no longer enough, they are often fired without compensation (interview, May 11, 2012).</p>
<p>Like the mining companies mentioned above, Gildan has been lauded in Canada for its social responsibility; CIDA itself participated in the awarding to it of an “ethical responsibility” award in 2004, at precisely the moment that Gildan was shutting down a factory in El Progreso that had been the first plant to have a union. Gildan shifted production to other factories, built and acquired new ones, and has continued to rake in profits—US$89 million in the final quarter of 2012—even as its record of criminal, irresponsible, and exploitative behavior has gotten worse. Investigations by the Washington-based Workers’ Rights Consortium between 2008 and 2011 uncovered the full extent of Gildan’s violence; workers who tried to organize for better conditions were fired, exposed to sector-wide blacklisting, and even threatened with violence and murder. At the Star S.A. plant, for instance, factory managers colluded with a handful of antiunion workers in threatening the lives of workers who were organizing to defend themselves. “It would be cheap to get you all killed” went one of the threats. “They will charge me 5,000 lempiras to kill all six of you.” Given the context of impunity and violence in Honduras, these threats are not to be taken lightly, and the worker who made them was widely known to have a privileged relationship to the factory managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0094582X13492129">Workers’ Rights Consortium, 2012</xref>: 5–10). CODEMUH sent Canadian Prime Minister Harper an open letter in 2011 detailing Gildan’s violations of human rights and international labor laws and asking him to denounce the company’s behavior and refuse to sign the free-trade agreement until Gildan obeyed the law. Undeterred, when Harper visited Honduras to sign the agreement he visited a Gildan factory and praised the company’s conduct there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094582X13492129">Chase, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Canada is also establishing a firm presence in the burgeoning tourist industry, which was among the most vocal supporters of the 2009 coup, engaging in a vigorous letter-writing campaign to persuade the governments of Canada and the United States to support the military regime. While it can be argued that some Global South states have benefited from growth in the tourist trade, Honduras does not fit that mold. Rather, Canadian “entrepreneurs” are snapping up traditional indigenous and Afro-indigenous (Garífuna)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0094582X13492129">2</xref></sup> land to turn it into highly exploitative and destructive resort hotels and retirement communities on Honduras’s Caribbean coast. Among the most notorious figures here is Randy Jorgensen, best known for his chain of Adults Only pornography retail stores and now a North Coast oligarch. Jorgensen has been buying up land near the coastal city of Trujillo in order to build a mega-resort with hotels, shopping centers, and a US$15 million port for cruise ships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0094582X13492129">Paley, 2010</xref>). The land itself is claimed by Garífuna communities that insist that it was sold to Jorgensen by someone falsely claiming to represent them. They argue that Jorgensen’s developments are wreaking havoc on traditional structures, disrupting those communities’ access and infrastructure for fishing, shipping, and a variety of manifestations of cultural life.</p>
<p>Thus the developments are displacing local communities and exploiting their Honduran employees and are creating a market in poorly paid and dangerous prostitution of Honduran women. Advertising for Jorgensen’s Life Vision Properties typically feature bikini-clad women, and interviews with Canadians who visit the region often candidly reveal the extent of degrading sex tourism that comes with these developments. Jorgensen himself was investigated in 2001 for using underage Honduran girls in his pornographic films, and the North Coast region has quickly accumulated the highest rate of HIV/AIDS infection in Central America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0094582X13492129">Paley, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>What is more, the increased presence of foreign capital in the region means an increase in the repressive security apparatus that protects those businesses from reprisals or interference from the dispossessed and disrespected Hondurans who might organize against their intrusions. The deeper militarization of Honduras’s North, then, has led to increased violence against organizers in a variety of different spheres and sectors, especially the ongoing struggle between landless campesino families and the oligarchs who seized their land and now hire private security to keep them away. In September 2012, Antonio Trejo and Eduardo Diaz, two resistance-affiliated lawyers who were working with campesino communities in the Aguán Valley, were assassinated. Trejo’s name, in particular, had been part of countless human rights alerts in the months leading up to his assassination, as he was receiving death threats connected to his work. Meanwhile, the direct clashes between campesinos and police, military, and private security firms have been the catalyst for some of the bloodiest moments since the coup. Nearly 100 campesinos have been killed, and in one attack alone, in June 2011, the community of Rigores was burnt to the ground by a squad of 75 police officers, houses, churches, schoolhouses and all, and no one was ever charged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0094582X13492129">Rights Action, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In fact, the effects of the Canadian state’s support for the interests of these companies go well beyond the immediate concerns of the companies themselves. Typically, the Canadian state does not act directly on behalf of individual companies; rather, it seeks to create a climate that will be amenable to all of its economic interests. It encourages and imposes on Honduras the most intense neoliberal policies it can, together with a security apparatus to enforce those policies, in the knowledge that this will be beneficial to Canadian investors even if it has directly harmful effects on most Hondurans. Indeed, Canadians were prominent among the foreign participants in the Honduras Is Open for Business conference put on by the Honduran government to advertise its willingness to comply with the neoliberal mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0094582X13492129">Meyer, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0094582X13492129">
<title>Honduras is Open for Business</title>
<p>A cursory scan of the new measures approved since the coup speaks to this fact: (1) privatizations across the board—of a variety of state enterprises, of previously protected land or rivers, and even of key seaports such as Puerto Cortés, though which most Honduran exports to North America pass; (2) moves toward the privatization of the education system, not least the teachers’ pension funds, which are now controlled by private banks rather than the teachers’ unions themselves; (3) the reopening of the mining laws in order to grant new concessions; (4) austerity measures for workers in a variety of sectors, including new laws about temporary work, which encourage employers, especially in the maquiladoras, to hire part-time workers in order to pay them less and block them from forming a union (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X13492129">Frank, 2012</xref>); and (5) the passage of antiterrorist laws that give the police unprecedented new powers, especially regarding surveillance and detention. The new antiterrorist laws expand the definition of “terrorist” to include all manner of groups associated with the social movement, including even some human rights organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X13492129">COFADEH, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, new laws allow for the creation of so-called charter cities on Honduran territory, which would give quasi-statehood to the owners of these territorial concessions, including the right to their own laws and police—a proposal developed in a Canadian right-wing think tank called the Macdonald-Laurier Institute. To most Hondurans, the charter city seems little more than direct foreign colonization, but it is being celebrated in the Canadian media: “Canadians are proud of their internationalist credentials, [and this plan] could be a template for doing good work abroad that has lasting effect and that gets the most bang for our buck” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0094582X13492129">Torobin, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Canadian Ambassador Cameron Mackay was quoted in the Honduran media in 2012 talking up Canada’s sterling corporate record and calling Canada a model of social responsibility that Honduran businesses could follow. Often in the same breath, he would mention that the Honduran state needed to do a better job of guaranteeing the security of private (i.e., Canadian) property: “Without security there can be no investment” (<italic>La Tribuna</italic>, February 2, 2012). The subtext is that Canada wants Lobo to crack down harder on dissent, flatten out social instability, and guarantee a placid, exploitable Honduran workforce and environment in which it can do business.</p>
<p>But the resistance remains, and it remains peaceful, though it has been relentlessly harassed and intimidated. As international attention has turned away from Honduras, it has become ever more dangerous for those who do not toe the neoliberal line. Bertha Oliva, director of the Comité de Familiares de Detenidos Desaparecidos en Honduras (Committee of Relatives of the Detained and Disappeared in Honduras—COFADEH), offered me a brief report on politically targeted violence in May 2012: since the coup, 23 journalists killed, along with upwards of 100 campesinos in the Aguán, more than 60 people from the LGBT community, and some 47 lawyers, all without proper investigation. “Three, four, five, six; or more youths killed every single day,” she concluded. “It is impossible to keep track” (interview, May 9, 2012).</p>
<p>These are not exaggerations. On my last visit to Honduras, twice in one week alone I was sitting with activists in the movement when they received news of the assassination of one of their compañeros. When a prison fire in Comayagua earlier this year killed 360 people, many of the dead proved to have been imprisoned, often for political reasons, without having been charged with a crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X13492129">Bird and Spring, 2012</xref>). Women in the resistance are particularly targeted and often suffer sexual violence. Gladys Lanza, a veteran of many decades of feminist organizing in Honduras, reports that since the coup there have been more than 300 women killed every year, and, far from being investigated by the police, the attacks are often carried out by them: “How can we trust the police? Many times it is in police stations where [women] are raped and attacked” (interview, May 7, 2012).</p>
<p>It is clear, then, that Honduras’s deeper neoliberalization under the coup government is being contested by a strong and popular social movement that for the better part of a decade has been expressing very clearly its displeasure with the neoliberal model. The cost of reimposing that neoliberal model is being paid by the very same Hondurans who have struggled against it for so long and many more who were newly politicized by the spectacle of their democratically elected president’s being whisked away in a helicopter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0094582X13492129">
<title>The Consequences of Canadian Imperialism</title>
<p>Canada’s support for the coup government is rooted in a determination that Zelaya’s presidency was too tolerant of the demands of the popular social movements—which run counter to the needs of Canadian capital—and that the new bosses will ensure greater security, flexibility, and profitability for Canadian firms. They are correct, of course. But Canada is pursuing those goals against the will of the Honduran people in a manner that leads directly to—and indeed <italic>relies upon—</italic>violations of their human rights, their right to organize, their right to public consultation, their right to public health and safety, and, ultimately, their right to a sovereign democratic process. In so doing, Canada has declared itself unequivocally an imperial power willing to use its full political, diplomatic, and economic power to create the kind of Honduras that Canadian capital demands.</p>
<p>This is a fact that the Canadian left must confront directly as Canada becomes ever more deeply enmeshed in its imperial projects. Canadian troops are now on the ground in Honduras, ostensibly to participate in counternarcotics campaigns and training exercises (though their presence is shrouded in Harper government secrecy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0094582X13492129">Huffington Post, 2012</xref>), and reports from Honduras suggest that the real purpose of the Canadian presence is to develop the Honduran military’s capacity to carry out the kinds of counterinsurgency operations that it “perfected” in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Equally troubling is Canada’s participation in Honduras’s recently established police reform commission. Few in Honduras would deny that the institution of the police is utterly corrupt from top to bottom, but when I spoke to the renowned Honduran historian Victor Meza, who is chairing the commission, I got the distinct impression that, however progressive its intentions, the commission was destined to fail. On the one hand, it could be made toothless by threats and violence against the commissioners. On the other, it could help justify an overhaul of the police that would even further orient the institution toward the protection of private property—especially foreign capital—and foster better coordination with the military in the realm of counterinsurgency (Victor Meza, interview, May 10, 2012). Surely it is no coincidence that the two foreign countries invited to contribute commissioners were Canada and Chile, Honduras’s two largest investors in mining.</p>
<p>In sum, Canada has partnered with a brutal, violent, and corrupt regime that seeks to break the will of reform-oriented social movements in order to impose a kind of hyper-neoliberalism, and it is actively assisting the Honduran state in developing the legal architecture and repressive capacity to do so. I have argued here that the Canadian state is pursuing this agenda to serve the interests of Canadian capital, with little regard for the human tragedies upon which this agenda relies. The Honduran case, moreover, is not isolated; rather, it fits into the trajectory of Canada’s new role in international affairs, alongside the 10-year war in Afghanistan, participation in the occupation of Iraq, repeated military invasions of Haiti, selective bombing of particular Middle Eastern states repressing their respective “Arab Springs,” and countless instances of cooperation with local agents engaged in violence, torture, and other violations of human rights.</p>
<p>It is clear that the most dramatic manifestations of this new international position have taken place under the Conservative government of Stephen Harper, but it is also true that, even in Honduras, the foundations for this shift were laid as early as the mid-1990s, well before the Conservatives came to power. Therefore, while opposition must focus on the present government, it would be incomplete and unsatisfactory to imagine that a change in the ruling party in Ottawa would be sufficient to address the problem. This trend should be troubling, especially to those of us situated in Canadian institutions, and it is my contention that identifying this new dynamic as an imperialist project is a necessary first step in confronting and ultimately reversing it. Last year, the Canadian senator Gerry St. Germain visited Honduras to champion the proposal for charter cities, proclaiming that it was a “historic moment” for the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0094582X13492129">Ordóñez, 2011</xref>). If he is correct, let us be certain that we are on the right side of history.</p>
