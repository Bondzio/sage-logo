<p>As we embark on a new year, we also mark the 39th anniversary of the <italic>Journal of Communication Inquiry</italic>. One of the first of its kind to recognize the importance of philosophical and evaluative critical inquiry in communication, <italic>JCI</italic> continues to publish cutting-edge research that spans disciplines. As <italic>JCI</italic> approaches four decades of critical communication inquiry, it is worthwhile to point out the current triumphs we have seen in the past year as well as the struggles still faced.</p>
<p>In the United States, the beginning of 2013 marks the second term of President Barack Obama, a time when the number of states supporting marriage equality expands nation-wide, and as a country we have shown forward-thinking initiative on issues such as access to health care and continued democratic protest toward corporate greed and corruption. Yet 2013 is also met with a United States divided on issues ranging from global warming and discussions regarding rights over women’s bodies, to most recently—gun control—or a lack thereof. It seems that for nearly all of the progress we may make socially as a society, we still return to many of the same outdated political debates we have had for decades—all the while relying on many of the same capitalistic, patriarchal institutions that create the problems that as a society so many of us now recognize. The world may have survived predictions of the “Mayan Apocalypse,” but in the United States and elsewhere, it remains full of uncertainty and seemingly on the verge of many changes.</p>
<p>Just as the country - and in fact much of the world - may be faced with social paradoxes of advancement and regression, the articles in this issue seem to reflect a two-steps-forward and one-step-back examination of popular media. Though they may not be many of the same issues currently occupying space in the political landscape, they are a compilation of timely and relevant topics that accurately demonstrate how far we as society and media system have come, yet just how far we have to go.</p>
<p>In the first article, Avery Holton presents an analysis of mediated constructions of mental health issues in a popular American sitcom. In this context, the author examines autism—a disorder that we are only beginning to understand, despite the fact that nearly 1 in every 88 children is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012: <italic>Autism Spectrum Disorders [ASDs]: Data and Statistics</italic>. Retrieved from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/NCBDDD/autism/data.html">http://www.cdc.gov/NCBDDD/autism/data.html</ext-link>). Although this analysis demonstrates attempts at an understanding and normalizing mental health disorders and those affected by it, ultimately we continue to see those with mental health disorders as “Othered” and outside the mainstream. This analysis of mediated constructions of mental health has particular relevance during the recent media landscape following the horrific mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, an event that roused a significant amount of discussion surrounding the state of mental health care awareness and services.</p>
<p>Two articles in this issue identify the exclusion and institutionalized bias that the African American community has faced and continues to face in the United States and the ways in which we see this demonstrated through the mass media. Amanda Davis Gatchett and Dana Cloud examine the Black Panther movement through the well-known (in this case biblical) rhetoric of the oppressed versus the hegemonic mainstream, while the most recent campaign of President Barack Obama is viewed in terms of media coverage discussing concerns of African American voters in the article by April Copes.</p>
<p>Jessica Birthisel and Jason Martin examine popular culture portrayals of the contemporary American workplace through the television program “The Office” in the final journal article. Although the corporate climate may have changed significantly over the past several decades, this piece suggests that even media representations that attempt to break the norm may still be doing more to reinforce traditional workplace roles than push boundaries.</p>
<p>The struggles for social advancement evident in this issue and present in the media landscape remind us to continue engaging in thoughtful discussion and research toward equality and understanding. <italic>JCI</italic> has a rich history of encouraging critical research that questions and challenges widely accepted social and cultural positions and norms. I hope that the articles in this issue—as well as those throughout all of 2013—fulfill the core values of the journal in representing meaningful research and voices that are so often otherwise not heard in traditional mainstream media formats.</p>
 <p>Lastly, as this is my first issue as managing editor, I would like to sincerely thank the former editor, Hye Jin Lee, for her assistance and advice in running the journal. In addition, I extend much gratitude to the readers, authors, and reviewers for their commitment to <italic>JCI</italic> and critical communication research. I am honored to be a part of this journal, and continue to learn every day. I look forward to the scholarship of the year to come.</p>
