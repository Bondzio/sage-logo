<p>The history of sociology has become a thriving subfield in Europe and Britain while U.S. sociologists continue to ignore it except incidentally. This is partly because there are few courses on the proper history of the discipline (as opposed to the history of its theories), therefore no reason for textbooks in that area, and no need for faculty. Psychology, by contrast, teaches the history of its field regularly, so publishers have provided a slew of suitable textbooks and monographs. Faculty who specialize in the history of that discipline are not rare. <italic>The Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences</italic> features far more articles on psychology, of course, than on sociology; and the short-lived journal, <italic>History of Sociology</italic>, during the 1980s was at that time impossible to sustain financially. There were plenty of submissions for publication but few academic libraries willing to foot the bill. This means that when histories of U.S. sociology are currently written, the authors are most often historians proper whose work flies under the flag of “intellectual history.” Some of these scholars do superb work, but one wishes that an historian of a given field would have enough education within it to feel at home there, rather than passing through as an interested visitor.</p>
<p>So it is that a Lecturer (i.e., Assistant Professor) at York University in the United Kingdom, Chris Renwick (PhD, Leeds, 2009), based in the history department, has decided to specialize in the complex story of biology’s impact on the nascent social sciences of the nineteenth century. He has covered sociology in this book and will presumably move to economics in his next one. The story in outline is simple, and little known in the United States. The first sociology chair in Britain went to L.T. Hobhouse in 1907 at the London School of Economics, who simultaneously took over the editorship of Britain’s only sociology journal, <italic>The Sociological Review</italic>. Hobhouse is mentioned today as a political theorist, but his work was broader than that. Renwick explains how debates were being held since the 1870s among learned societies, like The British Association for the Advancement of Science, on the question of “what to do about sociology”—which in practical terms meant either that of Spencer or Comte. Political-economy was being attacked for its narrowness and improbable domain assumptions, and it was thought that sociology could cure its ills, while also showing how to reconstruct society along lines that would ease class tensions.</p>
<p>But far more importantly, Francis Galton and Patrick Geddes were both pushing hard to integrate genetics and biological theorizing into the social sciences, and were having some success among scholars and the public. Followers of Galton and Geddes himself stood in hot contention for the sociology chair that Hobhouse won, and in the latter’s inaugural speech, he firmly swept aside the claims that biological reductionism had been making on sociology during the preceding years. His orientation was instead toward political philosophy, the philosophy of history, the natural sciences, and political-economy as inspired by Adam Smith (p. 170). Sociology was to earn its keep by providing the British government and other interested parties with scientifically tenable solutions to social problems, and Hobhouse’s approach, not Galton’s nor Geddes’, would, he claimed, succeed in that.</p>
<p>Renwick’s book is clearly written, well documented, and gives all the information that modern sociologists might want about Galton’s eugenics program and Geddes’ “biosocial science of civics,” in addition to a precis of Hobhouse’s triumphant counter-program. It also, of course, illuminates obvious parallels between our own gene-obsessed intellectual period and that of the Victorians. As Steve Fuller correctly says in his foreword, “This is history of science at its best.”</p>
