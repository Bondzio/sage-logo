<p>Robert W Cox is one of the most influential thinkers in international relations and global governance studies. After a successful 25-year career at the International Labour Organization (ILO), he took an appointment as Professor of International Organization at Columbia University in New York. Some seven years later he took a position in York University’s Political Science Department, where he remained until 1996 when he became emeritus.</p>
<p>Cox is an independent scholar who resists categorization. His work highlights tensions and contradictions rather than continuity and permanence. To understand these tensions Cox examines broad historical shifts or Braudel’s <italic>longue durée</italic>, and draws from a wide range of thinkers which are outside disciplinary bounds of international relations. As a result, Cox’s work offers tools to pose new questions on the puzzles of our time, in particular to ask questions about social forces from the bottom up and the relation to broader global shifts.</p>
<p>Some of Cox’s most influential publications include <italic>Approaches to World Order</italic> (1996), <italic>Production, Power and World Order: Social Forces in the Making of History</italic> (1987), and ‘Social forces, states and world orders’ in <italic>Millennium: Journal of International Studies</italic> 10(2), 1981.</p>
<p>The following interview took place at the Balsillie School of International Affairs, in Waterloo, Ontario, July 2012.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Sarah J Martin:</speaker>
<p>Thinking about change has been a theme of your work. Your present project is to write your memoirs and reflect on the changes you have witnessed over the course of your life. In <italic>The Political Economy of the Plural World</italic> (2002), you wrote: ‘A book as a stage in the process in which the author has developed thinking over some years through changing social and political milieus’. With that in mind, could you tell me a bit about your background and how you came to think about the changes you have witnessed?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Robert Cox:</speaker>
<p>I think that quotation represents the way I approach thinking about things. It is an historical approach. I resist the idea of writing things about political economy that sound as if they are definitive depictions of a state of affairs. The meaning of that quotation is that we have to think about ourselves as living in a continually changing world.</p>
</speech>
<p>So how did I come to have these kinds of thoughts?</p>
<p>I went to university fairly young. I was 14 or 15 when I started at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. My family was not wealthy and could not have afforded to send me to university, but fortunately I received a scholarship. I thought I should study something that would equip me to earn money for the future. So I went into business school, which was called the Faculty of Commerce at McGill in those days. During the first year I decided to switch over to the Faculty of Arts to study history. The future would have to look after itself. That was my first major change in direction.</p>
<p>For my master’s thesis, I was very much interested in the development of nationalism in French Canada. My professor of Canadian history [Prof. John Irwin Cooper] advised me to pick an election to analyse as an historical project. I picked the Quebec election of 1886. It occurred at a critical time. Quebec politics used to be owned by an elite of lawyers and notaries within a rural society, predominantly influenced by the [Catholic] church. In 1886 this traditional elite was overturned and a new party the <italic>Parti National</italic> led by Honoré Mercier was swept to power. It was period of radical change.</p>
<p>I like to think my study was an anticipation of the French <italic>Annales</italic> School’s approach. Of course, I had never heard of the <italic>Annales</italic> School at the time [1945]. They work with the idea of the synchronic and the diachronic. The synchronic is everything that happens during a particular time, and how it may be interrelated. The diachronic means change over time. In effect, I was treating the election of 1886 as an <italic>Annales</italic>-type analysis without being aware of it.</p>
<p>When I finished my degree, I received a call from the Principal of the university, Cyril James, to interview with the ILO. The ILO was located at McGill University during the [Second World] war due to a sequence of events. At the beginning of the war, the ILO had moved the office from Geneva to Vichy, France. When France was being overrun by the German invasion, suddenly the group in Vichy had to be saved. The ILO Director-General, John Winant, wanted to take the ILO to the United States. The Roosevelt administration said you can come to the United States but you can’t stay. The neutrality policy of America at that time made Roosevelt unwilling to grant asylum to an international body like the ILO. So Winant approached his friend Dr Wilder Penfield, on the faculty of McGill, to see if the ILO might come to Canada. Penfield got the agreement of the Principal of McGill and spoke to Mackenzie King [then Prime Minister of Canada] and [in 1940] the ILO was located at McGill.</p>
<p>When the Principal called me, he told me that the ILO was planning its return to Geneva to begin its post-war life and it was recruiting. He referred me to someone in the ILO to be interviewed. I was interviewed and was offered a post as a junior professional. I was delighted to go. My involvement with French Canadian nationalism made me an odd man out in the Anglophone part of Quebec.</p>
<p>Shortly after joining the ILO, the new ILO Director-General, David Morse, asked me to join the <italic>cabinet</italic> (the ILO was structured on the French administrative model). The <italic>cabinet</italic> was the Director-General’s personal staff. I was in the <italic>cabinet</italic> for the next decade or more. Morse was moving around the world and talking with the senior political people in the different countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America and I accompanied him on many of those trips.</p>
<p>When Morse decided to leave the ILO, after a quarter of a century in office, I was unsure whether I should leave or not. Morse had a brilliant career and the ILO had just been awarded the Nobel Prize under his leadership [1969]. It was an appropriate moment for him to withdraw, especially given the political division within the United States regarding Morse’s stand on Cold War issues, which meant that often he could not count on his own country for support. The year before Morse left, I asked for an extended leave to teach at the Graduate Institute of International Studies, part of the University of Geneva.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>What did you teach?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>I taught a course on international organizations. The question was whether international organizations were going to become a legitimate centre of authority. As a result of the experience with the League of Nations, and ultimately, with the Second World War, [international organizations] had really lost all authority as organizations. [They were just conferences of governments.] Whether an international organization could become a legitimate authority in the world as a whole was the first issue. The second issue was how international organizations would be able to serve the world. Within the ILO it was a question of producing social equity.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>How did the conversations you had with people around the world apply to these two points – international organizations working towards both becoming legitimate and producing social equity?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>The ILO had existed for a quarter of a century, and it had built up a series of international conventions that were open to ratification by governments. Great Britain had been the principal influence in the creation of the ILO and was a leader in promoting the making of international conventions. Britain had a certain interest as a major trading nation in preventing labour conditions and wages from being a factor in trade competition. It was in Britain’s interest to establish a legal framework that would raise the wages of other workers around the world so that British workers would not be undercut by cheaper labour abroad. This economic interest, as well as support for labour’s efforts at improvement of conditions, led to the adoption of whole series of conventions designed to standardize social policy throughout the world. When I was travelling around the world what became obvious to me was that you could not just standardize because the cultural differences and the historical differences of societies were so great. You had to really think about the different societies and how nations could be developed so as to benefit labour rather than by simply adopting certain standards. That led me to understand that some of the traditional work of the ILO was of limited validity now that the ILO’s membership covered the whole world. The approach when the ILO’s membership was limited to a group of mainly developed countries was no longer valid.</p>
</speech>
<p>There were some people within the ILO whose careers were anchored in the labour standards approach. One person who was very much entrenched in this approach was elected to become the Director-General when Morse withdrew. Since my own thinking had developed so differently, it became difficult for me to work with him.</p>
<p>So that’s what led to my resignation [in 1972]. I had an invitation from Columbia University to teach and stayed there for a few years. It was a good experience. The American university was a place where you could think your own thoughts. The United States has an all-absorbing kind of ideology, and as a foreigner, I was trying to become more understanding of what that country was all about as the big power, knowing I was not part of it. It was at Columbia that I began to consider myself as a universal foreigner. People who talk about being citizens of the world are not realistic because the world is not, or at any rate not yet, an entity of which you can be a citizen. You are always a foreigner. If I ever publish my memoirs will be under the title of universal foreigner.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>Susan Strange described you as an eccentric in the best sense of the word, ‘a loner, a fugitive from the intellectual camps of victory, both Marxist and liberal’. You are outside, but at the same time, you have been engaged with contemporary debates. Can you talk about your intellectual influences?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>There were two major influences. One would have been the primarily American academics whom I met as director of the ILO’s Institute for Labour Studies in Geneva. The idea [of the institute] was to pursue independent research not determined by the ILO programme, but research concerned with the evolution of the world in terms of its social structure and social policy, and to identify what sort of problems were likely to be coming up. During that time there was a group of Americans who would come to Geneva to conduct research on the United Nations. One in particular, Harold Jacobson from the University of Michigan, became a very close friend and we wrote a book together [Cox, Robert Warburton and Harold Karan Jacobson, <italic>The Anatomy of Influence: Decision Making in International Organizations</italic>, New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1974]. There are many others, for example Ernst Haas and Inis Claude. These were people who were writing and publishing about international organizations and I became part of that group. In the long run they were good friends more than intellectual influences.</p>
</speech>
<p>The other aspect was in my own thinking. I tended to pick up ideas that interested me. For example, Collingwood, who would have been unknown to that group of Americans. He wrote about the ‘inside’ and the ‘outside’ of history.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1468018113484564">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Understanding what is ‘inside’ was left out of the major schools of social science thought. They studied objects, objectifying thought as well as everything else. I was more inclined to an historical approach, to understand the thoughts which moved history. Those are the two aspects intellectually of my development during that period.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>You wrote, ‘if you want to ask where the world is going you have to get out of the way of disciplinary thinking’. Your interests guided you rather than pursuing a PhD.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>For many years I tried to find a way to write a doctoral dissertation. I never had time to do that – from university I went directly to work in the ILO – but in retrospect perhaps maybe it wasn’t a bad thing. I never did get involved in a disciplinary way of work. My way of finding myself was through the thoughts of thinkers that I found congenial and revealing to me. My reading was entirely on my own initiative. I didn’t follow a syllabus and so it was an interest which led me from one person to another. How many people ever go back to Vico? And yet I found Vico an amazing source.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1468018113484564">2</xref></sup> How many reading lists include Pierre Teilhard de Chardin?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1468018113484564">3</xref></sup> It was discovering these people’s ideas that was my way of recompensing for not having done the formal work of a PhD.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>A key issue that you are often cited for is the distinction between critical theory and problem solving. How do you view this distinction in relation to social policy?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>It is a question of difference, not one being better than the other. In a way, it takes you back to the diachronic and synchronic dimensions. Problem solving is what you do in the synchronic dimension, but it’s not much help understanding the diachronic dimension. My own thinking is much more directed to the diachronic way of thought, but I don’t want to diminish the practical importance of the synchronic way of thinking because that’s going on most of the time. People are encountering problems and they have to be solved within the frameworks of society as it exists. Some of those problems may be of the type that is indicative of either a need for or an actual process of transformation. That is where the difference between the diachronic and synchronic becomes more difficult to handle. You can’t just apply problem solving to the movement of history.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>What are the critical issues in contemporary global social policy?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>Growing inequality is an enormous issue and probably the basis of many of our problems. It is a question of poverty and the way in which social policy can reach parts of the population. We are seeing more and more alienation, and institutions are irrelevant to many people, particularly in politics. More and more people have no hopes or don’t place hopes on political change at all. They reluctantly come out and vote in elections and this suggests that people don’t see [voting] as a way out.</p>
</speech>
<p>That is why you get these explosions in society like the Occupy movement. In the United States this is most significant because this is the country that presents itself, to itself, as the ultimate democratic society. And yet, you can see the people don’t seem to feel being any part of a functioning society. Alienation, in that broad sense, is a major issue. Alienation and inequality feed on each other.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>In <italic>Political Economy of the Plural World</italic>, you commented on 9/11 that surprise and secrecy are the weapons of the weak and those who challenge the legitimacy of a constituted power.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>9/11 was a case of surprise. You have the most fully developed military power in the world surprised. Now there are conspiracy theories developing that it was all manufactured to justify a new kind of regime which is developing now. It is turning what one used to think of as a democratic United States into a system that is spying on everybody. It has facilities, like the drones, to punish just on the say so of some authority without the whole messy process of law and adjudication. 9/11 is given as justification for a number of changes that have reduced the real freedom of people by building a state in which the military and other linked agencies are capable of doing things that were never conceived of by democratic systems. You are creating enormous power within the state. The military industrial complex has become uncontrollable by the President and, in fact, absorbs the President of the United States.</p>
</speech>
<p>The whole Obama experience has been very interesting. Obama came in on a popular wave with anticipations of radical change. That change manifestly became impossible at certain points. There are some minimal changes in health care, but the social aspect has been frozen while the control over people has been magnified.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>What do you mean by ‘the social aspect has been frozen’?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>Nothing has been done to alleviate the growing inequality in society. Even on the issue of health [in the US], a basic social policy issue, it has been manifestly impossible to do more than the minimal change. There has been a progressive diminishing of social protections. Inequality is becoming greater rather than less. There are no policies to hinder [inequality] and the policies that are enforced encourage it.</p>
</speech>
<p>The Occupy movement is a bubble that comes up from below, or a series of bubbles that come up and burst and they are evidence that all is not well. Society is in a state of disbelief in the mediating power of government. The protests take an anonymous form. There is no programme, no organization, no leadership, but there is evidence that all is not well – people are hurting and protesting. The protest cannot form any kind of coherent pattern. Society is not hanging together the way it used to.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>Why hasn’t there been more pushback?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>The answer is the alienation from our own institutions. In the recent American campaigns for the Republican candidacy, all kinds of weird things are being said by politicians to attract one kind of rabble or another but with no thought of social programmes. I think that people don’t believe in politics anymore.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>To follow up on this alienation from institutions – is an institution a permanent fixture of society, or can it be replaced? What do you mean by an institution?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>Institutions are temporary permanents; they are what people have to hold on to for the structure of their society. Their strength is when people recognize them to be such that they feel they are part of them, not by being employed in them, but because institutions are there to serve them, to keep order and to help them. When people start thinking these institutions are alien from them, then they lose their legitimacy and societies are open to revolt. There is no leadership and there are no programmes; it is a very sick and degraded society you are left with.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>If institutions are ‘temporary permanents’ and thus always part of society, perhaps reformed, perhaps they come and go, what might be next?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>That is what the word reform means – taking a new form. There are ways in which that is done. Sometimes we can’t see what the shape of society might be. That means that people no longer really believe in the institutions; the whole idea of social and political structure has been degraded. It is reformed by revolution or by a more coherent programme of reform; but it takes the basis of what we have as institutions and reshapes them. That is gradual historical change, something we don’t see happening right now. We are in a potentially dangerous state, almost sleepiness, somnolence. When are we going to wake up?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>We’ve been talking about the rising gap between rich and poor and the issue of inequality. You wrote in <italic>Approaches to World Order</italic> (1996) that crises occur with rising inequality. What evidence of crisis do you see?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>There is evidence of crisis in the popular revolts in Italy and Greece. It shows that people have realized the society has broken down. They are protesting more coherently than the Occupy movement in the United States. Certainly there are lots of domestic issues in China and Russia. All around the world there is a tension with the existing structures of politics and society. Where it is apparently quiet, I think it is roiling underneath.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>You describe the Occupy movement as a bubble that came up but didn’t move things very much and suggest that there are perhaps more bubbles.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>The American political system does not really provide a vehicle [for this kind of protest]; the parties are useless. They are used to talking with each other and arguing with each other, but they really don’t come to grips with this bubbling of protests in society.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>Your work allows for the posing of new questions and perspectives on the complexities and contradictions of our age. What are the new questions we should be asking?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>Today, one question is about globalization. One sense of globalization is a process that will encompass the whole world and bring about institutions and social structures that encompass everyone, in the sense that they become uniform for the whole world. Capitalism is the economic process pulling it all together. Those who believe globalization is the way to go will favour this gradual unification process. My own feeling is to react against that idea by emphasizing the individuality of cultures and being negative about homogenizing them into one globalized form. That leads to the question of world order becoming based upon a process of understanding of differences among peoples, and a continuing ability to revise that understanding among a series of different cultures that are politically represented in the form of states or alliances, rather than forming one ‘Empire’, which seems to be the meaning Hardt and Negri gave to the term.</p>
</speech>
<p>I see two alternatives. One is a world of different civilizations that learn how to live together, each developing its own value system, its own institutions, its own forms of social structure, but able to live with the other civilizations in some tolerable way. This probably cannot be represented in some definitive institution. What I am thinking of is a form of continual negotiation.</p>
<p>The other possibility is that ‘Empire’ becomes dominant. This is not the empire of Hardt and Negri, but is the empire of George W Bush – the development of American power to absorb the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Those two ideas are contradictory. What I see emerging is catastrophic confrontation between the American ‘Empire’ and the unifying counterforce of Eurasia. In this confrontation, the Pentagon is the real power in the American ‘Empire’. The President of the United States becomes the face of power. The threat of the Pentagon is arousing the unification of Eurasia, a growing sense of solidarity between China, Russia and the republics of Central Asia. They have formed their own common institutional forms of cooperation in reaction to the build-up of American power, and are carrying out joint military exercises.</p>
<p>This is really going back to the vision of Halford Mackinder [and his Heartland theory]<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1468018113484564">4</xref></sup> of an almost inevitable conflict between the two – Eurasia confronting what is now the American ‘Empire’. There are dangerous incidents in the making that could trigger this catastrophe. Is Israel going to bomb Iran and thereby provoke the enlargement of that crisis of the United States confronting Eurasia? This seems quite possible. The idea of a harmonious, tolerant coexistence of civilizations is comforting, but the odds are on a more catastrophic outcome.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>You have proposed two contradictory alternatives, a geopolitical conflict shaped along the fractures laid out by Mackinder’s Heartland thesis and a more harmonious existence shaped by constant negotiations and shaped by tolerance rather than conflict. What questions would be helpful to ask to understand these two alternatives?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>The question is whether we accept the idea of a plural world – that is the basic issue. Unfortunately, the Pentagon–industrial complex has excluded that because they think in terms of supreme universal control. If you look at a map and the way Mackinder’s Heartland has been surrounded; and the pressure on the Eurasian Heartland moves from the Middle East to Southeast Asia. The Eurasian centre has not been provoking [conflict], but they have been showing resistance. The Russians resist when it comes to Georgia; they are sensitive; both sides understand the nature of the struggle, but this struggle is never mentioned in the popular press or by politicians.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>What questions do you wish you had asked?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>My historical way of approaching things doesn’t fix on a particular event. It sees a general tendency. What I think would be a way of saving things would be if people were more conscious of what was going on in the broad picture. The build-up of this confrontation is taking place and yet one gets diverted by particular issues. Israel is concerned to expand its territory; there’s division amongst the Arab countries; and the Iranians are involved in the civil war in Syria. So you have a focus on local conflicts while the broadest issue – what is going to happen to the world – could build up into a catastrophic confrontation.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>You highlight the potential of military conflict, yet there are other issues that are global, such as climate change – and you mentioned growing inequality. These are also broad questions.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>If we are to deal with the problem of the biosphere – and I agree with you, that’s the real problem about the end of the world – I think the way in which we can deal with that is through this notion of a plural world. Once the major countries come to a tolerant understanding of each other, then they can collectively face the biosphere problem. But the other approach building up to catastrophic confrontation is completely destructive of the biosphere. It accelerates the emission of gasses that destroy the biosphere and it diverts attention from the problem of a weakening biosphere. None of this is highlighted in any way in public opinion or by the programmes being developed by think tanks.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>To be effective, it seems to me social forces need to work against something or someone. In the past, social forces worked against, for example, the ‘the boss’ or industrial processes.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>The social forces themselves are so fragmented now you can’t talk about a class structure anymore. The working class is not one class anymore. It has been fragmented by technology. There’s no sense of the solidarity that you could evoke in the 19th and 20th century. That’s gone. The leadership is no different. There are different kinds of leaders in terms of ideology, in terms of the organizations they control and the kinds of socio-political activism they are engaged in. The old idea of class conflict no longer applies. Now, as I see it, the question is about whether we can take on the military–industrial complex [which incidentally President Eisenhower warned us about long ago]. Are you going to support the continuing build-up? It is based on fear of other people, and has to generate and build on that fear. That comes to control the workings of the political system. It is a huge problem to unravel. I don’t see anywhere that there are political parties or specific social movements that tackle the issue as I understand it.</p>
</speech>
<p>If they begin to agree on their understanding of what the issue is, then possibly out of that will come some ideas of organizational structure and leadership and theories and programmes that can rally people. But right now it is part of that alienation of society in general.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>How has this atmosphere changed in Canada?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>RC:</speaker>
<p>It is very disappointing, I think back to the Pearsonian era [Lester Pearson, Prime Minister of Canada 1963–1968]. Canada thought of itself as having a mission in the world, which would have fit in with this idea of a plural world. Now it has become a matter of alignment. Canada does not stand in between rivals anymore – we are with one of the rivals. By being in the middle, Canada could build, and for a moment, stop, think and promote negotiation. But now it’s all <italic>rah rah rah</italic>. It is interesting the way [the Government of Canada] has revived the War of 1812, and the symbolic ways they are building up a sense of latent militarism in the service of the American alliance.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>SJM:</speaker>
<p>It reminds me of one of your most well-known quotes – theory is always for someone. History is also always for someone. This rewriting of Canada’s history and highlighting the War of 1812 is accompanied by the erasure and end of peacekeepers that were spearheaded by Pearson during the Suez Canal Crisis.</p>
</speech>
<speech>

<p>The Canadian era I remember was one where Canada looked to Europe and looked to Asia. Canadians once thought of themselves as world people, placing maple leaf flags on their backpacks so as not to be mistaken for Americans. Now Canada has been enclosed within North America.</p>

<p>‘Oxford philosopher and historian RG Collingwood pointed out that events have both an “inside” and an “outside”. We can think of the “outside”, which is recorded by the external observer, as a given, as data. The “inside”, which the historian seeks to understand, is the thought behind the event, which makes it a “fact”, something that has been made’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468018113484564">Cox, 2007</xref>: 514).</p>

<p>‘Teilhard de Chardin, introduced the term noösphere to the study of evolution, … the sphere of thought that emerged from and became superimposed upon the biosphere or sphere of life … the concept of the noösphere, and the historical differentiation of forms of consciousness, offers a valuable approach to defining the problem of mutual understanding that besets our sense of “the international” today’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468018113484564">Cox, 2007</xref>: 517).</p>
