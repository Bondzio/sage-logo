<abstract>
<p>Hillel Steiner’s left-libertarian theory of justice is the most serious recent attempt to reconcile the ideals of (luck-egalitarian) equality and freedom. This attempt consists in an argument that a universal right to equal freedom, which in Steiner’s view means also a universal right to maximal freedom, implies a universal right to self-ownership and to an egalitarian share of the world’s natural resources. In this article, I argue that this argument fails on Steiner’s own terms. I argue that, on Steiner’s conceptions of freedom, self-ownership, and an egalitarian share of the world’s natural resources, insofar as the right to equal freedom implies the right to self-ownership and to an egalitarian share of the world’s natural resources, it is incompatible with (luck-egalitarian) equality.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Left-libertarianism in general and Hillel Steiner’s version of it in particular have received a lot of critical attention lately (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470594X12460638">Curchin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470594X12460638">De Wijze et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470594X12460638">Fried, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470594X12460638">Quong, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470594X12460638">Risse, 2004</xref>). Left-libertarianism is a theory, or rather a family of theories, of distributive justice that is usually characterized as vesting all moral agents with two foundational rights: (1) a right to self-ownership and (2) a right to an egalitarian share of the world’s natural resources. By virtue of its commitment to these two rights, sometimes it is characterized also as an attempt to reconcile equality and a particular important sphere of freedom delineated by the right to self-ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470594X12460638">Quong, 2011</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1470594X12460638">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>However, as opposed to other versions of left-libertarianism, on Steiner’s version the right to self-ownership and the right to an egalitarian share of the world’s natural resources are not really foundational. On his version, there is only one foundational right by which these two rights are said to be implied: a right to equal freedom, which in Steiner’s view means also a right to maximal freedom.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470594X12460638">2</xref>
</sup> Thus, Steiner’s left-libertarianism is a much more ambitious project. It is not an attempt to reconcile (luck-egalitarian) equality and merely a particular important sphere of freedom delineated by the right to self-ownership. Instead, it is an attempt to reconcile (luck-egalitarian) equality and freedom <italic>tout court</italic>. Indeed, it is the most serious recent attempt to reconcile these two ideals.</p>
<p>In this article, I will examine Steiner’s left-libertarianism in light of the latter objective and argue that it fails on his own terms. I will argue that, on Steiner’s conceptions of freedom, self-ownership, and an egalitarian share of the world’s natural resources, insofar as the right to equal freedom implies the right to self-ownership and the right to an egalitarian share of the world’s natural resources, it is incompatible with (luck-egalitarian) equality.</p>

<sec id="section2-1470594X12460638">
<title>Freedom, self-ownership, and an egalitarian share of the world’s natural resources</title>
<p>Our first task, then, is to find out what Steiner means exactly by ‘freedom’, ‘self-ownership’, and an ‘egalitarian share of the world’s natural resources’.</p>
<sec id="section3-1470594X12460638">
<title>Freedom</title>
<p>Let us start with freedom. On Steiner’s conception of freedom (1994: 6–42; 2001):<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>A person (<italic>P</italic>) is free to perform a certain action (<italic>x</italic>) if, and only if, <italic>P</italic> is not unfree to <italic>x</italic>.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>P</italic> is unfree to <italic>x</italic> if, and only if, <italic>P</italic>’s <italic>x</italic>-ing is, or would be, rendered physically impossible by an action of another person.</p>
</list-item>
</list>The most famous (some would say infamous) feature of this conception is, undoubtedly, the one that says that in order for <italic>P</italic> to be unfree to <italic>x</italic>, <italic>P</italic>’s <italic>x</italic>-ing has to be rendered physically impossible. For the question with which we are concerned in this article, however, two other features are much more important. The first of these is the one that says that only other people's actions (as opposed to their omissions) can make <italic>P</italic> unfree to <italic>x</italic>. The second is the one that says that <italic>P</italic> is free to <italic>x</italic> so long as <italic>P</italic> is not unfree to <italic>x</italic> – given the other features of this conception, this means that when <italic>P</italic> is merely unable to <italic>x</italic> (that is, when <italic>P</italic>’s inability is not a result of someone else’s action), <italic>P</italic> is free to <italic>x</italic>.</p>

<sec id="section4-1470594X12460638">
<title>Self-ownership</title>
<p>As for the right to self-ownership, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X12460638">Steiner (1994</xref>: 232) subscribes to GA Cohen’s following characterization of it:
<disp-quote>
<p>Each person is the morally rightful owner of himself. He possesses over himself, as a matter of moral right, all those rights that a slaveholder has over a complete chattel slave as a matter of legal right, and he is entitled, morally speaking, to dispose over himself in the way such a slaveholder is entitled, legally speaking, to dispose over his slave. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470594X12460638">Cohen, 1986</xref>: 109)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1470594X12460638">
<title>An egalitarian share of the world’s natural resources</title>
<p>What about the right to an egalitarian share of the world’s natural resources? On Steiner’s view, this right means that each person is entitled to a per capita share of the total value of the world’s natural resources. Now, this might already look like a poor attempt to reconcile freedom and (luck-egalitarian) equality which is not worth further examination. That is because such a distribution of the world’s natural resources will result in massive inequalities (on any of the various currencies found in the luck-egalitarian literature) due to the massive inequalities in people’s natural abilities. Steiner argues, however, that the germ-line genetic information which people carry within them and which determines the genetic endowment and thus the natural abilities of their children is part of the world’s natural resources (1994: 237–48). This means, on his view, that, in effect, each person is entitled to a share of the world’s external natural resources whose value varies in reverse proportion to the value of his or her children’s genetic endowment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470594X12460638">3</xref>
</sup> And this, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X12460638">Steiner (1994</xref>: 275–80; 2011: 112–5; see also 1997), would substantially mitigate, if not eradicate, the inequalities that ensue from people’s unequal natural abilities (assuming that a minor with lesser natural abilities (<italic>M</italic>), or someone else, has a right against <italic>M</italic>’s parents that they use the additional external resources to which they are entitled in order to improve <italic>M</italic>’s abilities).</p>

<sec id="section6-1470594X12460638">
<title>The right to equal freedom, self-ownership, and an egalitarian share of the world’s natural resources</title>
<p>Now that we have a clear idea of what Steiner means exactly by ‘freedom’, ‘self-ownership’, and an ‘egalitarian share of the world’s natural resources’, we can move on to the question of whether, on his own terms, his attempt to reconcile (luck-egalitarian) equality and freedom is successful. The first and most obvious problem with Steiner’s argument that this is indeed the case has to do with the assumption mentioned at the end of the last section: that <italic>M</italic>, or someone else, has a right against <italic>M</italic>’s parents that they use the additional external resources to which they are entitled in order to improve <italic>M</italic>’s abilities. According to Steiner, minors are the property of their parents; they do not count as moral agents who can have that right (or any other right for that matter). Moreover, nowhere does he argue that someone else has that right.</p>
<p>Yet, Steiner argues that, in light of the right to self-ownership, the fact that at some point minors become adults (that is, moral agents who can have rights) and that in producing them their parents used a natural resource in the form of germ-line genetic information mean that parents’ ownership of their children is temporary and expires upon the children’s attainment of adulthood, and suggests that this may also give rise to <italic>M</italic>’s aforementioned right (2008: 354 n. 15). It is clear, however, that given Steiner’s position that minors cannot have rights, the only relevant right to which these facts may give rise is <italic>M</italic>’s right as an adult to <italic>post hoc</italic> compensation from her parents in case they did not use the additional external resources to which they are entitled in order to improve her abilities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470594X12460638">Wolff, 1999</xref>: 155–6). What is not clear is whether this right can actually exist. After all, by not using the additional external resources to which they are entitled in the specified way <italic>M</italic>’s parents did not violate any of <italic>M</italic>’s rights while she was a minor. So, where does <italic>M</italic>’s right to compensation come from? What is she supposed to be compensated for? It seems that if <italic>M</italic> did not have a right against her parents that they use the additional external resources to which they are entitled in order to improve her abilities (or any other right for that matter) while she was a minor, then she cannot have a right to be compensated for the fact that her parents did not do so.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470594X12460638">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Be that as it may, let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that <italic>M</italic> can have a right against her parents that they use the additional external resources to which they are entitled in order to improve her abilities. This is obviously not enough to render Steiner’s attempt to reconcile (luck-egalitarian) equality and freedom successful. Another (although, as we shall see presently, not the last) necessary condition for this is that this right is implied, alongside everyone’s right to self-ownership and a per capita share of the total value of the world’s natural resources, by the right to equal freedom.</p>
<p>Recall, then, that Steiner’s conception of freedom has the following two features: (1) only other people’s actions (as opposed to their omissions) can render us unfree, rather than merely unable, to <italic>x</italic> and (2) when we are merely unable to <italic>x</italic>, we are free to <italic>x</italic>. Now, <italic>M</italic>’s inabilities, in virtue of which her parents are entitled to additional external resources, are natural inabilities which were not caused by someone else’s action. In other words, they are mere inabilities, not unfreedoms. Thus, on Steiner’s own conception of freedom, <italic>M</italic> is free to perform all the actions that she cannot perform just because of these inabilities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470594X12460638">5</xref>
</sup> Therefore, all other things being equal, <italic>M</italic> is as free as someone else who does not have her inabilities and can perform these actions.</p>
<p>It might be argued, though, that <italic>M</italic>’s inabilities are a result of someone else’s action; namely, her parents’ act of procreation which brought her to life. After all, it might be argued, if that action did not occur, <italic>M</italic> would not suffer from these inabilities. The obvious objection to this line of reasoning is that in the absence of this action <italic>M</italic>’s inabilities are not the only things that would not exist; another ‘thing’ that would not exist is <italic>M</italic> herself.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1470594X12460638">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Let us suppose though, again, just for the sake of argument, that the right to equal freedom does imply, alongside everyone’s right to self-ownership and a per capita share of the total value of the world’s natural resources, <italic>M</italic>’s right against her parents that they use the additional external resources to which they are entitled in order to improve her abilities. As mentioned above, this is still not enough to render Steiner’s attempt to reconcile freedom and (luck-egalitarian) equality successful. The last necessary condition is that the value of the additional external resources to which <italic>M</italic>’s parents are entitled is big enough to eradicate, or at least substantially mitigate, the inequalities between <italic>M</italic> and children with better natural abilities that are due to the inequalities in their natural abilities. To keep things simple while discussing this issue, I will assume a world populated only by <italic>M</italic>, her parents, another child (<italic>N </italic>), whose natural abilities are better than <italic>M</italic>'s, and <italic>N</italic>'s parents.</p>
<p>Recall, then, that on Steiner’s view in such a two-family world <italic>M</italic>’s parents are entitled to more external resources than <italic>N</italic>’s parents, due to the fact that the value of the germ-line genetic information that <italic>N</italic>’s parents appropriated while producing <italic>N</italic> is higher than the value of the germ-line genetic information that <italic>M</italic>’s parents appropriated while producing <italic>M</italic>. And the value of the additional external resources to which <italic>M</italic>’s parents are entitled is equal to the difference between the values of the two pieces of germ-line genetic information.</p>
<p>Now, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X12460638">Steiner (1994</xref>: 276), the value of certain germ-line genetic information is a function of
<disp-quote>
<p>what can be done with it. And what can be done with it is, these days, quite a lot of diverse things … But I think we can safely suppose that, mediately or immediately, this genetic information will be an input … in some body-building process. What is the value of a body? All bodies are collections of abilities and disabilities, talents and incompetences. These vary from the highly valuable to the highly disvaluable. And parental germ-line genetic information contributes, along with many other factors, to their production … such genetic information constrains the set of abilities that can be produced with it … And presumably the valuation of these abilities and disabilities is some function of what people would pay to acquire or be rid of them, or of the redress for which persons would be liable if they injured others so as to cause them losses of abilities or incurrences of disabilities.</p>
</disp-quote>
Accordingly, in our two-family world the value of the additional external resources to which <italic>M</italic>’s parents are entitled will be equal to the cost of enabling <italic>M</italic> to acquire the nonnatural equivalent of <italic>N</italic>’s natural talents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470594X12460638">Steiner, 2011</xref>: 115).</p>
<p>The problem with this argument is that it rests on the assumption that, by appropriating the relevant germ-line genetic information while producing <italic>N</italic>, <italic>N</italic>’s parents prevent <italic>M</italic>’s parents from performing all the actions that <italic>M</italic> cannot perform, but could perform if <italic>M</italic> had <italic>N</italic>’s natural abilities and, therefore, deprive them of the freedom to perform all these actions. This assumption, however, is wrong. Following Steiner’s supposition that the main use of genetic information is as a factor in some body-building process, the most that <italic>N</italic>’s parents prevent <italic>M</italic>’s parents from is being the parents of a child who has <italic>N</italic>’s natural abilities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1470594X12460638">7</xref>
</sup> Now, given that children usually do some things that enable their parents to do some things, it is very likely that this does indeed prevent <italic>M</italic>’s parents from performing a range of various actions – actions that depend on <italic>M</italic>’s ability to perform some actions that she cannot perform, but could perform if she had <italic>N</italic>’s natural abilities – and thus deprives them of the freedom to perform a range of various actions. Moreover, in some cases, making it possible for <italic>M</italic>’s parents to perform these actions will indeed amount to enabling <italic>M</italic> to acquire the nonnatural equivalent of <italic>N</italic>’s natural abilities. These are cases in which enabling <italic>M</italic> to acquire the nonnatural equivalent of <italic>N</italic>’s natural abilities consists only in a one-off procedure. For instance, suppose that, as opposed to <italic>N</italic>, <italic>M</italic> was born with some medical condition that prevents her from moving her legs and therefore prevents her from performing some actions that are necessary preconditions for her parents performing a range of various actions. Suppose further that <italic>M</italic>’s medical condition can only be solved once and for all by an operation. In this case, the value of the additional external resources to which <italic>M</italic>’s parents are entitled will be equal to the cost of that operation. It will, in other words, be equal to the cost of enabling <italic>M</italic> to acquire the nonnatural equivalent of <italic>N</italic>’s natural abilities. Yet, in many other cases, cases in which enabling <italic>M</italic> to acquire the nonnatural equivalent of <italic>N</italic>’s natural abilities consists only in some incessant treatment (or in which such treatment is cheaper than a one-off procedure), making it possible for <italic>M</italic>’s parents to perform those actions will most likely not amount to enabling <italic>M</italic> to acquire the nonnatural equivalent of <italic>N</italic>’s natural abilities. That is simply because it is most likely that <italic>M</italic> will outlive her parents. Suppose, for example, that, as opposed to <italic>N</italic>, <italic>M</italic> was born with a medical condition that prevents her from moving her legs and that it cannot be solved once and for all by an operation, but rather for fixed periods of time by some fairly expensive medication. In this case, the value of the additional external resources to which <italic>M</italic>’s parents are entitled will be equal to the cost of treating her with the medication, but only so long as they are alive. Thus, assuming that <italic>M</italic> will outlive her parents, (luck-egalitarian) equality will not be achieved in this sort of case, even if we assume that the right to equal freedom implies that <italic>M</italic> has a right against her parents that they invest the additional external resources to which they are entitled due to her natural inability in providing her with the medication.</p>
<p>Note, finally, that the reason why (luck-egalitarian) equality will not be achieved here is not that it is impossible to enable <italic>M</italic> to acquire the nonnatural equivalent of <italic>N</italic>’s natural abilities. The reason is that <italic>M</italic>’s parents are simply not entitled to additional external resources whose value is big enough to enable <italic>M</italic> to acquire the nonnatural equivalent of <italic>N</italic>’s natural abilities and thus to achieve (luck-egalitarian) equality.</p>

<sec id="section7-1470594X12460638">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>I have identified three different problems in Steiner’s attempt to reconcile freedom and (luck-egalitarian) equality. The first problem is that a minor with lesser natural abilities (<italic>M</italic>) cannot have, according to Steiner, a right against her parents that they invest the additional external resources to which they are entitled in improving her abilities.</p>
<p>The second problem is that, even if we assume that <italic>M</italic> can have this right, it is not implied by the right to equal freedom: given that <italic>M</italic>’s inabilities, in virtue of which her parents are entitled to additional external resources, are natural inabilities, she is free to perform the actions that she cannot perform just because of these inabilities. Hence, all other things being equal, <italic>M</italic> is as free as someone else who does not have her inabilities and can perform these actions.</p>
<p>The third problem is that, even if we assume that the right to equal freedom does imply this right, this would not always eradicate, or substantially mitigate, the inequalities between <italic>M</italic> and children with better natural abilities that are due to inequalities in their natural abilities: the additional external resources to which <italic>M</italic>’s parents are entitled are meant to compensate them for the freedoms they lose as a result of other people appropriating more valuable germ-line genetic information, not for the freedoms that their child could have if they appropriated the more valuable germ-line genetic information. Thus, in many cases the value of the additional external resources to which they are entitled will simply not be big enough to achieve (luck-egalitarian) equality.</p>

<p>Quong argues that this attempt fails, because left-libertarians think about equality in luck-egalitarian terms rather than in terms of the Rawlsian idea of justice as reciprocity. According to Quong, as opposed to such a Rawlsian-inspired conception of equality, the luck-egalitarian conception is not necessarily compatible with self-ownership. Thus, the best that left-libertarians can hope for is a contingent reconciliation of luck-egalitarian equality and the aforementioned sphere of freedom. As Steiner points out, however, at least as far as his own version of left-libertarianism is concerned, Quong’s argument that the luck-egalitarian conception of equality is not necessarily compatible with self-ownership fails. For it builds on situations in which some rights violations cannot be fully redressed by their perpetrators. This kind of eventuality, argues Steiner, is a contingency that besets any theory of just compensation and ‘is not normally taken to impair the coherence of the principles generating those rights’ (2011: 115).</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-1470594X12460638">

<p>Steiner holds that the overall amount of freedom within any given society is fixed (1994: 52–4). Therefore, in his view, distributing it equally provides each person with the maximum possible amount of freedom which is compatible with providing a similar amount to everyone else.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-1470594X12460638">
<label>3.</label>
<p>The reason this does not mean, on his view, that each person (<italic>P</italic>) is entitled to a share of the world’s external natural resources whose value varies in reverse proportion to the value of <italic>P</italic>’s own genetic endowment, which is determined by the genetic information <italic>P</italic>’s parents utilized in making <italic>P</italic>, lies precisely in the fact that it is <italic>P</italic>’s parents, not <italic>P</italic>, who utilized the relevant genetic information. It is, therefore, part of their, not <italic>P</italic>’s, share of the world’s natural resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X12460638">Steiner, 1994</xref>: 273–8; 2011: 112–5). But why is the relevant genetic information that which they utilized in making <italic>P</italic>, rather than simply that which they carry within them, regardless of whether they utilized it to make <italic>P</italic>? After all, it is located inside their self-owned bodies, which means that no one else is allowed to add it to his share of the world’s natural resources (without their permission). Steiner argues, however, that, although it is located inside their self-owned bodies, as long as they do not utilize it, it is not part of their share of the world’s natural resources either; it is simply unowned (1994: 248–9 n. 26).</p>

<p>Steiner rejects the view that all of our duties to others are correlated by rights. Instead, he holds that ‘not all of the benefits which our duties require us to bestow on others are ones to which they [or anyone else] have rights’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X12460638">Steiner, 1994</xref>: 61). Hence, it might be argued that his argument can rely on a weaker assumption than the one saying that <italic>M</italic>, or someone else, has a right against <italic>M</italic>’s parents that they use the additional external resources to which they are entitled in order to improve <italic>M</italic>’s abilities; namely, that <italic>M</italic>’s parents have a (uncorrelative) duty to do so. Recall, however, that this duty is supposed to be a matter of distributive justice, and for Steiner distributive justice is concerned ‘only with those gettings and givings which are thought to be justifiably enforceable’ (1999: 133-4); that is, only those givings and gettings that are backed up with rights.</p>

<p>I say ‘actions that she cannot perform <italic>just</italic> because of these inabilities’ so as to distinguish between these kinds of actions and actions that she cannot perform partly because of these inabilities and partly because of other people’s actions – that is, when her natural inability to perform a certain action is the cause of someone else preventing her from performing another action that she would otherwise be able to perform – which on Steiner’s conception of freedom, she is unfree to perform.</p>

<p> Note that, unlike the typical nonidentity problem which deals with harm and which is comparative in nature – we ask whether the life of a person who has been conceived is so bad that it would have been better for her not to exist at all – the point of this objection is not that <italic>M</italic> is freer now than she would have been had her parents not conceived her (this does not contradict the claim that her inabilities to do some things are nevertheless due to her parents’ act). The point is, rather, that her inabilities to do some things are not due to her parents’ act, given that she could not have done these things anyway, that is, in the absence of her parents’ act (just as my inability to draw a square circle could not be due to someone else’s act, given that I am unable to do so anyway, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470594X12460638">Steiner (1994</xref>: 33) himself notes). See also Kramer’s extensive discussion of this issue (2003: 295–309). Note also that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470594X12460638">Steiner (1999</xref>) seems to suggest that this objection rests on the empirical fact that it was impossible for <italic>M</italic>’s parents to produce her without her inabilities, or, more generally, that it is impossible to genetically manipulate germ cells, which determine our personal identity – a fact that may change in the future. I am not at all sure that such a development will enable him to employ this line of reasoning, but cannot possibly explain the source of my doubt here.</p>

<p>Or, perhaps, even parents of a child who has better natural abilities than <italic>N</italic>, given that they could combine either of the two gametes that <italic>N</italic>’s parents used in producing <italic>N</italic> with another gamete (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470594X12460638">Steiner, 2008</xref>: 352–3). This possibility may make the following argument a bit more complex, but it does not invalidate it.</p>
