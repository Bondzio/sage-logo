      <abstract>
        <p>During the past few years, marriages within ‘gotra’ (clan) of the Jat community have come
          into the limelight. Frequently, those couples who have eloped have been brutally murdered
          by the diktats of the elders—these are known as ‘honour killings’. Many such incidents
          have occurred in Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh and the rural belt of Delhi. These areas
          have reaped the fruits of modernization and access to various facilities such as
          educational institutions, health centres, modernized roads and multinational business
          establishments that have encouraged foreign investment. There exists a vast gulf between
          this modernization and the almost feudal mind sets of people like the ‘Khap Panchayats’
          who force couples who have entered intra-gotra marriages to return to the community fold,
          even to the extent of forcing the couples to live like siblings. A large number of such
          wedded couples have even lost their lives. Thus, as per their gotra affinity, the Khap
          Panchayats consider them as brother and sister. The Khap Panchayats try to legitimize
          their actions by quoting historical antecedents of uncertain origin to support their
          practices. They are of the opinion that the Khap Panchayat is an age old institution,
          having its foundation in the early medieval period.</p>

    <p>Historical appropriation of legitimacy by socially and economically upward mobile castes is
      not a new phenomenon and it has gained unfortunate importance in contemporary times.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0257643013477250">1</xref></sup> The reasons for such fabricated
      claims are numerous but representative democracy appears to have played an important role in
      fostering such tendencies. In the age of globalization and growing consumerism the retention
      of such identity has led groups to enforce self-promulgated caste rules and regulations. It is
      therefore, not surprising to note the dictates issued by Khap panchayats in and around Delhi
      region to regulate the ‘gotra’ marriages in their community. Such attempts at regulation
      unfortunately have frequently ended in gruesome ‘honour killings’. These have assumed alarming
      proportions in recent times and pose a serious threat to the democratic and constitutional
      functioning of civil society. In this article an attempt is made to investigate the historical
      basis of the Khap panchayats on the basis of documents, particularly Indo-Persian and
      Rajasthani historical sources.</p>
    <p>According to a recent survey carried out by Shakti Vahini with the help of the National
      Women’s Commission, for the year 2008–2009, 354 cases of violence related to ‘honour killings’
      have been analyzed (on data taken from First Information Reports [FIRs]). It was found that 72
      per cent of cases are related to inter-caste marriages, 3 per cent are related to same gotra
      marriages, 15 per cent of cases were related to the non-consent of parents. Thus only 2.4
      cases fall under the category of gotra marriage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0257643013477250">2</xref></sup> What is surprising to note is the fact that most
      of these so called ‘crimes’ are instigated on the directives of panchayats. It is all together
      a different matter that most of these panchayats have practically no legal or constitutional
      rights. Most of the time, these panchayats claim legitimacy attributed to some long historical
      tradition or certain social conventions.</p>
    <p>Information about the history of the Sarvakhap Panchayat is introduced to us by the
      unpublished handwritten Pothi of Pandit KanhaRam, resident of village Shauram, in the district
      of Muzaffarnagar. He has discussed some historical incidents pertaining to Khap Panchayats in
      his Pothi. The Pothi consists of 16 hand written pages, describing the locations and dates of
      Khap Panchayat meetings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0257643013477250">3</xref></sup>
      According to the Pothi, the first meeting of the Sarvakhap Panchayat was held in the forest of
      Baraut in VS 1252 (1195 <sc>AD</sc>). It took the decision to raise an army against the
      attacks of Mohammad Ghori.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0257643013477250">4</xref></sup>
      This seems to be fictitious as there is no corroborating evidence to support this claim. The
      closest reference of Jats during this time suggests that in 1192, after the defeat of
      Prithviraj Chauhan, the farmers, in the area around Hansi (Haryana) revolted under the
      leadership of Jatwan. Qutubuddin Aibak suppressed the revolt.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0257643013477250">5</xref></sup> The most plausible reason for this revolt seems
      to be the opposition to the new land revenue policy implemented by the Turks. Further, the
      Pothi suggests that another meeting of the Khap Panchayat was held in VS 1455 (1398
        <sc>AD</sc>) in the forests of Chaugama, in the district of Muzaffarnagar. The purpose of
      this meeting as stated in the Pothi was to resist the onslaughts of the attacks of Taimur
          Lane.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0257643013477250">6</xref></sup> However the
      autobiography of Taimur, <italic>Malfuzat-e-Tamuri</italic>, tells us that Jats troubled him a
      lot in the areas around Tohana (near Hissar), but does not mention any opposition from the
      Jats in the area closer to the forests of Chaugama, in the district of Muzaffarnagar. Further
      he writes that when his army was sent, the Jats used to hide in the nearby cane
          fields<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0257643013477250">7</xref></sup> and thus avoided
      direct confrontation. Moreover, it is important to note that when Taimur attacked the areas
      adjoining Meerut and Haridwar, nowhere do we find any evidence that he had faced any
      resistance from the Jats.</p>
    <p>Subsequently, the Sarvakhap Panchayat also claims that they had sent an army of 5000 soldiers
      in favour of Rana Sanga against Babur in the battle of Sikari (Khanwa) in 1527
          <sc>AD</sc>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0257643013477250">8</xref></sup> However, in
      the absence of corroborative evidence it is again difficult to verify this claim. Moreover,
      Babur who has mentioned almost all the rulers and communities who fought in favour of Rana
      Sanga does not mention the Jats as his adversaries. Similarly another Sarvakhap Panchayat was
      supposedly held in VS 1718 (1661 <sc>AD</sc>) in Chaprauli, a place located in the vicinity of
      Meerut and Muzaffarnagar. Its purpose was to oppose the Jazia tax imposed by Mughal Emperor
      Aurangzeb and he was requested to roll it back.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0257643013477250">9</xref></sup> But the date of this Sarvakhap Panchayat does
      not tally with the date of the Jazia tax that Aurangzeb imposed in 1679 <sc>AD</sc>on Hindus
      in the 22<sup>nd</sup> year of his reign.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0257643013477250">10</xref></sup> The Jat revolt of 1668 under the leadership of Gokula Jat also had
      nothing to do with the Jazia tax. It was a peasants’ revolt which took place in the region of
      Mathura because of the increasing land revenue burden during the reign of Aurangzeb.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0257643013477250">11</xref></sup></p>
    <p>The Sarvakhap Panchayat claims that in the third battle of Panipat which was fought between
      Ahmad Shah Abdali and the Marathas, they had sent an army of 22,000 soldiers under the
      leadership of Chaudhary Shirlal Jat of Shaurabh village, district Muzaffarnagar, in the
      support of the Marathas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0257643013477250">12</xref></sup>
      This information also is not supported by historical sources. It is a well known fact that the
      Jat Raja of Bharatpur, Surajmal, did not extended any help to the Marathas in this battle.
      Therefore to claim that the Sarvakhap Panchayat had sent such a huge army for the support of
      the Marathas<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0257643013477250">13</xref></sup> appears more
      fiction than fact.</p>
    <p>It is not surprising to note that the Jats rely on Pandit KanhaRam’s handwritten pothi to
      legitimize the historical role of the Khap Panchayat. Interestingly, it is written in modern
      Hindi. At present, this pothi is in possession of Chaudhuri Kabul Singh of Shauram village in
      the district of Muzaffarnagar. This Pothi claims that there had been a total of 24 meetings of
      Sarvakhap Panchayat from 1252 to VS 1817 (1195–1760 <sc>AD</sc>). To further their claims of
      legitimacy, out of these, 8 meetings were held during the reign of Mughal Emperors and the
      rest prior to the reign of Akbar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0257643013477250">14</xref></sup> Some of the dates mentioned herein do not tally with actual historical
      dates. Apart from these dates, the incidents described in this Pothi, again, do not correspond
      to contemporary historical sources on the basis of which these events can be co-related with
      facts.</p>
    <p>As a matter of fact, it is really difficult to accept the claims of the Sarvakhap Panchayats
      since the way they represent the nature of warfare they undertook against the invaders
      (Mohammad Ghori, Taimur Lane, Babar and Ahmad Shah Abdali) is utterly unreliable. First, the
      efforts to organize armies seem unrealistic without state support; Second, how could such a
      national awakening arise in the Sarvakhap Panchayats, whereas the country as a whole only
      experienced such an awakening in the nineteenth century? The best example of this could be
      seen in the revolt of 1857 where the majority of Indian rulers supported the British to
      suppress masses of rebels.</p>
    <p>The authenticity of the pothis needs to be examined on the basis of linguistic characters as
      well to rule out any ambiguity. Since the pothis claim long-standing historical legitimacy, it
      is but natural to expect that the language will correspond to contemporary traditions. Even a
      cursory look at the language of these pothis makes it amply clear that these were written in
      Khari Boli Hindi and do not resemble the language used in the early nineteenth century. It
      appears that the Chaudhary of Shauram village (Mujaffarnagar District) got such a history
      fabricated by Pandit Kanharam. The pothis claim repeatedly that the Khap Panchayats fought
      against the atrocities of the medieval rulers. However, it is surprising to note that
      historically validated incidents of Jat revolts do not figure in these pothis. When Mohammad
      Tughlaq increased the land revenue on these areas of Western UP (Ganga–Jamuna Doab) by 20 per
      cent in comparison with other areas, the farmers could not pay such a heavy revenue during the
      famine. Mohammad Tughlaq sent an army to quell the protest and the majority of farmers fled to
      the forest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0257643013477250">15</xref></sup> Given the
      practice of holding Khap Panchayats, one would expect a meeting of the Sarvakhap Panchayat at
      this juncture.</p>
    <p>Similarly, during the reign of Aurangzeb, in the year 1668, there was a fierce battle under
      the leadership of Gokula Jat near Mathura, and the Emperor Aurangzeb had to send an army to
      suppress the Jats. Gokula was publically beheaded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0257643013477250">16</xref></sup> After this, Aurangzeb adopted a policy of
      suppressing the Jats and the latter were not allowed to assemble, except for a single meeting
      against the Jazia. Keeping in view this description, the pothi of Pandit Kanharam cannot be
      treated as an authentic source.</p>
    <p>M.C. Pradhan, a sociologist, in his work titled <italic>The Political System of the Jats of
        Northern India</italic>, has made extensive use of Pundit Kanharam’s Pothi for his
          research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0257643013477250">17</xref></sup> As a matter
      of fact, this work was published at a time when in Western Uttar Pradesh, the Jats were trying
      to establish their political identity under the leadership of Chaudhary Charan Singh. This
      book however, was not taken seriously by historians.</p>
    <p>The legitimacy of these Khap Panchayats do not rest on validated historical evidence. The
      historicity of the so called records of these panchayats has been used to legitimize their
      claims. This explains why it poses a major challenge to historians. In this article I have
      tried to discuss the nature of the village panchayat during the Mughal period, along with
      investigations into Khap Panchayats and gotras (clan) of Jats.</p>
    <p>The origin of the word ‘Khap’ is derived from ‘faank’, meaning an off-shoot or fraction.
      Historically the word ‘Khap’ was used for the first time in Rajasthan in the context of Rajput
      ruling class during the medieval period. In Muhnaut <italic>Naiansi ri vigat</italic> or the
      Khyats of Marwar state, we find that the word ‘Khap’ has extensively been used in the context
      of different sects of the Rajput ruling class. The first Census report based on religion and
      caste was prepared in Jodhpur in the year 1890–1891, thereby dividing the people of India on
      the basis of religion and caste. Even the castes were divided on the basis of
          gotras.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0257643013477250">18</xref></sup> The word
      ‘Khap’ has come into existence in the said Census report. When it was translated into Hindi,
      the word class instead of being coined as ‘gotra’ was termed as ‘Khap’. For example,
        <italic>Murdumshumari Raj Marwar</italic> was a census that divided the people of all castes
      in the year 1891 into ‘gotras’—meaning thereby khaps. Different khaps of the Jat caste have
      been described.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0257643013477250">19</xref></sup> Khap
      Panchayat means the panchayat of the villagers who belonged to the same gotra. Thus different
      gotras had their own Khap Panchayats. Khap Panchayats believe themselves to be autonomous from
      the State and claim to represent all members of that particular community.</p>
    <sec id="section1-0257643013477250">
      <title>Historical Evidence of Panchayat</title>
      <p>To understand the working style, significance and the nature of Khap Panchayats, it is very
        important for us to understand the organization of the Mughal village panchayat systems. The
        Khap Panchayat can be seen as a panchayat at the micro-level. The study of village
        communities and panchayat organizations in India was carried out mainly by scholars such as
        Sir Henry Maine, Elphinstone, Baden Powell, Charles Metcalfe and James Mill, who also
        occupied various posts in the British East India Company. The main objective of these
        administrators was to trace land ownership and revenue payment patterns. In order to
        adequately address these objectives they realized that the heads of the villages were the
        most feasible category for the purpose. The British administrators ignored the fact that
        often, ownership of the land was vested in the farmers and preferred to assign collection of
        revenue to the local kings. Following the battle of Buxar in 1764, the East India Company
        became the sole master of the entire land of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. Subsequently, the
        study of the village community was also carried out by British administrative officers and
        therefore they can be held responsible for the propagation of the concept of the village
        community and the panchayat.</p>
      <p>The general understanding of village communities and panchayat organizations was largely
        based on the descriptions of the European travellers (especially Bernier) rather than on the
        documents of the Mughal period. This may explain why they compared the Indian village
        community to the Russian Mir and the German Mark.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0257643013477250">20</xref></sup> It is interesting to note that no one
        refuted these beliefs, even during the period of national struggle in India. Gradually new
        research offered new perspectives and earlier theories were slowly demolished. What was the
        nature of the village panchayat in the Mughal period? What were its functions and role? To
        understand all this, we need to go back to the village panchayat system during the Mughal
        era. Basically, one can say that the village panchayats were neither autonomous, nor free,
        but their functioning was greatly influenced by external forces. Even among modern
        historians, there is no unanimity regarding the village panchayat organizations during the
        Mughal period. Irfan Habib is of the opinion that North India never had a village panchayat
        system during the Mughal period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0257643013477250">21</xref></sup> B.R. Grover has also refuted the existence of the panchayat system.
        According to him, if there had been the village panchayat administration system, then there
        would have been no need for the Mughals to appoint officials like Chaudhary and Quanungo at
        the village level. Dilbagh Singh in his study on Eastern Rajasthan lays emphasis on the idea
        of the village panchayat and suggests that the organization did exist in the later Mughal
        period. He is of the opinion that the larger and more developed villages had the panchayat
        system, whose members however, were mainly from the upper class of the village such as
        Chaudhary, Quanungo, Patel and Zamindar, along with people from upper castes such as Brahmin
        and Mahajans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0257643013477250">22</xref></sup> But
        whether an ordinary farmer or a person from the weaker section of society could be a member
        remains doubtful. However, there are no documents available for historians in Rajasthani and
        Indo-Persian sources that throw light on this subject or that can describe the village
        panchayat organization and its nature in the Mughal period.</p>
      <p>But at times, we do find references to the panchayat in some Rajasthani documents. For
        example, if there was a dispute concerning the border (Kankad) of two villages, then the
        Quanungo and Chaudhary (Pargana Officials) used to invite Patels of 12 villages for
        resolving the dispute.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0257643013477250">23</xref></sup>
        The Patel by virtue of his being the head of village also used to be the head of panchayat
        or council, though it is not clear about who else constituted the village panchayats.
        Nevertheless, it is important to realize that the Parganas that constitute the area of
        concern for our purposes used to be part of the Delhi and Agra Subas. Administratively, the
        majority of these Parganas, being part of Delhi Suba were usually designated as ‘khalisa’.
        The region of Western UP, Delhi’s rural belt and the majority of Haryana being in close
        proximity to the imperial court meant that these were either classified as khalisa or were
        part of jagirs of imperial Mansabdars.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0257643013477250">24</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Thus, the administrative organization at the pargana and the village level of these areas
        was in full administrative control of the officials of the Mughal State. At the local level,
        the Patwari used to play a pivotal role; his sole responsibility was to maintain a record of
        all statistics pertaining to land revenue and the agricultural production of each peasant of
        each village. Even the Malba tax from the farmers was collected with the help of the
            Patwari.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0257643013477250">25</xref></sup> The Patel,
        along with being the head of the village, also functioned as a semi-government official
        whose job was to collect land revenue from the farmers and deposit it in the office of the
            Amil.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0257643013477250">26</xref></sup> A ‘Sahna’ was
        also appointed in each village as the farmers had to pay the land revenue in the
        ‘batai–jinsi’ system—a crop sharing system for revenue realization. It was also the Sahna’s
        job to keep watch on standing crops.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0257643013477250">27</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The Sahna had to be vigilant and ensure that no farmer would take home the harvested crop
        without paying land revenue to the State. This used to be the major reason of skirmishes
        between the farmers and the Sahnas. There is evidence that points to the Mughal State
        instructing the farmers not to quarrel or to misbehave with the Sahna.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0257643013477250">28</xref></sup> Even so, we hear about
        skirmishes between the two. The Patwari and Patel exercised their functions at the local
        level which the Qanungo and Chaudhary worked at the pargana level.</p>
      <p>The responsibility to look after theft, dacoity and to maintain law and order seems to have
        been that of the Faujdar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0257643013477250">29</xref></sup> The Faujdar’s responsibility was also to penalize farmers who failed to
        pay land revenue charges. The Amil was the highest administrative official whose
        responsibility was to oversee the collection process of the land revenue with the help of
        subordinate officials. Thus the land revenue administration at the village level was managed
        by the Pargana and local administrative officials. That is why the Patels and the Patwaris
        were directed to make a list of farmers with disputes and to submit these to the Amil.</p>
      <p>Various sources provide evidence of how the Amil resolved disputes between farmers. For
        example, in the year 1680, Kesho Jat of the Ratoli village (the village near Hodal, Pargana
        Shahar) had complained in the Darbar of the Amil that while Aaso Jat of Moja Jatoti had
        engaged his daughter to his son, he had proceeded to marry her off instead to the son of
        Ratna Jat of Moja Jonai. The enquiry by the Amil revealed that the complaint was true and
        the latter imposed a fine of ₹5 on Asa Jat.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0257643013477250">30</xref></sup> Similarly, when there was a fight between
        Khema and Godu Jat in Moja Taroli, the Faujdar imposed a fine of ₹18, and 8 annas on both
            farmers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0257643013477250">31</xref></sup> In Mauja
        Dhanauli, Raruka and Kisna Jat raped the wife of Tikku Jat and both men were fined ₹44 and
        ₹33 respectively by the Amil.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0257643013477250">32</xref></sup> Similarly, the son of the Khema Jat of Gudha village raped Daala Jat’s
        daughter; consequently Khema Jat was fined ₹41 by the Amil. It seems that the investigative
        authority was also vested with the Amil. Thus it appears that there was apparently very
        limited function or role for the panchayats even in resolving intra-caste disputes.</p>
      <p>In another situation, the land of four villages of the Meos was encroached upon by the Jats
        of Khoh village of pargana Kama. The Quanungo and the Chaudhary were directed by higher
        authorities to resolve the dispute with the help of the Patels of the respective
            villages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0257643013477250">33</xref></sup> In another
        case, Chaukha Jat Patel of village Khairal of Pargana Shahar reaped the harvest of a
        sugarcane field of 5½ bighas without taking the permission of the Sahna. Thereafter,
        following on from the complaint made by the Sahna, the Amil of the pargana imposed a fine of
        ₹7 on the Patel. When the Patel abused the Sahna, the latter booked a complaint in the court
        of the Amil and the Patel, too, was summoned. The Patel however failed to appear. Sources
        reveal that the penalty on the Patel was enhanced to the tune of ₹231 because of his callous
        attitude and continued disregard of the law of the land.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0257643013477250">34</xref></sup> It is evident that most disputes and matters
        of unlawful behaviour were adjudicated and resolved by lower state-level officials.</p>
      <p>Moreover, there is no reference of any aggrieved party ever approaching the panchayat for
        redressal of their complaints. For example, Harji Patel in Mauja Khedli did not get his cane
        field measured for revenue assessment. When this lapse was discovered by the Amil, a fine of
        ₹27 was imposed. Without the knowledge of the Sahna, Khema Jat of Mauja Morda destroyed the
        maize and bottle gourd was sown in 4 bighas. Following up on the Sahna’s complaint, a fine
        of ₹7½ was imposed by the Amil.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0257643013477250">35</xref></sup> In another case, in the year 1665, Puran Patel of Mauja Bhau, Jagga
        Patel of Bhirhi Kalan and Lala Patel of village Kaadma (Pargana Chalkalyan) had reported a
        number of quarrels between the farmers and the Amil. The Amil received a fine of ₹1064 in
        lieu of penalties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0257643013477250">36</xref></sup></p>
      <p>To further substantiate my argument I have chosen a few cases of the crimes involving the
        Jats of the region. For this purpose, we examined another set of Rajasthani documents named
        ‘Chithiyaat’ wherein we find the information concerning the disputes of the farmers and the
        Patels regarding land holdings. The major part of the information in these documents relates
        to the villages of the Pargana of Eastern Rajasthan which were given to the Rajput Kachchwah
        Raja in his Tankhawah Jagir. But some of the Chithis also shed significant light on the
        villages of Narnaul, Kama, Pahari, Hodal and Bharatpur areas, inhabited mainly by Jat
        peasants. Interestingly, we do not get any reference to Khap Panchayat, though village-level
        disputes find frequent mention. Similarly, the ‘Khatutahalkaran’, a secret report concerning
        the activities of the farmers does not mention the term Khap Panchayat. In this context, it
        is imperative to discuss the Vakil reports as well. These reports were prepared by the
        Vakils of the Amber Raja posted at the Mughal Darbar. These reports bring to light the
        revolts and other activities of the Jats but give us no information about the Khap
        Panchayats. Similarly, the <italic>Ain-i-Akbari</italic> informs us that the majority of the
        Jat villages of Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh and countryside of Delhi formed part of the
        Delhi Suba in the Mughal administrative system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0257643013477250">37</xref></sup> Most of the Parganas were given to the
        Imperial Mansabdars as Tankhwah Jagir or were designated ‘Khalisa’ (Imperial land).
        Therefore it will not be incorrect to assume that the Mughal State had devised a system of
        local governance whereby a stringent control over the region could be maintained. Had the
        Khap Panchayat of Jats been in existence, would there not have been some reference to them?
        Furthermore, the activities of the Khap Panchayats would also have found some mention in any
        one of the Indo-Persian or Rajasthani sources which are fairly detailed. Moreover, the
        meetings of the Khap Panchayats as claimed by Pothis, were mega-events, and should have
        attracted the attention of the administrative set-up, which was closely involved even in
        petty interpersonal disputes in their realm. It is difficult to believe that such large
        assemblies do not find any mention in all the recorded information and contemporary
        documents pertaining to the medieval phase.</p>
      <p>I would like to submit that the village panchayat system existed during the Mughal period;
        however it is still difficult for scholars to define its character, role and functions.</p>
      <p>The Khuts and Mukadams functioned as representatives of the village community during the
        Sultanate period; similarly, the Patel who was a member of the peasant community served as
        the head of the village community during the Mughal period. The social and economic position
        of the Patel used to be much higher and influential than other farmers. He was the head of
        the village community and his duty was also to assist in the collection of land revenue from
        his fellow farmers. He was in constant touch with the Amil and the Faujdar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0257643013477250">38</xref></sup> A few elderly peasants may
        have helped the Patel, though we do not have any evidence that points to the presence of
        village councils. It seems clear that while most disputes were resolved by the Amil, some
        minor conflicts and village welfare work was deputed to the village council, under the
        leadership of the Patel. However, records show that farmers did raise their grievances, even
        against the Patels, to the Mughal court.</p>
      <p>Apparently, Village Panchayats were never recognized by the Mughal state. Their major role
        was to assist the state officials (Amil, Faujdar, Amin, Chaudhary and Quanungo) with the
        help of the Patel and the village council, whenever these officials happened to visit the
        village for the purpose of measuring village land or for other reasons. The Patel with the
        help of other members of the village council used to provide them food and shelter and even
        transport facilities in the form of bullock carts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0257643013477250">39</xref></sup> With the help of the Patwari, the village
        council used the Malba tax to undertake various infrastructure projects such as construction
        of dams and water bodies, particularly in the rainy season. The Village Councils also played
        a major role in resolving farmers’ disputes over land, water, cattle and other such local
        level problems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0257643013477250">40</xref></sup></p>
      <p>After the fall of the Mughal Empire, as the position of administrative officials waned,
        village councils assumed greater importance in resolving disputes between farmers. Moreover,
        the position of the Zamindars and the Patels got strengthened in the village community and
        the colonial authorities used this opportunity to absorb them in their own administrative
        structure. It is this changed situation that has been described by British administrative
        officers like Baden Powell, Sir Henry Maine, Elphinstone, Metcalfe and James Mill among
        others.</p>
      <p>In the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Jat leaders claimed their hereditary
        position and exercised control over the peasantry. Those villagers who disobeyed orders were
        given severe punishments. Generally Jat chieftains were looked on with favour as being
        impartial. The Maharaja of Jodhpur, Bakhatwar Singh was often known to consult the Jat head
        of Jhanwar village in complex cases.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0257643013477250">41</xref></sup></p>

      <title>History of Gotra</title>
      <sec id="section3-0257643013477250">
        <title>Gotras</title>
        <p>Since Khap Panchayats generally comprise and correspond to different gotras of Jats, a
          brief survey is given in this section to place them in a historical context. The Jats are
          divided into a number of gotras (clans), unmatched by any other community. According to
          prescriptive literature concerning the Hindu caste system, the gotras play a pivotal role.
          The popular perception about gotras is that they are based on the common ancestor’s name.
          That is why people belonging to the same gotra are tied together with a feeling of
          brotherhood. This is also the reason that Khap Panchayats have opposed intra-gotra
          marriages and now wish to bring about an amendment in the Hindu Marriage Act. The gotra
          seems to consist of an evolved institution coming down from ancient times in Hindu
          society. R.S. Sharma defines the term ‘gotra’ to mean ‘Gaushala’ that means
              cowherds<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0257643013477250">42</xref></sup> and
          suggests that it evolved during the Rigvedic period. Since Rigvedic society was basically
          a cattle rearing community, it indicates that the formation of gotras must have been along
          economic lines. People of a particular group used to maintain a Gaushala, and their
          survival depended on the sale of milk. Historians suggest that because of their
          co-operation with each other and the feeling of brotherhood, the people of a single
          Gaushala were termed as belonging to the one gotra.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0257643013477250">43</xref></sup> This is viewed as the basis of the origin
          of the gotra system in Rigvedic society. With the shift to agriculture from cattle
          rearing, the gotras started being identified with different farming settlements instead of
          Gaushalas. As tribal society gradually turned into a farming community, new gotras sprang
          up. The process was rapid and by the beginning of the medieval period the number of gotras
          had increased to 500.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0257643013477250">44</xref></sup>
          Hence, a number of pastoral tribal communities transformed themselves into
          agriculturalists and subsequently, caste became the basis around which gotra identities
          crystallized. Many of these communities subsequently asserted themselves as organized
          armed groups to make their presence felt and to evolve their specific identities.</p>
        <p>The earliest information that we have about the Jats is available in the
            <italic>Chachnama</italic>. It is mentioned that in 809 <sc>AD</sc>, the Jats reared
          cattle in the area of Sindh.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0257643013477250">45</xref></sup> During the phase of the Delhi Sultanate, the Jats emerged as an
          important farming community in the area of Punjab. Abul Fazl in his
            <italic>Ain-i-Akbari</italic> describes the Jats as among the best farmers in the north
          western region. Later on, Jats acquired a large number of Zamindaris in Delhi and Agra
              Subas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0257643013477250">46</xref></sup> In the late
          eighteenth century, French writer Wendel writes that ‘Jat means having a
              plough’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0257643013477250">47</xref></sup> The
          French writer Modave writes: <disp-quote>
            <p>[A]lthough the Jats are gentle people and if they are not forced to take arms, they
              take delight in farming on their free will. For me, the hard work of the Jats is
              appreciable because of the fact, that they have not left the earth unploughed and
              their fields are far better maintained.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0257643013477250">48</xref></sup></p>
          </disp-quote></p>
        <p>The above description indicates the fact that to be recognized as an important farming
          community and to shed their traditional characterization as a pastoral community, the Jats
          had to struggle for a very long time.</p>
        <p>Recent research indicates that the Jats got transformed into an agrarian community only
          after the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0257643013477250">49</xref></sup> So, it is clear that their gotra identity
          could have got solidified only after that period. The word ‘Jat’ is usually found in
          Indo-Persian sources after the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate (1206 <sc>AD</sc>),
          particularly in north India. The writer of the <italic>Tarikh-i-Firozshahi</italic>, Shams
          Siraz Afif, mentions that there were a number of ‘kharaks’ between Sirsa and
              Hansi.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0257643013477250">50</xref></sup> Kharak is a
          Persian word meaning ‘cow herds’, and we deduce that these places also had a number of
          areas dedicated to cow rearing. Cow rearing was an important occupation in medieval India,
          not only for its dairy produce but also because the ox was a very important means of
          transport for carrying goods. Transportation of grains and foodstuff was carried out by
          the Banjara community and they were in possession of thousands of oxen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0257643013477250">51</xref></sup> Afif writes that when
          Firozshah Tughlaq thought of establishing a new city named Hisar Firoza, there were
          already two big villages there. One was big Laras and the other small Laras. The big one
          had 50 and the small one had 40 ‘kharaks’. There was no village in the whole area without
          a kharak.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0257643013477250">52</xref></sup> The
          geographical location of the area attracted the attention of the Sultan, who established a
          new city named Hissar. But there was a scarcity of water there. In summers, when traders
          from Iraq and Khurasan used to visit these areas, they had to buy a glass of water for 4
          Jitals—a kind of currency, which was one twenty-fifth of a <italic>dam</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0257643013477250">53</xref></sup> Afif also informs us that
          the Jats had still not completely transformed themselves into a farming community.
          Apparently, one section of the Jat community was still associated with the breeding of
          cattle (kharak) and then selling the oxen to the Banjaras. Their social identity was known
          by the gotras they were associated with, such as, Bachda (small ox), Baidka (young ox),
          Bail and Dhanda (old ox). Thus the kharaks were known by the type of cattle they dealt
          with and gradually the families associated with the kharaks, too, took their identity from
          the types of cattle that they were rearing.</p>
        <p>Afif further mentions that Firozshah Tughlaq decided to dig canals and connect them to
          the rivers because of the prevalent water scarcity. Two canals were dug linking them to
          Hissar Firoza: one named Rajibaha was from the Yamuna and the other, named Ulagkhani came
          from the Satluj. Both these canals, after passing from Karnal, used to connect Hissar
          Firoza via Hansi.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0257643013477250">54</xref></sup> Afif
          writes that there were a number of towns and villages located along the course of these
          canals, like Jind, Dhatrath, Hansi, Safidon and so on, which benefited significantly from
          the canal water. Before these canals were dug it was possible to grow only the Kharif crop
          in the Hissar area. Thereafter the cultivation of the rabi crop also came up since the
          wheat crop was not possible without water.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0257643013477250">55</xref></sup> Before this we read about Hansi ‘Shiq’ (an
          administrative unit), implying that this area of Hissar was a part of the Hansi Shiq from
          the administrative point of view. But subsequently, the Sultan ordered that the Shiq be
          transferred to Hissar. So Hansi, Agroha, Fatehabad and from Sirsa to Salora and
          Khijarbad—all these areas were included in the Hissar Shiq, and Malik Delan was appointed
          as the Shiqdar of this area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0257643013477250">56</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Firozshah established another city in between Hissar Firoza and Sirsa, which was named
          Fatehabad. On one occasion when the Sultan was travelling to Delhi from Sirsa on the way,
          a child was born to his wife. The child was named Fateh Khan and the township was named
          after him. Ziauddin Barani writes that villages became settled and multiplied because of
          the irrigation facilities in this area. As the subjects took to agriculture, they produced
          many crops. Earlier, due to the scarcity of water, there used to be a number of Tilodi or
          (group of bullock carts) found in this area and people lived in bullock carts instead of
              villages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0257643013477250">57</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Wherever the Tilodi found water, they settled permanently and built up habitations. With
          the establishment of the canals and due to better administration under the Sultans, these
          ‘Tilodis’ transformed into villages and the settlers gave up the practice of sleeping
          under the bullock carts. Scarcity of water did not allow any crop except the hardy ‘moth’
          and ‘urd’. With the advent of canals, the farmers could also produce cane and wheat. The
          Central Asian invader, Tamurlaine, also described the sugarcane crop he happened to
          observe while he passed through Tohana. After the establishment of these villages, the
          administration improved drastically and the Kharaj (land revenue) collection became stable
          and systematic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0257643013477250">58</xref></sup></p>
        <p>The Kharaks were mainly found in the areas of Hansi, Hissar, Fatehabad, Sirsa and Jind
          where the Jat population was found in great density. We must be aware of the fact that
          Afif may have exaggerated these figures somewhat in order to please the Sultan. Evidence
          shows that by the fourteenth century, the transformation of Jats into an agrarian
          community was as yet incomplete. One section of the community still subsisted on cattle
          rearing. The scarcity of water did not allow them to settle down at any fixed place. Along
          with their cattle and families, they use to roam here and there for water and their usual
          abode was the Tilodi (bullock cart). The majority of kharaks were located where water was
          available in abundance. By and large agricultural productivity was also low because of the
          lack of water and only a few kharif crops were grown in these areas.</p>
        <p>After the advent of canals, the region witnessed several important changes in the social
          and economic lives of the Jats. The availability of water increased the productivity in
          the area. Wheat and sugarcane could be grown in this region. These new possibilities of
          secure agricultural production offered fresh opportunities to the Jats to settle down as
          an agrarian community. The farmers who settled near the canals had to pay more revenue in
          comparison with others. Such farmers were classified as ‘Nehra’ by the land revenue
          officials. This classification of the farmers created a new social identity such as Nehra
          or Neharwal gotras. Afif writes that Firozshah had deputed a number of soldiers and
          officers to look after the canals so that the water could flow safely through the villages
          and towns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0257643013477250">59</xref></sup></p>
        <p>The Jats of Berwal also lived in Hissar. Originally, the Berwal Jats had carved out their
          settlements in region of Churu (Rajasthan). Later on after the fourteenth century, they
          moved towards the region of Hissar (Haryana). During the medieval period, the area of
          Berwal Jats was less fertile, with thorny bushes and berries. This fact is corroborated by
          Barani who states that that due to the scarcity of water, plum bushes and other thorny
          plants were found in plenty in the region of Hissar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0257643013477250">60</xref></sup> The term ‘Ber’, also became associated
          with the social identity of Jat farmers of that area who were now known as ‘Berwal’. The
          Jats of the Malik gotra were not only found in Haryana but also in Western UP. The Malik
          gotra is not confined only to the Jats, but also refers to other Hindu castes, such as
          Punjabi, Harijans and Gujjar. We find this gotra in the Muslim population of Pakistan
          (around Lahore and Rawalpindi) too. During the Sultanate period, Malik used to be a title
          or rank in the army, just like Mansabdar in the Mughal army. So, the identification of
          this gotra emerged from military ranks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0257643013477250">61</xref></sup> That is why people of this gotra are found
          among various castes. Similarly, the Dalal gotra, too was formed not on the basis of a
          common ancestor but on the basis of a certain profession. During the medieval period, the
          brokers who dealt with foodstuffs and grain were called ‘Dalal’. Some of the Jat gotras
          were formed on the criteria of localities, such as Punia, Sansanwal, Deshwal, Dahiya and
          Bagri. Other gotras like Tanwar, Panwar, Chauhan and Rana are common in Jats and Rajputs
          and other communities. Some other gotras common among Jats, Bishnois, Gujjars and Harijans
          are Godara, Kataria, and Gothwal.</p>
        <p>The peacock is regarded as a totem of the Jats and they have a special respect for their
          emblem. Crook, while commenting on the Jats, has suggested that a few groups claim their
          origin with the peacock. For example, in Jind and Hissar districts of Haryana, the Jats
          have Moor and Banwala (Peacock) gotras. In fact the Jats of the Moor and Banwala gotras
          consider themselves brothers or fraternal groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0257643013477250">62</xref></sup></p>
        <p>The <italic>Mardumshumari Rajmarwar</italic>, 1891, mentions that the Punia and Godara
          Jats are the oldest inhabitants of Western Rajasthan. Godara means those who possess
              cows.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0257643013477250">63</xref></sup> The Punia
          Jats, found in a majority in the Churu district of Rajasthan, are among the poorest Jat
          groups. They originate from a large village named Punia Jat, situated in the state of
              Bikaner.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0257643013477250">64</xref></sup> Some of
          the families whose livelihood was cattle rearing settled around Hissar. The place where
          cattle rearing took place was termed as Kharak Punia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0257643013477250">65</xref></sup> In the Nagaur pargana of Rajasthan many of
          the Jat communities are known by their village names such as Indana, Mundel, Jalwania,
          Deedel, Dugolia and Varnagawan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0257643013477250">66</xref></sup> Other regions like Bharatpur and Mathura also have Jat gotras derived
          from village names, such as Sinsiniwal, Sogaria and Sorot.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0257643013477250">67</xref></sup> By the end of the eighteenth century the
          Jats were thus able to form more than 250 gotras.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0257643013477250">68</xref></sup> The identity of the majority of Jats was
          based either on occupation, village, region or some kind of totem. The Jats used the
          gotras to forge a new social identity which was composite as well as specific.</p>
        <p>Historical evidence pertaining to Jats appears increasingly in contemporary literature
          especially after the late seventeenth century with the beginning of agrarian revolts. A
          large number of Jat peasants and zamindars participated in revolts against the Mughal
          State to assert their own socio-economic position. The Mughal State deputed spies to
          provide information on the activities of the rebels. There is interesting information
          regarding a certain Jat named Churaman Jat who was a rebel fighting the Mughals. The
          information includes locations of fortresses, numerical strength of men and arsenals and
          strategies of how he would meet the Rajput bhumias while pretending to attend religious
          ceremonies.</p>
        <p>Although one would expect the Khap Panchayat to play a key role during times of upheaval
          and mobilization, no such organization is mentioned in the reports. Had this organization
          been active in the Mughal period, it is needless to say that the land revenue officers and
          the spies would have mentioned and reported it to the Mughal authorities. Contrary to
          historical evidence, present day Khap Panchayats claim their existence at least from
          Mughal times. They also emphasize that they fought against the Mughal authorities. Even if
          the panchayats had conducted their meetings in the forests, this would have found mention
          in either the Mughal records or the Rajput and the Indo-Persian chronicles.</p>

        <title>The Jat Revolts</title>
        <p>Revolt against the Mughals in such an organized and sustained manner is a clear testimony
          of the enhanced socio-economic position of the Jats that encompassed some form of caste
          identity. Apparently the most important cause for the revolt during the late seventeenth
          and the early eighteenth century can be explained in the economic exploitation Jats
          suffered at the hands of the Mughal authorities. The Jat movement (1668–1735 <sc>AD</sc>)
          was a long struggle of farmers and zamindars that shook the Mughal State to its core. It
          is therefore, not surprising to note that the Jat revolt was chiefly centred around the
          areas of Agra, Mathura, Bharatpur, Delhi, Hodal, Palwal and Mewat. The Jat Revolts got
          their impetus from the collective strength of farmers and zamindars. Among the chief rebel
          leaders who provided direction and a sense of unity were Gokula, Rajaram, Bhojraj and
          Churaman. The credit for the collective struggles cannot however go to the Khap Panchayats
          since there is no evidence of their existence. Nor did the Khap Panchayats bear any record
          or criticize the atrocious actions of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb who publically ordered
          the beheading of Gokula Jat.</p>
        <p>Thousands of peasants belonging to different castes, such as Meena, Meo and Gujjar, were
          involved in the Jat struggles to contest and protest the rigorous land revenue policy of
          the Mughals. For example, in the year 1714, the Meo peasants who belonged to twenty
          villages of Pargana Khohri left their village because of the levying of heavy land revenue
          and took shelter in the Thun fort of Churaman Jat,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0257643013477250">69</xref></sup> which already had a strength of 12000
          professional warriors. Churaman Jat even employed a number of Afghans from Bareilly and
          Sahajahanpur at a salary of ₹3 per day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0257643013477250">70</xref></sup> There was a powerful section of the
          Gujjars of Helak and Sihi in the army of Jats. Harji Gujjar was the Commander in Chief who
          died while fighting in Delhi. Later on Raja Surajmal built Harji Kund as a
              memorial.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0257643013477250">71</xref></sup> It is
          evident that the Jats were not alone in their struggle, but were aided by other
          communities who lived close by. As a matter of fact, the local Jat zamindars strengthened
          the social base of the Jat movement during the Mughal period. Their army consisted of the
          farmers (irrespective of their caste) who were victims of heavy land revenue demands
          imposed on them by the Mughal State. For example, Amar Singh Jat of Tappa Khair in Kol
          (Aligarh) pargana, Nanda Jat and his son were very influential in the region of Khurja.
          Apart from these, Khemkaran Sogaria, Rati Ram Jat of Jargaon, Anceram, Roop Singh, Govind
          Ram, Daya Ram Jat of Medu, Bhure Singh and Chattar Singh Jat among others had a tremendous
          influence in their own region. They used to keep strong military contingents in their
              fortresses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0257643013477250">72</xref></sup> They
          divided the booty amongst themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0257643013477250">73</xref></sup> After the death of Churaman in 1721 <sc>AD</sc>, the Jat movement got
          divided into two segments and there was a power struggle between Badan Singh and Mohkam
          Singh (son of Churaman) which was resolved with the intervention of these local Jat
          Zamindars. The majority of these Zamindars were with Badan Singh as they were not happy
          with the quarrelsome and arrogant nature of Mohkam Singh.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0257643013477250">74</xref></sup> Moreover, even the Kachhwaha Raja Jai
          Singh of Amber had supported the cause of Badan Singh.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0257643013477250">75</xref></sup> In the year 1723, a Jat state was founded
          in Deeg which later on came to be known as the Bharatpur State.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0257643013477250">76</xref></sup> So we would again like to underline that
          during this long struggle of the Jats, Khap Panchayats had no role to play, that exists in
          any of the extensive set of records available to us.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section5-0257643013477250">
        <title>Khap Panchayat</title>
        <p>Given the spatial distribution of Jats it is not surprising that the major centre(s) of
          the activities of Khap Panchayat is comprised of the areas of Haryana, Western UP and the
          rural belt of the National Capital of Delhi. However, during the Mughal period these areas
          were in the jurisdiction of Delhi Suba from the administrative point of view.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0257643013477250">77</xref></sup> Some of the areas like
          Shahar, Narnaul and Koil (Aligarh) sarkars were located in the jurisdiction of Agra
              Suba.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0257643013477250">78</xref></sup> It is
          imperative to have a look at the spatial distribution and social status of the Jats in and
          around Delhi and Agra Suba at the end of the sixteenth century. The Delhi Suba comprised a
          total of 8 sarkars and 232 parganas. Of these 64 parganas had Jat Zamindaris and out of
          these 27 parganas were wholly under the control of the Jat zamindars and in 37 parganas
          the Jat had their shared Zamindari with other castes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0257643013477250">79</xref></sup> The Agra Suba had a total of 13 sarkars
          comprising 203 parganas and Jats had their zamindaris in 22 parganas. Out of these, 5
          parganas were under complete control of Jat zamindars (meaning only the Jat community) and
          in 17 parganas the Jats had shared zamindaris with other castes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0257643013477250">80</xref></sup> Interestingly, these figures indicate that
          the Jats did not have much influence in the Delhi and the Agra Suba till the end of the
          sixteenth century. Most of the Parganas of Delhi Suba were placed in the category of
          Khalisa jagir (whose land revenue was directly deposited in the coffers of Mughal Emperor)
          and the rest of the Parganas were assigned in Tankhawah jagir to the Imperial mansabdars
          in lieu of their salaries. That is why in the Delhi Suba, the land revenue administrative
          officials of the Mughal period had considerable influence at the pargana as well as
          village level. So, to talk about the freedom and autonomy of the Khap Panchayats in this
          area would be misleading. The <italic>Ain-i-Akbari</italic> gives us the information that
          in many parganas of the Delhi Suba, along with the Jats, other caste zamindaris like
          Rajputs, Muslims and Brahmins existed, which implies that the village council consisted of
          mixed castes. For example, in 1665 <sc>AD</sc>, in pargana Chalkaliyana the Jats occupied
          51.43 per cent zamindaris out of 100 villages, while 31.45 per cent and 17.14 per cent
          were controlled by the Rajputs and the Muslims respectively. Another important point is
          that the strengthening of the social position and identity of Jats took place only after
          the sixteenth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0257643013477250">81</xref></sup>
          It is further testified by the fact that later on during the period of Jat revolt
          (1668–1735 <sc>AD</sc>) in Agra Suba there was a considerable increase in Jat
              zamindaris.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0257643013477250">82</xref></sup></p>
        <p>We would expect to find an institution like the Khap Panchayat to have grown in
          prominence over a long period of time. However the history of the Jats does not contain a
          single reference to the Khap Panchayat. Even settlement patterns do not furnish additional
          evidence. Nevertheless, for a better comprehension of the process of solidarity and to
          attempt to locate the role of Khap Panchayat, if any, it is important for us to analyze
          the social position of the Jats of Western UP right from the medieval period. The
            <italic>Ain-i-Akbari</italic> informs that out of a total of 22 parganas, only in 7
          parganas, did the Jats have zamindaris. These 7 parganas were Kutana, Masudabad,
          Chaprauli, Tandah, Jhimjhimati, Jalabad and Jalalpur which are located in the modern
          Meerut district.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0257643013477250">83</xref></sup> The
          rest of the 15 parganas previously belonged to Tagas, Gurjars, Rajputs and Muslims,
          whereas gradually this area became dominated by the Jats.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0257643013477250">84</xref></sup> Similarly, in the area of modern Aligarh
          which was known as Koil Sarkar, according to <italic>Ain-i-Akbari</italic>, the majority
          of the parganas in this suba were dominated by the Rajputs and Muslim zamindaris. Thus it
          is apparent that there was no Jat zamindari in the Aligarh Sarkar till the end of the
          sixteenth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0257643013477250">85</xref></sup>
          Later on we find evidence in Rajasthani sources which suggest that by the end of the
          seventeenth century, the Jats had established their zamindari over many parganas in Koil
          (Aligarh) sarkar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0257643013477250">86</xref></sup>
          During the eighteenth century, Jats had established big Talukdaris in the areas of Jawar,
          Murasan, Hathras and Iglas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0257643013477250">87</xref></sup> These big Talukdaris played a major role in the establishment and later
          part of the military structure of the Bharatpur state. Two factors played an important
          role in the sudden rise of Jat zamindaris in the region of Western UP. The first one was
          that many new Jat settlers migrated to this region in search of land which was available
          in abundance. According to the <italic>Ain-i-Akbari</italic>, the major part of the area
          was heavily forested at the end of the sixteenth century and therefore offered
          possibilities for settlements. Second, during the period of the agrarian revolts, the Jats
          had successfully replaced the Gujjars and Tagas from their zamindaris and established
          their own zamindaris due to their superior military power and social position. The British
          land revenue officer of the time, Mr. Gillan noted, <disp-quote>
            <p>The Jats are hard thrifty men, and it is hardly necessary to say, admirable
              cultivators. They are found all through the district (Meerut) and nearly everywhere in
              large numbers; but their chief possessions are in the north-west where they call their
              ‘Des’. It is said that they had invaded the district, driving out the Tagas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-0257643013477250">88</xref></sup></p>
          </disp-quote></p>
        <p>The Jats of Western UP are divided into 92 gotras most of which are similar to those of
          the Rajputs, for example, Tomar, Pawar, Rana, Chauhan, Gahlot and so on, from the
          ethnographic point of view. The Jats of these areas may be classified into two broad
          categories—Hales and Des—which are commonly known by the names of Pachhadas and
              Deswals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-0257643013477250">89</xref></sup> In common
          parlance, these are also known as Bagri and Deshwala. Earlier, dissimilarities prevented
          inter-caste marriages, although this is not the case today. The Deswals considered
          themselves to be the natives whereas the Pachchads were treated as ‘Baagris’ or outside
          settlers and as a result they were treated as inferiors. The Pachhads believe that their
          ancestors had settled here from the areas of Jaisalmer and Sindh around 1000
              <sc>AD</sc>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-0257643013477250">90</xref></sup></p>
        <p>Although the Khap Panchayats claim that they were the dominant community from the period
          of the Delhi Sultanate, the analysis in the foregoing sections demonstrates that the
          social position of the Jats remained weak till the end of the sixteenth century. In modern
          times, the most united form of panchayat has been found in Meham Chaubisi (Rohtak)
          (panchayat of 24 villages) and even this has representatives from different sections of
          society. Meham Chaubisi Sarvkhap Panchayat also claims to be an old institution but does
          not pretend to have any written farmans or documents issued by the Mughal authorities. Ch.
          Kabul Singh of Saurabh village (Mujaffarnagar district) has a number of farmans issued to
          the Jat Khap Panchayats by Emperor Akbar which are written in Hindi, although a number of
          Urdu words have also been incorporated. But when examined by a medieval historian, these
          documents from the Rajasthan state archives were not found to be genuine, as they are not
          written in Persian, which was the language of the State in the Mughal Empire. One can
          indentify Mughal farmans in two ways: first, ‘Allah-hu-Akbar’ meaning ‘God is Great’ is
          written at the top, and second, they always contain the seal of the Emperor. Along with
          the seal, we also find Tugra, the name of the Emperors and his ancestors inscribed on the
          farmans (the decorated signatures of the Emperor were termed as ‘Tugra’). The farmans in
          possession of the Khap Panchayats have neither the seals nor the Tugra of the Mughal
          Emperors.</p>
        <p>In Western UP, there had been a good deal of ethnographical difference between the
          Pachhadas and the Deshwals, where the former were considered socially inferior to the
          latter. From the social and economic point of view however, the Pachhadas were far more
          advanced than the Deshwals. It seems probable that the Pachhadas claimed their own
          superiority by citing the Khap Panchayats. A similar history was also been written about
          the Marathas in the early twentieth century when their revolts against the Mughal state
          during the reign of Aurangzeb were projected as a ‘Hindu awakening’ or a kind of national
          movement. There seems to be no historical basis for concluding that such a history was
          written by the Jats highlighting the importance of Khap Panchayats.</p>
        <p>The agrarian movements during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries by the
          Jats against the Mughal Empire strengthened their social identity. During this period, the
          Jat zamindars were able to mobilize a large number of Jat peasants, in their fortress
          (grahis). The peasants of the surrounding villages used to assemble in the gharhis of the
          Jat zamindars hoping to get rid of their heavy land revenue burdens. This process not only
          strengthened the feeling of brotherhood among the Jat peasantry and Jat zamindars but it
          also provided a strong political and social identity to the Jat community. For example,
          the zamindars of Sinsini village (Raja Ram, Bhajja, Churaman and so on) were identified as
          Sinsinwal gotra Jats. Similarly the Sogaria and Sorot Jats made their gotra identity well
              recognized.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-0257643013477250">91</xref></sup></p>
        <p>The Jat Khap Panchayats have objected to marriages of boys and girls in same gotra, based
          on their social and cultural practices. The Khap Panchayats state that Jat society has
          found such practices unacceptable since ancient times and they claim to protect their
          cultural heritage by banning such intra-gotra marriages. Hence, it becomes necessary to
          discuss a few aspects of social and cultural elements in the history of the Jats.
          Historians have found that the origin of few Jat gotras in medieval times is linked to
          professions or locality, rather than a particular personality. Rajasthani documents and
          the reports from British ethnographers state that although Jat society did not follow any
          particular social customs and rituals for marriage in the pre-modern period, the Jats do
          not marry within their own gotra. Prabhu Dayal Mittal writes about the Braj Jats that they
          may marry the elder brother’s widow. This tradition separates them from other Hindus
          because in Hindu society, the elder brother’s wife has a social position, second only to
          the mother of the family. This is the reason that Jats are growing in a large number. Jat
          can keep any woman in their house after getting married with her. That is also why Jats
          had been considered as a lower or less Hindu caste.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-0257643013477250">92</xref></sup></p>
        <p>The Rajasthani documents bear out that Jats could and did marry women who belonged to
          other castes. To illustrate this fact, Giridhar Jat of pargana Jalalpur married the
          ex-wife of Murali Nai in 1739, and kept her with him without paying the Garecha tax (tax
          on re-marriage) to the state. When the matter was discovered, he was fined ₹20 by the
              Amil.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-0257643013477250">93</xref></sup> Similarly,
          Prasa Jat of village Nainapur in pragana Harsana got married to an Ahir woman.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-0257643013477250">94</xref></sup> In the same way, Nathu Jat
          of Jaisinghpura in pragana Maujpur got married to the ex-wife of Nanu Mali.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-0257643013477250">95</xref></sup> In the Hashil Farohi column
          of Arsatta documents we find many examples in which the Jat community issued no
          restrictions to a person who wanted to get married to a woman from another caste. Jats
          therefore did not have restrictions or taboos about the customs and traditions regarding
          marriages. That is why a popular saying states that <italic>Jat ka kya Hindu aur Meo ka
            kya Musalman</italic>. This conveys that it is difficult to clearly equate the religion
          of Jats as Hindu, or the religion of the Meo as Muslim. Jats did not rigidly observe Hindu
          traditions, nor did Meos closely observe Muslim traditions. This saying thus captures the
          fluidity of these modern day categories like Jats being Hindus and Meos being Muslims. One
          can safely say that the Jat community stood apart from the rigid boundaries of Brahmanical
          Hindu order. Possibly this may be a reason why today the Jat gotras are more numerous than
          any other caste apart from the Brahmans. It also shows that from the Mughal period to the
          present, Jat communities have developed in strikingly different ways from other
          groups.</p>
        <p>R.P. Rana has also shown in his study that the Jat community’s socio-cultural traditions
          and practices did not confirm with the rigid cultural religious of the Hindu caste
              system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-0257643013477250">96</xref></sup> Though
          most of the Haryana region remained untouched by the Bhakti movement in the medieval
          period, the influence of this monotheistic movement could be still seen in many places.
          The areas near to Rohtak are considered to be influenced by Nathpanthis. The Gaddi of
          Nathpanthis in Asthal Bohar village proves that nearby Jats may have been influenced by
          the ideology of Nathpanthis. The Nathpanthis by and large also rejected Brahamincal
          religious ideology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-0257643013477250">97</xref></sup>
          Since, the eighteenth century, Jats have been followers of the monotheistic ideology of
          Baba Haridas in rural areas of Delhi and Bahadurgarh (Haryana). Similarly Nischchal Das
          and Garibdas have been the religio-cultural preceptors of the Jats in the villages of
          Jhajjar district of Haryana.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-0257643013477250">98</xref></sup> These saints were the followers and preceptors of Monotheistic ideology
          that challenged the Brahaminical ideology and dominance of the caste system. There has
          been much similarity between the Nathpanthis and the tenets of the Monotheistic religious
          ideology. Therefore, it will not be incorrect to state that the rural area of Rohtak,
          Jhajjar, Bahadurgarh and Delhi has never imitated rigid caste segregation, since the area
          was influenced by monotheistic ideology. Later on in the early twentieth century, these
          areas came under the influence of Arya Samaj, perhaps due to their already established
          inclinations towards monotheistic leanings. Subsequently, the Arya Samaj ideology led to
          the establishment of a large number of gurukuls in these areas.</p>

      <title>To Sum Up</title>
      <p>The discussion in the foregoing sections is a clear testimony that the claims of Khap
        Panchayat having long historical origins is difficult to sustain. Even a cursory look at the
        historical processes concerning the Jat community and the idea of the panchayat, is
        sufficient to challenge any such claim. We have tried to historically examine the nature of
        panchayats especially in Jat areas and argued that the nature of panchayats during the
        Mughal era was not fully explained by British officers and historians. The village panchayat
        was not an autonomous or independent organization in the Mughal period, and its area and
        reach of work were limited. Most of the quarrels and crimes that related to matters at the
        village level were sent to the office of the Amil and thus the panchayats had a very limited
        role, if any. When rural panchayats were neither autonomous nor independent then how is it
        possible to consider the autonomy and influence of Khap Panchayats?</p>
      <p>It is important to take note of the followings factors. The Khap Panchayats are not common
        or popular throughout the greater Jat community. They are totally unknown in Bikaner, Churu,
        Sikkar, Jodhpur, Nagaur, Merta, Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts of Rajasthan, where a
        large number of Jat peasants have been residing since medieval times. In Haryana also the
        Jat peasants of Sirsa district are not familiar with the Khap panchayat. Similarly, there
        was no organization like the Khap Panchayat in the medieval period which was independent and
        autonomous in character. Such a claim is not supported by any contemporary historical
        document. An important document relied on by the Jats is a handwritten booklet by Pandit
        KanhaRam which mentions dates and meetings of the events related to Sarvakhap Panchayats
        since medieval times. Very few of the dates from this booklet actually match with the dates
        of historical events. Moreover, it is necessary to verify the historicity of the booklet of
        Pandit KanhaRam itself. First, the booklet claims that the Sarvakhap Panchayats were
        independent and autonomous in their decision making. Second, they are supposed to have
        opposed the anti-Hindu policies of the Mughal emperors and the Sultans of Delhi. Third, they
        were supposedly motivated by national consciousness and hence fought against the Muslim
        invaders, for instance, Mohammad Ghauri in the the twelfth century, Tamurlane in the late
        fourteenth century, Babur in the early fifteenth century and Ahmad Shah Abdali<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-0257643013477250">99</xref></sup> in the third battle of Panipat
        in 1761 <sc>AD</sc>. This contention appears quite untenable in the absence of corroborative
        information. Babur in his Baburnama has given a very good description of the battle of
        Khanwah and has described all the names of petty Rais and rulers who came in support of Rana
        Sanga to fight against Babur. But the Baburnama never once mentions anything about the role
        of the Jats or their panchayats. In the same way, it is not supported by any historical
        source that Jats fought in favour of Maratha Sardar Bhave in the third battle of
        Panipat.</p>
      <p>It is important to realize that it was only after the year 1960, with the politics of
        Chaudhry Charan Singh, that a well defined identity of the Jats of Western UP took concrete
        shape. During this phase, based upon their own gotras, numerous Khaps also came into
        existence which, were earlier in an embryonic stage, if present at all. These Khaps produced
        a number of local political leaders. In the politics of Haryana also, these Khaps came to
        hold sway only after the period of the Emergency. Even in Haryana the rise of Khap
        Panchayats can be attributed, on the lines of Western UP, to the politics of Chaudhry
        Devilal.</p>
      <p>Recently, Khap Panchayats have started issuing new orders for its members and are
        attempting to even amend the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955.</p>
      <p>It is no surprise to note that as a matter of fact Khap Panchayats are patriarchal in
        nature. Regrettably, one of the decisions of Khap Panchayats is as follows: a meeting of the
        Khap Panchayat was held in the Sisana village on 23 March, 1993 (Sunday) hosted by the
        Dahiya Khap of the Jats, in which more than one lakh people (the sarpanches) from Haryana,
        Delhi, UP, Punjab and Rajasthan participated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-0257643013477250">100</xref></sup> The Sarvkhap was headed by Chaudhry
        Ramphal Dahiya, the head of Dahiya Khap. The decisions taken in the panchayat concerning
        women are as follows: Sarvkhap unanimously decided that rights of a girl should be decided
        following from the property of the husband rather than on the property of the father. Only
        in the absence of a brother should the inheritance rights be passed on to the daughter(s).
        The Sarvkhap believes in equality of education and girls should be educated like boys but
        instead of co-educational schools and colleges, we should have separate schools and colleges
        for girls. The girls or the women of the family should not be taken for Barat (marriage
        party). The Sarvkhap also opposed the 33 per cent women reservation given to them by the
        Panchayati Raj. These bodies have always opposed the right of inheritance for women. Under
        the pressure of these Khap Panchayats, the government of Haryana made an amendment in the
        right to inheritance, and sent it to the President for approval. However, this was dismissed
        by the Hon’ble President. Thus Khap Panchayats in their approach appear to be not only
        resisting democratic institutions but are even anti-women.</p>
      <p>It will not be incorrect to suggest that the changed social composition of these panchayats
        tells us a lot about their growing conservatism. As mentioned earlier, in a few districts of
        Haryana and Western UP, Jats enjoy considerable influence on the basis of their population.
        They are the owners of extensive farming lands and also enjoy a dominant place in local
        administration and politics. However, in the recent past it has been observed that the Khap
        Panchayats are being actively dominated by retired army officers or civil officers, who use
        it as platform to project their own political image. These people do not hesitate to raise
        sensitive issues like gotra and matrimonial disputes. On the pretext of safeguarding culture
        and tradition the Khap Panchayats are being harnessed to gain political mileage and to
        exploit the ignorance of the local populace by creating mass hysteria.</p>
      <p>In the Jat community if a boy and a girl marry in the same gotra, the Khap Panchayats
        declare them to be criminals and violators of their social code of conduct. Khap Panchayats
        put forth the argument that people of the same gotras have a common ancestor referred to as
        Dada. The couple belonging to the same gotra are like siblings and thus, they cannot marry
        each other. The basic character of most of the Khap Panchayats is patriarchal and most of
        its policies are anti-women. Even a glimpse of the system of justice meted out by these
        Panchayats is a clear testimony of its true character. I would like to conclude that Khap
        Panchayats do not have any legitimacy or historical basis. They do not have any basis in
        ancient social institutions, but are of recent origin and have come into existence in the
        context of modern social, political and economic conditions.</p>

          <p>Kanha Ram, <italic>Untitled Pothi</italic> (In possession of Chaudhary Qabul Singh
            village Shoram, Dist. Muzaffarnagar) containing 16 wrongly bound leaves written on both
            sides. The first leaf, though mutilated, mentions Samvat 1840. The visible difference in
            ink and size of letters suggests its gradual compilation. Even if began in Samrat 1840,
            it was completed at a later date. Its author, Pandit Kanharam is said to have been a
            person of local repute and was a resident of village Shoram, Dist. Muzaffarnagar. This
            manuscript written in bad Hindi, is an unconnected compilation mostly from earlier but
            now untraceable pothis and partly from the author’s own observation, showing the
            activities of the Jats and other local people, especially of the Doah and Haryana region
            during the Medieval times. Its earlier portion (leaves 3a–11a) refers to the meetings of
            the Sarvakhap Panchayat held in Samat 1252, 1254 (in a Jungle near Baraut), 1256, 1305,
            1352 (Bhokharhedi) 1317 (Libberhedi), 1344 (Shikarpur), 1383 (Sisauli), 1408 (in a
            Jungle near Sishauli), 1455 (in a Jungle of Chaugama), 1460 (Sikarpur), 1547 (in a
            jungle near Baraut), 1560 (Bavali), 1584, 1597 (Kairana), 1613 (Nisarh), 1621 (Shoram),
            1665 (Khekaram), 1686 (Nisarh), 1718 (Chhaprauli), 1727, 1764 (Bhaisewal), 1766 (Karnal)
            and 1817 (Sisauli). The latter part of the Pothi (leaves 11a–16b) bound reversely,
            enumerate the social customs of the Jats and other people and the nature, scope,
            formation and functioning of the Sarvakhap Panchayat. The dates in some cases are
            incorrect and the numbers of participants in the Sarvakhap Panchayat meetings and of
            local militia raised for any battle seems to be highly inflated. See G.C. Dwivedi,
