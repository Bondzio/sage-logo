<p>Principal leadership is inextricably linked to student performance and the importance of effective principals is undisputed. This issue offers several important articles that principals will find valuable in pursuit of becoming more accomplished and skillful in promoting school success.</p>
<p>In the lead article, researchers Fisher and Frey explore how school improvement efforts that often focus on students who are below grade level affect gifted and talented students. These improvement efforts typically focus on improving instruction, often through a framework and professional development. The authors examined how gifted and talented students respond to this type of instruction. They found that “teacher modeling was valuable, that group work should include accountability, and that homework should be reasonable.” Practical and useful strategies that secondary principals can use to help them develop school improvement actions that are inclusive of students who are gifted are provided.</p>
<p>How to define effective teaching and how to accurately measure it has recently become one of the most discussed topics in education. With teachers being the most important factor in increasing student achievement, policymakers and school leaders alike are examining how to ensure effective teachers in every classroom. Range, Duncan, Scherz, and Haines explored the perceptions of school leaders about the traits of incompetent teachers, strategies used to work with incompetent teachers, and the barriers to their dismissal. The researchers offer suggestions to school leaders regarding supervision and evaluation procedures and processes specifically identifying key considerations for addressing ineffective teachers.</p>
<p>The third article casts a spotlight on the leadership challenges of implementing standards-based student groupings across a school district in math and language arts. Researcher Vogel examined the actions of district and school leaders in changing from a traditional age-based grade-level structure to a standards-based student-grouping model. Specific leadership actions that advanced fundamental cultural, structural, and procedural changes in schools and classrooms, as well as the challenges encountered in the change process are summarized in their findings. Community and district contextual factors that promoted or impeded the change process are also identified. Principals will find the recommendations for implementation strategies and actions for leading innovation and change relevant to their own practices.</p>
<p>It is well acknowledged that confidentiality is important in the school counselor relationship. In some circumstances, school policy may require disclosure of content discussed in counseling unrelated to threat of harm to self or others. O’Connell’s article addresses the practice of confidentiality in school counseling and the attitude of secondary principals toward this practice. Important strategies for developing clear confidentiality practices are described. Principals will find the discussion and review of the complex ethical and legal obligations that both the school counselor and the principal have with regard to student rights and confidentiality instructive.</p>
<p>Principals and school district leadership will find these articles thought provoking and enlightening. Important concerns and issues are discussed that inform principals’ essential work in improving schools. Each article is a “must read”!</p>
