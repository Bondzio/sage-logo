<p>Trying to explain what Gregg Gillis, who performs under the stage name Girl Talk, does to someone who grew up in the eras of The Doors or The Ramones can be a bit challenging. Technically, Gillis is a mash-up artist—someone who combines two or more samples of music to create new musical experience.</p>
<p>As an example, one of the most famous mash-ups is DJ Danger Mouse’s “Grey Album,” a combination of the vocals from rapper Jay-Z’s “The Black Album” and samples from the Beatles 1968 album, “The Beatles” (better known as “The White Album”). But despite the artistic success of straightforward mash-ups by artists such as Danger Mouse, nothing compares to the sonic collages created by Girl Talk. Gillis, who has a degree in biomedical engineering, quit his day job several years ago to create his remixes. His most recent album, “All Day,” reportedly contains at least four hundred samples—typically snippets of rap combined with samples of pop, rock, or soul music from the past forty or fifty years, including The Doors and the Ramones.</p>
<p>Both Danger Mouse and Girl Talk have given away their albums online, and none of the samples have been licensed or paid for use. Capitol/EMI, the Beatles publisher, sent out a cease-and-desist letter telling Danger Mouse and the websites hosting his work to take down the album because it infringed on the Beatles’ copyright. But when the album remained online, nothing happened to those distributing the content. And so far, no one has sued Girl Talk’s Gillis for his massive sampling.</p>
<p>It is the world of such collagists working in the legal netherworld between fair use and flat-out infringement that occupies the attention of <italic>Cutting across Media: Appropriation Art, Interventionist Collage, and Copyright Law</italic>. The book is an eclectic anthology of essays, oral histories, interviews, and collages. The introduction by editors McLeod and Kuenzli sets the stage with the Igor Stravinsky quote, “A good composer does not imitate, he steals” (p. 1). Instead of focusing on the need for and procedures for fair use or the need for the public domain, McLeod and Kuezli look instead at the collage/remix culture that creates new works out of old: “The chapters included here implicitly or explicitly treat collage as a cultural practice that can intervene within mass media, consumer culture, copyright regimes, and everyday life” (p. 2).</p>
<p>A key point in both the opening essay and in the collection itself is that collage/remix/assemblage is not unique to the digital era. Among the examples is a brief essay by Lloyd Dunn from the sound assemblage group The Tape-beatles about his work on <italic>PhotoStatic</italic> magazine and the concept of casual publishing. Photocopiers made it easy for artists to not only combine source materials in new ways but also to distribute the new work on a small-scale and inexpensive way. Following his essay is a series of pages from a 1988 edition of <italic>PhotoStatic</italic> on the Tape-beatles and an interview with Dunn and his colleague John Heck about the legal and creative issues that emerged from their work on sound and visual collages. Another is a photo essay by culture jammer Craig Baldwin portraying billboard alterations and “improvements” from the 1980s and 1990s in the San Francisco area that include turning cigarette billboards into antiwar, antimilitary statements.</p>
<p>The digital age gets its own attention with essays from Davis Schneiderman (on DJ Danger Mouse and others) and from Illegal Arts founder “Philo T. Farnsworth” (the publisher for Girl Talk). Farnsworth argues that while what Girl Talk does is legal under fair use, he would be interested in opening up a wider discussion with the music industry:</p>

<p>Our interests have never been to completely dismantle copyright law, but we operate on the fringes due to the extreme reactions by the entertainment industry to sampling. While we wave the banner of “illegality” to draw attention to the absurdity that our releases would be considered as such, our motives are to promote new forms of music rather than to be criminals. (p. 162)</p>

<p>In contrast, <italic>Reclaiming Fair Use: How to Put Balance Back in Copyright</italic> looks at how current interpretation of copyright and fair use is favoring corporate owners, though the authors argue that content creators and users can reclaim their rights. The book has a clear agenda that copyright and fair use needs to be taken out of the realm of lawyers and into the world of creators and is as much a piece of activism as a scholarly work:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Over the last few years, we have worked with filmmakers, online video makers, dancers, creators of open-access university courseware, media literacy teachers, and librarians. They all had one common problem. They needed to quote copyrighted material in order to do their work well, and the licensing arrangements that work perfectly well for highly professional media operations such as Hollywood studios just didn’t fit their needs. In fact, they sometimes could not get anyone at a studio or music company or archives house to answer their e-mails or calls, because there was so little money in the licensing deals. (p. x)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The authors make a convincing case on the problem of fear of fair use through examples taken from world of documentary filmmaking. Gordon Quinn, an executive producer for <italic>Hoop Dreams</italic>, ran up against the fear of fair use while editing a film about new immigrants to the United States. One potential scene featured a Nigerian immigrant driving a taxi while listening to George Strait on the radio. A white man rides up beside the immigrant on a motorcycle and glares at him. Despite really liking the scene, Quinn says he cut it because he knew that he would not be able to get the owners of the rights to the song to respond to his request for permission because it would be worth such a small amount of money.</p>
<p>The point is that Quinn likely could have legally run the clip and used the George Strait song as incidental background music without any licensing whatsoever, but he didn’t because the filmmaking community has such an aversion to any risk about using any copyrighted material without a license. It’s not because it is illegal but because the filmmaker will have trouble getting insurance. Quinn’s dilemma highlights one of the authors’ central points: many people are both users and creators when it comes to copyright, and as creators, they don’t want to do anything that might compromise the income they receive from licensing the content of their own work.</p>
<p>The book provides a deep history of fair use, going back to the origins of copyright in seventeenth-century England. And while the authors are not particularly focused on the public domain, they also provide a good discussion of that aspect. At the core of the book is the tension in copyright law between property rights and the propagation of culture. The central problem they see with copyright law today is that it is viewed as being almost exclusively about property rights and the control of intellectual assets in a way that frames virtually all the discourse as avoidance of becoming involved in an expensive lawsuit:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Most importantly for fair use, [trade organizations] represented all copyright policy as being about protection of copyright holders’ monopolies. All unlicensed taking was stealing, or “piracy.” Paying copyright holders was a moral act—the only right thing to do. The only way to “respect” copyright, in these lessons, was to pay for all access to copyrighted material. Copying was represented not only as wrong but as immoral. (p. 49)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The authors also provide ample suggestions on developing best practices for user/creators that allow them to stay solidly within fair use standards and convince risk-averse backers to understand that fair use is being met. As an example, they show how Quinn, who cut from his film the scene featuring the George Strait music, worked on developing best practices for fair use for documentary filmmakers.</p>
<p><italic>Reclaiming Fair Use</italic> is an excellent history and how-to manual on fair use brought down occasionally by a drumbeat on the evils of current interpretation of copyright laws.</p>
