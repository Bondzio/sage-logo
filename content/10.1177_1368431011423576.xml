<abstract>
<p>This article presents a blueprint of a feminist agenda for the twenty-first century that is oriented not by the <italic>telos</italic> of gender parity, but instead evolves as an ‘immanent critique’ of the key structural dynamics of contemporary capitalism – within a framework of analysis derived from the tenets of Critical Theory of Frankfurt School origin. This activates a form of critique whose double focus on (1) shared conceptions of justice; and (2) structural sources of injustice, allows criteria of social justice to emerge from the identification of a broad pattern of societal injustice surpassing the discrimination of particular groups. In this light, women’s victimization is but a symptom of structural dynamics negatively affecting also the alleged winners in the classical feminist agenda of critique. The analysis ultimately produces a model of social justice in a formula of socially embedded autonomy that unites work, care, and leisure.</p>

<p>The agenda of second-wave feminism, we are repeatedly told, is unfinished.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1368431011423576">1</xref>
</sup> While women have effectively gained ground by increasing their command of economic resources, as well as by enhancing their capacity to exercise autonomy, our societies are still haunted by gendered job segregation of both paid and unpaid work, the ‘glass ceiling’, and the gender wage gap. Even worse, as Nancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368431011423576">Fraser (2009</xref>) has contended, second-wave feminism has been unwittingly co-opted by the forces of neoliberal, ‘flexible’ capitalism, which thrived on the feminist cause of emancipation from domesticity and empowerment through participation in the labour market. In this way, second-wave feminism has ultimately served ‘to legitimate a structural transformation of capitalist society that runs directly counter to feminist visions of a just society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368431011423576">Fraser, 2009</xref>: 99).</p>
<p>I do not propose to deal here with the unfinished business of feminism. Instead, I will adumbrate a new model for conceptualizing gender justice, enabled by the transformative dynamics of capitalism in the twenty-first century. This would necessitate a shift in the perspective and nature of inquiry. Second-wave feminism proceeded from the point of view of the injustice of exclusion: exclusion from the system of production of economic and symbolic power which, being androgenic and economistic, devalorized and disadvantaged women. The old agenda was, largely, driven by a concern with parity – economic, political and cultural parity between men and women. It asked the question: how can women achieve parity in well-being with men, and proposed a variety of gender-equalizing strategies such as full access to the labour market (against the andocentric ‘family wage’), together with the unmasking of non-economic inequalities as sources of injustice. The new agenda is to be oriented, I will argue, not by a concern with <italic>parity</italic> within the old institutional model of the political economy of capitalism, but by a concern with the <italic>model of well-being</italic> itself.</p>
<p>While this shift in the nature of inquiry is necessitated by the losses suffered by second-wave feminism, it is enabled by its gains. Whatever feminism might have failed to accomplish, it did succeed in shifting the balance of <italic>relational</italic> power between the sexes by granting women<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1368431011423576">2</xref>
</sup> access to economic, political, and cultural resources. This newly gained relational power gives women the opportunity to exercise <italic>structural</italic> power (to use the conceptual dichotomy coined by Susan Strange)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1368431011423576">3</xref>
</sup> – that is, the power to change the rules of the game, the norms structuring the environment of social interactions, in a word – the power to alter the very model of the political economy of capitalism in advanced liberal democracies. In order to reconstruct a feminist agenda along these lines, we need to bring political economy back into the normative debate on justice.</p>
<p>An opportune synergy between a critique of political economy and normative analysis of justice is available within Critical Theory as a tradition of social philosophy. I refer to the reflective social science that was developed at the Institute for Social Research (Institut für Sozialforschung) in Frankfurt in the 1930s, outside of the transcendental turn Jürgen Habermas effected sometime in the 1960s, triggering the marginalization of political economy in the analysis of capitalism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1368431011423576">4</xref>
</sup> This tradition of social philosophy contains a notion of emancipatory politics that retains much of the Marxian engagement with political economy, altogether avoiding the fallacy of economic reductionism. It is this engagement with the political economy of capitalism – with the liberating as well as subjugating tendencies in its transformation – that I find cogent to the analysis of social justice, including gender-related aspects of injustice, in the early twenty-first century. From this perspective, social justice can be conceptualized via an analysis of the key stratificatory dynamics of capitalism – dynamics that affect the distribution of life-chances in society, thereby fostering a <italic>historically particular</italic>, but <italic>structurally general</italic> experience of injustice, which in turn emanates a <italic>normatively generalizable</italic> notion of justice. Rather than analysing capitalism from the point of view of exclusion, subordination, disempowerment of a particular group (i.e. women), such a perspective directs us to identify a larger systemic pattern of injustice, rooted in the key antinomies of capitalism.</p>
<p>In what follows, I will advance a proposal for a model of social justice able to satisfy feminist concerns with empowerment and autonomy, in which normative criteria emerge via an ‘immanent critique’ of the key structural dynamics of contemporary capitalism, in line with the tenets of Critical Theory. My larger goal is to bring political economy back into the treatment of normative issues of justice, in the style in which political economy had been relevant to the analysis of culture in the work of the founders of Critical Theory.</p>
<p>The article proceeds as follows: in the first part, I briefly review those tenets of Critical Theory that are most relevant to the task at hand, i.e. the articulation of normative criteria befitting the nature of capitalism underlying the political framework of early twenty-first-century liberal democracies. I will thereby enunciate a notion of <italic>socially embedded autonomy</italic> to replace the ideal of gender parity, and will articulate a framework of analysis. This framework will be operationalized in the second section of the article in the form of analysis of the current transformative dynamics of capitalism. Such an analysis will, eventually, allow the article to present voluntary labour market mobility as the pivotal element in a gender-neutral institutional model of the fair distribution of life-chances in the twenty-first century.</p>

<title>Critical Theory: six requisites of analysis</title>
<p>The concept of what Theodor W. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368431011423576">Adorno (1973)</xref> called ‘immanent critique’ – a critique performed from a perspective internal to the context or culture that serves as an object of analysis, as opposed to ‘transcendent critique’ performed from an imaginary point of reference outside of its object of analysis, has been a constitutive element of the hermeneutic turn in political philosophy. The concept has shared the destiny of hermeneutic philosophy – it rose to prominence with the rejection of scientistic positivism, to be later discredited under the weight of accusations of conventionalism and value relativism. It has recently experienced a revival, as the critical potential of hermeneutical practices related to identity and collective meaning-formation has been vindicated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1368431011423576">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>I do not espouse here, however, the broad hermeneutical version of immanent critique that has risen to novel prominence. More appropriate for the analysis at hand is a specific, admittedly more narrow, form of immanent critique, as designed by the first generation of Frankfurt School authors<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1368431011423576">6</xref>
</sup>– namely critique from an ‘internal point of view’ that accounts not just for context-specific meaning-formation, but also for the socio-structural dynamics of social injustice operating in a given context. This modality of immanent critique is more suitable for the pursuit of a feminist agenda able to remedy the particular failure of second-wave feminism – its cooptation by neoliberal capitalism. This is the case because the double focus of the critical enterprise: (1) on shared meanings of justice; and (2) on structural sources of injustice, allows ideational aspects of analysis to be related to structuralist ones, that is, to link collective perceptions of justice to peculiarities of the structure of socio-economic relations within which agents interact. Such an analysis would enable criteria of social justice (and related standards of validity) to emerge from the identification of a broad pattern of societal injustice surpassing the unfair treatment of particular groups. This would allow a feminist critique in which women’s victimization is but a symptom of structural dynamics affecting negatively also those who would be seen as privileged actors within the second-wave feminist agenda (such as ethnic-majority male workers). Let me now revisit the key logical steps linking societal perceptions of justice to socio-structural sources of injustice within the analytical technique called ‘immanent critique’ by the pioneers of Critical Theory.</p>
<sec id="section2-1368431011423576">
<title>From ontology of injustice to norms of justice</title>
<p>Critical social analysis finds its direction not in the <italic>telos</italic> of a just society, but in the concrete <italic>experience of social injustice</italic> – as displayed in specific human suffering.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1368431011423576">7</xref>
</sup> The ontological centrality of historically specific human suffering means that notions of social justice, as part of the larger issue of political legitimacy, should be understood and evaluated first and foremost as responses to social injustice. In turn, the practical experience of suffering and oppression as an ontological starting point correlates with liberation from the particular circumstances of oppression as a normative goal. Applied to contemporary debates on social justice, the ontological centrality of suffering (rather than the deontological positing of foundational values, such as, say, liberty or equality) means that we should seek to derive normative criteria of evaluation from an analysis of broadly shared experiences of social injustice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1368431011423576">
<title>The hermeneutic requirement</title>
<p>Suffering (injustice) and liberation from it (justice), however, only make sense from the internal perspective of the subjects of that experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368431011423576">Adorno, 1973</xref>). This hermeneutic requirement functions also as a methodological one: we must start from where we happen to be historically and culturally – <italic>from a historically specific pattern of suffering and oppression</italic>, and conceive the theory of emancipation from the <italic>perspective of the subjects of that experience </italic>(to whom analysis is addressed).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1368431011423576">
<title>The structural sources of injustice and autonomy</title>
<p>Here we come to the most essential, for this analysis, requisite of critique. Suffering, which is the analytical starting point of Critical Theory, is caused by relations of domination (<italic>Herrschaft</italic>), understood as illegitimate, ‘surplus’ repression, or oppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368431011423576">Geuss, 1981</xref>: 35). However, the exercise of power always implies repression, through institutionalized structures of social relations via which power is generated and reproduced. In this sense, both oppression and autonomy are socially embedded and imbued with normative power. In other words, social injustice is not simply a matter of arbitrary unequal distribution of power that causes oppression; it is rooted in the specific structure of social relations for a given society and the particular types of institutions and norms these relations engender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368431011423576">Horkheimer, [1937] 2002</xref>). These relations are embodied in the basic social practices and institutions, as well as in the structure of the political economy within which the process of social reproduction takes place. According to this third requisite of analysis, radical critique of society is therefore to target not just instances of repression, but <italic>the structure of social relations</italic> that engenders them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1368431011423576">
<title>The dialectics of capitalism</title>
<p>A feature of immanent critique in the Frankfurt School tradition is the critic’s interest in those ‘antinomies’ (tensions, problems, conflicts) that are part of the very constitution of the object of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368431011423576">Adorno, 1973</xref>). In line with this fourth requisite of critique, normative criteria for the evaluation of institutional forms of social relations are to be grounded on identification of the <italic>key contradictions (antinomies) in the functioning of capitalism</italic>.</p>
<p>I will now propose an adjustment to the classical tenets of Critical Theory by way of adding two requisites of critique. The first consists in drawing a distinction between <italic>relational</italic> and <italic>structural</italic> dimensions of domination. The second consists in articulating a positive conception of autonomy by way of clarifying the connection between normative (i.e. related to perceptions of justice) and structural dimensions of the social order (i.e. related to the political economy).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1368431011423576">
<title>The structural and relational dimensions of domination</title>
<p>Lived experiences of socially-generated suffering (the empirical entry point of Critical Theory) can emerge along two dimensions in the organization of power relations. On the one hand, social injustice might be generated by unequal distribution of power (e.g. as inequalities based on gender, class, ethnicity, or culture). I will call this the ‘relational’ dimension of domination: injustice is a matter of power asymmetries enabling the oppression of certain groups by others. In Marx’s analysis, the relational dimension of domination concerns the unequal distribution of power between capital and wage labour, which underlies exploitation. This logic applies also to forms of culture-based or gender-based discrimination. Emancipation, from this perspective, stands in terms of some sort of parity. The political struggle of the Left in the course of the twentieth century has predominantly targeted this relational dimension of domination. The critical enterprise was directed, intellectually and politically, against disparities in social status, political voice and access to resources; it has therefore sought to eliminate status hierarchies, economic inequality, and political subordination. However, as it stresses inequality within a given model of well-being, this type of critique diverts attention from what might be wrong with the very model of well-being, beyond inequalities in the distribution of power. For instance, while feminists fought for parity with men within a model of capitalist social relations, few of them questioned the nature of the socio-economic model within which they aspired for equality.</p>
<p>On the other hand, social injustice can emerge as a matter of the structural features of the social system. Thus, Marx grounded his critique of exploitation in an analysis of the structural features of the organization of power – the organization of socio-economic relations as, so to speak, the ‘rules of the game’ of capitalism. Thus, he observed that the social powers of capitalists (to invest or disinvest capital, to hire and fire, to extract surplus from labour) and their interests (to maximize profit) are a function not of a personal choice or individuals’ morality, but of the social structures by virtue of which some agents assume the role of capitalists. Marx discusses the social injustice that arises as a matter of the <italic>structural </italic>power of the system (the system’s power to shape the environment within which agents interact) under the rubric of alienation: alienation arising from the submission of all human beings to the productivist logic of capitalism (and thus becoming alienated from their essence as creative beings desirous of freedom). Here social harm concerns the domination of the system over the majority of its members. This structural dimension of domination has been later addressed in an analysis of individuals’ submission to the imperatives of consumer society – a type of generalized social evil that was a central target of critique for the first generation of Frankfurt School authors. However, the structural dimension of domination has been marginalized after the cultural turn in social philosophy as, since the 1980s, attention started to be focused on issues of recognition and participation.</p>
<p>If critique is to run along the two dimensions of domination articulated above, the normative content of emancipation need not be limited to parity and inclusion. It should be enlarged to include emancipation from structural injustice – the injustice of submitting to the operative logic (rules of the game) of the social order under consideration. This, however, would necessitate re-accommodating the critique of political economy into normative social philosophy, as this would help revive attention to the obliterated structural engines of social injustice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1368431011423576">
<title>The normative relevancy of political economy and the ideal of a just order</title>
<p>Finally, we need to clarify how engagement with the political economy of capitalism relates to normative analysis (i.e. to issues of justice and legitimacy) from an ‘internal’ point of view. Critical Theory, as developed by the Frankfurt School, distances itself from the economic reductionism present in Marx’s later work. Thus, issues of normative evaluation that form the realm of analysis of political legitimacy are not seen as direct translations of social stratification within the processes of economic production. However, even though the economy might not be the basic and primary source of suffering and injustice, the generation and distribution of social risk and opportunity resulting from the configuration of state–market relations have a strong effect on individuals’ life-chances. Thus, an analysis of the political economy of contemporary capitalism enables us to target the two dimensions of domination discerned above: the structural dimension along which social risk and opportunity are <italic>produced </italic>(and therefore the parameters within which individuals’ life-chances are framed), and the relational dimension along which social opportunity and risk are <italic>distributed</italic> among participants (life-chances are stratified).</p>
<p>This programmatic position on the normative relevance of the political economy (in the sense of a connection between socially-generated experiences of injustice and structural sources of domination), in turn contains an awareness that human autonomy is inevitably socially embedded, as well as enabled by a particular pattern of state–economy relations. Thus, the notion of <italic>socially embedded autonomy</italic> (one targeting not simply the injustice of inequality, but the socio-structural matrix of domination), comes to stand as a positive normative ideal of Critical Theory, without being an <italic>a priori</italic> posited <italic>telos</italic> (such as abstract values of autonomy, freedom, or equality tend to be). It is this notion of socially embedded autonomy that allows the feminist agenda of our age to be fashioned by demands surpassing gender parity.</p>
<p>In view of the six requisites of critique outlined above, what would it mean to articulate an agenda of justice (including gender justice) as ‘immanent critique’ of neoliberal capitalism? Such an analysis would be guided by the following questions: (1) What is the historical pattern in the production and distribution of opportunity and risk within the political economy of contemporary capitalism?; (2) How do these dynamics trigger structural contradictions (anomalies) that in turn translate into (3) a historical pattern of structurally generated injustice, experienced by individuals as (socially induced) suffering?; (4) What model of social justice does such a diagnosis of social injustice emanate? I will now proceed to actuate the theoretical framework adumbrated above in an immanent critique of the structural dynamics at work in contemporary capitalism.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1368431011423576">
<title>The dynamics of neoliberal capitalism</title>
<p>The gradual neoliberal transformation of capitalism since the 1970s that culminated in the most recent economic crisis, and the issues of social justice it has brought about, provides a starting point in the formulation of a new agenda of societal, including gender, justice. These dynamics of transformation define the analytical locus of ‘where we happen to be historically and culturally’ (in line with the second, hermeneutic, requisite of critique). The reason for making the recent transformative dynamics of capitalism a focal point of analysis is that they are generating a stratified distribution of opportunities and risks that, in turn, engenders discrete experiences of injustice giving social justice its particular signification, thereby allowing an internal perspective that relates normative and structural dimensions of the social context. Let me now turn to the operative logic of contemporary capitalism in order to elucidate the structural grounds of those normative claims to justice that are to shape the feminist agenda of our times.</p>
<sec id="section9-1368431011423576">
<title>The stratified and gendered production of opportunity and risk</title>
<p>It has been suggested that technological development in advanced modernity has changed the logic of distribution from wealth to risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368431011423576">Beck, 1992</xref>: 19–50). The new exposure to risk is allegedly universal: all social strata are affected by the new global risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368431011423576">Beck, 1992</xref>: 49). This diagnosis is in need of adjustment, if not correction. As I have argued elsewhere, globalization has increased not only exposure to risk, but also to opportunity – opportunity for wealth creation but also for diversification of lifestyles and increased control over one’s life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368431011423576">Azmanova, 2010</xref>). An example at hand is the altered status of such traditionally disadvantaged groups as single mothers. The knowledge economy has allegedly allowed them the flexibility to combine child rearing with a professional career. This has been noted as part of a broader trend, associated with the new economy, of improving women’s status in advanced industrial democracies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368431011423576">Richards and Gelleny, 2007</xref>). The flexibilization of work has facilitated, at least in principle, the reconciliation of parenthood with careers and leisure. As individuals engage in multiple, and often interrupted, career trajectories, this unsettles the hegemony of the unilinear, uninterrupted career that has been competing with the demands of parenthood. (The same applies to the paragon of academic success – the monograph, which necessitates a long, sustained effort, and a supporting spouse, usually a wife, in a servicing function.) The centrality of the knowledge economy of open borders in the production of opportunities and risks charts the structural dimension of domination in modern capitalist democracies: the particular production of opportunities and risks related to a person’s exposure to globalization defines the rules of the game to which all social actors are subjected. The structural dimension of the model of contemporary capitalism (the increasing importance of integration into the global knowledge economy) in turn determines its key antinomy, to which I turn next.</p>
<p>Increased opportunities for wealth creation, combined with the proliferation of forms of property ownership and job tenure that the knowledge economy of open borders allows, have increased the labour <italic>de-commodification capacity</italic> of societies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1368431011423576">8</xref>
</sup> At the same time, the social value of de-commodification is tangibly on the rise as people attribute increased importance to work–life balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368431011423576">Goodin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368431011423576">Inglehart, 2008</xref>). It should be noted that the so-called ‘masculinization’ of women’s biographies (the downside of the achievement of second-wave feminism) concerns primarily their professional life; for the vast majority, it has not affected the desire for children. As Catherine Hakim’s research demonstrates, most women insist on combining family and a lifelong career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368431011423576">Hakim, 1996</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1368431011423576">9</xref>
</sup> For these women, the masculinization syndrome creates a problem as it disadvantages them – the linear, progressive career path is either detrimental to motherhood, which remains a value, or motherhood is damaging to careers, which are also of value. Moreover, there is no reason to maintain that parenting is more of a value to women than to men. Recent studies consistently show that citizens throughout Europe, irrespective of gender, continue to uphold the two-child norm, with virtually no variation from Finland and Britain in the North, to Portugal and Greece in the South (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368431011423576">Esping-Andersen, 2009</xref>: Chap. 1). Neither is there a reason to limit the notion of work–life balance to combining careers with parenting. Research indicates that the value of discretionary time is generally on the rise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368431011423576">Goodin et al., 2008</xref>) and that part-time work is desired by women irrespective of whether they have care responsibilities or not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368431011423576">Yerkes, 2009</xref>: 539–40). Thus, the set of preferences constituting the formula of well-being that emerges from empirical research seems to go beyond the ‘work–family balance’ and to include personal autonomy from the demands of both the workplace and the family. It is this model of well-being (combining work, care, and leisure) that the growing de-commodification capacities of modern societies is to put into practice.</p>
<p>However, due to increased competition in the global economy, <italic>commodification pressures</italic> on labour have also increased: from expansion of working hours and pressure for retraining to remain employable, to spillover of work into domestic life. This parallel expansion of the de-commodification capacity (or potential) of modern societies and the increase of commodification pressures constitutes the key antinomy (internal contradiction) of contemporary capitalism (in line with the fourth prerequisite of critique). This, in turn, affects the parameters in which the production and distribution of opportunity and risk, and related to them social injustice, emerge.</p>
<p>Importantly, the exposure to risk and opportunity in the allocation of society’s de-commodification potentials and commodification pressures is neither random, not evenly distributed; it is stratified and gendered. It is the <italic>access</italic> itself to earning opportunities that is stratified and gendered, as is the capacity for exit from the labour market. While the global neoliberal economy has generally increased opportunities (both for wealth creation and control of one’s life trajectory), this is only valid, however, for individuals whose professional competency secures easy access to the knowledge economy of open borders. On the other hand, however, globalization translates into hazards in cases where labour market access has diminished for those with the ‘wrong’ type of competency – mostly manual workers in sectors exposed to globalization or low-skilled workforce in the domestic service industries.</p>
<p>Economic stratification also has a gender component. Studies consistently show that the gender pay gap is, in most countries, far greater for the low-skilled than for the highly-skilled workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368431011423576">Grown, 2007</xref>). It is also worth noting that the ‘feminization’ of the male life course (balancing a career with parenting) is generally limited to the top of the social pyramid: less-educated men seem more reluctant to lessen gender specialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368431011423576">Esping-Andersen, 2009</xref>: 99–100; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368431011423576">Kim and Choi, 2010</xref>). Thus, the new economy, with the differential access it offers to individuals according to their type of educational capital has, overall, compounded the uneven distribution of life-chances as only the higher classes are taking advantage of the relative degendering of employment opportunities and lifestyles. Low-skilled women, it turns out, are cursed not only with lousy jobs but also with lousy husbands.</p>

<title>The political economy of injustice</title>
<p>According to the first requisite of critique – that of the ontological centrality of injustice, we need to discern the patterns in which social injustice, in terms of inequitable distribution of life-chances, emerges in the new context. In the heyday of the welfare state, the social question stood in terms of the relative poverty of wage-labour, as well as women’s exclusion from the labour market. Social rights were pursued in the logic of wealth redistribution through public policies for full employment and income substitution measures, as well as by means of women’s inclusion in the labour market.</p>
<p>In the new context, the incapacity of the volatile global economy to provide for full and long-term employment, as well as the incapacity, or the unwillingness, of public authority to maintain robust redistributive policies means that one’s personal ability to enter the labour market has become an increasingly important parameter in the distribution of life-chances. Equally important, in terms of the rising value of de-commodification, is a person’s capacity for voluntary exit from the labour market. Thus, while <italic>voluntary</italic> job flexibility (capacity to enter and exit the labour market at will) is marked not simply by higher levels of income but also by more diverse sources of income (and therefore – diminished risk), <italic>involuntary</italic> temporary employment is a source of precariousness (insecure and low incomes) that most often affects lower-skilled workers in sectors exposed to international competition and, disproportionally, women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368431011423576">UNRISD, 2005</xref>: 35–48). Therefore, the highly stratified and gendered distribution of institutionalized risk and opportunity through secure exit from, and entry into, the labour market has become the apex of the social question.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the new operative logic of neoliberal capitalism has broadened the range of structurally-induced suffering. Commodification pressures have also increased for the group of the ‘old’ labour market insiders who, as recipients of such classical de-commodification measures as working-time limitations and unemployment insurance, had been privileged by the post-war welfare state. The white male worker who, by profiting from a protected labour contract, had stood in the way of women and ethnic minorities’ access to employment, has been the quintessential target of second-wave feminism. However, recent neoliberal reforms of the welfare state have incurred the reduction of employer-sponsored de-commodification measures (such as pension, health, and employment insurance), placing the burden of financing basic insurance on the employees, thereby increasing the commodification pressures on them in the logic of working longer for a lower remuneration. Such increased commodification pressures (especially working overtime) are particularly heavy on skilled labour in sectors exposed to the competitive pressures of the global economy. For this group, the experience of social injustice is related to pressures generated along the structural dimension of domination (as charted by the operative logic of neoliberal capitalism): the all-embracing pressure of commodification under the competitive dynamics of global economic integration.</p>
<p>This means that what we identified earlier as a key dynamic of contemporary capitalism – the intensification of commodification pressures, despite the growing de-commodification potential of advanced industrial societies – has been generalized to include a large variety of groups subjected to forms of oppression. These operative dynamics of neoliberal global capitalism become the structural source of a broad spectrum of experienced injustice – from the incapacity of some to enter the labour market (especially the young who are facing unprecedented rates of unemployment, irrespective of level of education), to an increase in working time for the labour market ‘insiders’ (across professional fields). In this sense these pressures foster a variety of particular, but structurally generalizable, experiences of injustice, from which a normatively general notion of justice could be derived.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section11-1368431011423576">
<title>Social justice, de-gendered</title>
<p>What measure of social justice emerges from the analysis of the recent dynamics of capitalism, discussed above – in line with the requirement that notions of justice be derived from structurally produced experiences of injustice (the third requisite of immanent critique)? We have noted that the institutionalized distribution of social opportunities and risks related to labour market entry and exit (i.e. the distribution of society’s de-commodification potential and commodification pressures) has become an effective mechanism of social stratification in the context of growing global economic integration. If social justice emerges in this light as a matter of the equitable distribution of social opportunity and risk, the most salient expressions of this distribution in the context of neoliberal capitalism is the ratio between voluntary and involuntary job flexibility (and not the ratio between secure and flexible employment, as left-leaning critics of neoliberalism commonly maintain). Voluntary flexibility is an indicator of opportunity; involuntary flexibility is an indicator of risk. This voluntary nature of labour market entry and exit, therefore, can serve as a key component in constructing a model of social justice able to secure an equitable distribution of opportunities and risks, free of class, gender, and other forms of discrimination, and in line with the ideal of socially embedded autonomy (along the sixth requisite of critique) institutionalized as a balance between work, care, and leisure.</p>
<p>However, research establishing that part-time work is becoming the long-term norm for women’s employment typically derides this as a symptom of gender injustice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1368431011423576">10</xref>
</sup> Solutions for balancing work and family life are usually sought in the direction of responsibilization of public authority either for retraining and increasing labour market access, or for providing family-support services. Thus, Gøsta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368431011423576">Esping-Andersen (2009</xref>) has advocated a shift from income maintenance (a classical redistributive tool of the welfare state) to social service provision (family services), in the logic that affordable quality childcare would allow women to combine careers with motherhood. Criticism of flexible employment and solutions based on replacing income maintenance either with retraining or with social service provision are problematic because such criticism implies an avowedly positive valuation of labour market participation. Exactly such a productivist approach to social justice (the high value of labour market inclusion) had supplied the normative foundation that facilitated the triumph of neoliberal capitalism in the late twentieth century. It was the espousal of labour market participation as a criterion of gender parity that had enabled neoliberal capitalism to hijack the feminist agenda and appropriate it to its goals, to the detriment to the broader feminist goals of empowerment and autonomy.</p>
<p>Admittedly, non-standard employment is generally associated with poor working conditions: lower pay, unsubstantial secondary benefits, poor career chances. It is these flaws in the institutionalization of flexible employment that initially made the trade unions in some countries oppose the growth in part-time work in the course of the 1980 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368431011423576">Yerkes, 2009</xref>: 539). However, note that it was under the continued pressures of female members that trade unions eventually embraced part-time work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368431011423576">Yerkes, 2009</xref>). The <italic>flawed institutionalization</italic> of flexible employment should not discard it as a tool for social justice – in the sense of gaining autonomy from the process of economic production – a value of at least equal worth as that of labour market participation. The flaw consists not in introducing flexible employment but in failing to provide the institutional conditions for voluntary labour market entry and exit, for instance, by mainstreaming part-time employment (e.g. via disconnecting the level of social provision from the length of employment). It is this voluntary nature of employment flexibility that could secure the equal distribution of the growing de-commodification capacities and commodification pressures of modern societies and thus bring to life the ideal of socially embedded autonomy articulated and defended here.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The shortcomings and achievements of second-wave feminism have a common source: the liberalization and deregulation of labour markets in the late twentieth century empowered women, and at the same time tamed the radicalism of the feminist agenda by making the demands of the market trump those of the family and of personal development. To return to Susan Strange’s conceptual dichotomy mentioned at the start of this analysis, women gained relational power vis-à-vis men without gaining structural power, that is, the power to alter the rules of social production. The most recent crisis of neoliberal capitalism, as it has put into question the parameters of its political economy and the normative notions of justice associated with it, has opened the opportunity for transforming women’s accrued relational power into structural power – into a capacity to alter the normative and institutional model of state–economy relations and thus gain autonomy both from domesticity and from the process of economic production.</p>
<p>In the analysis offered here, I suggested deriving normative criteria of social justice generally, and of gender equity more narrowly, via an ‘immanent critique’ of the key structural dynamics of the recent transformation of capitalism in line with the tenets of Critical Theory. I noted that the neoliberal transformation that beset advanced industrial democracies in the late twentieth century has triggered a dynamics of stratification and social conflict that can serve as a focal point of analysis. Thus, normative criteria emerge not from an <italic>a priori</italic> notion of gender equality but from an analysis of the nature of the societal innovation that capitalism has undergone in the late twentieth century; in particular – from the dynamics of the production and distribution of social opportunity and risk associated with the growing exposure to globalization. Thus, the guiding notion of social justice is immanent in the varieties of patterned experiences that the new operative dynamics of capitalism generate along what I have described as the structural dimension of the production of opportunities and risk and the relational dimension of their unequal distribution. This allowed me to interpret the increased commodification pressures on women (resulting from the cooptation of the feminist agenda to the productivist goals of neoliberal capitalism) not as a distinct instance of social injustice, but as a sign of a larger pattern of injustice concerning a broad category of social groups, including the former ‘winners’ in the androgenic model of the welfare state (white male labour market insiders). Labour market deregulation that has been undertaken under the imperative of global economic competition, and the resulting proliferation of flexible and part-time work, have changed the terms in which social justice stands: it is no longer a matter of wealth generation and distribution, as in the golden years of the welfare state, nor is it a matter of gender parity in labour market participation, but it is rather a matter of balanced, gender-neutral distribution of voluntary labour market entry and exit. It is the institutionalisation of this voluntary nature of labour market participation that would engender a framework of state–economy relations able to put into practice an ideal of socially embedded autonomy that balances work, care, and play.</p>

<p>The first wave of the feminist movement (nineteenth and early twentieth century) aimed at removing legal obstacles to equality (e.g. property rights and voting rights). The second wave spanned the 1960s–1980s and presented a radical challenge to the androcentrism of state-organized capitalist societies. The movement focused on a broad spectrum of economic, political and cultural dimensions in the distribution of power that entailed the discrimination of women, such as the stigmatization of women as care-givers and the devalorization of this role in relation to that of the male bread-winner; or the unequal access of women to, and their inferior positioning within, the labour market.</p>

<p>I use here the generic concept ‘women’ for the sake of outlining, at this point of the argument, the qualitative change in the distribution of power between the sexes that second-wave feminism accomplished, in full awareness that, used in this way, the concept masks socio-economic and cultural inequalities among women – a phenomenon which I address further in the analysis.</p>

<p>While ‘relational’ power refers to the capacity of an actor to influence directly the behaviour of other actors, and is based on capacity to control resources, ‘structural’ power refers to an actor’s capacity to affect outcomes by changing the environment in which interaction takes place, i.e. the capacity to set the terms of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368431011423576">Strange, 1994</xref>: 23–43).</p>

<p>Seeking to provide a secure foundation of normative justification, Karl-Otto Apel and Jürgen Habermas proposed founding a universal ethics on the principle of dialogue. This amounts to a transcendentalist turn in Critical Theory, as undistorted human dialogue becomes a language-based equivalent of Kant’s universal moral principle (the categorical imperative). With this move, Habermas disengaged from the analysis of the political economy and political sociology of capitalism, thus triggering a redefinition of the critical enterprise.</p>

<p>Like Gøsta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368431011423576">Esping-Andersen (1990</xref>), I use the term ‘labour de-commodification’ in reference to the growing autonomy from the process of material production, and the ensuing liberation of man from market forces. One’s capacity for de-commodification (as a matter of capacity to exit the labour market with little or no loss of income) is, therefore, a precondition for individual autonomy and a life of self-improvement.</p>

<p>Here Hakim describes two other contemporary female preference types: (1) the traditional home-centred woman who may work out of necessity but whose primary objective is motherhood and family; and (2) the woman who puts career above all else, and who is only likely to have children if they ‘fit in’.
