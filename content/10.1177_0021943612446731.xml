<abstract>
<p>This article furthers the recent trend of studying communication during new employee socialization by examining the nature of message content and message sources during this important process. Results from an investigation of 85 newly hired hotel managers’ socialization experiences indicate that newcomers distinguish clearly between the extent they receive different socialization message content. They also receive distinct message content from different sources, suggesting newcomers rely on a variety of sources for socialization information. The implications of these results on the success of newcomer adjustment are also discussed and directions for future research are offered.</p>

<p>One of the major purposes of organizational socialization is to inform new employees of organizational and unit practices, familiarize them with relationships within the organization, and instill the values of the organization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021943612446731">Katz and Kahn (1978)</xref> argue socialization activities often include role-sending efforts in which expectations about work roles are conveyed to newcomers in an attempt to mold them into acceptable and efficient organizational members. Communication is absolutely central to these efforts as many different kinds of information from a variety of sources inform newcomers of many aspects of their new work roles. For example, newcomers receive messages about employee role responsibilities and the history, politics, language, interpersonal relationships, goals, and values of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao, O’Leary-Kelly, Wolf, Klein, &amp; Gardner, 1994</xref>) that are likely to affect their adjustment. More important, knowledge about these content areas can lead to the success of new employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao et al., 1994</xref>).In the 1980s and 1990s, much of the socialization research investigated socialization tactics’ impact, but failed to directly address the role of communication (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021943612446731">Allen &amp; Meyer, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021943612446731">Baker, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021943612446731">Jones, 1986</xref>). In recent years, however, specific features of messages during the socialization process have become the focus of this research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021943612446731">Barge &amp; Schlueter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021943612446731">Morrison, 2002</xref>). This trend is a positive development as it provides a more complete understanding of role-sending efforts during the socialization process. This article continues this trend by investigating the nature of two key communication dimensions identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021943612446731">Jablin’s (1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021943612446731">2001)</xref> comprehensive reviews, <italic>message content</italic> and <italic>message sources</italic>. It begins with a description of newcomer socialization. It then proposes a number of research questions about the communication dimensions of this process. Finally, the methodology and results of a study of 85 newly hired managers’ socialization experiences at a major hotel corporation are described and discussed.</p>
<sec id="section1-0021943612446731">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Organizational socialization continues to be of great importance to employers and employees alike as at least 3% (or more than four million employees) of the labor force routinely are considered new hires on monthly basis, even in difficult economic times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021943612446731">Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2010</xref>). Since the socialization process typically lasts several months, as much as 25% of U.S. workers are experiencing organizational socialization at any point in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021943612446731">Rollag, Parise, &amp; Cross, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021943612446731">Bauer, Bodner, Erdogan, Truxillo, and Tucker’s (2007)</xref> meta-analytic review of socialization studies, of which half were conducted since 2000, finds organizational socialization has a significant impact on performance, job satisfaction, commitment, intention to remain, and turnover. In addition, these effects are moderated by role clarity, self-efficacy, and social acceptance, information which is communicated to newcomers during the socialization process.</p>
<p>Relatedly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021943612446731">Katz and Kahn (1978)</xref> state that one of organizational socialization’s most important goals is to communicate work role expectations (role sending). Role-sending messages tell the newcomer things such as appropriate work-related behaviors (e.g., showing up on time to meetings) and performance requirements (e.g., process so many claims in a day without any errors). These messages are conveyed in both ambient (i.e., pervasive, noncontigent) and discretionary (i.e., intentional, selectively transmitted) messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021943612446731">Jablin, 1987</xref>). According to Katz and Kahn, in many cases, newcomers perform their roles in line with role expectations, but at times they may disagree with them, negotiate, and ultimately perform their roles in accordance with their own needs, abilities, and wishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021943612446731">Jablin, 2001</xref>). Thus, the enacted role may differ considerably from the role expectations that were communicated to the newcomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021943612446731">Graen &amp; Scandura, 1987</xref>). At the same time, newcomers use the information communicated about their role to make their decisions about how to perform their role.</p>
<p>Many scholars have recognized the need to investigate the communicative elements of socialization. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021943612446731">Jablin (1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021943612446731">2001)</xref> argues that most interactions between newcomers and their supervisors, coworkers, and other organizational members center on the exchange of messages. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021943612446731">Stohl (1986)</xref> points out that “memorable” messages are one of the most important processes through which individuals “learn requisite organizational orientations” (p. 231). These calls have argued that researchers will better understand what employees learn during entry as well as how they learn it by directly investigating at least two key communication dimensions of the socialization process: message content and message sources, which have received some attention in the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021943612446731">Barge &amp; Schlueter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021943612446731">Haueter, Macan, &amp; Winter, 2003</xref>) but often without reference to each other. This article furthers this line of research by investigating the two concepts together to create a better understanding of not only what kind of information newcomers receive but also who gives them that information. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021943612446731">Bauer et al. (2007)</xref> argue that newcomer learning is an understudied area of socialization research. This study addresses that concern by investigating two of the most important aspects of learning: what was taught (message content) and who the teacher was (source).</p>
<sec id="section2-0021943612446731">
<title>Message Content</title>
<p>The information communicated to newcomers during socialization is critical to employee indoctrination and adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021943612446731">Jablin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021943612446731">Lankau &amp; Scandura, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021943612446731">Saks &amp; Ashforth, 1997</xref>), making it vital to investigate the actual content of that information. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao et al. (1994)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021943612446731">Ostroff and Kozlowski (1992)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021943612446731">Stohl (1986)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0021943612446731">Staton-Spicer and Darling (1986)</xref> provide a variety of, yet similar, classifications for the types of information newcomers learn about during the socialization process. In addition, at least two recent investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021943612446731">Barge &amp; Schlueter, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021943612446731">Hart &amp; Miller, 2005</xref>) directly examine message content and offer directions for future research.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao et al. (1994)</xref> categorize the knowledge obtained through socialization into six content areas. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao et al. (1994)</xref>, performance proficiency refers to knowledge about how to perform the tasks necessary to do the job. “People” refers to knowledge about the employee’s level of acceptance into the work unit. Political knowledge informs the newcomer about formal and informal power structures within the organization. Language refers to knowledge of the profession’s technical language and jargon that is unique to the organization. Organizational goals and values knowledge provide “an understanding of the rules or principles that maintain the integrity of the organization” (p. 732). The final content area, history, provides knowledge of the organization’s and work unit’s history. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao et al. (1994)</xref> find new employees who possess knowledge of the six content areas that (presumably because they have been well socialized through messages communicated about these content areas) are more likely to be successful in terms of career advancement.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao et al.’s (1994)</xref> classification builds on the earlier work of others and later work continues to identify similar content areas. In an analysis of memorable messages during organizational socialization, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021943612446731">Stohl (1986)</xref> finds that the content of messages falls into two general categories: role related, which describes the behaviors necessary to do a new job (similar to performance proficiency), or culture related, which describes the meaning of organizational behavior and values (similar to organizational goals and values, politics, and history). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021943612446731">Ostroff and Kozlowski (1992)</xref> describe four content areas—job-related tasks, work roles, group processes, and organizational attributes—which largely overlap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao et al.’s (1994)</xref> performance proficiency, history, language, and political content areas. Chao et al.’s content areas cover a broader range of topics than either of those earlier studies, more effectively capturing the breadth of socialization message content.</p>
<p>In more recent studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao et al.’s (1994)</xref> classification is further validated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021943612446731">Haueter, Macan, and Winter (2003)</xref> identify what they considered one additional content area, role performance, which is quite similar to performance proficiency. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021943612446731">Barge and Schlueter (2004)</xref> investigate the following categories: professional behavior (similar to performance proficiency), formal and unwritten work expectations and rules (similar to performance proficiency), work ethic (similar to goals and values), office politics (similar to politics), importance of customer service (similar to performance proficiency), team and organizational family (similar to people), importance of newcomer to the organization (similar to people), and the importance of communicating openly, which does not correspond precisely with any of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao et al.’s (1994)</xref> categories. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021943612446731">Myers and Oetzel (2003)</xref> propose additional, but still overlapping content areas such as familiarity with others (similar to people content) and organizational acculturation (similar to goals and values content). Although no scale can capture all the possible topics that are discussed during the socialization process that will help a newcomer adapt to a new role, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao et al.’s (1994)</xref> classification taps into the most commonly identified content areas across several studies, and it makes sense to use it as the basis of measuring the content of messages newcomers receive during socialization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0021943612446731">
<title>Message Sources</title>
<p>Major sources of information during organizational socialization include top management, supervisors, coworkers, and subordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021943612446731">Jablin, 1987</xref>). Although message sources provide new hires with a range of information, each source is likely to emphasize certain content given their areas of responsibility and expertise. For instance, top management tends to send written, mediated messages during socialization to formally orient the newcomer and for legal compliance.</p>
<disp-quote><p>For example, recruits may be exposed to an orientation by members of the organization’s personnel department in which they receive a wide variety of written publications and an oral briefing on a variety of topics including work rules, insurance, employee service, and the like. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021943612446731">Jablin, 1987</xref>, p. 696)</p></disp-quote>
<p>Over half of the messages received by newcomers from supervisors involve job instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021943612446731">Katz, 1980</xref>). Supervisors are the primary sources of newcomers’ task-related information, which is in keeping with supervisors’ responsibility for the performance of their work units, motivation to maximize newcomer performance, their role as the primary evaluators of newcomer performance, and their position as role expert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021943612446731">Jablin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021943612446731">Katz &amp; Kahn, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021943612446731">Ostroff &amp; Kozlowski, 1992</xref>). Newcomers also are likely to identify supervisors as the chief source for determining job requirements and consider them more reliable than coworkers as an information source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021943612446731">Hanser &amp; Muchinsky, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>Coworkers and subordinates also are important sources of information for new managers. Coworkers, particularly those at a peer level, have substantial interests in socializing newcomers and often quickly incorporate them into the workgroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0021943612446731">Moreland &amp; Levine, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021943612446731">Sias, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021943612446731">Zurcher, 1983</xref>). Newcomers and coworkers evidence equal patterns of information asking and sharing shortly following newcomers’ entry into the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021943612446731">Jablin, 1984</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021943612446731">Sias (2005)</xref> finds collegial peer relationships are positively related to the quality of information received from coworkers whereas information peer relationships are negatively related to information quality. She also finds information quality is positively related to job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Her study as well as her earlier research on peer and coworker relationships (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021943612446731">Sias &amp; Cahill, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021943612446731">Sias &amp; Jablin, 1995</xref>) clearly identify the importance of coworkers as sources of socialization messages. Subordinates also may serve a similar initial role as supervisors and coworkers as the new manager seeks to establish their place in the organizational hierarchy. In addition, the extensive research of leader-member relationships finds supervisors rely on subordinates for accurate information to help them perform well as leaders (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021943612446731">Fairhurst, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021943612446731">Fairhurst &amp; Chandler, 1989</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021943612446731">Sias (2005)</xref> argues that subordinates who provide accurate, quality information to their supervisors may be more likely to become a member of the “in group.” Consequently, when supervisors are in the early days of their tenure, subordinates may work even harder to provide quality information to create a positive relationship with their new supervisors.</p>

<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>With numerous studies measuring content and identifying similar content areas, but giving them different labels, confusion persists about the distinctions between different content areas and what exactly newcomers are learning during socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021943612446731">Bauer et al., 2007</xref>). As mentioned previously, newcomer learning is an important outcome of this process, but it is difficult to measure learning if there is not more clarity between the different content areas. Thus, it becomes increasingly important to further validate the socialization content areas clearly identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao at al. (1994)</xref>. Consequently, this study’s first research question is as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0021943612446731" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: To what extent do newcomers receive messages about the following socialization content areas identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao et al. (1994)</xref>: performance proficiency, history, language, politics, organizational goals and values, and people?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition, top management, supervisors, coworkers, and subordinates are likely to be key sources of information for newcomers during organizational socialization. Each source is likely to provide information in keeping with their areas of responsibility and expertise. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021943612446731">Kramer (2010)</xref> argues that sources of socialization information contribute significantly to uncertainty management for newcomers. He provides an expansive list of potential sources, but it is not clear how those areas of expertise may relate to the message content areas. This is a common weakness in much of the socialization content research. It is critical for newcomers to know which sources to go to for the information necessary to facilitate their adjustment. Consequently, this study’s second research question is as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-0021943612446731" list-type="simple">

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Data were collected from 100 full-time newly hired managers of a major hotel corporation during their entry period. The employees were in their 3rd through 12th week of employment within the organization. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021943612446731">Brett (1984)</xref>, the entry period generally ranges from 1 week through 6 months. Other investigations of newcomer socialization experiences report sampling employees from the 3rd week through the 12th month of employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021943612446731">Allen &amp; Meyer, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021943612446731">Bauer &amp; Green, 1994</xref>). Consistent with these perspectives, the participants completed a survey once during their early tenure in the organization. The survey measured the content of messages received during socialization as well as the sources of those messages in addition to other socialization experiences, which were analyzed in another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021943612446731">Hart &amp; Miller, 2005</xref>).

<p>Access to the new manager database of the hotel corporation, which included names, work addresses, start dates, and position title, was granted after negotiations with representatives of the corporation’s upper management. The hotel corporation paid for the cost of mailing the surveys as well as the return postage for completed surveys. The researcher agreed to provide a written report of the study’s findings to upper management representatives. Participation was voluntary.</p>
<p>Initially, 217 managers were solicited. One hundred managers completed the survey, representing a response rate of 46.1%.</p>
<p>Although the participants were all employed as managers, they represented a wide variety of specializations within the hotel corporation and worked in one of a number of properties or subsidiaries. The breakdown of specializations was as follows: 21% (<italic>n</italic> = 21) were front desk managers; 17% (<italic>n</italic> = 17) were restaurant managers; 11% (<italic>n</italic> = 11) were sales managers; 9% (<italic>n</italic> = 9) were account managers; 8% (<italic>n</italic> = 8) were housekeeping managers; 6% (<italic>n</italic> = 6) were event managers; 6% (<italic>n</italic> = 6) were general management trainees; 5% (<italic>n</italic> = 5) were guest care managers; 5% (<italic>n</italic> = 5) were catering managers; 3% (<italic>n</italic> = 3) were operations managers; 3% (<italic>n</italic> = 3) were conference services managers; and 6% (<italic>n</italic> = 6) of the participants did not indicate a specific specialization.</p>
<p>Prior to beginning work at their assigned property, all the managers participated in a 1-week off-site training program, which familiarized them with the general operations and culture of the hotel corporation.</p>

<title>Socialization message content</title>
<p>A 30-item, modified version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao et al.’s (1994)</xref> Socialization Content Scale was used to assess the extent to which employees reported receiving messages about performance proficiency, organizational history, people, politics, language, and organizational goals and values during organizational entry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021943612446731">Table 2</xref>). Chao et al.’s original scale asked if participants possessed knowledge about the content areas, but did not reflect whether messages had been received. Consequently, as reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021943612446731">Table 1</xref>, all items were reworded to ask the participants to indicate the extent to which information had been emphasized (through a message) about each content area. They responded through 5-point Likert-type metric where 1 = <italic>to a very little extent</italic> and 5 = <italic>to a very great extent</italic>.</p>

<p>Principal components factor analysis using varimax rotation with Kaiser normalization was applied to the instrument to assess the scales’ factor structure. The results found a six-factor solution (with eigenvalues greater than one explaining 73.2% of the variance) corresponding to the predicted factor structure after dropping two items from the organizational goals and values subscale, one item from the history subscale, and three items from the politics subscale. No items were dropped from the language, performance proficiency, or people subscales. Reliability of each subscale was assessed through Cronbach’s alpha. The reliabilities were as follows: language (α = .92), performance proficiency (α = .88), people (α = .82), organizational goals and values (α = .80), history (α = .77), and politics (α = .58). Factor loadings are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021943612446731">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Socialization message sources</title>
<p>To measure sources of socialization messages, participants were presented with six descriptions as part of the survey, one for each socialization message content area (based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao et al., 1994</xref>). For each description, they were asked to indicate who the primary source of the described information was. They could choose one of the following sources: top level management, supervisor, coworkers, or subordinates. Since these descriptions were single item measures of separate content areas, no reliability or factor analysis could be done.</p>

<title>Message Content Received During Socialization</title>
<p>The first research question asked which message content areas newcomers receive messages about. To analyze this question, a Friedman test of mean rankings and Tukey test of mean differences was done to determine if there were differences in the extent to which each content area was emphasized in messages. All message content areas were experienced at a moderate to high level. Specifically, messages about goals and values of the organization were emphasized the most (<italic>M</italic> = 3.99/5) followed by messages about language (<italic>M</italic> = 3.92/5), performance proficiency (<italic>M</italic> = 3.62/5), history (<italic>M</italic> = 3.31/5), people (<italic>M</italic> = 3.19/5), and politics (<italic>M</italic> = 3.17/5). According to the Friedman test, the mean rankings were as follows: organizational goals and values (4.73), language (4.45), performance proficiency (3.77), history (2.80), people (2.69), and politics (2.58). The chi-square indicated that the rankings were significantly different (χ<sup>2</sup>= 133.965, <italic>df</italic> = 5, <italic>p</italic> = .000).</p>
<p>The Tukey test, which is an appropriate analysis for multiple comparisons, indicated that the mean for organizational goals and values messages was significantly different than the means for performance proficiency, history, people, and politics messages. The test also indicated that the mean for language messages was significantly different than the means for history, people, and politics messages. Finally, the test indicated that the mean for performance proficiency messages was significantly different from the means for people and politics messages.

<title>Sources of Message Content</title>
<p>The second research question asked who (top management, supervisors, coworkers, or subordinates) were the primary sources of information for each of the socialization message content areas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021943612446731">Table 4</xref>). A chi-square test of percentage differences was used to analyze this question. The majority of newcomers (52%) identified their supervisor as the primary source for performance proficiency message content whereas 29% indicated their coworkers, 11% selected top management, and 8% picked their subordinates as their primary source of performance proficiency messages, χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 49.20, <italic>p</italic> = .000. In contrast, coworkers were reported to be the primary source (59%) of people messages whereas 18% selected their supervisor, 14% reported top management, and 9% selected their subordinates, χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 63.28, <italic>p</italic> = .000. Coworkers were also identified by almost half (49%) of the participants as the primary source of politics message content, followed by the supervisor (33%), top management (13%), and subordinates (5%), χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 47.36, <italic>p</italic> = .000.</p>

<p>In terms of history and language messages, the distribution of primary information sources was more balanced. For information on the history of the organization, 38% identified their coworkers, 31% selected their supervisor, 20% reported top management, and 11% noted their subordinates as the primary message source, χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 17.04, <italic>p</italic> = .001. For the primary source of information for organizational language, 36% identified their coworkers, 34% selected supervisor, 26% reported top management, and 4% selected subordinates, χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 25.76, <italic>p</italic> = .000.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In recent years, studies of organizational entry investigate communication variables such as message content and sources as well as other communication activities such as information seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021943612446731">Barge &amp; Schlueter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0021943612446731">Morrison, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021943612446731">Waldeck &amp; Myers, 2008</xref>), indicating communication’s obvious importance in the socialization processes. This study builds on this recent trend by investigating two communication-related variables connected to the socialization experience. These results make a strong case for future investigations to examine communication factors, particularly <italic>message content</italic> and <italic>message sources</italic>, as central elements of organizational socialization.</p>
<sec id="section14-0021943612446731">
<title>Message Content</title>
<p>This study further supports the validity of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao et al.’s (1994)</xref> socialization content categories, but it also extends research of socialization content by investigating the content of messages communicated to newcomers rather than simply measuring newcomer knowledge of socialization content as an effectiveness outcome, which many studies have continued to do (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021943612446731">Myers &amp; Oetzel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021943612446731">Taormina, 2004</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021943612446731">Taormina (2004)</xref> assesses the extent to which newcomers knew training-related information, the extent to which they understood socialization information, the extent to which they received coworker support, and their beliefs about the future. All of these outcomes, which were referred to as socialization content, are important to know, but do not directly examine the actual process of socialization. This study represents a different approach from what much of the socialization literature as the items in the modified scale ask newcomers if the content was emphasized rather than whether they simply possess knowledge. This distinction is important because newcomer learning can be understood more fully if the content of the information communicated to newcomers is studied. When content is studied from a knowledge-level perspective, then the research is only looking at the outcome of the learning process rather than the process itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021943612446731">Waldeck &amp; Myers, 2008</xref>). This perspective limits our ability to understand the learning process itself—this study changes that approach.</p>
<p>In addition, by reframing the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao et al. (1994)</xref> items as this study has done, one of the key purposes of the socialization process, namely the transmission of role expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021943612446731">Katz &amp; Kahn, 1978</xref>), is more clearly explained. Indeed, the participants in this study received a significant amount of the content areas identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao et al. (1994)</xref>. In addition, newcomers did clearly distinguish the extent to which they received messages about each content area. Finally, a clear picture of the content of newcomer socialization experiences in this study emerged when it was found that messages about goals and values of the organization, language, and performance proficiency were emphasized to a greater extent than messages about history, people, and politics. These results provide a richer understanding of what kinds of information are emphasized as part of the role transmission process. They suggest that, at least in the early stages of socialization, specific details of the work role as related to work performance and technical skills such as the workplace language are emphasized. Newcomers are also given the big picture of what the organization stands for and where it wants to go through communication of its goals and values. Information about the history of the organization, the newcomers’ acceptance as well as the politics does not appear to be emphasized as much during the early stages of socialization. It may be the case that information is shared later as the newcomer adapts to his or her role and becomes accepted into the work unit.</p>
<p>As a result of this study, we now have a better idea of what specifically is taught to newcomers during the socialization process and whether they can determine if they have received information about those content areas. In focusing on examining the content of socialization messages, key aspects of message design and delivery should be studied <italic>in the future</italic>, as well as how their design conveys information to the newcomer. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021943612446731">Kramer (2010)</xref> suggests the extent to which socialization content is disseminated through stories (a specific way messages can be designed) helps newcomers make sense of the organizational environment. He further argues that memorable socialization messages that help the newcomer are typically communicated in face-to-face informal settings, an important aspect of message delivery.</p>
<p>Research of message content should be studied in a couple of other ways as well. First, more specific detail of the content areas identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021943612446731">Chao et al. (1994)</xref> and others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021943612446731">Barge &amp; Schlueter, 2004</xref>) need to be examined because the nuances of socialization content may be important in the process of helping newcomers adapt. For example, performance proficiency message content may ignore some distinctions in these kinds of messages. Messages that describe only the technical aspects of satisfactorily completing a task may only partially contribute to becoming proficient in performing the task. Messages informing newcomers how to develop relationships with others who participate in the completion of the task may be equally important in successful task performance. In fact, earlier research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021943612446731">Stohl (1986)</xref> suggests that newcomers remember messages that familiarize them with their work setting in addition to those that convey workgroup acceptance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021943612446731">Stohl’s (1986)</xref> framework for identifying memorable messages and even <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021943612446731">Louis et al.’s (1983)</xref> investigation of helpful socialization practices may offer other ways to investigate communication during socialization. This study asked newcomers which messages were emphasized, one route to identify the message importance. It may be more productive to directly ask newcomers which messages they remember best and which messages they felt were most helpful to their success as new employees. Those questions may be better indicators of the importance of socialization messages and may provide more practical recommendations for successful socialization.</p>
<p>Finally, <italic>message content research</italic> should focus on how individual characteristics affect the perception of message content during socialization as well as newcomers’ overall adjustment. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021943612446731">Saks and Ashforth (1997)</xref> point out that personality characteristics, affective dispositions, values and beliefs, needs and motives, and demographic variables are likely to affect newcomers’ ability to learn during socialization and reduce their uncertainty. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021943612446731">Wanous (1992)</xref> also argues that individual factors such as willingness to conform may affect the acceptance of pivotal and relevant norms during socialization. Individual factors may determine which messages are remembered and considered helpful, and ultimately, the success of socialization efforts. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021943612446731">Waldeck and Myers (2008)</xref> suggest that perceptions of message content could be affected by psychological contracts between the organization and the newcomer as well as individual behaviors such as proactive information seeking and self-regulation. Research to date has tended to ignore individual differences during socialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0021943612446731">Saks &amp; Ashforth, 1997</xref>), but their potential affect necessitates their investigation.</p>

<sec id="section15-0021943612446731">
<title>Message Sources</title>
<p>This study’s findings suggest that coworkers are vitally important sources of information during socialization. A vast amount of literature attests to the importance of communication between supervisors and subordinates (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021943612446731">Berman, West, &amp; Richter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021943612446731">Jablin, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021943612446731">Tjosvold, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0021943612446731">Wheeless, Wheeless, &amp; Howard, 1984</xref>), but research on communication between peers indicates that it is also crucial in the adjustment of newcomers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021943612446731">Comer, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021943612446731">Sias, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021943612446731">Sias &amp; Jablin, 1995</xref>). Although the findings of this investigation indicate that the supervisor is an important source of information in all the content areas with the exception of people, coworkers are an equally important source of information in all the content areas except goals and values.</p>
<p>This investigation also indicates that peers are a primary source of information for people and politics message content. Since newcomers generally operate in a work unit, the coworkers are in the best position to indicate newcomer acceptance into the work unit (people). In addition, it also may be the case that coworkers are the ones who can tell newcomers how the balance of power really functions in the organization (politics), or at least newcomers perceive that they are the best source of that kind of information. Newcomers may perceive the supervisor as the main source of information for performance proficiency because (a) the supervisor is mainly concerned with employee performance, and (b) newcomers are concerned with the evaluation that the supervisor can provide and listen most intently to what their supervisor tells them about this area. Another notable content area concerns goals and values messages, which a majority of the participants reported top management as the primary source of information. This hotel corporation spent a considerable amount of time during the formal training discussing the goals and values of the corporation, so it is not surprising that these messages are acknowledged. It also is not surprising that the other sources were not viewed as primary for this content area. In less formal settings, coworkers may be the best source for newcomers to understand the “real” goals and values of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0021943612446731">Zurcher, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021943612446731">Kramer (2010)</xref> further argues for the importance of coworkers by pointing out that peers are also the most available sources of information during the organizational socialization process.</p>
<disp-quote><p>Peers are an important ongoing source of information for managing uncertainty and making sense of organizational experiences. Peers are a source of information for interpreting one’s own and other supervisor-subordinate relationships and impact individual outcomes like satisfaction, commitment, and turnover. (pp. 132-133)</p></disp-quote>
<p>Other aspects of socialization messages sources such as credibility should be studied in the future. As mentioned previously, prior research suggests that supervisors and coworkers vary as sources in terms of their helpfulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021943612446731">Louis et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021943612446731">Ostroff &amp; Kozlowski, 1992</xref>), which influences their credibility. If newcomers find the information communicated by a source to be particularly helpful, they are more likely to view that source as credible. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021943612446731">Maitlis (2005)</xref> highlights the importance of social relationships in influencing perceptions of source credibility by finding a positive relationship between employees’ sensemaking and employers’ efforts to increase employee understanding. The more there is a match between these activities, the more likely newcomers will view socialization sources as helpful and credible. This may be especially the case for supervisors who are being socialized by subordinates. Louis et al. finds subordinates to be among the most helpful information sources as they are often gatekeepers of departmental information. However, further investigation is warranted in this case as secretarial or administrative staff may need to be differentiated from the broad “subordinate” category. They are able to provide very different information from other kinds of subordinates. It is likely that supervisors view the reliability of information from subordinates differently, depending on whom it is coming from.</p>
<p>In addition to source credibility and helpfulness, recent research suggests an additional direction for future study of socialization message sources—the relationship between message sources, organizational identification, and socialization effectiveness. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021943612446731">Scott and Stephens (2009)</xref> find that organizational identification is affected by which sources the newcomer interacts with and gains information from. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021943612446731">Van Der Vegt and Bunderson (2005)</xref> find socialization effectiveness to be improved when newcomers indentify with many different people and levels within an organization. Research traditionally has examined the relationship between socialization tactics and identification (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021943612446731">Gibson &amp; Papa, 2000</xref>). However, by emphasizing the importance of message sources and their impact on identification and socialization effectiveness, a better understanding of how newcomers develop identification can be gained.</p>
<p>To conclude, this study’s objective was to examine two important aspects of communicating content during organizational socialization. Its findings indicate newcomers receive a wide range of message content from a variety of sources, which is an important step in determining exactly what and how information is communicated to newcomers. The study continues the important shift of investigating socialization from a perspective that argues that it is only a process of organizations and newcomers using a variety of tools to adapt to the a new work role to a perspective that argues socialization is also a process in which individuals communicate information about many different topics that will ultimately help the newcomer be successful. It provides additional evidence that communication is at the core of this process.</p>
<p>Although the study is limited in that it studied one organization within one industry, it did examine the socialization experiences of individuals from a wide variety positions across the country in very different kinds of hotel properties, which <italic>allows its findings to be generalized across other settings</italic>. Still, <italic>the study of communication’s role in socialization</italic> needs to expand to other kinds of organizations and industries to further increase the generalizability of these kinds of investigations. We can then discover more about what and how information is being communicated, which will help researchers, newcomers, and organizations to improve socialization experiences for everyone involved.</p>
