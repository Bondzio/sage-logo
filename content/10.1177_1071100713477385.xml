<title>Background:</title>
<p>In open ankle arthrodesis, debate remains as to which surgical approach and fixation devices should be used. The purpose of this study was to identify union, complication, and patient satisfaction rates of ankle fusions performed at our institution, using the plane between extensor hallucis longus and tibialis anterior with medial tibiotalar screw internal fixation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100713477385">
<title>Materials and Methods:</title>
<p>A retrospective review was performed of all isolated primary fusions between 2005 and 2009. Eighty-two ankles were identified in 73 patients. All patient records were reviewed, and 57 patients (65 ankles) attended for clinical evaluation and scoring. Age range at surgery was 18 to 75 years (mean, 56.1 years); 8 patients were smokers. Diagnoses were trauma in 52 patients (63%), osteoarthritis in 17, rheumatoid arthritis in 7, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in 3, congenital talipes equinovarus in 2, and talar avascular necrosis in 1. Follow-up range was 7 months to 8.3 years (mean, 4 years).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100713477385">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Time to union ranged from 8 to 39 weeks (mean, 13.3) with a union rate of 100%. The AOFAS range was 12 to 93 (mean, 70). Eighty percent were “very satisfied” or “satisfied.” Major complication rate was 14.6%: 7 malalignments; 3 wound problems; 2 complex regional pain syndrome; and 2 delayed unions, both smokers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1071100713477385">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>An excellent union rate, high patient satisfaction, and low complication rate were achieved with this technique. Varus malalignment and persistent pain resulted in dissatisfaction. Many patients remained highly active, and bilaterally fused patients functioned as well as unilateral ones.</p>

<p>Tibiotalar arthrodesis is a well-established surgical technique for relieving pain in the degenerative ankle joint. The pathogenesis of articular damage is most commonly secondary to trauma (70%), followed by rheumatoid arthritis (11.9%), primary arthritis (7.2%), and neuropathy (4.9%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100713477385">17</xref></sup> Other causes include osteonecrosis, infection, gout, and hemophilia. The ankle fusion procedure was first described by Albert<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100713477385">1</xref></sup> in 1879, and Charnley<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100713477385">2</xref></sup> introduced the principle of compression arthrodesis using an external fixator. More than 30 techniques have been described depending on the approach (open, mini open, arthroscopic), type of fixation (internal, external), use of bone graft (with or without), and hardware used (screws, plates, nail, none). The open technique can be performed via an anterior, posterior, lateral, medial, or combined surgical approach. Recent rates of successful primary fusion range from 80% to 100%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100713477385">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100713477385">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100713477385">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The popular transfibular approach may have advantages over other approaches because full-thickness flaps may be less likely to slough, the chance of neuroma may be reduced by using the plane between the sural and superficial peroneal nerves, and there may better exposure to correct deformity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100713477385">12</xref></sup> The anterior approach allows for good exposure of the entire joint, particularly for deformity correction, but risks injury to branches of the superficial peroneal nerve and anterior tibial neurovascular bundle. Union rates are comparable between these 2 approaches, between 84% and 100%, as are complication rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100713477385">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100713477385">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100713477385">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100713477385">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100713477385"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100713477385">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100713477385">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100713477385">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100713477385">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to review our institution’s experience of ankle arthrodeses performed via an open anterior approach using compression screw internal fixation. The aim was to assess union rates, postoperative function, complications rates, sporting activities, and patient satisfaction.</p>
<sec id="section6-1071100713477385" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We retrospectively reviewed 82 consecutive primary ankle fusions performed in 73 patients (9 bilateral) between 2004 and 2009 with a mean follow-up of 47 months (range, 7-100 months). Three patients with bilateral fusions had their first ankle fused before 2004, and these were also included. All patients were fused via an anteromedial surgical approach using the interval between extensor hallucis longus and tibialis anterior. Internal fixation was achieved with either 2 or 3 partially threaded cancellous screws placed from the medial tibia into the talus. All procedures were performed by the 2 senior authors (D.S. or N.C.) or by a registrar under their supervision. Smokers were not offered surgery unless they had stopped smoking for 6 months prior to their operation.</p>
<p>Patients were identified via our unit’s database, where a basic data set (demographics, diagnosis, operation type, comorbidities, length of stay) was collected prospectively. Only patients who underwent an isolated ankle fusion were included in the review, and those who had previous foot or ankle fusions, or simultaneous fusions at the time of surgery, were excluded. Hospital records were reviewed, and patients were contacted via telephone and invited for a clinical assessment, including American Orthopaedic Foot &amp; Ankle Society Ankle/Hindfoot Scale scoring (AOFAS score). A questionnaire was completed to document patient satisfaction with the procedure and sporting activities currently undertaken. All postoperative complications were noted, with major complications defined as deep soft tissue infection, osteomyelitis, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), malunion, and nonunion. Minor complications included superficial wound dehiscence, wound edge necrosis, symptomatic malalignment, symptomatic sensory nerve injury, and prominent hardware. Further interventions related to the index surgery were also noted. Data were analyzed using the 2-sample t test, chi-square test, and Pearson’s correlation coefficient, using the SPSS statistical package (version 17, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).</p>
<p>Of the 73 patients identified, 8 were unable to attend clinical review but were interviewed via telephone and 9 were not contactable (1 death), giving a 78% response rate for clinical review. There were 39 males (47 ankles) and 34 females (35 ankles), with a mean age at surgery of 56.1 years (range, 18-75 years). The most common diagnosis was trauma in 52 ankles (63%), followed by primary osteoarthritis in 17 (21%). Other diagnoses included 7 (9%) with rheumatoid arthritis, 3 (4%) with hereditary sensory motor neuropathy, 2 (2%) with congenital talipes equinovarus, and 1 (1%) with talar avascular necrosis. Eight (10%) were smokers. Forty-five right and 37 left ankles were fused. Two screws were used in 78 ankles and 3 screws in 4 ankles. The most common screw diameters used were 6.5 mm (37 ankles), 7.5 mm (27 ankles), and 8 mm (9 ankles).</p>
<sec id="section7-1071100713477385">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>All patients underwent ankle arthrodesis via the anteromedial approach. Intravenous antibiotics were given, and the patient was positioned supine with a thigh tourniquet inflated to 300 mm Hg. A midline 10-cm longitudinal incision was made over the ankle joint. The interval between extensor hallucis longus and tibialis anterior was identified, and the anterior tibial artery and veins and the deep peroneal nerve were retracted laterally. Following anterior joint capsulotomy, osteophytes were resected and the joint was debrided with removal of all sclerotic and nonviable bone using osteotomes, curettes, and a rongeur. The bone surfaces were roughened using an osteotome and drilled with a 2.5-mm drill to produce bleeding. No bone graft was used. A posteromedial stab incision, approximately 3 cm proximal to the tip of the medial malleolus, was made to allow insertion of cannulated screws under image intensification. The screws were placed in the posteromedial and anterolateral talar head, and if a third screw was used (for large patients), it was placed centrally. Washers were used in soft bone. Alignment of the ankle position was assessed clinically and by intraoperative anteroposterior and lateral radiographs. The wound was closed in layers with repair of the extensor retinaculum.</p>

<title>Rehabilitation</title>
<p>Non-weight-bearing was advised for a total of 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of 50% partial weight bearing and then 4 weeks of full weight-bearing. After 12 weeks of immobilization, plain radiographs were taken (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100713477385">Figure 1</xref>), physiotherapy was commenced, and normal footwear was worn. Patients were routinely seen at 2 and 6 weeks then at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively for examination and to assess bony union. Some were evaluated earlier than 12 weeks with radiographs. Delayed union was defined as ankle joint pain on physiological loading and incomplete bridging trabeculae on 2 orthogonal views radiologically, beyond 6 months. Nonunion was defined by the same criteria, after 9 months.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The mean length of inpatient stay was 3.1 days (range, 1-12 days). Mean time to union was 13.3 weeks (range, 8-39 weeks). Of the 82 ankles, there were 2 (2%) delayed unions (uniting at 31 and 39 weeks, both smokers) and no nonunions (union rate 100%). There were 13 (16%) minor complications: 3 (4%) symptomatic varus malalignment, 2 (2%) wound dehiscence, 2 (2%) superficial infections, and 1 (1%) stress fractures, and 5 patients (6%) required hardware removal. There were 4 (5%) major complications: 2 (2%) CRPS and 2 (2%) delayed unions. In addition, there were 6 (7%) asymptomatic sensory nerve injuries and 2 (2%) cases of asymptomatic varus malalignment. Following all fusions, 3 (4%) patients had subtalar injections, and subsequent fusions were performed in 8%: 5 subtalar, 1 Chopart, and 1 triple. There were no symptomatic thromboembolisms, deep infections, or osteomyelitis.</p>
<p>At mean follow-up of 47 months (range, 7-100 months), of the 65 ankles reviewed (79%), the mean AOFAS ankle/hindfoot score was 70 (range, 12-93) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100713477385">Table 1</xref>). Satisfaction data for 73 ankles (65 patients, 89%) were obtained, with 58 (80%) rated as either “very satisfied” or “satisfied” (58% of ankles were rated as “very satisfied”), 3 (4%) as “dissatisfied,” and 2 (3%) as “very dissatisfied.” Eight (11%) were “neither satisfied nor dissatisfied.” Thirty-four percent of patients participated in some form of recreational activity, including walking, dancing, golf, squash, badminton, long-distance cycling, and skydiving. Of the 2 patients who were “very dissatisfied,” both had CRPS. The 3 “dissatisfied” patients all had complications. Two of them contracted a skin ulcer: 1 laterally from 15-degree varus malalignment and the second, in a rheumatoid arthritic patient on prednisolone, medially from the cast, which remained unhealed at review 8 months later. The third “dissatisfied” case was a diabetic patient with 5-degree varus malalignment.</p>

<p>Complications, especially CRPS, were associated with a lower AOFAS score and dissatisfaction. One male with CRPS, who was a smoker and had a delayed union (uniting at 39 weeks) and an AOFAS score of 36, was “very dissatisfied.” The other patient with CPRS was female, a nonsmoker with an AOFAS score of 15, who united at 12 weeks, who was also “very dissatisfied.” An AOFAS score of less than 45 also correlated with dissatisfaction; despite this, 2 patients were satisfied with AOFAS scores of 9 and 30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100713477385">Figure 2</xref>). One bilaterally fused patient with hereditary sensory motor neuropathy had a left AOFAS score of 30, with 20 degrees of varus malalignment, but was “satisfied.” The patient was “very satisfied” with the right ankle, with an AOFAS score of 74.</p>

<title>Subgroups</title>
<p>Nine patients underwent bilateral fusions (none simultaneous) with a mean follow-up 61 months (range, 24-100 months). The diagnosis in 9 ankles was osteoarthritis, 5 were post traumatic, 1 had rheumatoid arthritis, and 1 had hereditary sensory motor neuropathy. Of the 8 patients reviewed, the mean AOFAS was 76 (range, 30-91) and no patients were dissatisfied, with 11 ankles rated as “very satisfied” and 1 as “satisfied” (combined total 75%), and the complication rate was 11%. Three participated in recreational walking, dancing, and golf. There was no statistical difference in AOFAS, satisfaction, or union time between the bilateral and unilateral groups with the numbers available.</p>
<p>The complication rate in those who smoked was 57% (4/7) compared with 21% for the whole cohort (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Six of 7 patients (86%) required extended management following surgery. The 2 patients with delayed unions (31 and 39 weeks) were both smokers and were immobilized longer. Two had an adjacent joint fused, 1 required repeated subtalar injections, 1 developed CRPS (with a delayed union), and 1 required medication for neurological foot pain. The mean time to union for smokers was longer than nonsmokers (20 vs 13 weeks, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1071100713477385">Figure 3</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite the large number of open ankle fusion studies in the literature, most report heterogeneous surgical techniques, making conclusions on a specific approach difficult. Over the past 25 years, approximately 15 studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100713477385">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100713477385">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100713477385"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100713477385"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100713477385"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100713477385">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100713477385">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100713477385"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100713477385"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100713477385">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100713477385">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100713477385">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1071100713477385">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100713477385">21</xref></sup> have reported on a sole open surgical technique, including the transfibular, anterior, medial, and combined approaches. In this study, we present our data on a single surgical technique, using the anteromedial approach and fixation with large fragment compression screws. We report the union and complication rates as well as AOFAS scores, patient satisfaction, and participation in sport after a mean follow-up of 4 years. This study is one of the largest series of open ankle fusions using a single technique, with only 2 others reporting larger numbers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100713477385">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100713477385">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of the single open surgical techniques published, 11 have shown union rates of 90% or better, usually using 2 or more compression screws. It would appear from these studies that surgical approach does not affect union rates, and this opinion is supported by others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100713477385">6</xref></sup>; however, without a meta-analysis, firm conclusions cannot be made. There is no accepted definition of delayed or nonunion for ankle fusion, although symptoms and absent bridging trabeculae beyond 6 months for delayed union and beyond 1 year for nonunion have been commonly used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100713477385">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100713477385">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100713477385">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100713477385">16</xref></sup> and so chosen for this study. This study demonstrates a 100% union rate and without the use of bone graft. This success has been achieved by one other study, with 16 patients via a transfibular approach using compression screws.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100713477385">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Risk factors for nonunion include a severe fracture, tibial plafond and talar fractures, open injury, local infection, osteonecrosis of the talus, smoking, previous nonunion, and coexisting major medical conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100713477385">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100713477385">6</xref></sup> Patients with a prior diagnosis of a combined plafond to talus fracture have the worst prognosis, followed by patients with Hawkin’s II or III talar fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100713477385">6</xref></sup> Factors not associated with nonunion included patient age and previous subtalar or triple arthrodesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100713477385">6</xref></sup> We believe that the excellent union rates shown in this study were achieved because of meticulous surgical technique, judicious resection of remaining cartilage, sclerotic and non to viable bone, and preservation of bone contours, to create a stable fusion mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100713477385">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100713477385">21</xref></sup> The use of cancellous screws rather than plates produces less soft tissue stripping, therefore preserving blood supply, and allows for excellent compression across bone surfaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100713477385">6</xref></sup> We did not document specific details of the type or classification of posttraumatic injuries; this series may have contained a lower number of high-grade injuries, thereby improving the union rate.</p>
<p>At the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust, our policy on perioperative smoking also reduces the ankle fusion nonunion risk, which is approximately 3.75 times higher in smokers assuming other risk factors exist and 16 times higher if no other risk factors exist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100713477385">4</xref></sup> The mechanisms thought to produce this deleterious effect include more than 4000 compounds in cigarette smoke, the most notable being nicotine, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen cyanide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1071100713477385">20</xref></sup> The timing of smoking cessation, however, has not been established. In this study, smoking correlated with a higher than average complication rate (nearly 3 times) and postoperative intervention rate compared with nonsmoking. Both delayed unions were smokers, and 2 smokers developed neurological pain (CRPS and neurological foot pain). Our institution’s policy is not to offer ankle fusion surgery to smokers, and these poorer outcomes in smokers support this policy. It is, however, impossible to prevent all patients from smoking, and hence some were included in this study, but we continue to counsel this group who are considering an ankle fusion, highlighting the increased risks.</p>
<p>The surgical approach is not thought to affect union rates, but each technique has its merits. Some authors believe that the transfibular approach allows for better exposure and the full-thickness flaps produced are less likely to slough than with an anterior approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100713477385">12</xref></sup> However, the same author in a later series using the transfibular approach reported a 15% lateral wound edge necrosis rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100713477385">11</xref></sup> In our series, 2 (2%) wounds dehisced, which is favorable compared with other reports using this approach (0%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100713477385">3</xref></sup> and 5%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100713477385">21</xref></sup>) and compared with the transfibular approach (0%-15%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100713477385">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100713477385">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100713477385"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100713477385"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100713477385">13</xref></sup> Injury to the superficial peroneal nerve is theoretically decreased when using the transfibular approach compared with the anteromedial approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100713477385">12</xref></sup> We found 6 (7%) sensory nerve injuries that produced numbness, none of which concerned the patients.</p>
<p>An element of patient selection bias occurred in this study as those selected for an open fusion tended to have a greater deformity than those offered an arthroscopic fusion. This may account for the 4% rate of symptomatic varus malalignment. The anteromedial approach may make correcting coronal malalignment more difficult compared with the transfibular approach.</p>
<p>The mean AOFAS score of 70 and the ability of one-third of patients to participate in recreational activities demonstrate that following ankle fusion, patients are able to maintain good levels of function, and these scores are similar to those in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100713477385">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100713477385">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100713477385">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1071100713477385">21</xref></sup> AOFAS scores correlated with patient satisfaction: A higher score was more likely to lead to a more satisfied patient, although there were exceptions. A change in preoperative AOFAS scores may be a better indicator of satisfaction; however, we did not measure preoperative AOFAS scores. Eighty percent of patients were either “very satisfied” or “satisfied” with the outcome of their ankle fusion, and 8% “dissatisfied” or “very dissatisfied.” These rates compare favorably with other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100713477385">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100713477385">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100713477385">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100713477385">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100713477385">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100713477385">18</xref></sup> with a range of 55% to 90%, although this parameter is not always measured in the same way and in some studies is not measured at all.</p>
<p>This series included 9 bilateral ankle fusions, the largest number yet to be published in a series using a single technique. These patients demonstrated no difference in results compared with unilateral fusions, with similar union times, complication rates, AOFAS scores, and satisfaction rates (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). Having both ankles fused did not appear to cause significant functional deficit. This may be due to the ability of the hindfoot and midfoot to remain flexible as patients are forced to use both feet and not favor one, as which may occur following unilateral fusion. Some bilaterally fused patients stated that when ascending slopes, a side-to-side stepping motion was used to overcome the inability of either ankle to dorsiflex.</p>
<p>In summary, we advocate the anteromedial approach for open ankle fusion using large fragment compression screws. The technique is simple and does not require a fibulectomy or multiple incisions. It is safe and is associated with excellent union rates, low complication rates, and high levels of patient satisfaction. Patients considering ankle arthrodesis who smoke should be counseled regarding the increased risk of complications including delayed union, a higher level of postoperative intervention, and longer time to union. These patients should be supported in smoking cessation and offered surgery once this has been achieved. Patients with bilateral ankle fusions function as well as unilateral fusions and are as satisfied; therefore, a previous ankle arthrodesis should not prevent surgery from being offered.</p>
