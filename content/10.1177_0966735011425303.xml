<abstract>
<p>Seeking new language for the Divine has encouraged Christian and Jewish feminists to explore other religious traditions which are richer in feminine language for God, and in some cases to borrow parts of what they find for their own use. However, these other religious traditions are often socially and politically less powerful, and borrowing their language and practice has ethical implications. Especially because the ethical dimensions of liturgy are bound up with theological issues, religious feminists have a moral duty to consider these questions in which there are rarely if ever any easy answers.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Jewish and Christian feminists have often found the traditional language of their religions to be male-focused, patriarchal, and restrictive. Some have turned to Scripture to remedy this, some have turned to their own experience, and some, often led or inspired by feminists who have left the monotheistic traditions in search of more woman-friendly spiritual nurture, have sought to borrow or use language from other religious traditions, including ancient and modern paganism and Native American sources. This process of borrowing can be enormously helpful, but it can also raise ethical issues, because the use of language taken from a less powerful community can harm those people. In this article, I will examine a series of examples of such borrowing and their ethical implications, asking whether our current frameworks for analysing these situations are sufficient.</p>
<p>These issues, although little addressed at present, find a precedent in earlier Christian and Jewish feminist discussions of the language of liturgy. Janet Walton has called feminist concern about liturgy ‘a matter of social justice’, and that surely extends beyond the equal representation of women into issues of racial and ethnic justice. Liturgy needs to be ethical because, if it is to be ‘an encounter, an engaged, embodied dialogue with God’ it cannot be ‘true’ if people are excluded from or harmed by the ‘texts, symbols, and metaphors’ used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0966735011425303">Walton, 2000</xref>: 12). By arguing in this way, Walton weaves the ethical in with the theological, reminding us that both are part of the liturgical endeavour. As well as recognizing and supporting all members of a congregation, liturgy needs to respect the humanity and dignity of people who are not members of the Church – this is in line with Jacquelyn Grant’s insight that ‘all forms of oppression are interrelated’ (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0966735011425303">Eugene et al., 1994</xref>: 128).</p>
<sec id="section2-0966735011425303">
<title>Three Ethical Principles</title>
<p>To begin this discussion, I want to lay out the ethical standard to which we should hold Jewish and Christian feminists when they are writing liturgy and theology. I propose to establish a common standard composed of three principles which are supported by feminism, Christianity, and Judaism, and which are relevant to the ethical debates at hand. These principles are, first, that we should strive for social justice and an end to oppression; second, that honesty or speaking truth is vital; and third, that we must not exclude ourselves from critiques of unethical behaviour. Ending the oppression of women is the foundational principle of feminism:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Although any general definition of feminism would no doubt be controversial, it seems undeniable that much work in feminist theory is devoted to the tasks of critiquing women’s subordination, analyzing the intersections between sexism and other forms of subordination such as racism, heterosexism, and class oppression, and envisioning the possibilities for both individual and collective resistance to such subordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0966735011425303">Allen, 2005</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As this quote suggests, feminism has often sought to ally itself with other anti-oppression and civil rights movements – some more closely than others. For example, lesbian movements have sometimes been almost identical to branches of feminism; at other times, some lesbians have felt rejected by feminists. More importantly for this project, people of colour have felt excluded from and extensively critiqued the mainstream and mostly white feminist movement; examples within feminist theology would include the critiques of Mary Daly by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0966735011425303">Lorde (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0966735011425303">Narayan (1997)</xref>, although there are also women of colour who are acknowledged as feminist pioneers and widely respected. Recent work on intersectionality has tended to reaffirm Jacquelyn Grant’s view, cited above, that ‘all forms of oppression are interrelated’, and hence that a movement such as feminism which opposes oppression along one axis should also seek social justice for people who are oppressed in other ways. This is supported by other work on feminist ethics: Haney proposes feminist ethics uses underlying ‘paradigms of friendship and nurture’, with the principles of honesty and respect for life being paramount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0966735011425303">Haney, 1994</xref>: 9). This latter principle has been extended to state clearly that loyalty to women within the context of feminism is part of a loyalty to humanity – if this is so, then feminism’s aims include the liberation of other oppressed groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0966735011425303">Robb, 1994</xref>: 16).</p>
<p>Social justice can also be framed as a key ethical concern of Jewish and Christian ethics, including non-feminist ethics. This is perhaps most visible in the liberation theology movement, a Christian tradition which seeks to understand and use the analysis of poverty provided by Marxism. However, it has also been strong in other Christian and Jewish communities: Ada Maria Isasi-Diaz names it ‘solidarity’ and suggests that it should be the model of Christian ethics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0966735011425303">Isasi-Diaz, 1994</xref>: 85). With these influences in mind, I take Jewish and Christian feminists to be doubly bound to seek to end all forms of oppression: both their religious commitments and their political commitments point in this direction. This will form the basis of my critique of some practices of using religious language and practices from other traditions, where such borrowing or theft perpetuates the oppression of a community.</p>
<p>The second principle which I identify as key is the need to speak truth to the best of one’s ability. This is a common ethical consideration, and particularly applicable to theological circumstances in which speaking as honestly as humanly possible about one’s experience and understanding of the Divine is an imperative. However, it is also importantly applicable to borrowing concrete or abstract items from other people: there is a need to give a truthful account of the sources of such items. In a sense, this turns back to the issue of social justice, both because falsehood in attribution may harm the people who are thus misrepresented, but also because naming God honestly (hence, in a sophisticated feminist theological understanding, not only as masculine) is an ethical as well as theological necessity, since we need to do so in order to be seen to be fully accepting the humanity of all members of the congregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0966735011425303">Walton, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, I take it that we have not just a philosophical but also an ethical duty to consider seriously critiques which have been made of certain kinds of unethical behaviour, and whether or not they apply to us as well. I take this to be a step in the direction of full ‘mutuality in our relating’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0966735011425303">Cannon and Heyward, 1994</xref>: 59), an entirely ethical form of relationship which is at least theoretically possible between people who occupy different places within the ‘demonarchy’, the combined forces of sexism, racism, and other oppressions within society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0966735011425303">Williams, 1994</xref>: 50). This consideration may not be easy, and as so often in matters of ethics there may be no clear answer especially in relation to particular circumstances, but this is no reason to avoid the issue.</p>

<title>The Context of Cultural and Religious Appropriation</title>
<p>Faced with claims of cultural appropriation, many people, especially in the groups who are borrowing, will ask whether use of words and ideas from another culture can really do harm. Taking physical possessions, whether or not they have religious significance, can easily be seen as stealing, and taking an item which has religious meaning and using it out of context is obviously disrespectful – but the use of something as abstract as an idea is harder to understand in this way. Religious feminists are hardly first in line when such critiques are being made: the Lakota Summit V singled out:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>individuals and groups involved in “the New Age Movement,” in “the men’s movement,” in “neo-paganism” cults and in “shamanism” workshops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0966735011425303">Mesteth, Standing Elk, and Swift Hawk, 1993</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Meantime Brunk and Young identify the ‘deep ecology’ movement and the men’s and New Age movement, as culprits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0966735011425303">Brunk and Young, 2009</xref>: 95). I think, however, that a brief consideration of the kinds of actions which are being attacked here – misrepresentation, amalgamation with other traditions, and, as the Lakota Summit V put it, ‘mixing... imitation rituals with non-Indian occult practices in an offensive and harmful pseudo-religious hodgepodge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0966735011425303">Mesteth et al., 1993</xref>) – show that Christian and Jewish feminists could easily fall into the same patterns.</p>
<p>We see this in more detail when we consider the work of post-colonial writers on the possible forms of harm caused by outsiders misusing religious ideas, words, and names. These harms include the loss of authentic religious thought to the members of the community from which it originated, with concurrent loss of their religious identity, and the misunderstanding (and possible stereotyping, lack of respect, and other mistreatments resulting from misunderstanding) which results from the misrepresentation of a religion by those who claim to be experts but are not directly members of the tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0966735011425303">Brunk and Young, 2009</xref>: 97). This is often framed using the metaphor of property, especially in the Native American case where the taking of physical as well as intellectual property by colonizers has been well documented. There are also plenty of secular examples, of which a useful one to consider is the inclusion of Native American characters in children’s books written by non-Native authors. On the one hand, the desire to include Native American characters in a realistic and meaningful way is laudable; on the other hand, when done by non-Native writers, such depictions are often stereotypes and even when well written tend (given the oppressive economic forces at work in the world of publishing) to fill the market with views of Native American communities which are imposed from outside those communities. Perceptions of Native communities are obviously shaped by these inaccurate sources, which is damaging to Native Americans who find themselves the object of extensive discussion but unable to speak for themselves, and without positive role models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0966735011425303">Seale, Slapin, and Gonzales, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Mary E. Hunt introduces a distinction which is useful in considering this debate, using the metaphor of physical property to distinguish between grand larceny, petty theft, and borrowing in using materials from other cultures. The first, grand larceny, is characterized by a lack of respect for the integrity of a body of work, which if extended to a religious system might include taking names or concepts out of context. The second, petty theft, is suggestive of a lack of nuance in the use to which the borrowed item is put; and the third, borrowing, requires that what is taken is only what is needed, that an explanation for the borrowing is given, and that it is returned after use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0966735011425303">Eugene et al., 1994</xref>: 106). In the setting of liturgy, it is hard to see how borrowing can be completed, since what has been used in a public and published setting cannot really be returned, but this issue clearly requires thought.</p>
<p>The metaphor of theft or borrowing is common to the point of being almost universal in writing about cultural appropriation (for example, almost all the essays in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0966735011425303">Ziff and Rao, 1997</xref>), and this seems to be because there is a close link between thinking about appropriation of ideas, language or concepts, and the history of appropriation of physical objects – the best example is perhaps anthropologists and private collectors taking or forcing people to sell items, often with ritual uses or religious importance, for museum display. However, despite the general acceptance of this metaphor, there are places where it breaks down. The issue of returning intellectual ‘items’ which have been borrowed or used by someone else is one such place, but there are also questions to be asked about whether treating intellectual property as if it were physical property makes sense in the light of the inherent differences between the two. This is a debate which is being wildly held at present especially in the area of copyright law in an internet age, and is too large to tackle in detail here (it raises huge questions such as whether ‘copyright’ can in any real sense belong, in law, to a community which may contain differing views, rather than to an individual).</p>
<p>Rather than discuss issues of law, I want to remain focused on the ethical issues by offering an alternative metaphor which (although like any analogy it has its own flaws) may help us to further think through the issues at hand. Rather than comparing a word or concept to an item, we can consider the issue at the level of culture, comparing operating within another cultural framework to entering another country as a foreign national. Here, the distinctions break down into related categories with new connotations: we can enter as colleagues for a particular piece of work, as honoured and welcome guests, as tourists who are worth tolerating because of their economic value, or as an invading army (this metaphor is related to the concept of ‘guesthood’ as an anthropological method as used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0966735011425303">Harvey [2010]</xref>). Because cultures are usually associated with physical spaces, these things often happen at once – actual tourists, for example, often strive to witness ‘real culture’ in the places they visit and are hence operating on our metaphorical level as well. Using texts and pictures, however, we can also become visitors within a culture without ever meeting the living human beings who are members of that culture. The question is now: when we ‘visit’ a culture in this metaphorical sense, can we be more than tourists whose book purchases support their authors, who in turn may not be members of the culture about which we are reading? If we are tourists, how can we repay our hosts and be on our best behaviour?</p>

<title>Working Through Some Examples</title>
<p>Without denying that there is much to be gained from exchange between different cultures and religions, I want to problematize some of the ways and situations in which this is done. To illustrate, and to explore in more detail the questions just raised, I want to analyse in detail some examples of such borrowing.</p>
<p>Marjorie Proctor-Smith wrote in her book, <italic>In Her Own Rite: Constructing Feminist Liturgical Tradition</italic>, that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A valuable resource for enlarging our imaginations about God-language is to be found in the varied and rich traditions of Goddess-worship, as practiced in ancient times, as continuing in the present, and as reconstructed by contemporary feminists. Such a process of appropriation must be guided by respectful openness to the tradition and a willingness to experience it on its own terms, as well as a critical study of its images, attending in particular to “sympathetic critics”. For example, existing traditions such as the Yoruba celebrate Oshun the Dancer, and Yemaya of the seas, who give to humanity ashe, the power-to-make-things-happen. The Laguna Pueblos revere Spider-Woman as the primordial deity, who gave fire to humankind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0966735011425303">Proctor-Smith, 2000</xref>: 100).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She cites sources for these claims – Michelle Cliff and Joseph Murphey, both African-American scholars of religion, and Paula Allen Gunn, a Native American feminist theologian. The ethical issue here is about who has rightful access to such traditions. Given the context of previous white/Western theft from indigenous African, American, Australian, Asian, and other communities, taking religious ideas and terms without permission or due respect for their original settings might be unethical. However much respect we have for the traditions from which we are borrowing, and however open we try to be, without some form of reciprocity it remains an unfair exchange and one which repeats a historical pattern of harm. As Isasi-Diaz has pointed out, having respect for a culture or person without actually engaging with them is useless – we need to do more than nod to the ‘problem of difference’, giving a name-check without allowing what has been said to change us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0966735011425303">Isasi-Diaz, 1994</xref>: 95). Furthermore, borrowing language such as this and claiming that it represents the authentic spirituality of the source culture can cause harm.</p>
<p>In this case, Proctor-Smith may not be directly causing harm, but following the procedure which she recommends could lead to practices which would cause harm in the forms mentioned earlier. For example, if the appropriated material – such as the name and attributes of a Yoruba deity used in a Christian context – is presented as authentic Yoruba spirituality, even though it has obviously lost much which was important in that process of being transported to a Christian setting, Yoruba spirituality may be said to be misrepresented in ways which can harm practitioners of the original form of the religion.</p>
<p>In more recent work, it is common for authors to show an awareness of these issues and the possibility of harm but not to discuss them in any great detail. For example, Jan Berry describes a ritual in which a Native American element is used – the dreamcatcher, a piece of ritual equipment which has been much taken up by the tourist and New Age markets – and while she mentions the possibility of an ethical issue and provides some brief arguments in favour of using the dreamcatcher in this specific context, the discussion is by no means extensive. She writes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There has been considerable criticism of the way in which some women’s spirituality groups and new age practitioners have taken elements from native American culture and used them in individualistic ways without respect or regard for the political and justice implications. In her work with first nation people, Clare was concerned to be respectful of their culture and traditions, and to avoid the co-option of others’ symbols and stories. For her, the symbolism of the dreamcatcher was one which resonated with both the content and process of her thesis, and was one she could use with integrity and respect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0966735011425303">Berry, 2009</xref>: 96).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We might want to ask whether Berry and Clare have the authority to judge that the use of the dreamcatcher here is with sufficient ‘integrity and respect’, or whether that should fall to the people of the First Nations from whom Clare has borrowed it. Furthermore, this example raises the question of how Clare has positioned herself in relation to the people whose culture she has studied. Is she a tourist here, taking what may not have been given freely, or a guest, borrowing something which her hosts have given her permission to use?</p>
<p>Another analogy which may be worryingly close, though one which is particularly useful because discussion around it has already focused on issues of appropriation, is with early (and more recent) ethnographers who have made their ways into other cultures by physical or social force and have then published, for profit, material which the originating culture regarded as private, secret, and/or sacred. A classic if extreme case is that of Frank Cushing, who in 1879 gained entry to the Zuni tribe, gathering material which he would later publish to general acclaim. Thomas writes that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Overstaying one departure date after another, Cushing started pushing his way into secret meetings and initiations. When asked to leave, he pretended not to understand, and the Zuni, too polite to insist, gradually came to accept his presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0966735011425303">Thomas, 2000</xref>: 74).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thomas goes on to record that later, ‘some Zuni expressed their irritation at his publishing their sacred legends and rituals’; Cushing apparently held that he had broken no confidences by publishing because such rituals only held meaning within their particular social context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0966735011425303">Thomas, 2000</xref>: 76). There are two flaws in such a reading: first, that the social context within which the rituals can have meaning is too narrowly read, since once those rituals have been introduced to, for example, English speaking white Americans, they can have meaning to them, which will in the first instance be influenced by the academics who are doing the introducing; and second, that whether or not a particular story is meaningful to the audience to which it is told, if you have said that you will not tell it and then you do, you have obviously been dishonest.</p>
<p>Without more information about Clare’s work and the responses of the First Nation people with whom she had worked, it is impossible to know to what extent the comparison might stand or not, especially since the discipline has changed massively since Cushing went to do field work in 1879. Furthermore, we can also say that using something in an originally private ritual is different from publishing and profiting financially from it. Because of these factors, it seems unwise to make too firm a judgement on this specific case, but perhaps we say minimally that the ethics of such situations need careful consideration.</p>
<p>Continuing the theme of very brief considerations, Berger’s survey of American Christian feminist liturgy refers to the problem in a single paragraph.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Alienation from the liturgical tradition invites a look at other ritual traditions. In some North American Feminist liturgies, there is liberal borrowing from Native American rituals practices. Other Feminist communities, however, worry about ‘ritual theft’ and prefer to abstain from ritual borrowing, particularly from peoples who have experienced colonial expropriation in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0966735011425303">Berger, 1999</xref>: 124-25).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She moves on to discuss the importantly different case of what she calls ‘Third World Feminist liturgies which borrow from their own local traditions. Use of that which can reasonably be called your own past or your own culture may not be ethically problematic in the same way, because the power imbalance between you and those from whom you are borrowing is smaller or non-existent.</p>
<p>A case which raises many of these issues and allows us to view them in a wider context is the Christian use of Yoga, especially Hatha Yoga which focuses on physical practices. My key feminist example of this particular kind of borrowing comes from Rosemary Radford Ruether’s ‘Summer Solstice Party’ ritual, given on pages 273-75 of <italic>Women-Church</italic>. She describes this as ‘an all-night picnic and camp-out around a bonfire representing the sun at the longest day of the year’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0966735011425303">Ruether, 1988</xref>: 273). All participants are asked to bring ‘a totem representing an important part of herself’, about which she tells a story, before the ‘totems are... arranged around the pole’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0966735011425303">Ruether, 1988</xref>: 273). Ruether does not mention whether this is intended to be borrowing, and I do not have space here to analyse it in detail, but the terms ‘totem’ and ‘totem pole’ are so heavily associated with Native American and First Nations people that I suspect that appropriation is taking place here as well. Having slept out overnight, the group rise with the sun and chant to it, after which they are asked to move through the Hatha Yoga Salute to the Sun – a series of 13 body postures drawn from Indian tradition – before breakfasting to conclude the party. Ruether reproduces diagrams of the 13 body postures on page 275, numbering rather than naming them and giving directions for points of breathing in and out.</p>
<p>The use or abuse of various forms of yoga in the West, and whether yoga can sit comfortably alongside Christianity, has been the focus of much attention already, mostly in the press and various internet forums. For example, <italic>The Washington Post</italic> has on their website a staged debate between Aseem Shukla, a co-founder and board member of the Hindu American Foundation, and Deepak Chopra, best known for writing self-help books which draw on various ‘New Age’ philosophies, about whether the Hindu background of yoga is sufficiently appreciated in the West. Once again, the debate turns out to be as much about the boundaries of the tradition (an even harder question in the case of Hinduism which has never been a single cohesive religion) as anything else, but the decoupling of yoga from Hinduism seems to facilitate the Western imagination in taking yoga to be part of the Eastern spiritual quick-fix which is so often sought. We see this in the other terms which Shukla remarks upon:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Once yoga was no longer intertwined with its Hindu roots, it became up for grabs and easy to sell. These journals abundantly refer to yoga as “ancient Indian,” “Eastern” or “Sanskritic,” but seem to assiduously avoid the term “Hindu” out of fear, we can only assume, that ascribing honestly the origins of their passion would spell disaster for what has become a lucrative commercial enterprise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0966735011425303">Shukla and Chopra, 2010</xref>).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this broader context, is not surprising that Ruether has both encountered yoga and found it spiritually uplifting, and that she has not given much if any thought to its origins and the need to acknowledge them. Unlike specifically seeking new images of God in unfamiliar traditions, this form of borrowing without thought is very common in the Western cultures within which Ruether is operating, though this does not of course excuse the act itself and the harm it may cause.</p>
<p>The use of yoga here is clearly an important part of Ruether’s ritual. As often – perhaps more often – the use of a culturally appropriated element is a very brief section in a work which is either relatively orthodox (using that term in a loose sense) or which draws from a wide range of other sources as well. I discussed earlier the pattern of very brief mentions of controversy; the uses of Native American material which I am about to consider do not even go that far, and often have a feel of ‘taking for granted’ the possibility of using such material. At the same time, the usages are often very small and treated as insignificant. For example, Malarcher mentions the use of ‘Native American flute music’ in a ritual – in fact, in the second version of a ritual which had originally used something else (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0966735011425303">Proctor-Smith and Walton, 1993</xref>: 186). The mention is generic – it does not refer to a specific piece of music or a specific tradition of Native American music. This is unlikely to be the fault of the author directly, since music is often marketed to Euro-Americans (and indeed Europeans) under such vague labelling; however, it seems symptomatic of a feminist acceptance of a series of stereotypical views of non-white people including previously appropriated material – compare Ruether’s use of yoga and also the way in which Zaidman writes that for the postmodern Jewish feminists whose ritual she attended, ‘the Native American religion is another source’ despite the clear understanding of Native writers that there is no single Native religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0966735011425303">Zaidman, 1996</xref>: 57; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0966735011425303">Weaver, 1997</xref>: 26). In a similar way, Winter seems to be using a quotation from John Fire/Lame Deer (1903-1976, Sioux/Lakota, who was among other things a Lakota holy man [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425303">The ipl2 Consortium 2009</xref>]) to support a stereotypical view of Native Americans as ‘repositories of a lost virtue’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0966735011425303">Thomas, 2000</xref>: xxvi). In the context of a liturgy for transformation called ‘Circle of Love’ which asks for God’s help in extending love to all people, she quotes John Fire/Lame Deer’s description of the whole world as a series of circles:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The camp in which every tipi had its place</p>
<p>was also in a ring.</p>
<p>The tipi was a ring in which people sat in a circle</p>
<p>and all families in the village</p>
<p>were in turn circles</p>
<p>within a larger circle,</p>
<p>part of the larger hoop</p>
<p>which was the seven campfires of the Sioux,</p>
<p>representing one nation.</p>
<p>The nation was only one part of the universe,</p>
<p>itself circular... (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0966735011425303">Winter, 1990</xref>: 191).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The purpose and general content of the liturgy is not at issue, and nor is the practice of quoting from a wide range of sources to remind people of the diversity of humanity as they seek, to use Winter’s own phrase from one of the prayers in the piece, to ‘extend/our circle of love/beyond all human boundaries’. Winter also quotes from Abba Dorotheus, whom she contextualizes as a ‘seventh-century Eastern Orthodox mystic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0966735011425303">Winter, 1990</xref>: 190-91). She does not, however, contextualize John Fire/Lame Deer beyond providing his name, and there are no references to the exact sources of the quotations. Intentionally or not, this brief quotation which is so evocative of a certain popular standard image of Native American life – as well as speaking clearly to the theme of the liturgy – is in danger of supporting stereotypes in the minds of those who hear or participate in the liturgy. This makes its use into the proverbial double-edged sword: on the one hand, it emphasizes the idea that others have this view of the world as an interconnected single entity of which all is worthy of respect and love, while on the other hand, it might make it harder for a congregation (especially one with little or no first-hand exposure to the present realities of Native American life) to relate to, respect, and ultimately love, these people as they actually are today.</p>
<p>Another example which is problematic in the same directions is Nellie Morton’s theological article ‘The Goddess as Metaphoric Image’, in which she uses much Goddess language (mostly presumably from Goddess worshipping neo-pagan communities) and a variety of images from Native American sources, including Hopi, Mexican, and Aztec traditions. Morton describes an experience in which she saw Goddess as a spider, and relates that to Native American imagery of spider goddesses. She writes that:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Several tribes of the early American Indians, especially the Hopi, reverenced the Spider Woman as Creator of the earth and all underneath the earth. Making her home underneath the earth, she was known as the Earth Mother, “as old as time... as young as eternity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0966735011425303">Morton, 1989</xref>: 116-17).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Her citation for this information is George Merrick Mullet’s 1979 book <italic>Spider Women Stories: Legends of the Hopi Indians</italic>, which one reviewer describes as ‘improved folklore’, commenting that although attention to the literary merit of folk-tales is worthwhile, ‘a volume such as this may give the mistaken impression that the narratives were originally intended solely as entertainment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0966735011425303">McNeil, 1981</xref>: 128). Remembering Thomas’s remarks on Cushing and other anthropologists, this should make us suspicious of such casual inclusions: and yet it might be equally bad not to include goddesses from outside the white Western traditions. Audre Lorde critiqued Mary Daly for doing just that, asking why Daly’s goddess images were ‘only white, western european, judeo-christian?’ Lorde goes on to list some goddesses whom Daly could have included in much the same way as Proctor-Smith listed goddesses in the quote at the beginning of this chapter: ‘Where was Afrekete, Yemanje, Oyo, Mawulisa? Where were the warrior goddesses of the Vodun, the Dahomeian Amazons and the warrior-women of Dan?’ (Lorde quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0966735011425303">Lunn [1993</xref>: 23]). I doubt that Mary Daly had in mind the ethical issues which I am discussing here, but Lorde’s criticism complicates the task at hand by asking that white religious feminists do seek to learn about and include material from other cultures in our work so as not to imply that these sources are inferior because we are ignoring them.</p>
<p>How, then, can those materials be acquired, studied, and used in a respectful way? As a final and perhaps more positive example, I want to consider a piece from the Clark, Ronan, and Walker collection, <italic>Image-Breaking, Image-Making: a Handbook for Creative Worship with Women of Christian Tradition</italic>. They give a plan for a ritual meal which they describe as ‘derived from Chinese Buddhist tradition’, and the note (‘This style of meal was introduced at Grailville by Theresita Lee Wang, originally of Hong Kong, now living in Cincinnati, Ohio’) makes it clear that this derivation is via personal contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0966735011425303">Clark, Ronan, and Walker, 1981</xref>: 50 and note p. 133). There is no discussion of the ethical implications of this usage in the book, but I think it is an instructive case to consider because it appears to produce different outcomes under the two metaphors proposed above. If we consider the metaphor of traditions as property, we have to first ask to whom the property belongs – here, it could be argued that the ‘ritual meal tradition’ belongs to the ‘Chinese Buddhist’ community as a whole (taking, for the sake of argument, ‘the Chinese Buddhist community’ to be something like ‘the group of people who identity as Chinese Buddhists, who are identified as Chinese Buddhists by others including other Chinese Buddhists, and who possess a range of linguistic and practical traditions including that of holding ritual meals of this kind’). If this is so, then a single member of that community may not have the authority to ‘give away’ this piece of ‘property’ (as discussed above, it cannot be lent or borrowed because once used and published for the use of other Christian feminists, it cannot be returned in any meaningful way; it has been more than shown or demonstrated to others once those others have adapted it for their own needs and published it), and the use of this ritual by the Christian feminists would be judged ethically unsound. There are signs here that the metaphor may be breaking down again – the use of the ritual meal by the Christian feminists does not, in fact, prevent Chinese Buddhists from continuing to use it; it is more like a digital file which can be copied and exist in several places at once than a unique object which once handed over cannot be accessed by the original owners.</p>
<p>However, if we consider the metaphor of religious traditions as spaces within which potential ‘borrowers’ may be invaders, tourists, or guests, this looks quite different. Where some Jewish and Christian feminists discussed above have seemed to be tourists, reading guidebooks but rarely interacting with the people who live permanently in the spaces concerned, in this case the Christian feminists who wish to visit have a ‘local contact’. It is hard to make a detailed judgement about the status of Theresita Lee Wang from the brief mention provided – it might make a difference to the analysis if she were a Chinese Buddhist, a Chinese Buddhist who had converted to Christianity, or always been a Christian, for example – but if we assume for the time being (as the authors of the book seem to accept) that she had a good knowledge of the Chinese Buddhist ritual meal tradition, then she could be seen as welcoming the Grailville feminists to the tradition as her guests. This would put their interaction with the tradition on a much more positive ethical footing. Furthermore, the Grailville feminists here appear to have made some effort both to learn about and from the Chinese Buddhist tradition, and have obtained their material from a knowledgeable and (it seems) willing source. It may be that they come as close as possible to undertaking the task of borrowing from another religious tradition in an ethically acceptable way.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Given the complexity of the matter, much more work in the area is obviously needed. I hinted that rather than the taking or borrowing of property, invading or visiting a community space may be a more fruitful metaphor, but this too will break down at some points – which those will be has yet to be fully explored. One advantage of the metaphor of visiting for the scripturally-based theologian is that it increases the range of biblical models, since receiving visitors or being a visitor in a strange land is a common theme especially in the Hebrew Bible. In fact, precedents can be found there for all the suggested parts of the metaphor. There are invasions, complete with detailed instructions on, for example, what to save and what to destroy in the process of conducting a siege, as given in Deuteronomy 20. There are examples of visitors who make inappropriate demands: Lot calls the men of Sodom ‘my friends’ – regardless of whether or not he was right to offer his daughters in place of his angelic guests, the men of Sodom are visiting and seeking to take what is not theirs (Genesis 19). Sometimes visitors are wonderful, and sometimes they are shown to be a difficulty; one visitor can be both, as Mary and Martha would testify. Sometimes, as in Tobit, they are not who you think they are. We are cautioned to be thoughtful about whose houses we visit, as the Houses of Wisdom and Folly are contrasted in Proverbs 9.</p>
<p>All of these considerations are relevant when our methods of visiting have changed. The stories mentioned above always have two sides, the visitor and visited; at different times, the biblical texts provide us with both perspectives on the situation. Offering and accepting hospitality is often important. This is likely to affect both our approach to other religious traditions and to those who might be in our congregations, a topic which again shows us the strong interaction between theology and ethics, and returns us to the ethical implications of our theological language more generally.</p>
<p>There is also, of course, a need for those religious writers – not just feminists – who are producing new liturgies and theologies to support each other in discussing and considering these issues, and how best to learn from other religious traditions without using their language and practices in ways which are insulting or harmful. When borrowing language for liturgy and theology, careful thought is required – although this should not come as a surprise since careful thought should be given to all language used for theology and liturgy. These areas of discourse are so socially powerful within religious communities that they deserve attention.</p>
<p>With principles like these in mind, judgements can perhaps be formed about the ethical implications in specific cases. It will never, however, be possible to make a blanket judgement and to say that all use of religious language and practice from another religious tradition is right – or that it is always wrong.</p>
