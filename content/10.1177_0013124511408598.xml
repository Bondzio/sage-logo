<abstract>
<p>This replication study represents an analysis of 47 exit portfolios of students enrolled in an urban teacher education program. Portfolios were analyzed to determine the degree to which students integrated concepts related to teaching in urban schools: asset/deficit perspectives, connections with families, social justice, high expectations for student learning, and contextualized teaching and learning. The portfolios fall into three groups along a continuum from “awareness” to “trying things out” to “making it their own.” With 30%, 51%, and 19% falling into each group respectively, the data are interpreted in relationship to faculty development and the challenges of scaffolding preservice teachers.</p>

<p>Portfolios are used for multiple purposes across the professional lives of teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124511408598">Wray, 2008</xref>). As portfolio use has become firmly embedded in the landscape of teacher education, evidence related to these multiple purposes is growing. Preservice teachers may create developmental portfolios to assist them with connecting concepts and practice as they work through their programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124511408598">Barton &amp; Collins, 1993</xref>), certification portfolios are used to meet state standards in both university based or non–university-based programs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124511408598">Pechone, Pigg, Chung, &amp; Souviney, 2005</xref>), and exit portfolios are created to demonstrate students’ overall accomplishments and to enable prospective employers to see samples of their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013124511408598">Anderson &amp; DeMeulle, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124511408598">Wray, 2008</xref>). The importance of developing the habit of mind necessary to produce a portfolio early in a teaching career is highlighted by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124511408598">National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (2010)</xref> portfolio requirements. In addition to these purposes, on a practical level portfolios, and particularly electronic portfolios, also enable education programs to more easily meet the reporting requirements for teacher education program approval at the state level and voluntary accreditation at the national level, for example, the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013124511408598">Bartell, Kaye, &amp; Morin, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Although not always defined as such, portfolios serve an important function in representing evidence for helping faculty understand the quality and effectiveness of their own programmatic work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013124511408598">Anderson &amp; DeMeulle, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013124511408598">Breault, 2004</xref>) as well as creating a structure for providing feedback to students. Electronic portfolio formats further enable faculty to share feedback and to consider students’ responses to feedback as an essential part of their professional development. The NCATE standards, for example, have created an expectation that teacher educators will routinely consider the assessments their students complete, which include portfolio performances, as a major data source for improving program effectiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124511408598">NCATE, 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, in their study of the portfolio culture in three elementary teacher education programs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124511408598">Delandshere and Arens (2003)</xref> observed what they referred to as a distorted, compliance-only approach to standards-based assessment rather than an approach that engaged faculty in critically analyzing the quality of their own teacher education practice across an entire preservice program. The potential of portfolios has yet to be fully realized.</p>
<p>Early research on portfolios in teacher education tended to focus on students’ experiences with and perceptions about the process of portfolio development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124511408598">Grossman, 2005</xref>) rather than on a systematic understanding of the evidence they contain, limiting our understanding of their value. With their continued use, however, the focus of research has shifted to emphasize portfolios as sites for student reflection. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124511408598">Orland-Barak (2005)</xref> found that mentor teachers’ reflective writing was predominantly of a descriptive, “behavioral” nature that lacked in-depth self-criticism and critical reflection. Her results revealed that this was true for both types of portfolios—“process portfolios” and “product portfolios”—despite their differences in purpose and content. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013124511408598">Mansvelder-Longayroux, Beijaard, and Verloop (2007)</xref> reported similar findings in their examination of the nature of reflection found in student teachers’ portfolios. These student teachers focused on reporting their own practice and how to improve it while making less use of the portfolio to gain a better understanding of situations and developments that had occurred, which the authors viewed as an absence of “critical processing.” So although early on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013124511408598">Zeichner and Wray (2001)</xref> identified portfolios as a potential source of ongoing reflection that can help challenge students’ perspectives on critical issues related to race, class, and culture and assist in their development as teachers who practice culturally responsive pedagogy, whether portfolios are working to develop such critical reflection has not yet been definitively established. Studies that address the preparation of teachers for working with diverse student populations—whether specifically in urban teacher education programs or not—tend to reflect self-report data based on a single preservice course or clinical experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013124511408598">Cochran-Smith, Davis, &amp; Fries, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124511408598">Hollins &amp; Guzman, 2005</xref>) rather than providing information about developmental expectations or programmatic contexts in which the studies took place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124511408598">Hollins &amp; Guzman, 2005</xref>). Although preparing a committed force of teachers for the nation’s schools, and particularly its urban schools, continues to be a nationwide problem of equity and social justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013124511408598">Darling-Hammond, 2006</xref>), the literature on portfolios has not typically addressed this challenge.</p>
<p>An exception is a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124511408598">Marquez-Zenkov, Corrigan, Brockett, and Lehrian (2008)</xref>, in which portfolio artifacts and reflections were analyzed to explore the relevance of that program’s social justice outcome to graduates’ current teaching. They found that preservice teachers’ understandings crossed settings and evolved during their time in the program as evidenced in their portfolios. Using survey data, the researchers also found evidence that graduates were making efforts to include teaching for social justice and identified supports for and impediments to social justice teaching.</p>
<p>Looking across portfolios for evidence of candidates’ understandings of equity and diversity remains a critical area for research and stands in opposition to the compliance only approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124511408598">Delandshere and Arens (2003)</xref> questioned. When portfolios are highly prescriptive and decontextualized from practice, students may be required to present only a single, isolated assessment of their ability to work effectively with a diverse group of students (i.e., meeting INTASC Principle #3), perhaps represented by a single class assignment in a “diversity” or “multicultural education” class. This approach both fails to consider a student’s stance across his or her practice and seems to contribute to the programmatic pitfall of having “diversity” be the responsibility of one course or one course instructor rather than a cumulative development of teaching practice.</p>
<p>The study reported here replicates an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013124511408598">Pugach, Longwell-Grice, Ford, &amp; Surma, 2008</xref>) whose purpose was to analyze, from a holistic perspective, how preservice candidates enrolled in an urban teacher education program addressed issues of race, class, culture, and language in the context of urban schools across several major portfolio entries. Specifically, the analysis sought to determine whether the trends observed in the initial study, which included 15 portfolios completed by students who volunteered for the study, held true for a larger sample of 47 portfolios from the same teacher education program representing all students in that semester who successfully completed the program. Therefore, it has the potential to contribute directly to a broader understanding of the types of evidence from teaching practice contained in portfolios. Equally important, it contributes to the discourse regarding how faculty can be assisted in critically analyzing their collective efforts across a teacher education program as represented by the contents of portfolios and how those efforts are or are not contributing to students’ learning in relationship to issues of equity that are so central to the preparation of all teachers, but particularly for urban teaching and learning. Through such an analysis, faculty members can begin to ask questions about where the program has been more or less successful in scaffolding their students’ growth as teachers who are committed and equipped to work successfully with students in urban schools.</p>
<p>Specifically, the study focused on the following two questions about how preservice teachers addressed diversity and equity in their portfolios:</p>

</list>
<sec id="section1-0013124511408598" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This study represents an analysis of the standards-based artifacts and rationales of 47 exit portfolios of preservice students who are preparing to teach pupils aged 6 to 13. These students were all enrolled in the “Elementary-Middle School Program” at the “university,” a multipurpose urban university with a longstanding commitment to the preparation of teachers for urban schools. Portfolios were developed in the spring of 2007 as the students were completing their student teaching semester.</p>
<sec id="section2-0013124511408598">
<title>Program Context</title>
<p>University’s urban mission for all educator preparation programs is evidenced not only in longstanding practice (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124511408598">Boyer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013124511408598">Post, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124511408598">Post, Pugach, Harris, &amp; Hedges, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124511408598">Pugach, Longwell-Grice, &amp; Ford, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013124511408598">Pugach, Post, Anderson, Lehmann, &amp; Donder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013124511408598">Pugach, Post, &amp; Thurman, 2006</xref>) but also in its unique interpretation of the ten (State) teacher standards (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0013124511408598">Appendix 1</xref>), which are patterned after the national INTASC standards. Guided by an overarching core guiding principle that emphasizes and clarifies the institution’s urban mission, this local interpretation was developed due to the faculty’s belief that the INTASC standards did not adequately address issues related to teaching in an urban context. In addition, it was believed that this interpretation might better focus preservice students’ thinking about what uniquely characterizes teaching in urban schools. Program coherence based on this shared mission is fostered through several features of the Elementary-Middle School Program, which are described in the pilot study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013124511408598">Pugach et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>During each of their four professional semesters in the program, students are assigned to a different clinical experience site in the City Public Schools (CPS) to ensure experience across the full age range of their certification prior to student teaching. In the first three professional semesters preservice teachers develop working portfolios emphasizing the various standards that are foregrounded each semester. To undergird the urban focus of the program and its core guiding principle, preservice teachers prepare a portfolio entry on urban teaching/equity each semester. In the final semester, concurrent with a full-time, 20-week student teaching experience required by the state candidates complete their final seminar, which, among other purposes, supports them in developing their culminating exit portfolios.</p>
<p>This final portfolio is designed to reflect development across all 10 standards as evidenced in practice during student teaching; some standards are paired resulting in a total of seven portfolio entries. Unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124511408598">Delandshere and Arens’ (2003)</xref> findings that portfolio artifacts were rarely explained and entries rarely included discussions of why artifacts were selected or how artifacts/entries relate to one another, portfolio entries in the Elementary-Middle School Program are organized in the form of an artifact representing candidates’ practice related to that standard accompanied by a rationale. Candidates are given substantial latitude in terms of selecting artifacts and deciding those that best represent each standard. The only requirements are that (a) one artifact must represent their literacy teaching, (b) one artifact must be a required integrated unit, and (c) the required log of contacts (phone or in-person) with every pupil’s family over the course of the semester cannot be used in isolation as an artifact. Each rationale includes a discussion of how this artifact relates to the other standards as well as to the core guiding principle of urban education and equity. Therefore, evidence of a commitment to urban teaching, equity, and diversity is meant to be visible throughout their portfolios and not solely in a single entry devoted to the standard on diversity (INTASC and State Teacher Standard #3).</p>

<sec id="section3-0013124511408598">
<title>Data Sources and Analysis</title>
<p>The intent of this study was to analyze each portfolio with regard to how the student portrays her or his teaching practice in terms of diversity and equity across the portfolio. In the original study, the analytic matrix included four levels of ratings, which were collapsed in the final analysis into three categories. For the replication study, the use of three categories was retained using slightly different categorical headings. All standards-based portfolio entries were then analyzed using the modified matrix (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0013124511408598">Appendix 2</xref>) based on five specific concepts related to diversity and equity and three levels of ratings. The five concepts were chosen because of the emphasis placed on them in the program as viewed by its faculty leaders, as well as their presence in program documents, standards, rubrics, and topics in weekly seminars. The five central concepts are as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-0013124511408598" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Asset/deficit perspective</italic>: Whether prospective teachers value and respect their students’ and families’ experiences and funds of knowledge and whether preconceived notions interfere with valuing such cultural and/or community knowledge.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Connecting with families</italic>: Whether or not prospective teachers make a genuine effort to communicate with the families of their students, not for the purpose of complying with the program’s mandates but for the purpose of learning about their students’ families to enrich the curriculum and foster student learning.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Social justice</italic>: Whether or not prospective teachers are fully aware of existing social inequities and utilize a social justice lens to think about, carry out, and reflect on their daily teaching practice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>High expectations</italic>: Whether or not prospective teachers believe urban children and youth can achieve high academic standards as evidenced by a challenging, demanding, and relevant curriculum that promotes student learning and higher-order thinking.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Contextualizing teaching and learning</italic>: Whether or not prospective teachers draw on knowledge of their students, their students’ families, and their students’ communities and embed their curriculum with such understandings. This includes the concept of funds of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013124511408598">Gonzalez, Moll, &amp; Amanti, 2005</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>After assessing the portfolio for the five concepts, a holistic rating was assigned reflecting the overall weight of the evidence across the portfolio entries. Portfolios were rated according to the three levels as follows. The terminology adopted for this study appears first followed in parentheses followed by terminology used in the original study:</p>
<list id="list3-0013124511408598" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Making it your own (principled practice)</italic>: Students took risks to integrate principles of diversity and equity into their practice consistently across artifacts; they reflected critically and analytically related to the core guiding principle. These student teachers appear to have internalized issues of equity and diversity into their practice in an un–self-conscious manner; their portfolio entries were internally consistent across entries.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Trying things out (mixed practice)</italic>: Students took risks to integrate principles of diversity and equity into their practice but did not see the full potential of the experience; they reshaped the curriculum in the context of the students and their lives but did not do so consistently; they missed some opportunities for integration, more reflection, and especially critical reflection, necessary.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Awareness (limited practice)</italic>: Students provided a surface mention of diversity and equity only, often only when prompted by the format of the rationale, and consistently missed opportunities to address these issues in practice. Students in this category did not view the curriculum in terms of either its social justice potential or its potential to contextualize teaching and learning within their own students’ lives, their cultures, or their communities.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>All four authors are faculty members who have teaching and/or program responsibilities in the Elementary-Middle School Program. None of the study’s authors were seminar instructors in the semester in which portfolios were completed and were also not responsible for grading the portfolios. Feedback provided to students by the instructors was not seen by the researchers and was not part of the study. Agreements with the Institutional Review Board mandated that portfolios were photocopied only after grades were submitted for the semester, that students’ names were removed, and that each portfolio was coded numerically.</p>
<p>Authors of the replication study included three of the original study’s authors and one new author. The guidelines established for reading the portfolios were to read each one through taking notes on each entry, as it related to any of the five concepts and placing those notes in one of the cells under what the reader deemed to be the appropriate categorical rating. In addition, each reader prepared a brief summary statement on the candidate’s overall attention to diversity across race, class, culture, language, and ability. Then each reader rated the portfolio holistically, paying attention to the weight of the evidence across concepts and cells and examples from various portfolio entries to support the decision.</p>
<p>In order to assure consistency of ratings, all four authors initially read the same four portfolios, took notes for each portfolio using the matrix, provided a rating, and met together discuss their ratings. This enabled the team to gain a consistent definition of the categories. Agreements were easily reached on what constituted “making it your own,” but a great deal of discussion took place regarding how to differentiate consistently between trying things out (mixed practice) and awareness (limited practice). These discussions focused on what it meant for student teachers to miss opportunities to apply a lens of urban teaching and equity to their practice; what it meant to hold high expectations as exemplified in the curriculum but without mention of issues of diversity and equity, save in the prompted final paragraph of the rationale; and whether an absence of attention to any of the five concepts that anchored the analysis constituted a “deal breaker” in terms of the categorical rating. A special concern existed around the relatively sparse mention of families across the portfolios, especially because every student teacher had the experience of calling or meeting family members and keeping a log of these contacts.</p>
<p>Following this, teams of two authors read five portfolios each and met as teams to discuss ratings and reconcile any differences. Teams then exchanged partners to read an additional group of five portfolios each. After each set of 10 portfolios was read, we met as a full research team to discuss our emerging understandings of the issues that were arising. One issue that surfaced was that a larger group of portfolios seemed to be falling into the middle category than in the original study. At this halfway mark we also noted the generally higher quality of the portfolios as a group compared to the original study. We took notes at these meetings, which became, in a sense, informal memos to guide our thinking as we approached the next set of portfolios and to document issues for further discussion as the analysis was completed. To complete the data analysis phase, we regrouped into sets of 2 researchers to read 5 or 6 portfolios each until all 47 were completed. By the end of the analysis, each team member had worked with every other team member at least once. Once all ratings were completed, they were entered into a common table.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>These 47 portfolios reviewed revealed great variation in the students’ abilities to represent familiarity with language related to urban teaching, equity, and diversity. Nine portfolios (19%) were rated as representing practice that was consistently principled. The raters had some level of confidence that these candidates would continue the positive practices represented in their portfolio on their own. Twenty-four portfolios (51%) were rated as taking some risks and “trying things out,” but students were not thinking critically about the potential the learning held in relationship to the five central concepts. The fourteen remaining portfolios (30%) were rated as representing limited practice and revealed an “awareness” level of understanding of issues emphasized by the program related to urban teaching and learning. Examples of portfolios from each level follow.</p>
<sec id="section5-0013124511408598">
<title>Making It Your Own: Consistent Understanding and Practice</title>
<p>Nine of 47 candidates (19%) had portfolios that received the holistic rating “making it your own.” This was the most advanced rating and the one, as previously mentioned, associated with the ability of the preservice teacher to consistently integrate principles of diversity and equity into their practice. This ability represented a certain amount of risk taking, but it did not seem forced. It was not only seen as a program expectation, appearing when prompted by the description of the portfolio assignment, but rather as a part of their ongoing professional practice. The “making it your own” candidate was able to reflect critically and analytically about issues of equity and diversity. Reflections revealed an honesty and openness about the richness and challenges of urban teaching and captured a level of persistence that convinced the readers that this principled practice could be sustained independently in the years beyond the final student teaching experience.</p>
<p>Thalia’s (all names are pseudonyms) portfolio serves as a representative example of students rated in the “making it your own” category. This candidate drew from her student teaching experiences in a third-grade classroom in the CPS. She showed unconditional respect for her students’ backgrounds and experiences and routinely drew upon their strengths when strategically assigning groups, designing projects and lessons, and scaffolding instruction to ensure that struggling students could achieve at the high levels she expected of the overall class. One of the ways she scaffolded instruction was to make strong connections with her students’ lives, and to use their background knowledge, including their misconceptions, to develop a responsive teaching environment. In the first example below, she discusses a word study lesson that was a “re-do from a lesson that had gone bad.” [sic] After including content that was more connected to students’ lives and providing some modeling, she discussed the effects on several students’ performances, including Shaina:<disp-quote>
<p>I have included a sample from the first lesson which reflects the struggles my students had during this lesson. I have then included a sample of the work after the lesson was modified. When you compare the samples, you can see how the changes I made to the lesson plan by making it more relevant to their lives resulted in higher learning. Shaina’s student samples show that during the first lesson she was unable to find one word that would appropriately fit in each box. After my modification to the lesson plan, Shaina was able to come up with at least two words that would be appropriate for each box. These modifications allowed Shaina to double her word list for each example.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In another lesson, Thalia discussed how she encountered student misconceptions during a social studies unit on the development of the local urban city. The class was examining the groups of people who migrated to city. As students worked in groups, she heard comments from students that were incorrect and conveyed stereotypes. Not only did she see the importance of this as a teaching opportunity (indeed, she built in additional lessons on the city’s diversity and the contributions made by the various racial and ethnic groups) but she discussed her personal growth and risk taking with regard to addressing social biases and inequities:<disp-quote>
<p>During this activity, I encountered many misconceptions that many students had about certain groups of people. I facilitated a group discussion on how these misconceptions come about and how to change these thoughts. … This eventually became one of my favorite lessons throughout the semester. Though I had to have discussions about stereotypes and misconceptions, which I was somewhat uneasy about at first, I was able to provide my students with new knowledge that would change their thinking forever.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This portfolio contained artifact after artifact that revealed Thalia’s use of a challenging and relevant curriculum. As mentioned, she appeared particularly sensitive to students who needed more tailored assistance. She did not approach such students from a deficit perspective; rather, she thought carefully about what they brought to the lesson that could be used to advance their learning. She mentions Erica, a student whose struggles in reading and math led to a referral for special education services—a referral process that was already underway when she began her placement.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I saw that Erica had a strong interest in word games and hands-on activities. Over the next several weeks, I began developing word games that would allow Erica some hands-on work that would be engaging and motivating. I invited Erica to eat lunch with me, and I showed her all of the activities that I had planned for her to take part in spelling and phonics. … For the first time I saw Erica have a true desire to learn. Previously, it was difficult to get Erica to produce anything on paper. She spent much of the day sitting at her desk drawing or coloring. After Erica would complete a session, she would come right over to me and say, “Look at what I did. I have even more words than I did yesterday.” There was a sense of pride in her voice and self-confidence that I had never seen before.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This portfolio demonstrated that even with the constraints of a semester-long student teaching assignment, it was possible to develop meaningful connections with families and the community. Thalia reached out to individual families as opportunities arose. For example, with Erica (the student mentioned above), she established regular communication with Erica’s mother and modified homework demands to achieve a more successful pattern of homework completion.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I had open communication with Erica’s mother throughout the semester, discussing her needs at the beginning and her gains throughout the year. Her mother was apprehensive in the beginning, but I felt that my caring approach to our conversations helped ease her mind and let her know that my main goal was the success of her daughter. … I took time to learn about her family and provided support for her educational needs at home. Erica’s mother is a single mom of three. She works two jobs and expressed the fact that there isn’t much time to help Erica with homework.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The other portfolios rated in this “making it your own” category were equally invested in drawing on student background information to design relevant and engaging lessons. Like Thalia’s portfolio, the curriculum reflected in the portfolios was rigorous and the reflections showed a real concern about student learning. The portfolios in this category went beyond revealing a reasonably strong repertoire of teaching ability—they communicated well-integrated and conscious efforts to learn about families and communities and to address diversity and social inequities.</p>

<title>Trying Things Out</title>
<p>Twenty-four portfolios (51%) were rated in this category. As mentioned, “trying things out” meant that the candidate took risks to integrate principles of diversity and equity into their practice but did not make use of the full potential of the experience. They may have reshaped the curriculum in the context of the students and their lives but did not do so consistently and missed some opportunities for integration. Oftentimes more reflection, and especially critical reflection, was needed. The following two descriptions are representative of the group of portfolios in this category.</p>
<sec id="section7-0013124511408598">
<title>Unrealized potential</title>
<p>Ford’s portfolio demonstrates strength in its artifacts, but the lack of critical reflection on teaching practice related to issues of teaching and learning in an urban setting. This lack of reflection meant that Ford’s portfolio included many instances of unrealized potential to connect his teaching to issues central to urban teaching and learning. For example, his portfolio showed high expectations for students’ learning across artifacts as represented in several learning experiences on the properties of light. Ford developed several experiment centers that the students rotated through, maintained an observation notebook on the results of each center, and finished with a whole class lesson that brought together the results of all of the small-group experiments in order to build an understanding of the properties of light. A second example described a fossil fuel unit. Ford used scientific language as information related to fossil fuels was introduced. The artifact describes a process of scaffolding the fifth graders in research skills, moving from modeling to independent work and including reteaching when it was evident the students were struggling with the idea of summarizing. The artifact reveals the use of formative assessments and daily observations to guide future instruction, assuring that all students will succeed.</p>
<p>Ford’s portfolio also included examples of “trying things out” regarding issues of social justice. It is not clear from the artifacts and reflections that critical thinking about social justice issues permeated the teaching philosophy, but some efforts were made to move in that direction. One example of this was presented in the integrated unit on fossil fuels, in which he asked students to write a persuasive letter to their school administrator encouraging her to change school practices to conserve fossil fuels. In this way Ford asked students to write for an authentic audience from an advocacy perspective to bring together all of their learning over the course of the unit. These letters did in fact lead to at least one change in school practice. Although the researchers recognized the social justice potential in this learning experience, the preservice teacher did not address it in the rationale for the artifact, further confirming that the preservice teacher is “trying things out” without reflecting critically with an eye toward the central concepts focused on teaching and learning in an urban context emphasized in the program.</p>
<p>A math lesson served as a positive model for contextualized teaching and learning. The lesson involved a local restaurant frequented by many of the students in the classroom and serves as an exemplary model for contextualizing teaching and learning. Ford asked the owners to track the number and types of pizzas sold in their restaurant over the course of 2 days. Those raw data became the source of information used in math lessons on ways to represent data and data analysis. The resulting work completed by the students went back to the business owner for display. Reflecting on the experience, Ford commented,<disp-quote>
<p>Students really looked deeper into the data and discussed why buying pineapple would be something that would be ordered much less often than pepperoni or sausage. While I enjoyed getting a business involved that I was comfortable and excited to work with, in the future I feel like I will be more likely to challenge myself to reach out to a new part of the community to bring in and learn with my students.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this instance, Ford not only tried things out but also reflected on the experience in such a way that led the reviewers to believe with some confidence that he will continue to connect directly with the community in which the school is located in the future. This level of confidence was not evident for all of the concepts, however. Specifically he did not have strong evidence to support the role of families in teaching and learning in an urban setting, nor was there a strong asset perspective demonstrated across the portfolio.</p>
<p>Ford is taking some risks across the issues that are central to this study. However, the lack of critical reflection on the experiences that would lead to connections between these experiences and their potential to develop more fully along the concepts identified as essential to urban teaching and learning resulted in a rating of “trying things out.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0013124511408598">
<title>Lack of balance</title>
<p>Lacey’s portfolio was also categorized as “trying things out.” This portfolio was characterized by ongoing attention to issues of social justice, but that did not exemplify high expectations in terms of the curriculum itself. This lack of balance accounted for the rating the portfolio received.</p>
<p>Regarding social justice, Lacey, who was teaching in a third grade classroom, implemented a debate on “whether the United States should allow people to speak more than one language,” conducted a biography unit in which students graphed and discussed why there were disproportionately more biographies about Caucasian persons in comparison to persons of color, and emphasized building a strong classroom community using cooperative groups in which students felt safe holding discussions about issues of race, class, culture, and language. About the debate on language the candidate wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>The debate drew a lot of attention to the language that some of the students and their families speak at home. During the debate the students were allowed to discuss this topic in a safe environment without worrying about being teased. This lesson brought attention to the benefits of having multiple languages in a classroom and the assets that come from diversity.</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p>The students in my classroom can see how knowing more than one language affects their classmates. Some of my students have family members that speak Spanish and some of them have had to learn English as students. Many of my students may have heard about this issue in the news or at home. However, the students may not have heard both sides of the story before forming opinions of their own.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To address the emphasis on the community in which the school is located, Lacey organized a field trip to a local nursing home to help students gain intergenerational knowledge. Students not only heard stories about the seniors they visited but also developed relationships by talking with them, playing cards, or listening to them sing. Of the trip Lacey said:<disp-quote>
<p>Instead of reading about the people in a community I wanted the students to meet people in their own community. A textbook community is alright, but real experiences with real people in a community will help the students remember what they have learned more than if they had just read about them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lacey also emphasized creating a functioning classroom community by describing several instances of cooperative grouping. Arguing for the importance of groups, she discussed the relationship between functioning cooperative groups and her ability to implement projects and experiments in the classroom because the groups had been developed over time and were functioning well. She also believed that when challenging topics came up in class, the fact that the groups had helped build a community led to a more positive environment for having these discussions.</p>
<p>However, Lacey did not provide a cogent example of a particular lesson where cooperative grouping was effective. Several instances were presented generally and they appeared credible, but none was accompanied by data to suggest the students had learned either in a group or individually from their group experience. One example was an invention groups worked on “to make the world a better place.” However, this invention was not tied, at least as presented in the portfolio, with any lesson or unit, nor were any specific data offered about the groups’ results.</p>
<p>Although Lacey genuinely appeared to be introducing topics related to social justice and worked toward taking on opportunities to integrate these issues into her teaching, the depth of curriculum related to these instances was not characterized by high expectations or rigor. For example, the artifact for the debate on languages was part of a larger social studies unit about “the different people of a community,” but no detail was supplied about the purpose of the unit or the standards the unit was designed to meet, and more important, how the debate addressed and contributed to the overall goals of the unit. Instead, the debate was presented essentially as a stand-alone activity. Therefore, though Lacey certainly was taking some risks in terms of raising a controversial and important issue (especially locally, where many students have a first language other than English, or live in families where parents’ first language is not English or who have not yet mastered English), the connection to a larger curricular purpose was not established. This led the readers to wonder whether issues of social justice as represented in the debate were integrated or functioned only as an add-on to the curriculum.</p>
<p>Lacey also taught an integrated unit on biography. This was presented both as a reading unit and an integrated unit, suggesting the candidate’s conception of an integrated unit needed strengthening. The candidate did connect the biography genre unit to other content areas, but these connections were uneven and sometimes problematic. In science, for example, students completed an experiment on airplanes that was related to the Wright Brothers. No credible explanation for this choice was presented. They also mapped the locations the persons in the biographies came from and graphed the race/ethnicity of the persons whose biographies they read against a graph of the race/ethnicity of the class. But given these data, the candidate described the follow-up only “as a mature discussion” without any detail to define what that meant. The unit appeared to be a loosely linked collection of activities instead of activities emerging from a sound unit-level plan leading to strong identified outcomes.</p>
<p>A final critique of this portfolio related to an artifact on multiple methods for assessing student knowledge. For a project on immigration, Lacey used a test on topics directly related to immigration but included an additional assessment project that seemed to represent a focus on cultural practices such as foods and the arts. A clear definition of the purpose of these various assessments, how they related to one another, and how they were related to the project’s curricular goals was not evident.</p>
<p>In summary, Lacey clearly was trying out a variety of ways to integrate issues of equity and social justice into the curriculum. This integration was not apparent only in the rationales the candidate offered but appeared in her practice as represented by the artifacts. But the lack of curricular depth signaled problems in the area of high expectations that resulted in a rating of “trying things out.”</p>

<sec id="section9-0013124511408598">
<title>Awareness</title>
<p>The 14 portfolios (30%) in this category represent those students who did not demonstrate their abilities to make connections across multiple dimensions of urban teaching and learning. These student teachers could not connect curriculum to standards, could not connect work at the university to work in their public school classrooms, or could not connect the their classroom practice to the lives of their students and families. They failed to see the potential in their students, in the curriculum or in themselves to explore social justice issues. They did not set high expectations for their work, used more traditional approaches to teaching, and appeared to teach to a perceived lowest common denominator in terms of their students’ potential. They might have used words or concepts they had heard in the program (e.g., high expectations), but they were unable to provide defensible artifacts for their claims or their use of terminology was inaccurate.</p>
<p>Fran’s portfolio from a fourth-grade classroom demonstrates these gaps. When describing her pupils as part of her integrated unit artifact she wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>My classroom consists of twenty-seven fourth-grade students and students range in age of nine to ten years old. Reading levels range from 2.1 to 5.2. Ninety percent of my students receive free or reduced breakfast and lunch. There are five students who receive extra support from a specialist.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We never learned much more about her students from the portfolio, nor did we learn a lot about the student teacher herself. Much of the writing in her rationales spoke to “a teacher could or should …” or “As a teacher it is your responsibility to …” That is, though Fran did use first-person pronouns, she most often spoke about a generic teacher or group of teachers, so it was difficult to know what the student herself had done specifically or was thinking specifically.</p>
<p>Among the artifacts, Fran included a human body systems unit, a geometry unit, a unit developing a classroom economy, and three examples of field trips. The lesson plans and/or assessments appeared engaging and full of activities but were light on curricular content or substance and also consistently absent of social justice.</p>
<p>As an example, Fran’s economics unit included multiple opportunities for engaging students in challenging work with a social justice focus. Her economics artifact included an application for employment, a computer-based worksheet, a worksheet on writing a check, a written response to the question, and a worksheet on what students learned from a guest speaker. The economics unit started as a response to classroom management issues and as she wrote, “The purpose of this classroom economy system was to teach children real skills that will help them for the rest of their lives.” Students filled out applications to apply for classroom jobs, which were basically maintenance tasks in the classroom. Given the context of the classroom in a rust-belt city and the demographics of students on free or reduced lunch, one could question how the “jobs” replicated rather than critiqued the status of people living in poverty. The computer-based worksheet asked about the printing, distribution, and use of money. One question on the worksheet asked, “Which presidents are on the following bills? US$1, US$20, US$100.” The students were not asked to think about how a change of number increased the value of pieces of paper that were similar visually or what a society says through the pictures it chooses to place on money. Another set of questions asked: “Do you save your money? If you do, what are you saving up for? Do you spend your money? If you do, what kinds of things do you buy?” Students were not asked to consider, for example, the forces that encourage them to spend or save and who in the society has more options to do either. Another worksheet was entitled “Understanding Checking Accounts.” The understanding was limited to parts of a check and what a checking account is. Fees related to the use of checks or comparisons among checking accounts or how banks can benefit from both were not discussed. Again, all of the activities have the potential to engage and empower students. However, Fran did not demonstrate how the students were held to any standards for quality in their work, how they used the learning in other settings, or how it connected to the students themselves. As indicated earlier, many opportunities for implementing a social justice approach to curriculum were missed.</p>
<p>A unit on the book <italic>Bud, Not Buddy</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013124511408598">Christopher Paul Curtis (1999)</xref> represented two entries in her portfolio. One of these entries and rationale demonstrated how the student teacher missed opportunities to contextualize teaching and learning. Grounding the rationale in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the student wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>As a teacher, it is your responsibility to teach children about different cultures. Students will feel like they belong in the classroom if their different cultures are celebrated rather than kept at the students’ homes, one way to do this to have the children share their cultures and customs with the class. Most importantly, teachers need to make sure that the students must have their basic needs taken care of and understand of this s not done; learning will be much more difficult and in some cases impossible. [errors were in original text]</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Taking Fran at what might be her best intentions, we want to assume that the student teacher will encourage students to bring their culture and their lives into the classroom in authentic ways to promote learning and feelings of belonging. However, her artifact was a lesson plan and a series of letters written from the perspective of the characters in the book. The plan did not indicate discussion about text-to-life connections, nor did the letters.</p>
<p>Fran’s portfolio was a clear example of a portfolio at the “awareness” level. She struggled to represent her work in real ways due to the weak array of work samples from which to select. This pattern was evident across the portfolios in the “awareness” category. The readers were not confident that the individuals in this category would be able to go into urban classrooms and engage in the type of teaching that would connect with pupils or create the type of curriculum that would challenge the pupils.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This replication study describes the range of representations of urban teaching, diversity, and equity issues in 47 student portfolios. The “making it your own” group consistently selected artifacts that were strong examples of teaching and learning in urban classrooms and could represent the strengths and weaknesses of each in their reflections from a critical perspective. The “trying things out” portfolios seemed to do one or the other well; that is, either the artifacts were not consistently strong or the rationales did not capture critical reflection on the work. In some cases, the artifacts did indeed hold relevance to the five central concepts, but the student teachers did not mention these issues and/or connections in their analysis of the teaching experience. In the “awareness” category, the student teachers did not have strong examples from their teaching practice to write well about. Student teachers’ ability to reflect critically on the work being planned and implemented appears to be a critical determining factor in the development of these preservice teachers in relation to the five central concepts emphasized in the urban teaching program in which they were enrolled.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this study provides evidence regarding the importance of conducting systematic and holistic analyses of student portfolios as a means of contributing to and raising questions about program improvement, specifically as it relates to preparing new teachers for urban schools. It continues our efforts to lay the groundwork for and inform a move toward a more empirically based understanding of portfolio use in teacher education. Specifically, we want to discuss how this study compares with the first and how an urban teacher education program makes sense of how its graduates address diversity and equity issues at the various levels represented in these portfolios.</p>
<sec id="section11-0013124511408598">
<title>Question 1</title>
<p><italic>Do the representations observed in the initial exploratory study hold true in the larger context of all graduates from one semester?</italic> The pattern in the first study had one third of the portfolios falling into each category. This exact pattern was not replicated in the second study. The results of this study indicate that a similar percentage fell into the “awareness” level (14% or 30%), but a larger percentage fell into the “trying things out” level (24% or 51%), and a smaller percentage fell into the “making it your own” level (9% or 19%). One possible explanation for the higher ratings of the portfolios in the initial study is that the first set of portfolios was submitted by student teachers on a voluntary basis. We assume that the individuals who participated might have felt strongly about their portfolios. The second set of portfolios represented every candidate who completed the program that semester.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0013124511408598">
<title>Question 2</title>
<p><italic>How should a teacher education program with an urban mission interpret the results of candidate portfolios rated at the various levels of a continuum (“awareness” vs. “trying things out” vs. “making it your own”)?</italic> Of particular interest is why fewer students seem to make the step to the “making it your own” category. Is it the case that developing the skills to be the urban educator the program desires takes longer than the four semesters that preservice teachers have in the program? Developing teaching skills is a complex process. Adding the complexity of teaching in urban contexts to the already complex task of becoming a teacher may be more than most students can achieve and/or represent in the portfolio. Other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013124511408598">Mansvelder-Longayroux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124511408598">Orland-Barak, 2005</xref>) have suggested that developing the reflective skills necessary to create strong portfolios that truly represent one’s work is labor and time intensive. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0013124511408598">Lyons (1998)</xref> suggests that some students are “natural reflectors” who complete the work with an ability that other student teachers may not possess. Is it the case that the portfolios in the top category were written by the “natural reflectors” in the program?</p>
<p>Portfolios classified in the “trying things out” category, the largest and most widely varied group, warrant further examination. If portfolio analysis is to influence programmatic work in any significant way, this group of portfolios must be unpacked for the potential they hold in informing the preparation to perform in urban contexts in relation to the five central concepts. For example, what does it mean to have primarily interesting, challenging curriculum but curriculum that nevertheless does not consistently take advantage of the opportunity to connect to issues of equity and diversity? If portfolio reflections suggest a relative absence of a critical framework, to what degree can this critical view be supported and scaffolded? How do we help prospective teachers move beyond a general appreciation for a critical framework to routinely embedding such a framework in practice, and is this possible? Is such a general appreciation indicative of a student who can even be scaffolded in this regard, or is this evidence of a more subtle form of resistance to addressing issues from a critical perspective?</p>
<p>What accounts for the number of portfolios in the “awareness” category? For the purposes of this study, we narrowed our focus from the exit portfolio rubric in use to focus in more depth on the five categories that framed the analysis: asset/deficit perspectives, connecting with families, social justice, high expectations for student learning, contextualized teaching and learning. Did this fact affect the readers’ interpretation of the evidence provided by the preservice teachers? Because of the emphasis placed on the issues related in the rubric utilized in this study, the finding suggests that program faculty may need to reconsider the structure, type, and quality of feedback provided to students and consider how students use the feedback that they receive earlier in the program to support their development as authors of portfolios in an urban teacher preparation program. Would it be better, for example, for us to prompt our students’ analyses based on responses to prior feedback rather than to the core guiding principle itself? How students use the feedback they receive in prior semesters, specifically with regard to the five concepts related to urban teaching and learning emphasized in this analysis, seems to be an important focus of program improvement in both the middle and low categories of ratings used in this study.</p>
<p>As the research team met, several additional issues surfaced related to the analytical tool itself. The first centers on the concept of social justice. The authors identified examples of student teachers who talked about instructional decisions being made through a social justice framework but who did not draw the students’ attention to the social justice implications of the learning experience they were describing. In other words, though issues related social justice were present in the rationale, they were not foregrounded in the preservice teachers’ practice. For example, when talking about planning to meet the needs of all learners and describing specific strategies implemented to do so, one student teacher reflected on this in relation to equity and social justice but did not plan learning experiences that led to students becoming aware of social justice issues. We were left to wonder how such a limited social justice lens would effectively carry out into a preservice teachers’ practice over time and independently. Furthermore, such a consideration may lead to a refinement of the description of the concept of social justice as applied in this study and in the preservice program itself.</p>
<p>A second issue focused on the distinction between contextualizing teaching and learning and incorporating student interests in the planning of units of study and individual lessons. Is it enough for a student teacher to survey students to learn about hobbies, interests, and family situations and make efforts to build that knowledge into the planning process? Or is the idea of contextualizing teaching and learning a larger issue that incorporates knowledge of the school and community, and the individual student within these particular settings, into teaching and learning in authentic ways? How do we assist our students in nesting the role of their pupils’ individual interests within the larger sociocultural framework of their families and communities?</p>
<p>An additional topic that surfaced during researcher meetings addressed the potential limitations of a student teaching semester and the extent to which student teachers can adequately demonstrate connections with families in authentic and significant ways during that time. As noted previously, in this program, all candidates must contact all of their pupils’ families either by phone or in person at the start of the student teaching semester and are encouraged to continue these relationships as a basis for improving their pupils’ learning. A majority of the family entries in these portfolios represented working with families in either a contrived, one time effort (“I have to have something for my portfolio”) or generally the portfolio included little or no mention of working with families across the entries. This second scenario is possible due to the structure of the portfolio assignment itself in that the standard where most work with families would be represented is paired with issues related to the community. We identified several examples of students who contextualized teaching and learning in meaningful ways but did not mention working with families. Portfolios in the “making it your own” category mentioned working with families in ongoing ways, usually more in relationship to individual students who were having difficulties. Therefore, the parameters of the portfolio itself may function as a limitation within a student teaching semester thereby reducing the frequency with which student teachers’ address the importance of this central concept.</p>
<p>This “second look” at our portfolios proved to be an important effort in assessing our teacher education practices and examining the extent to which reflections and artifacts reveal students’ perspectives on critical issues related to equity and diversity in their development as urban educators. The three categories have held up across both studies and appear to have utility when reviewing the extent to which our program graduates are committed and equipped to work successfully with students in urban schools.</p>
<p>The findings from this study have informed faculty and program development in small ways. As three of the authors of this study currently teach in the program, involvement in this study has fed back into their teaching in specific classes. One example of this comes in the revision of an urban expertise project that now scaffolds students to think more critically about issues of social justice and issues of equity and diversity while exploring the urban city they will be teaching in for four semesters. A second example comes in the revision of a literacy methods course to more fully take advantage of students’ developing understanding of critical literacy in the development of language arts lesson plans. On a programmatic level, several changes have been implemented as well. The program adopted <italic>Open Minds to Equality: A Sourcebook of Learning Activities to Affirm Diversity and Promote Equality</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124511408598">Schniedewind &amp; Davidson, 2006</xref>) for use in all four semesters of the field placement seminars in order to provide students with concrete examples of lesson plans with a vision of equality and justice for all people. In addition, the program revised their practices in the students’ use of feedback on previous semester’s portfolio work. The first assignment in Semesters 2, 3, and 4 is to reflect in writing on the feedback provided in the previous semester’s portfolio. The aim of the work is twofold. First, it can provide guidance in students’ developing understanding of the program’s emphasis on important issues in teaching in urban schools. Second, instructors can collaboratively develop stronger supports for students’ progress.</p>
<p>Although it is clear to the authors of this study that the analysis of exit portfolios is valuable work, the benefit to faculty and program must also be made clear in order to justify time and effort necessary to engage in the critical analysis of exit portfolios. Furthermore, the potential of portfolios as source of ongoing reflection on critical issues related to race, class, and culture proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013124511408598">Zeichner and Wray (2001)</xref> can be more fully realized when faculty and programs routinely engage in this challenging work.</p>

<title>Core Guiding Principle</title>
<sec id="section15-0013124511408598">
<title>Urban Education/Equity</title>
<p>All programs at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee leading to licensure by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction have adopted a unified guiding principle centered on advocating for and providing an equitable education to all students, particularly those in urban schools and agencies. Individuals licensed through University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee will demonstrate an understanding of the unique characteristics of urban contexts and keep issues of race, class, culture, and language at the forefront of their work. Candidates will have substantive knowledge about the varieties of urban contexts and cultures, the forces that maintain poverty, and other powerful historic and contemporary beliefs and traditions that support discrimination in society. They understand how other social identities, including gender, disability, sexual orientation, and religion, intersect with the forces of poverty, cultural traditions, language, and racism and lead to inequity in teaching and learning.</p>
<p>This <italic>urban education/equity</italic> principle is aligned with University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee’s unique commitment to the urban community and influences our interpretation of state licensing standards and how they are assessed. During each portfolio review, students are expected to specifically address the urban/equity principle as the overarching lens through which they interpret the performance standards of the applicable license.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0013124511408598">
<title>UWM-WI Teacher Standards</title>
<p>These standards are based on Wisconsin’s ten Teacher Standards. It is important to note that Wisconsin adopted the <italic>Model Standards for Beginning Teacher Licensing, Assessment and Development</italic> developed in 1992 by the Interstate New Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (INTASC), a program of the national organization, the Council of Chief State School Officers. Faculty and staff at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee have articulated these 10 standards specifically for University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee candidates to reflect their alignment with University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee’s Core Guiding Principle: Urban Education/Equity.</p>
<sec id="section17-0013124511408598">
<title>Standard #1: A Liberal Arts Foundation With Strong Content Knowledge</title>
<p>Wisconsin Teacher Standard #1: The teacher understands the central concepts, tools of inquiry, and structures of the disciplines he or she teaches and can create learning experiences that make these aspects of subject matter meaningful for students.</p>
<p><italic>For</italic> University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee <italic>candidates</italic> this means drawing on strong disciplinary knowledge in liberal arts as well as knowledge of the sociocultural and historical context of the discipline. Candidates are able to translate their knowledge of disciplinary content into appropriate instructional activities and represent this content in meaningful ways for their students. They apply rigorous and high expectations for every student and demonstrate the belief that every child is capable of learning—especially children in urban communities, many of whom are often wrongly believed to be unable or unwilling to learn.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0013124511408598">
<title>Standard #2: Developmental Framework, Placing the Learner at the Center</title>
<p>Wisconsin Teacher Standard #2: The teacher understands how children learn and develop and can provide learning opportunities that support their intellectual, social, and personal development.</p>
<p><italic>For</italic> University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee <italic>candidates</italic> this means basing professional practice on sound knowledge of the range of typical development, including cognition, language, social-emotional development, and gross and fine motor skills. Using knowledge of individual learners to inform their practice, candidates engage students in activities that optimize learning and development.</p>
<p>Candidates recognize the unique potential of the individual learner. They simultaneously appreciate the role of their students’ context, that is, their cultures and communities, in shaping their individual development. Candidates understand the historic and philosophic forces that may influence their assumptions about diverse cultures and communities.
