<abstract>
<p>The social capital present within local communities is increasingly viewed as an important source of co-productive capacity for delivering better public services. However, to date, research in the field of public administration has paid scant attention to the links between structural and attitudinal components of social capital, such as community organizational life, political engagement and levels of interpersonal trust, and the performance of public services. In this article, the relationship between social capital and public service performance is explored by reviewing the available empirical evidence on this topic. The existing evidence suggests that the strength and direction of the social capital performance relationship may vary by the different dimensions of social capital. Thus, further research in this area would have theoretical and practical benefits.</p>

<p>The concept of social capital is increasingly deployed in a host of important areas of public policy and administration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0952076710394399">Halpern, 2004</xref>). Within any given geographical area, structural and attitudinal components of social capital, such as community organizational life, political engagement and levels of interpersonal trust, constitute a stock of material, cultural and human resources that can potentially be mobilised for public purposes, including the delivery of public services. At the same time, it is highly conceivable that the quality of public institutions is a key determinant of levels of social capital within communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0952076710394399">Rothstein and Stolle, 2008</xref>). However, to date, public administration researchers in the UK have rarely examined the links between social capital and the performance of public organizations (though see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0952076710394399">John, 2005</xref>), despite the central place of both topics within contemporary policy debates. This article takes stock of the state of knowledge on this issue by reviewing the empirical literature on the relationship between social capital and public service performance.</p>
<p>To what extent might the achievements of public organizations be attributable to community organizational life, engagement in public affairs and social trust? Or does the stock of social capital within any given area depend rather upon the efforts of public service providers? This is a timely and extremely pertinent subject for investigation. A commitment to increasing citizen participation in service provision is at the heart of the UK coalition government's attempt to build a “Big Society” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0952076710394399">Department for Communities and Local Government, 2010</xref>). At the same time, in the wake of the global financial crisis, the social capital found within local communities is increasingly regarded as a panacea for the coming era of budget cutbacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0952076710394399">Association of County Chief Executives, 2009</xref>). Much public service provision is already characterised by the contribution of citizens to the production of the goods and services that they consume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0952076710394399">Parks et al., 1981</xref>). Further attempts to mix the productive efforts of service providers and service users may be more likely to succeed where there is a greater stock of social resources that can be brought to bear on co-production. It is therefore important to identify what constitutes social capital and to explore its potential connection with public service performance.</p>
<p>In the first part of this article, five key dimensions of the concept of social capital are introduced: community organizational life, engagement in public affairs, community volunteerism, informal sociability and social trust. The concept of public service performance is then examined, before its potential relationship with each dimension of social capital is explored. In the third section, empirical studies examining the social capital–performance relationship are reviewed. In the fourth, future research directions are identified.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0952076710394399"><title>What is social capital?</title>
<p>The concept of social capital has been conceptualized and operationalized in myriad alternative ways (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0952076710394399">Portes, 1998</xref>). According to Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0952076710394399">Putnam (2000)</xref> it comprises “connections among individuals – social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trustworthiness that arise from them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0952076710394399">Putnam, 2000</xref>: 19). This implies that social capital is a <italic>structural</italic> (networks) and <italic>attitudinal</italic> (norms) phenomenon that is the property of communities rather than individuals. At the heart of the concept, then, is the notion that the relational resources within a community can be harnessed by certain actors to achieve desired outcomes – which may or may not be beneficial for the public good.</p>
<p>Critics have associated social capital theory with neo-liberal economics (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0952076710394399">Navarro, 2002</xref>) and critiqued limited conceptualizations that exclude social network ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0952076710394399">Western et al., 2005</xref>). Ben <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0952076710394399">Fine (2010)</xref>, in particular, argues that an emphasis on social capital in policy debates distracts attention from other important explanatory factors, such as capital and class, which may be responsible for social outcomes. However, while the concept of social capital is a highly contested and controversial one, it remains a useful heuristic for exploring the salience of social relationships in the field of public policy because of its facility for bridging the worlds of academia and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0952076710394399">Woolcock, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Generally speaking, social capital is conceptualised in the empirical literature as a latent construct that cannot be directly observed, but rather is composed of separate though inter-related dimensions that are susceptible to observation. Although each of these dimensions may have an independent life of their own, taken together they constitute a theoretically coherent representation of an underlying concept. In <italic>Bowling Alone</italic>, Robert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0952076710394399">Putnam's (2000)</xref> assessment of the effects of declining social capital in the U.S., he identifies and measures five general dimensions of social capital: community organizational life, engagement in public affairs, community volunteerism, informal sociability and social trust. Each of these dimensions incorporates distinctive bonding (exclusive) and bridging (inclusive) aspects, which may reinforce exclusive identities or encompass myriad diverse ones in ways that may or may not be conducive to the public good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0952076710394399">Portes, 1998</xref>). The contribution of each dimension to the broader level of (positive and negative) social capital within any given area is outlined next in order to frame the boundaries for the review of the evidence on the social capital–performance relationship.</p>
<p>Community organizational life reflects the formal organizational resources available within local communities, such as sports clubs, arts societies and social support groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0952076710394399">Putnam, 2000</xref>). In theory, these community-based organizations (CBOs) build social capital amongst citizens by serving as small-scale learning environments that spur the development of shared values and norms. However, evidence suggests that local elites sometimes harbour CBOs’ resources at the expense of the community at large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0952076710394399">Platteau, 2004</xref>), and that community organizational life can exacerbate tensions between social groups by generating excess competition for political influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0952076710394399">Berman, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0952076710394399">Putnam (2000)</xref>, engagement in public affairs is an important element of social capital, especially participation in democratic politics through voting in elections and attendance at public meetings. Such participation may make citizens more respectful of each other's rights and reduce levels of social disaffection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0952076710394399">Sullivan and Transue, 1999</xref>). However, some studies have also indicated that community activism may serve to exclude certain marginalised or underrepresented groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0952076710394399">Kobayashi, 1994</xref>), or, in a worst-case scenario, become a repository for extremist political parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0952076710394399">Goodwin, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Community volunteerism through voluntary individual acts of assistance and participation in community projects is another key dimension of social capital. In theory, active voluntary involvement in “doing good” in society broadens and deepens the connections between people (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0952076710394399">Wilson, 2000</xref>). Nonetheless, some research suggests that volunteers may have strong self-interested reasons for their acts or become overly sympathetic to, and influenced by, the interests of local elites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0952076710394399">Brooks, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Informal sociability reflects the social life people enjoy in settings that are not formally organized, such as dinner parties, visiting restaurants, playing and watching sport, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0952076710394399">Putnam, 2000</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0952076710394399">Erickson and Nosanchuk (1990)</xref>, these activities prompt conversations about social and political matters and thereby enable people to resolve collective action problems. However, while the deepening of friendship ties can promote pro-social behaviour, it may also sustain a “small-town mentality” that upholds the status quo and suppresses dissent and difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0952076710394399">Vidich and Bensman, 1968</xref>).</p>
<p>Social trust refers to the underlying generalized reciprocity that guides exchanges between community members. Trust can foster collective action in the absence of formal mechanisms for that purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0952076710394399">Coleman, 1994</xref>). In a high-trust community, members perceive there to be strong support from peers and corresponding obligations on their own part. Unfortunately, though, such solidarity may restrict the flow of information and social support beyond the group and can be an indicator of insularity and closed-mindedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0952076710394399">Suttles, 1972</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0952076710394399"><title>What is public service performance?</title>
<p>In the private sector, it is relatively straightforward to agree and measure financial criteria of organizational success and failure. Organizational performance in the public sector is, however, characterized by a much higher degree of complexity and is invariably multidimensional. Public organizations are typically required to meet multiple and potentially conflicting organizational goals. The creation of performance information, its interpretation, and its use are all subject to disagreement amongst interested stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0952076710394399">Moynihan, 2008</xref>). Thus, as an inevitable consequence of the publicness of public services, their achievements are judged by a diverse array of constituencies, such as taxpayers, staff and politicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0952076710394399">Boyne, 2004</xref>). Despite these political complexities, there are key tangible elements of performance that all stakeholders are likely to value (if to varying degrees), such as the speed with which services are delivered, the extent to which they meet the needs of service users and the capacity within public organizations to do this cost effectively.</p>
<p>Each of these elements of performance can be measured or gauged in a variety of ways. Typically, this has been done via three methods. First, through the analysis of administrative data collected and published by public organizations themselves, such as statutory indicators that are mandated by central governments, scores issued by regulatory agencies and also the expenditure and output data collected by individual organizations. Examples of these in the UK included the National Indicator Set for local authorities, “star ratings” awarded to schools and hospitals, and the Chartered Institute for Public Finance and Accounting's <italic>Finance and General Statistics</italic> publications. Second, survey measures can be utilised to directly assess stakeholders’ perceptions of performance. These are sometimes set by political superiors (for example, statutory user satisfaction questionnaires), but also include primary data collected by non-governmental organizations and academic researchers on the views of managers, politicians and citizens. Finally, achievements on each of the key elements of performance identified above can be judged through the use of in-depth interviews with key stakeholders. This approach offers the prospect of a more nuanced, context-sensitive appreciation of the interplay between different performance elements.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0952076710394399"><title>Perspectives on social capital and public service performance</title>
<p>Each dimension of social capital is likely to have a distinctive relationship with public service performance. Critically, though, while many studies have focused on the impact of social capital on performance (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0952076710394399">Coffe and Geys, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0952076710394399">Knack, 2002</xref>), it is conceivable that causation runs in the other direction, with social capital contingent upon the quality of public services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0952076710394399">Rothstein and Stolle, 2008</xref>). The causal mechanisms that might underpin links between each dimension of social capital and performance are explored next.</p>
<p>Community organizational life can potentially enhance performance by enabling citizens to overcome collective action problems associated with influencing public organizations – which in turn may make policy makers more responsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0952076710394399">Elkins and Simeon, 1979</xref>). CBOs also develop expertise in addressing complex social problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0952076710394399">Wallis and Dollery, 2006</xref>), and can thereby build capacity and lower costs for public service providers. However, community organizational life may be dependent upon the strength and stability of political institutions. For example, CBOs are reliant on local government funding, and often reflect, or are shaped by, the decisions of politicians and policy makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0952076710394399">Leach and Wilson, 1998</xref>). It is therefore likely that the relationship between community organizational life and public service performance will be a reciprocal one that is mutually reinforcing – notwithstanding the potentially negative externalities associated with CBOs (see above).</p>
<p>Public organizations generally require the support of citizens and service users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0952076710394399">Hirschman, 1970</xref>). The relative engagement in public affairs within any given area may therefore exert an important influence on public service delivery decisions. A more active citizenry may dictate agenda-setting or constrain the range of alternatives available to policy makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0952076710394399">Elkins and Simeon, 1979</xref>). Nevertheless, the engagement of citizens may also be determined by the quality of the public services they receive, and could follow a u-shaped pattern, with active citizenship greatest at low and high levels of performance. Individual-level research indicates that citizens often become politically active in response to the failings of public service providers, but may feel more committed to activism when they have confidence that their demands will be met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0952076710394399">Vigoda, 2002</xref>). This suggests that the connections between this dimension of social capital and performance may be particularly complex.</p>
<p>Public organizations serving areas with high levels of community volunteerism may benefit from higher levels of public-spiritedness and commitment to the needs and interests of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0952076710394399">Putnam, 2000</xref>). In particular, volunteers may be more likely to supplement existing service provision. The potential benefits of such voluntary contributions can include more buy-in from citizens, less resistance to public initiatives, and with shared labour, greater efficiency and effectiveness in service delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0952076710394399">Wilson, 2000</xref>). However, it is quite conceivable that these benefits are contingent on the opportunities that are made available for people to co-produce public services (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0952076710394399">Boyle and Harris, 2009</xref>). Hence, the relationship between volunteering and public service performance may well be a reciprocal one.</p>
<p>Informal sociability can serve as a conduit for the “flow of helpful information that facilitates achieving our goals” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0952076710394399">Putnam, 2000</xref>: 288–89), building the potential for collective action and the leveraging of peer pressure on public officials. At the same time, areas benefiting from strong informal connections may also be more self-reliant and well-ordered than those that are socially disengaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0952076710394399">Sampson et al., 2005</xref>). Although causal mechanisms directly linking better public services to sociability are somewhat difficult to envisage, it seems plausible to expect that where public institutions treat people fairly and equitably, friendships are more likely to flourish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0952076710394399">Frazer, 2008</xref>). Thus, while the strength and the direction of the connection between sociability and performance may be difficult to trace, it is conceivable that the two are to some extent mutually supportive.</p>
<p>In theory, social trust contributes to community connectedness, and relieves public authorities of the ‘burden of enforcing compliance’ with legislation, increasing their capacity to focus on improving services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0952076710394399">Boix and Posner, 1998</xref>). Trust may also lower transaction costs within civil society, making it easier to improve public services through cross-sectoral partnerships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0952076710394399">Purdue, 2001</xref>). Nevertheless, levels of trust within civil society may be largely determined by the quality of political institutions. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0952076710394399">Brehm and Rahn's (1997</xref>) study of the individual level determinants of social capital suggests that confidence in government has a larger effect on social trust than vice versa.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0952076710394399"><title>The empirical evidence</title>
<p>Numerous empirical studies have assessed the relationship between social capital and individual level outcomes, especially for health (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0952076710394399">Veenstra, 2000</xref>), education (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0952076710394399">Coleman, 1988</xref>), and government (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0952076710394399">Brehm and Rahn, 1997</xref>). However, rather less is known about its connection with organizational outcomes, despite the explosion of interest in public service performance during the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0952076710394399">Boyne, 2004</xref>). The empirical evidence on social capital and performance surveyed here was largely drawn from statistical studies of organizational outputs and outcomes in the public sector. Such evidence is suitable for review because it utilises multiple cases and enables other important influences on performance, such as socioeconomic deprivation, to be held constant. Nevertheless, qualitative evidence on the links between social capital and the delivery of public services is also reviewed.</p>
<p>The empirical studies were identified by utilising three internet search engines: web of science; Scopus; and Google Scholar. This ensured that a wide spread of academic journals was captured by the search as well as books and working papers. To identify studies which analyse the relationship between social capital and organizational performance, it was necessary to adapt additional search terms for relative levels of social capital (e.g. civic culture, political engagement, volunteering), in conjunction with adapted terms for public service performance (e.g. effectiveness, efficiency, responsiveness). The search revealed 48 studies that empirically evaluate the relationship between social capital and some aspect of organizational performance in the public sector. The selected studies were nearly all undertaken in single countries, with most being conducted in the United States (21) and the UK (5), with Belgium, Canada, Germany (2), India, Italy, Mexico, Nepal, Norway, Peru, Sweden (2), Switzerland and seven cross-country international studies also represented. Despite the appropriateness of this work, it is nonetheless limited.</p>
<p>Some researchers aggregate the different dimensions of social capital, but fail to examine the separate effects of these dimensions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0952076710394399">Coffe and Geys, 2005</xref>). Where the concept of social capital is disaggregated, the available evidence invariably focuses on only one dimension (especially trust: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0952076710394399">La Porta et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0952076710394399">Rothstein and Stolle, 2008</xref>), or a sub-set (e.g. community organizational life and informal sociability in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0952076710394399">Sun, 1999</xref>). Only a single study examines the relationship between performance and all five dimensions of social capital identified by Putnam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0952076710394399">Knack, 2002</xref>). At the same time, many studies have focused on the relationship between social capital and public service expenditure (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0952076710394399">Coffe and Geys, 2005</xref>) or management quality within governments (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0952076710394399">Knack, 2002</xref>), rather than well-defined organizational outcomes, such as pupils’ educational attainment (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0952076710394399">John, 2005</xref>). Moreover, some of the performance measures do not adequately capture supply-side organizational factors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0952076710394399">Milner and Ersson (2000)</xref> use library book lending as an indicator of local government output, yet such lending may be a product of demand-side factors, such as citizens’ propensity towards reading, rather than the efforts of public servants.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these limitations, the studies reviewed below facilitate a valuable preliminary assessment of the relationship between social capital and performance. The evidence covers a wide range of public services ranging from single purpose organizations, such as schools and tenant management organizations, to multipurpose organizations, such as state and local governments. Several studies draw on a large sample of organizations, and different aspects of performance are covered. In addition, most consider the potential effects of relevant contextual variables. The review of the available evidence begins by examining capital in the aggregate and performance, before studies investigating each dimension of social capital are explored and future research directions identified.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0952076710394399"><title>Aggregate social capital</title>
<p>Several researchers have sought to create aggregate indices of social capital by bringing together its separate dimensions under the rubric of a single latent construct (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0952076710394399">Western et al., 2005</xref>). The vast majority of studies drawing on aggregate indices of social capital find that it has a positive impact on performance.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0952076710394399">Putnam's (2000)</xref> index of social capital is positively related to pupils’ examination performance, public health, and low crime rates in the U.S. states – and fire safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0952076710394399">Andrews and Brewer, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0952076710394399">Rice and Sumberg (1997)</xref> correlate policy innovation in U.S. state governments with an index measuring political engagement (e.g. newspaper readership), political equality (e.g. women state legislators), community organizational life (e.g. nonprofit organizations per capita) and social trust (e.g. lawyers per capita [reversed]).

<sec id="sec6-0952076710394399"><title>Community organizational life</title>
<p>Despite growing interest in the role that CBOs can play in delivering public services during the past few decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0952076710394399">Wallis and Dollery, 2006</xref>), systematic research has only recently begun to examine the connections between community organizational life and the performance of public organizations. Much of this work is focused on the achievements of state and local governments, especially in the United States.</p>
<p>Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0952076710394399">Putnam (1993)</xref> linked community organizational life and the performance of Italian regional governments, studies in state and local governments have furnished rather more mixed results on this relationship. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0952076710394399">Rice (2001)</xref> finds that community organizational life has little impact on residents’ or experts’ perceptions of the performance of Iowa community governments. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0952076710394399">Knack (2002</xref>) uncovers no relationship between associational activity and management capacity in U.S. state governments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0952076710394399">Milner and Ersson (2000)</xref>, though, report positive correlations between study circle participation and library book lending in 24 Swedish counties, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0952076710394399">Pierce et al.

<p>Qualitative studies of the community organizational life-performance relationship furnish a more clear-cut positive link between the two. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0952076710394399">Carver et al.'s (2003)</xref> study of anti-smoking policy implementation by non-profit organizations in Mississippi concludes that the fall in tobacco use in that state was attributable to the activities of those organizations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0952076710394399">Baqui et al.

Beyond the context of state and local governments, quantitative research corroborates the findings of these qualitative studies (perhaps suggesting that the benefits of community organizational life are experienced at smaller spatial scales).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0952076710394399">Sun (1999)</xref> finds that parental participation in community organizational life is linked to better examination performance in U.S. high schools. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0952076710394399">Porfeli et al.

Although this evidence suggests community organizational life enhances public service outcomes, few empirical studies have examined the potential for causation to run in the other direction.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0952076710394399">Berman's (1997)</xref> historical analysis of the collapse of the Weimar Republic suggests that weak political institutionalization was to blame rather than a fragile civil society.

It is therefore very difficult to form a clear picture of the extent to which community organizational life and public service performance may be mutually reinforcing or whether causation runs in a single direction only.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0952076710394399"><title>Engagement in public affairs</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0952076710394399">Putnam's (1993)</xref> study of civic culture in Italy identified political engagement as a critical factor in determining the success of regional governments, and several subsequent studies have corroborated this finding in state and local governments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0952076710394399">Knack (2002)</xref> links political engagement with the management capacity of U.S. state governments, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0952076710394399">Borge et al.

These studies suggest that public organizations operating in politically active areas may find it difficult to improve services because they must overcome strong collective resistance to unwanted policy change amongst the citizenry. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0952076710394399">Sepheri and Pettigrew's (1996)</xref> case comparison of two middle hill villages in Nepal suggests that community control of primary health care was often hampered by local power relations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0952076710394399">Aldrich and Crook (2008</xref>) too find that the siting of new trailer parks by Federal Emergency Management Agency officials in the wake of Hurricane Katrina was more difficult in politically active areas.</p>
<p>Qualitative research in tenant management organizations has suggested, though, that client participation in service decisions bolsters management capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0952076710394399">Lowndes and Stoker, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0952076710394399">Tunstall, 2001</xref>), and may result in better residential stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0952076710394399">Saegert and Winkel, 1998</xref>). Nonetheless, a wide evidence base illustrates the considerable challenges that public organizations face engaging, educating and empowering citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0952076710394399">Andrews et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of the propensity for public service performance to influence engagement with public affairs, several individual level studies point towards a connection between government failure and active engagement (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0952076710394399">Brehm and Rahn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0952076710394399">Vigoda, 2002</xref>). At the local government level, researchers have identified a link between poor performance and voter choices in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0952076710394399">James and John, 2007</xref>), but, to date, no studies examine the impact of organizational performance on electoral turnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0952076710394399">Van Oorschot and Arts, 2005</xref>, assess the impact of alternative welfare regimes). Nonetheless, the individual-level evidence is suggestive of a complex relationship between engagement and performance through time, with poor performance prompting activism, which in turn spurs service improvement and lower engagement until performance again declines. Longitudinal studies tracking engagement in public affairs and organizational outcomes could illuminate this critical issue.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0952076710394399"><title>Community volunteerism</title>
<p>Although evidence linking volunteerism with organizational performance in the public sector is currently sparse, it reveals a positive relationship in most cases. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0952076710394399">Knack (2002)</xref> correlates volunteering with management capacity in U.S. state governments, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0952076710394399">Ferguson et al.

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0952076710394399">John's (2005)</xref> study of 27 secondary schools in England in 2000 indicates that student volunteering has a positive relationship with examination performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0952076710394399">Sheldon and Epstein (2002</xref>) observe a similar correlation between volunteering and pupil discipline in a sample of elementary and secondary schools in 12 U.S. states.

This study points to the possibility that volunteers only actively co-produce services that they perceive to be deficient.</p>
<p>Although to date no research has sought to directly link the quality of public services to volunteering, a small number of studies furnish evidence on the effects of alternative institutional settings on propensity the to volunteer. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0952076710394399">Buhlmann and Freitag (2007)</xref> find that decentralization is positively related to volunteering in the Swiss cantons. Given the centrality of volunteering to the concept of social capital, empirical evidence on the service quality effects on volunteerism would cast light on an important aspect of the social-capital performance relationship.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0952076710394399"><title>Informal sociability</title>
<p>The evidence on informal sociability and public service performance is far more mixed than for other dimensions of social capital, perhaps unsurprisingly, as socializing would intuitively seem less likely to prompt collective action than CBOs or political engagement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0952076710394399">Knack (2002</xref>) finds no relationship between sociability and the capacity of U.S. state governments – a finding replicated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0952076710394399">Ferguson et al.'s (2005)</xref> study of capacity reveal similar correlations in U.S. city governments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0952076710394399">John (2005</xref>), too, uncovers no link between parental socializing and school examination performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0952076710394399">Sun (1999</xref>), though, connects parental socializing with U.S. high school examination scores; and, a similar relationship is observed between socializing and policy innovation in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0952076710394399">Tavits’ (2006)</xref> study of U.S. local governments (though not for efficiency). Thus, although three studies do not identify a link between sociability and performance, two do, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the basis of these sparse findings.</p>
<p>To date, the impact of the quality of public services on people's socialising has not been studied systematically – though a large literature is evolving on the effects of alternative welfare regimes. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0952076710394399">Scheepers et al.,'s (2002)</xref> analysis of Eurobarometer data finds that citizens in countries with a strong welfare state have fewer social contacts with family and friends than do those in the Latin Rim. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0952076710394399">Van Ooorschot and Arts (2005</xref>) and others furnish further evidence on the complex effects of welfare provision on social networks. Plainly, though, much more systematic evidence on the relationship between sociability and public service performance is required before any attempt to extract general trends on this interesting issue can be undertaken.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-0952076710394399"><title>Social trust</title>
<p>The connection between social trust and individual level outcomes is the subject of numerous studies, especially in relation to crime (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0952076710394399">Ross et al., 2001</xref>). It is also the subject of most of the research examining the impact of performance on social capital. Although some of this is carried out at the individual level (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0952076710394399">Espinal et al., 2006</xref>), much is at the organizational-level (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0952076710394399">Letki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0952076710394399">Rothstein and Stolle, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The available evidence on the impact of trust on performance points towards a linear positive relationship between trust and performance. At the national level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0952076710394399">La Porta et al. (1997)</xref> find that social trust is linked to the efficiency of the judiciary, bureaucratic quality in government, school performance and lower levels of government corruption in economically advanced nations – findings mirrored in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0952076710394399">Bjornskov's (2010)</xref> updated replication study.</p>
<p>At a lower spatial scale, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0952076710394399">Knack (2002)</xref> finds that trust is correlated with management capacity in U.S. state governments, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0952076710394399">Pierce et al.

At the local level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0952076710394399">Rice (2001</xref>) uncovers a link between trust and the performance of municipal services in Iowa, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0952076710394399">Tavits (2006)</xref> finds a correlation with policy innovation in German and U.S. local governments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0952076710394399">Cote (2001</xref>) finds a strong correlation between social trust and management of the Quebecois regional development boards, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0952076710394399">Kahne and Bailey's (1999)</xref> qualitative study of graduation rates in two Chicago high schools illustrates that social trust plays a key role in building the confidence of disadvantaged students.

<p>Although the bulk of the research examining the impact of social trust on performance reveals a positive connection between the two, a growing evidence base on the impact of performance on trust highlights that it is not possible to draw firm conclusions about this issue without considering the direction in which causality may run. At the nation-state level, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0952076710394399">Letki's (2006)</xref> analysis of World Values Survey data reveals a strong link between the perceived quality of government bureaucracies and trust. In their study of the same dataset, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0952076710394399">Rothstein and Stolle (2008)</xref> find that effective and impartial public institutions are positively related to social trust. This finding is corroborated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0952076710394399">Freitag and Buhlmann's (2009)</xref> multi-level analysis of the World Values Survey data, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0952076710394399">Kumlin and Rothstein (2005)</xref> reveal a connection between the responsiveness of health care, transportation, social assistance and employment agencies and trust in the Vastra Gotaland region of Sweden (though not for child care). Overall, the findings confirming both variants of the trust–performance connection point towards a mutually reinforcing association between the two. Systematic comparison of the strength of each side of this reciprocal relationship within the same study at the organizational level would greatly clarify the causal mechanisms at work here.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-0952076710394399"><title>Future research directions</title>
<p>The balance of the available evidence tends to suggest that better performance and high levels of social capital may go hand in hand. However, much more research is required to underpin firm theoretical and policy conclusions, particularly on the impact of performance on social capital, and especially for dimensions of social capital other than trust. At the same time, the methodologies used in existing studies exhibit important weaknesses. In particular, the cross-sectional research design adopted in nearly all of the articles reviewed here does little to address the difficult issue of causality. Although some quantitative studies have controlled for these causation issues using instrumental variable techniques (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0952076710394399">Coffe and Geys, 2005</xref>), so far only one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0952076710394399">John, 2005</xref>) has tackled this problem head-on using longitudinal data. Similarly, a single qualitative study has unravelled these causal processes by carrying out longitudinal case comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0952076710394399">Lively Neal, 2009</xref>). Future studies should build on this work and investigate social capital and public service performance over long time periods.</p>
<p>In addition, to fully understand the social capital–performance relationship it would be essential for researchers to trace the interactions between the different dimensions and other relevant environmental influences. For instance, circumstances beyond the control of public organizations may harm their performance, especially socioeconomic deprivation and resource pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0952076710394399">Boyne, 2004</xref>). It is conceivable that public organizations operating in areas rich in social capital are better able to overcome such challenging circumstances. For example, in deprived areas with a tradition of community engagement, managers may find it easier to implement new service initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0952076710394399">Middleton et al., 2005</xref>). Likewise, it may be the case that high-performing public agencies more successfully contribute to the growth of social capital in areas facing tough contextual challenges. In the current climate of fiscal austerity, evidence on the extent to which social capital can enhance the resilience of public service providers to budgetary cuts will cast important light on the potential trade-offs between service priorities the cuts will provoke. At the same time, studies examining the extent to which social resilience is stronger in areas benefiting from better quality public services would provide a strong illustration of the contribution public organizations can make to the development of the “Big Society”.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the reported findings may be a product of where and when the empirical studies were conducted. Most of the empirical literature on the effects of social capital on performance is from the United States, while much of the pioneering work on the impact of performance on social capital has been carried out in a Scandinavian setting. Much more research is required in other countries to cast light on the comparative generalizability of these studies. For example, the U.S. is perceived to be an especially voluntaristic society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0952076710394399">Lipset and Schneider, 1983</xref>), while Scandinavian countries are often claimed to exhibit particularly high levels of social trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0952076710394399">Rothstein, 2001</xref>). Other countries too (e.g. European post-communist states and Latin America) exhibit very distinctive civil society–government relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0952076710394399">Valkov, 2009</xref>). Ultimately, then, systematic cross-country comparisons of the social capital–performance relationship in different public agencies are required to cast light on when it matters most and in which policy fields.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-0952076710394399" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The issue of social capital and public service performance is of increasing interest and importance. Attempts to mix the productive efforts of service providers and service users are at the heart of numerous reforms designed to improve the management and delivery of public services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0952076710394399">Bourgon, 2009</xref>). Such reforms gathered momentum in the UK during the tenure of the previous Labour government and have now been taken up (albeit in a less state-centred form) as part of the coalition government's Big Society agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0952076710394399">Jordan, 2010</xref>). This article explored the social capital–performance relationship by reviewing the empirical evidence on this topic.</p>
<p>The existing empirical studies confirm some of the arguments about the benefits (and to a lesser degree the costs) of social capital for public service delivery, and the potential benefits of public services for social capital. Each dimension of social capital (excepting informal sociability) is found to have a positive relationship with performance, at least some of the time. This appears to be so across most aspects of performance (though, interestingly, not for efficiency), and in several organizational settings, suggesting that areas high in social capital may be more resilient to economic recession and budgetary cutbacks. Although much of the evidence is drawn from research in the United States, it does highlight the potentially large role for public policies to play in eliciting the positive associations between social capital and service improvement. All of which points towards the need to understand the challenges associated with designing and implementing effective co-production initiatives, which can successfully bring together citizens and public service providers. How public organizations meet these challenges will have profound implications for the theory and practice of public policy and administration in years to come.</p></sec>
