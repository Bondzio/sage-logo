<p>From a contemporary standpoint, the theatre of naturalism (and possibly the theatre in general) might appear to be a quaint relic of the 19th century, an exhausted, antiquated aesthetic form bearing little relevance to present-day culture and politics. It is easy to forget, especially for those not especially interested in the heritage of the performing arts, that naturalism was once a revolutionary movement that exposed bourgeois hypocrisy, rallied against injustice and inspired its detractors to riot in the streets. Make no mistake, naturalistic theatre was a significant aesthetic and political force, and a re-examination of its enduring legacy is timely. Philip Beitchman’s book underscores the movement’s obsession with class conflict, and functions as a rejoinder to those who mistakenly believe that political theatre was the sole preserve of the historical avant-garde (those artists, such as Bertolt Brecht, who attempted to dissolve the boundaries between art and political life).</p>
<p>Noting the close etymological relationship between the words ‘theatre’ and ‘theory’, this slim volume promises to reflect on naturalistic theatre in the light of contemporary French theory with specific reference to the work of Baudrillard, Derrida, and Bernard Stiegler. The author claims this focus on the connections between naturalism and ‘theory’ makes his book distinctive by filling lacunae in the scholarship on naturalistic theatre, one of the most enduring facets of modernism, and one, apparently, uncontaminated by an encounter with critical thought. On one level, this is a reasonable project, and makes perfect sense. The word ‘theatre’ is derived from the Greek noun ‘theatron’. The prefix ‘thea’, means ‘to look at’, so the theatre is literally a place for looking, and the word ‘theory’ (derived from the Greek ‘theoria’) refers to the act of contemplation or speculation. So, both words connote some kind of inspection of phenomena, as others – such as Susan Melrose in her book <italic>A Semiotics of the Dramatic Text</italic> (Macmillan, 1994) – have noted before. Unfortunately, Beitchman’s engagement with French theory could be stronger. He fails to provide any new insight into naturalism despite occasionally deploying a few jargon terms associated with French theory (a notoriously wide and discontinuous category). Beitchman refers to Baudrillard several times, for example, but never teases out the implications of his work for the naturalistic theatre. The following extract, from the chapter on Arnold Wesker’s play, <italic>Chicken Soup with Barley</italic>, is typical of the book’s encounter with theory.
<disp-quote>
<p>Something about this style must foretell also the realer-than-real, the hyperreal, the virtual reality of the derealizing French theorist, Jean Baudrillard; although his ideas will be in even better harmony with the theatre of David Storey.</p>
</disp-quote>
Beitchman cites Baudrillard, along with the other usual Gallic suspects, in several other chapters, but rarely explicates the complex concepts developed by French theory with rigour. In short, <italic>The Theatre of Naturalism</italic> is a frustrating read, for it neither provides any significant explication of the ‘theory’ it invokes, nor does it convincingly demonstrate how Baudrillard’s or Derrida’s writings contribute to a new understanding of the cultural and political work performed by naturalism.</p>
<p>For the most part, the book comprises a series of short chapters that engage with canonical naturalistic plays such as Ibsen’s <italic>Ghosts</italic>, Strindberg’s <italic>Miss Julie, </italic>Shaw’s <italic>Mrs Warren’s Profession</italic>. Beitchman’s summations of some of the most striking works written for the stage almost exclusively focus on the written word. The book is about dramatic literature and ignores the <italic>theatre</italic> of naturalism. This is a relatively minor terminological quibble, but it is symptomatic of the work’s general laxity. Naturalism was not just a literary phenomenon. It depended on a series of theatrical conventions – the fourth wall, representational acting, ensemble playing, and realistic <italic>mise-en-scene</italic>. Indeed, the book could have benefited from a more precise definition of naturalism (and other key terms), for Beitchman does not adequately clarify how naturalism can be distinguished from cognate movements like realism.</p>
<p>The distinction between the two terms is fluid and not obviously apparent – both refer to attempts to represent ordinary people in everyday situations, as opposed to the heroic figures of, say, the Classical or Renaissance stage, which dealt with the nobility in remote settings. An account of the received history of naturalism would have enabled Beitchman to demonstrate how his project unsettles dead verities.</p>
<p>For the record, naturalism is usually differentiated from other attempts to faithfully represent reality by its efforts to ‘scientifically’ analyse the human subject. In short, many naturalist plays can be read as attempts to confirm the thesis that human subjects are formed by the twin determinants of heredity and environment, or so the authoritative pundits would have us believe – see Brockett and Findlay’s classic history of European and American drama, <italic>A Century of Innovation</italic> (Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1990). This conventional reading of naturalistic drama is most clearly evident in Ibsen’s play <italic>Ghosts</italic>, which one early review described as ‘an open sewer’ for its frank treatment of taboo subject matter. Oswald, one of the many hapless figures in Ibsen’s iconic drama, is a product of his stifling middle-class environment, and suffering from hereditary syphilis – a legacy from his dissolute father. <italic>The Theatre of Naturalism</italic>, despite its claims of originality, is a relatively conventional work, which reinforces the rather tired readings of the canon. It does little to inspire new readings of the works it cites, and confirms received wisdom about the movement’s origins and its apparent disappearance. For instance, Beitchman confirms the role played by Emile Zola’s famous manifestos in providing the nascent movement with an aesthetic and political agenda. This is a perfectly good observation, but it merely repeats the standard commentaries on the topic by observing the movement’s affinities with enlightenment rationality, and a desire to apply the logical methodology of 19th-century science to the theatre.</p>
<p>A work purporting to bring French theory into a contiguous relationship with naturalism might have been expected to contest such a static characterization of Ibsen’s exemplary play and Zola’s manifestos by, say, reading naturalism in the wake of Derrida’s ‘hauntology’ – a neologism used to convey the play of presence and absence, past and present in everything that <italic>is</italic>. Alas, Beitchman gives Derrida short shrift despite citing <italic>Spectres of Marx</italic>. We can only speculate on how Derrida’s work might unsettle theatre history, and provide a better understanding of how the ghosts of naturalism haunt present theatre practice and inhabit the dramatic texts of contemporary playwrights, and avowedly non-naturalistic practices. I am perplexed by the book’s failure to examine any contemporary work – naturalism is far from a spent force, and its ghosts continue to inhabit and possess postmodern drama (the work of dramatists like Sarah Lane and Mark Ravehnill have not exorcized the spirit of naturalism, which thrives on stage and on the myriad of screen technologies that deliver drama to most spectators).</p>
<p>Finally, I found Beitchman’s decision to arbitrarily close his survey of naturalism in the 1970s rather perplexing – the book concludes by examining the theatre of David Storey, a figure whose reputation has waned since his heyday more than a quarter of a century ago, and whose work displays the influence of Beckett as much as any naturalist. Various strains of naturalism are alive and well, especially in America, and the popularity of Australian playwrights such as Joanna Murray-Smith, Hannie Rayson and Patricia Cornelius demonstrate that the form continues to flourish locally.</p>
<p>Despite the problems articulated above, the book is not without merit. <italic>The Theatre of Naturalism</italic> functions as a useful source book for those looking for a descriptive account of the genre’s most famous works. It also does a commendable job of reminding its readers that naturalism was ‘always already an aporia and a contradiction-in-terms’ (p. 100) since it presupposes the existence of a stable ‘reality’ that the theatre can simply reflect – a point that Beitchman, as a translator of Baudrillard, is well placed to articulate.</p>
