<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Color Doppler ultrasound is widely used to examine intratendinous flow in individuals with overuse tendon problems, but the association between color Doppler and pain is still unclear.</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis</bold>: Intratendinous flow is present and associated with pain in badminton players, and intratendinous flow and pain increase during a badminton season.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design</bold>: Cohort study (prognosis); Level of evidence, 2.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: Ninety-five semiprofessional badminton players were included in the study at a tournament at the start of the badminton season. All players were interviewed regarding pain. The anterior knee tendons and Achilles tendons were studied. Each tendon was scored using a quantitative grading system (grades 0-5) and a qualitative scoring system (color fraction) using color Doppler ultrasound. Eight months later, 86 of the players (91%) were retested by the same investigators during an equivalent badminton tournament (including 1032 tendon regions; 86 players with 4 tendons each with 3 regions), thus forming the study group.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: At the start of the season, 24 players (28%) experienced pain in 37 tendons (11%), and at the end of the season, 31 players (36%) experienced pain in 51 tendons (15%), which was a statistically significant increase (<italic>P</italic> = .0002). Abnormal flow was found in 230 tendon regions in 71 players (83%) at the start of the season compared with 78 tendon regions in 41 players (48%) at the follow-up. The decrease in abnormal flow was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). Of the 37 painful tendons at the start of the season, 25 had abnormal flow (68%). In contrast, 131 tendons (85%) with abnormal flow at the start of the season were pain free. At the end of the season, 18 of the 51 painful tendons (35%) had abnormal flow. Ninety-six of the 131 pain-free tendons (73%) with abnormal flow at the start of the season were normalized (no pain and normal flow) at the end of the season.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: It was not possible to verify any association between intratendinous flow and pain at the start of the season or at the follow-up (end of the season). Intratendinous flow at the start of the season could not predict symptomatic outcome at the end of the season. The decrease in Doppler flow during the season might suggest that intratendinous flow could be part of a physiological adaptive response to loading and that intratendinous flow as previously believed is not always a sign of pathological changes.</p>

<p>Earlier studies indicate that no flow is seen in healthy tendons with color or power Doppler,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511435478">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511435478">35</xref></sup> and the general belief is that the presence of intratendinous Doppler activity is a sign of pathological abnormality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511435478">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546511435478">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0363546511435478">40</xref></sup> However, recent studies have shown that intratendinous flow can be increased in both the patellar and Achilles tendons during exercise in normal healthy asymptomatic patients and in both symptomatic and asymptomatic athletes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511435478">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511435478">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511435478">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546511435478">34</xref></sup> These findings indicate that intratendinous flow is not always a sign of overuse injury, as previously stated by some authors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511435478">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511435478">35</xref></sup> but instead a part of the normal physiological response to loading.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511435478">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511435478">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511435478">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546511435478">34</xref></sup> Our hypothesis is that there is an association between the intratendinous flow in the Achilles and anterior knee tendons and current pain and that intratendinous flow and pain are increased in players during a badminton season.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to determine whether there is a relationship between the intratendinous flow in tendons with the presence of pain and to examine the amount of color Doppler activity and current pain in the Achilles and anterior knee tendons of semiprofessional badminton players after a badminton season (8 months). In addition, we aimed to determine if asymptomatic tendons with abnormal intratendinous flow at the start of the season lead to the development of pain at the end of the season or vice versa.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The study examined semiprofessional badminton players in the second best badminton league in Denmark who played the same 2-day national tournament at the start of the season and again at the end of the season 8 months later. The individuals who were assessed both at baseline and after 8 months were considered eligible for inclusion in the subsequent statistical analyses. The goal was to include all players participating in these 2 tournaments. The players were interviewed about previous and current pain in their Achilles and anterior knee tendons on location in the 2 tournaments, and moreover, players were examined ultrasonographically.</p>
<p>Ninety-five players participating in the badminton tournament at the start of the season were recruited and interviewed about pain symptoms as well as examined with US before their first match. The same examinations were repeated at an equivalent badminton tournament 8 months later at the end of the season on 86 of the original 95 players (86/95, 91%). These 86 players form the study group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546511435478">
<title>Interview</title>
<p>The interview covered demographics, injuries, and diseases. A systematic interview guide was used. The players were asked to describe the amount of competition and training during the season and the previous 3 years. Specifically, the players were questioned about current and previous pain in the Achilles tendon region and the anterior knee tendons (the quadriceps and patellar tendons) in the last 3 years and about previous diagnoses. Episodes of pain were defined as pain in a degree that had limited the amount of training for more than a week. The same 2 investigators in one room performed all interviews. All US examinations on both occasions were performed by the same 5 experienced specialists in US in another room in a blinded fashion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546511435478">
<title>Ultrasonography</title>
<p>The US examinations were performed on 4 GE Logic 9 14-MHz linear array transducers (Fairfield, Connecticut). All 5 investigators applied minimum transducer pressure during scanning to demonstrate as much flow as possible. All machines had the same settings and Doppler sensitivity. To maximize sensitivity for any flow, the lowest pulse repetition frequency and wall filter were applied. The color Doppler (CD) gain was set just below the level that produced random noise in the image. The Doppler settings were the same for all examinations. We chose CD and not power Doppler (PD) because the equipment in this study has higher sensitivity using the CD mode than with the PD mode. The Achilles tendons were scanned with the players placed prone with a pillow under the distal tibia. The feet were hanging freely in a relaxed, slightly plantarflexed position. The anterior knee tendons were scanned with the player in a supine position and the knee in 15° of flexion with a pillow (relaxed position). All tendons were scanned in the longitudinal and transverse planes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511435478">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511435478">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546511435478">37</xref></sup> The tendons and peritendinous tissues were evaluated with CD, and the presence of intratendinous flow (ie, intratendinous vascularity) was registered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546511435478">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0363546511435478">42</xref></sup> A longitudinal image with the maximum flow on CD was obtained to make a quantification of intratendinous CD. All scans were performed before warm-up before the players played their first match in the 2 tournaments. All data were stored as a DICOM file (National Electrical Manufacturers Association, Rosslyn, Virginia) and exported to a computer for postprocessing analysis.</p>

<sec id="section5-0363546511435478">
<title>Classification of the Tendon Areas (Anatomy)</title>
<p>As in recent studies, the Achilles tendon was divided into midtendon, preinsertional, and insertional (calcaneal) regions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511435478">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511435478">7</xref></sup> The knee tendons were subdivided in 3 regions: quadriceps, patella, and tuberositas tibiae region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511435478">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511435478">29</xref></sup> The Achilles tendon and the anterior knee tendons were scanned on both sides, giving a total of 12 tendon regions (4 tendons each with 3 tendon regions) in each player.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546511435478">
<title>Region of Interest (ROI) and Grading</title>
<p>The tendons were evaluated according to the amount of intratendinous CD activity inside the ROI. In all locations, the ROI was 2 cm in the longitudinal direction. The ROI was defined according to bony landmarks except the free midtendon of the Achilles tendon, where the ROI is defined from the center of the maximum CD activity and 1 cm proximally and distally from that point. The ROIs in the Achilles and anterior knee tendons used in this study were the same as those used by other authors in recent studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511435478">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511435478">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511435478">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511435478">29</xref></sup> The amount of color fraction inside the ROI was calculated as the number of color pixels divided by the total number of pixels inside the ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511435478">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The grading system used in this study is identical to the system used by Boesen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511435478">6</xref></sup> in a recent study looking at elite badminton players (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546511435478">Figure 1</xref>). As studies have shown that there is some degree of CD activity in normal tendons after exercise, which is probably physiological,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511435478">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511435478">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511435478">29</xref></sup> CD activity 0 and 1 were characterized as normal and CD activity &gt;1 as pathological. The tendons were assessed for CD activity at the start of the season and again 8 months later (end of the season) at the same tournament. The legs were divided into dominant and nondominant instead of left and right, according to the racket arm: For right-handed players, the right leg was the dominant and vice versa. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee of Copenhagen (KF:01-045/03).</p>

<sec id="section7-0363546511435478">
<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>The analysis of correlated data arising from repeated measurements and multiple body parts (tendons and regions) when the measurements are assumed to be multivariate normal statistically calls for the use of a hierarchical model. When the outcome measure is discrete (ie, either binary or polytomous), the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) fits statistical models to data with correlations or nonconstant variability, where the response is not normally distributed. In the model, badminton player is applied as a random effect factor, whereas tendon, region, and side (dominant vs nondominant) are applied as fixed factors. Likewise, when modeling the data over time, a fixed factor for time is applied. As it was anticipated that some different patterns could apply across participants having abnormal CD US without pain, and vice versa, we also report the actual count data from the marginal model using the total numbers of assessment in the denominator, although without estimation of any statistical inference parameters.</p>

<p>Basic characteristics of the players are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546511435478">Table 1</xref>. All players entering the tournament at the start of the season and again at the end of the season were recruited. Of the 86 players who completed the follow-up, a total of 344 tendons were scanned (86 players × 4 tendons; Achilles and anterior knee tendons on both sides in each player). This resulted in 1032 anatomic tendon regions (344 tendons × 3 tendon regions; the Achilles tendon was divided into midtendon, preinsertional, and insertional [calcaneal] regions, and the anterior knee tendons were divided into quadriceps, patellar, and tuberositas tibiae regions) applicable in the US assessments.</p>

<title>Current Pain Symptom and Development</title>
<p>At the start of the season, 24 players (24/86, 28%) had current pain in 37 tendons (37/344, 11%) entering the tournament; 10 players (10/86, 12%) had pain in more than one tendon. Of these 37 painful tendons, 7 Achilles tendons (3 on the dominant side; 4 on the nondominant side) and 30 anterior knee tendons (20 on the dominant side; 10 on the nondominant side) were painful (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546511435478">Table 2</xref>). At the end of the season, 31 players (31/86, 36%) had current pain in 51 tendons (51/344, 15%); 16 players (16/86, 19%) had pain in more than one tendon.

The overall increase in number of players with painful tendons from the start to the end of the season, primarily driven by changes in the Achilles tendons, was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = .0002).

Abnormal intratendinous flow in the different regions was lower after the season, corresponding to 78 tendon regions (78/1032, 8%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546511435478">Table 3</xref>). This was also supported by a statistically highly significant lower number of tendon regions with abnormal flow after the season compared with the start of the season (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) using the GLMM approach. Looking at the color fraction (CF) measured as the color pixel inside the ROI at the start to the end of the season, the mean CF decreased in all tendon regions apart from the insertion region of the dominant Achilles tendon and the midportion of the nondominant Achilles tendon (see the Appendix, available in the online version of this article at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/">http://ajs.sagepub.com/supplemental/</ext-link>).</p>

Also, players with current pain but normal flow at the start of the season (12 tendons) were reduced to 7 (7/12, 58%) painful tendons with normal flow at the end of the season. Only one tendon with current pain but normal flow at the start of the season (1/12, 8%) had developed abnormal flow but was pain free at the end of the season (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363546511435478">Table 4</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study on semiprofessional badminton players showed a significant decrease in intratendinous flow in nearly all regions in the Achilles and anterior knee tendons during a single season (8-month period). Only 17% of the players had “normal” intratendinous flow (ie, no visual flow) at the start of the season compared with 52% at the end of the season. The decrease in intratendinous flow in the players during the season was evenly distributed throughout the tendon regions. In contrast, a significant increase in tendon pain among the players was seen during the season primarily in the Achilles tendons. Furthermore, no association was found between tendons with intratendinous flow and current pain neither at the beginning nor at the end of the season. Thus, it was not possible to confirm the hypothesis regarding a clear association between CD and pain.</p>

<p>Looking at the association between intratendinous flow and pain among semiprofessional players in our study, a significant decrease in intratendinous flow in almost all tendon regions of the Achilles and anterior knee tendons was found over the season. Despite the decrease in intratendinous flow, a number of previously normal tendons throughout the regions developed pain. At the start of the season, abnormal intratendinous flow in at least one tendon region was found in the majority of the players (83%). Accordingly, 68% of the painful tendons at the start of the season had abnormal intratendinous flow, whereas 85% of the tendons with abnormal intratendinous flow at the start of the season were pain free.</p>
<p>After the season, abnormal intratendinous flow was only found in 18% of all tendons, despite an increase in the number of tendons with pain. Only 35% of the tendons with pain at the end of the season had abnormal flow. Thus, these data do not support an association between abnormal intratendinous flow and pain.</p>

<p>In healthy sedentary individuals, it has been shown that unaccustomed exercise leads to an increase in intratendinous flow in the Achilles tendon without the formation of pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511435478">8</xref></sup> The increase in intratendinous flow was also found in the Achilles and anterior knee tendons in 46 elite badminton players during a tournament, and no clear significant correlation between the increase in intratendinous flow and pain among the players was found, although a tendency to a correlation between self-reported pain and the highest amount of intratendinous flow in the patellar tendon could be found.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511435478">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511435478">29</xref></sup> However, no threshold in the amount of intratendinous flow could be established to distinguish between painful and nonpainful anterior knee tendons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511435478">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511435478">29</xref></sup> Furthermore, elite badminton players were followed during a tournament, and intratendinous flow was increased in all players after 1 or 2 matches with no association to pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511435478">6</xref></sup> Another recent study looked at Doppler activity in 61 badminton players and also found no association with pain but an association with the number of training hours per week, suggesting that flow may be a response to mechanical load.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546511435478">34</xref></sup> This is supported by the present results and indicates that intratendinous flow is not always a sign of a pathological disorder but rather a part of a normal physiological adaptive loading response. A study followed 22 elite junior volleyball players during a 3-year period and found no significant correlation between clinical symptoms and abnormal gray-scale US and vascularity changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511435478">23</xref></sup> The result showed that players with normal clinical test and US findings at the start of the study were associated with a low risk of developing symptoms or abnormal US findings during the 3-year follow-up period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511435478">23</xref></sup> This fits nicely with the present results, in which the majority of the tendons that were found to have normal flow at the start of the season still had normal flow after 8 months. The same group of volleyball players was matched with sedentary controls. Analysis of the clinical symptoms and intratendinous flow showed that these symptoms were more common among volleyball players but that still a relatively high number of asymptomatic tendons in both groups demonstrated intratendinous flow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511435478">24</xref></sup> These studies taken together indicate that athletes have a higher amount of intratendinous flow compared with sedentary individuals.</p>
<p>In some studies, the relationship between intratendinous flow and pain has been found to correlate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511435478">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511435478">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546511435478">35</xref></sup> and based on biopsies from Achilles tendinopathy patients, vasculoneural in-growth has been suggested to be partly responsible for the formation of pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511435478">3</xref></sup> Along this line, the presence of glutamate, a mediator of pain in the central nervous system, in the painful and hypervascularized area has also been demonstrated in chronic painful Achilles tendinopathies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511435478">4</xref></sup> However, this study only included 4 patients with a painful nodule in the Achilles tendon and compared them with 5 patients with normal Achilles tendons, and it does not explain asymptomatic tendons with intratendinous flow or vice versa, as other studies have now shown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511435478">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511435478">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546511435478">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, only 5% of the 131 pain-free tendons with abnormal intratendinous flow at the start of the season developed pain and still had abnormal flow at the end of the season. The majority (73%) of the 131 pain-free tendons with abnormal intratendinous flow at the start of the season normalized (no pain and normal flow) at the end of the season, and 92% of tendons with pain but normal intratendinous flow had not developed abnormal intratendinous flow at the end of the season. Thus, it was not possible to confirm the second hypothesis, namely, that pain-free tendons with abnormal intratendinous flow at the start of the season would develop pain during the season or vice versa. This indicates that abnormal intratendinous flow with no pain at the start of a season is not a predictor of injury during the next 8 months. The increase in intratendinous flow at the start of the season compared with the end of the season may also be a normal physiological response to intensified training. This fits well with the fact that the majority of the players in the present study had intensified their training a few weeks before the first measurements, explaining the high number of tendons with intratendinous flow, and during the season, the players (tendons) get used to the training load.</p>
<p>In clinical practice, clinicians only see symptomatic patients with potential increased flow and pain. Furthermore, CD is used in clinical practice to follow different treatment regimens on tendinopathy. Looking at the present players with current tendon pain at the start of the season, 68% of the tendons had abnormal intratendinous flow (grades 2-5). However, at the end of the season, only 35% of the tendons with current pain demonstrated abnormal intratendinous flow. Thus, even in the players experiencing pain, no clear association between intratendinous flow and current pain could be verified. The pain tolerance for our participants (competitive semiprofessional athletes) is probably higher compared with that in sedentary individuals. Earlier studies showed a high number of elite badminton players played with tendon pain and accepted playing with pain as part of the game.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511435478">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546511435478">29</xref></sup> This is important to have in mind in the clinician’s everyday practice: the anticipation of pain tolerance and US findings between athletes and sedentary individuals.</p>
<p>In this study, the anterior knee tendons were scanned with the knee flexed 15°. The tendons are slightly strained in that position, and intratendinous flow is thereby limited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546511435478">30</xref></sup> The correct position to examine intratendinous flow with CD is with the knee fully extended and relaxed, which we did not know when the study was performed. If we had used the fully extended and relaxed position, we expect that we would have found even more intratendinous Doppler activity also in tendons apparently without flow in this study. Therefore, we may have underestimated the amount of intratendinous flow in the patellar tendon in this study. Finally, US equipment is becoming more sensitive along with lower costs on high-end equipment. We speculate that Doppler US now identifies some of the normal flow in the tendons, which was not possible on older machines. Therefore, grading systems also need to be modified accordingly.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There was no association between intratendinous flow in the Achilles and anterior knee tendons and current pain at the start of the season or at follow-up 8 months later (end of the season). Intratendinous flow did not predict symptomatic outcome during an 8-month-long badminton season. The decrease in Doppler activity over the season may suggest that intratendinous flow is part of a physiological adaptive response to load and is not always pathological. Our data challenge the use of CD as the main indicator used by many clinicians to evaluate the severity of tendinopathy or the prognosis of tendinopathy especially in athletes. Further data to support these findings are necessary.</p>
