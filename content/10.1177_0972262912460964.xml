<p>Global economy has never been more competitive and open than today. Globalization has levelled the economic landscape in a way that potential competition can emerge almost everywhere and easily cross market, industry and geographic barrier to challenge dominant positions of current leaders. The instability of the economic scenario makes competitive advantages linked to positional rents less and less defendable and forces companies to engage in a difficult race in which only the most innovative players increase their chances of survival.</p>
<p>In such a scenario innovation is the only strategy left to companies to create and defend their competitive advantage and to nurture sustainable growth. Increasingly innovation and the consequent creation of business opportunities are technology based.</p>
<p>Thus, it is extremely beneficial to improve our understanding on how technological changes enable new business development and how entrepreneurs can be better positioned at capturing those opportunities. For such a reason <italic>Entrepreneurship and Technological Change</italic> is a greatly welcome contribution.</p>
<p>There is a growing interest among policy planners in both the public and private sectors about entrepreneurship and aspects of the consequences of successful entrepreneurship, namely innovation and technological change. This interest is a natural result of the shift towards a knowledge-based economy, as well as the substantial increase in public investment in knowledge-based institutions (e.g., universities), knowledge generating public programmes (e.g., public funded research institutions) and knowledge sharing activities (e.g., public and private partnerships and research consortia).</p>
<p>Understanding the antecedents and consequences of entrepreneurship and innovation is critical because technological change has been shown to be related to improvements in economic performance at all economic levels—at the firm, among firms in industry and at the regional and national levels. Universities are increasingly being viewed by both themselves and policy planners as engines of regional economic growth and development because of their role in the commercialization of intellectual property through technological transfer. The primary commercial mechanisms for technology transfer are licensing agreements, research joint ventures and university based start-ups.</p>
<p>The book under view provides an overview of the burgeoning literature on entrepreneurship, innovation and technological change with an emphasis on the nexus among these concepts and activities as related to regional economic growth and development.</p>
<p>The structure of the text consists of three parts. The first part provides conceptual roots for the interaction of entrepreneurship and change in the technological domain, while the second part focuses on the notion of renewal that can be associated with entrepreneurial behaviour and results from technological change, both exogenous and endogenous to the firm, either in industries or in regions. The third and last part maps frameworks which derive from innovation literature (and are normally adopted to explain patterns of technological change), by explicitly listing them with the entrepreneurship construct.</p>
<p><italic>Entrepreneurship and Technological Change</italic> includes a set of chapters that results from a collaborative process intended for collecting fresh empirical evidence to be interpreted according to the most recent theoretical advancements. The key contributions of each study are described in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p>In Chapter One, Lucio Cassia, Tommaso Minola and Stefano Paleari, through the revision of a large amount of theoretical and empirical papers in the field, have shed new light on technological entrepreneurship linking it to (strategies) innovation forms. The study also suggested entrepreneurship as the antecedent of innovation in the generation of firm performance.</p>
<p>In Chapter Two, Franziska Giinzel and Helge Wilker studied the use of technology in new ventures, in ways that result in change in the business model in order to enhance the start-ups’ ability to act successfully in the market. The authors have identified three main types of relationships: technology adopting, technology intensive and technology advancing. However, the approach followed in this analysis has several limitations of location and industry bias.</p>
<p>In Chapter Three, Ingrid Roaldsen and Odd Jarl Borch claimed that R&amp;D alliances not only contribute to the entrepreneurship strategy, but they may also provide input for an inter-organizational design of the value system creating a more adequate open configuration of the firm. However, the study fails to investigate the role of R&amp;D alliances in speeding up the process of changing the value chain and the business model of the firm.</p>
<p>In Chapter Four, Thomas Hedner, Ivor Cowlrick, Roland Wolf, Michael Olausson and Magnus Klofsten’s study indicates that entrepreneurial attitudes and intentions are perceived to be of high value to the very early strategic selection and validation of the drug target area as well as the immediate pre- and post-marketing periods. This study seems to be more on hypothesis generating rather than hypothesis testing and therefore needs to be tested in larger perspective studies.</p>
<p>In Chapter Five, Moreno Muffatto and Paolo Giacon investigated what the drivers of the entrepreneurial high-tech investments are and how they can be conceptualized and assessed. From the case studies, it emerges that every technological investment is an engine and a generator of entrepreneurial opportunities. The study, based on preliminary evidence, further concluded that the idea of linking the entrepreneurial behaviours of single actors to the change at industrial level can be considered a potential contribution for developing further research.</p>
<p>In Chapter Six, Peter Svensson’s study has shown that local actors can collaborate to reduce knowledge filter barriers and to mobilize resources for increasing the knowledge base in order to do so. This study has dedicated these resources to facilitating the commercialization of an emerging technology and has used them to create local as well as international networks, a prototype factory and a meeting place for the regional actors involved. This has led to business opportunities and many entrepreneurial commercialization efforts by a variety of actors.</p>
<p>In Chapter Seven, Lucio Cassia, Alfredo De Massis and Tommaso Minola attempted to shed some light on the complex issue of corporate venturing from a managerial point of view. In particular, it explains several ways through which technological change and innovation can occur through an entrepreneurial system that enables the aggregation of knowledge and the acquisition of resources. The study has explored one and, therefore, further research could be aimed at refining the decision framework by introducing the possibility of assigning a specific weight to the different factors based on the relative importance attributed by the decision maker to each one.</p>
<p>In Chapter Eight, Lene Foss, Tatiana Lakovleva, Jill Kickul, Elin Oftedal and Anne Solheim linked the literature of product innovation to entrepreneurial agency through identifying the challenges that entrepreneurs face within an industrial environment where technological innovation is a core value and ‘King’. Empirical data of this study illustrate three types of discontinuous innovation: radical disruptive, radical sustaining and incremental disruptive. To replicate this study across industries, future research should employ comparative studies to examine whether these strategies are important when dealing with radical and potentially disruptive technology in other industries. It might also be useful to explore the ‘pattern’ of innovative firms along technology and market dimensions and compare this pattern across industries.</p>
<p>In Chapter Nine, Dries Faems, Klaasjan Visscher and Fleur Lamers’s study provides specific guidelines to managers of entrepreneurial firms on how to realize sustainable exploration. To substantiate further, the study, therefore, encourages future research on exploration patterns that complements respondents’ impression of the evolution of exploration with more objective indicators of explorative activities.</p>
<p>In Chapter Ten, Celine Viala and Catherine Leger-Jarniou studied the use of organizational levels required to implement corporate entrepreneurship. This study suggests a new conceptual model which represents a framework more adapted to analyze the implementation of corporate entrepreneurship within the organizations. The corporate entrepreneurship dynamic can be deployed by activating eight levers, namely, strategy, HR management, structures, culture, control, communication, resources and IT system.</p>
<p>In Chapter Eleven, Letizia Mortara, Johann Napp, Simon Ford and Tim Minshall studied how the concepts of corporate entrepreneurship and open innovation overlap on many accounts.</p>
<p>The book has been successful in achieving two purposes for which this has been compiled. First, various essays in the book concentrate on the explanation of entrepreneurial initiatives, at both firm and collaborative levels, which have been left out substantially in literature and secondly but equally relevant purpose of this book is the diffusion of stimuli and thoughts of the dynamics and implications of entrepreneurial innovation and technological change.</p>
<p>In nutshell, the book contributes to a better understating of the link between technological change and entrepreneurship, thus filling a gap in the debate which is rather biased by the dominance of the US economy. Together with the uncommon approach to technology entrepreneurship, I hope that the community of integrated scholars will receive this volume as a suggestive exercise and a stimulus for further and deeper research.</p>
