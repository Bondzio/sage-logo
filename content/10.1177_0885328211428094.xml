<abstract>
<p>Osteogenic responses of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) were compared on square-patterned, inverse square-patterned, and planar titanium, chromium, diamond-like carbon (DLC), and tantalum; hypothesis was that both the materials and patterns affect osteogenesis. Samples were produced using photolithography and physical vapor deposition. Early-marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and mid-markers, small body size and mothers against decapentaplegic-related protein-1 (SMAD1), runt-related transcription factor-2 (RUNX2), and osteopontin were studied using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. ALP and hydroxyapatite, were colorimetrically studied. ALP reached highest values on both patterned titanium samples, but mid-markers disclosed that it was already lagging behind planar and inverse patterned tantalum. Hydroxyapatite formation disclosed that osteo-induced hMSCs passed all the differentiation stages (except on planar chromium). Presence of hydroxyapatite disclosed that both types of patterning promoted (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) osteogenesis compared to planar samples. Results suggest that the osseocompatibility/integration of implants could be improved by changing the monotonous and featureless implant–host interface into micro-patterned interface to provide physical differentiation cues.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0885328211428094" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is envisioned that in the future the use of intelligent implants, like biomedical micro-electro-mechanical systems (bioMEMS), will increase. These devices offer opportunities for medical advances such as transplantation of therapeutic cells, controlled and targeted drug delivery, and implantable biosensors for on-line diagnostics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211428094">1</xref></sup> BioMEMS are typically constructed from two types of materials: silicon and metal-patterned silicon. Silicon compounds commonly enable device function, whereas a patterned silicon surface serves as the functional basis of many biosensing devices. The patterned areas directly interact with analytes such as proteins and cells functioning as sensing elements, while the background substrate remains passive to analyte deposition to ensure a high signal-to-noise ratio.</p>
<p>The biocompatibility and analyte compatibility of MEMS materials have not been investigated until recently. Earlier, these devices were packaged or encapsulated to avoid direct contact with tissues and body fluids. Biocompatibility is a surface-mediated property and the biocompatibility of a device depends on those materials in contact with tissues. The advent of implantable MEMS devices that interact directly with the body constituents has made the biocompatibility of silicon and other MEMS materials much more important. In spite of adequate performance in some tests,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211428094">2</xref></sup> it is feared that the potential cytotoxic responses limit the applicability of MEMS in biological systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211428094">3</xref></sup> Hence, there is the need to develop coatings that can be used to improve the biocompatibility and long-term performance of implantable bioMEMS devices.</p>
<p>In bone, biosensing devices could monitor mechanical strains indicative of bone loss,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211428094">4</xref></sup> the pressure and force patterns of bone being incorporated in a healing spinal fusion <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211428094">5</xref></sup> and tissue engineering events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211428094">6</xref></sup> Drug delivery devices in bone could be used for a controlled release of growth factors to allograft bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211428094">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>A rapidly established and stable connection between an implant surface and the surrounding tissue is an important prerequisite for the long-term success of implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211428094">8</xref></sup> Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) differentiating to osteoblasts play an important role in osseointegration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211428094">9</xref></sup> Stem cells differentiate into several somatic cells when subjected to appropriate environmental cues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211428094">10</xref></sup> It was recently shown that surface patterning plays a significant role in the differentiation of MSCs to adipocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211428094">11</xref></sup> and in the kinetics of adipogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211428094">12</xref></sup> It has been speculated that progenitor cells rely on spatial information for differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211428094">13</xref></sup> and that a balanced focal adhesion-mediated cell signaling could be critical for the differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) to bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211428094">14</xref></sup> Our previous research showed that the micro-patterned surfaces are cytocompatible for both differentiated osteoblast-like cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211428094">15</xref></sup> and their pluripotent mesenchymal progenitors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211428094">16</xref></sup> Due to the potential role of hMSCs in osseointegration of implants, the aim of this study was to study the effect of micro-patterning on MSC-osteoblast differentiation. This study compares the osteogenic responses of hMSCs on square-patterned and inverse square-patterned samples with planar nonpatterned control samples composed of titanium, chromium, diamond-like carbon (DLC), or tantalum. The present hypothesis was that both the materials used, and their patterning, affect the osteogenic capacity of hMSCs.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0885328211428094"><title>Pattern designs</title>
<p>The photomasks for the photolithography processes were commercially produced by Mikcell Ltd. (Ii, Finland) using a layout designed with CleWin layout software (Wieweb software, Hengelo, The Netherlands). The soda-lime glass plate with a structured chrome layer consists of two mask patterns repeated several times to enable batch fabrication. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211428094">Figure 1</xref> represents the layout of the samples. The first pattern set was used to produce micro-patterned biomaterial surfaces which contained regularly spaced 75 × 75 µm<sup>2</sup> covered with titanium, chromium, DLC, and tantalum squares (square-patterned samples). The distance between the adjacent squares was 100 µm, so that the patterns coated 18.4% of the total sample surface area. Uncoated 100 × 100 µm<sup>2</sup> silicon squares were produced 75 µm apart alternatively on Ti, Cr, DLC, or Ta background so that the silicon features occupied 32.7% of the total sample surface area (inverse square-patterned samples). Samples of titanium, chromium, DLC, and tantalum without patterning were fabricated as planar control samples.

<sec id="sec4-0885328211428094"><title>Ultraviolet lithography</title>
<p>Polished 2 in. silicon wafers (p-type) with crystal orientation &lt;100&gt; (Si-Mat, Landsberg am Lech, Germany) were used as the substrate material. Wafers were dry-baked at 200°C and coated with 20% hexamethylsilazane (Riedel-de Haen Laborchemikalien, Seelze, Germany) in xylene to remove moisture and to enhance the adhesion between photoresist and silicon. A negative photoresist (ma-N 1420, Micro Resist Technology GmbH, Berlin, Germany) was spun at 5000 rpm for 30 s and baked on a hot plate for 2 min at 100°C. Pre-treated wafers were exposed to a 365 nm UV light with a Karl Suss MA45 exposure tool (Suss MicroTec Inc., Waterbury Center, VT, USA) through the photomask for 14 s. Unexposed photoresist was removed by immersing 1.5 min in ma-D 533s developer bath (Microresist Technology GmbH) and followed by rinsing in deionized water.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0885328211428094"><title>Direct current sputtering</title>
<p>Thin films of Ti, Ta, or Cr were deposited on photoresist-covered wafers using magnetron sputtering technique (Stiletto Serie ST20, AJA International Inc., North Scituate, MA, USA) in argon plasma with high-purity (99.9% or better) target materials (Goodfellow Metals, Huntingdon, UK). An acceleration voltage of 400–500 V, a chamber pressure of 3–4 × 10<sup>−4</sup> mbar, and a deposition time of 5 min were used to deposit approximately 200 nm thick films.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0885328211428094"><title>Plasma vapor deposition</title>
<p>Filtered pulsed plasma arc discharge method was used to deposit DLC films on the patterned Si wafers. In this method, plasma pulses are created by igniting a vacuum arc between a cathode and a ring-shaped anode. Plasma pulse is then accelerated through an anode and a solenoid toward a sample where the plasma causes the deposition of a thin film. The system operates in pulses with a 1–7 Hz repetition frequency. The high-energy plasma was used to produce adhesion layer and generated by acceleration using a capacitor (<italic>C</italic> = 16.0 μF) voltage of <italic>U</italic> = 6000 V. Plasma was steered toward the sample with a magnetic field generated by the arc discharge current in a 90° curved solenoid. The curved solenoid filters out neutral atoms and graphite particles emitted from the cathode. After deposition of an adhesion layer, the main portion of a 200 nm thick film was deposited with a low-energy deposition unit run at 500 V average voltage for about 15 min.</p>
<p>After deposition, the wafers were immersed in a mr-Rem 660 resist remover (Microresist Technology GmbH) in an ultrasonic bath for a few minutes to remove the photoresist. Thin films deposited on the top of photoresist were lifted off with the dissolving resist and revealed the final micro-patterns. Wafers were finally cut to 10 × 10 mm<sup>2</sup> samples before sonication for a few minute in 7 × detergent (OneMed Ltd., Vantaa, Finland), ethanol, and deionized water to remove organic residues and silicon dust from dicing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0885328211428094"><title>Sample sterilization</title>
<p>Prior to using samples for cell culture studies, the samples were immersed in 70% ethanol in Petri-dishes for 30 min after which most of the ethanol was removed and the rest left to vaporize for 20 min. Ethanol-treated samples were packed in sterile packs and sterilized with gamma irradiation with a total dose of 31.8 kGy at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland using a Co-60 source (Gammacell 220, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, Mississauga, Canada).</p>

<sec id="sec8-0885328211428094"><title>Measurement of zeta-potentials</title>
<p>Zeta-potentials of the sample surfaces were measured using an electrokinetic analyzer for solid samples (SurPASS, Anton Paar GmbH, Austria) in pH 7.09 ± 0.03 in 1 mM KCl. All samples were measured in duplicates (i.e., two pairs) using an adjustable gap cell on which the samples were mounted. The measurements were repeated three times from all pairs. The zeta-potential was evaluated from streaming current measurements according to the Helmholtz–Smoluchowski equation:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211428094">17</xref></sup>

<sec id="sec9-0885328211428094"><title>Cell cultures</title>
<p>Human bone marrow-derived MSCs (Poietics™, Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) were cultured on 10 cm Petri dishes (Corning Inc., New York, NY, USA) using Lonza Mesenchymal Stem Cell Growth Medium (MSCGM) containing Mesenchymal Cell Growth Supplement, <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and GA-1000 (Gentamicin/Amphotericin-B). The cells were cultured at 37°C in humid 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in air. The cell monolayer was washed twice with 10 mM phosphate-buffered 140 mM saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and the cells were detached using 2.5 mg/mL trypsin in PBS-EDTA (0.05 mL/cm<sup>2</sup>) at room temperature for 5 min. An equal volume of temperature-equilibrated MSCGM was added. The suspension was transferred to a Falcon tube and trypsin removed by centrifugation at 600 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in culture medium and seeded onto the biomaterial samples using the recommended 0.3 × 10<sup>4 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup> cell density. At 24 h after seeding, MSCGM was replaced by Osteogenesis Induction Medium (Lonza) containing supplements and growth factors (ascorbate, ß-glycerophosphate, dexamethasone, mesenchymal cell growth supplement, <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin). Induced hMSCs were fed every 3–4 days with fresh Osteogenesis Induction Medium. Uninduced control hMSCs were fed with MSCGM using the same schedule to obtain negative controls for qRT-PCR from all sample types and for colorimetry from patterned titanium. The development of the osteoblastic phenotype was followed using early, mid-term, and late osteoblastic differentiation markers described below. Tissue culture-treated polystyrene 12-well microplates (Corning Inc., New York, USA) were used in all experiments. Human bone marrow-derived MSCs used in the experiments were 6th passage cells.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0885328211428094"><title>Quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction</title>
<p>The 14 - and 21-day uninduced and induced samples were transferred to new plates for total RNA extraction using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Complementary first-strand DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 30 ng of total RNA using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) for ALP, Sma/small body size, and Mad/mothers against decapentaplegic-related protein-1 SMAD1, runt-related transcription factor-2 (RUNX2), osteopontin (OP), and β-actin was performed using iQ5 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). For primer sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328211428094">Table 1</xref>), the corresponding sequences were searched in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Entrez search system, with sequence similarity searches carried out using the NCBI BLAST program. The primers designed were produced by Oligomer (Helsinki, Finland). A master mix of the following reaction components was prepared: 1 µL primer mix (forward and reverse primer concentrations 5 µM), 7 µL dH<sub>2</sub>O, and 10 µL IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad); 2 µL of cDNA was added to 18 µL of the master mix. The real-time PCR program was composed of initial denaturation for 3 min at 95°C, then 45° cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 s, annealing at 60°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s, followed by a melting step with ramping to 95°C (0.5°C/step). The standard curves were generated for β-actin by assessing serial cDNA dilutions (ten-fold dilution for six logarithms). Results were analyzed using the comparative C<sub>t</sub> method. All analyses for standard curves and samples were performed in duplicates and repeated twice.

<p>The 14-day uninduced and induced samples were washed twice with PBS, transferred to a 24-well plate, and washed again with PBS. Also 100 µL of Passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added to wells and the plate was rocked for 15 min; 30 µL aliquots of lysates were transferred to 96-well plates and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was measured using SIGMAFAST™ p-Nitrophenyl phosphate tablets (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA). Stain solution was made according to manufacturer’s instructions and 200 µL of the solution was added to each well for 30 min in dark. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured using a Multiskan Ex-Photometric plate reader (Labsystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Finland). Each sample type was analyzed in triplicates and the ALP activity of induced cellular samples was compared with that of uninduced cellular controls.

<sec id="sec12-0885328211428094"><title>Mineralization</title>
<p>In this study, 28-day uninduced and induced samples were washed twice with PBS, transferred to a 24-well plate, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min. Mineral deposits were stained using a hydroxyapatite (HA) specific OsteoImage™ Mineralization Assay (Lonza) according to manufacturer’s instructions, after which samples were counterstained with DAPI (1:1000 in dH<sub>2</sub>O; Sigma) nuclear stain for 10 min. Samples were washed twice in PBS and once in dH<sub>2</sub>O before mounting in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Ltd., Peterborough, England) and coverslipping. Minerals were visualized using an Olympus AX70 fluorescence imaging microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Minerals were measured from a 25-point (5 × 5 mm<sup>2</sup>) matrix from each sample using Plate CHAMELEON V (Chameleon Systems, Ruislip, UK; 485 nm filter for excitation and 535 nm filter for emission) for plate reading. To ensure equal number of cells in the samples, nuclei were imaged from four locations from each sample and counted using color-based segmentation and watershed algorithm in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, USA). One sample of each sample type was used for the analysis.</p>

<sec id="sec19-0885328211428094" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Logically, after we had clarified that the micro-textured surfaces are cytocompatible for both differentiated osteoblast-like cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211428094">15</xref></sup> and their pluripotent MSC progenitors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211428094">16</xref></sup> it became necessary to check if such surfaces also allow successful osteogenic MSC-osteoblast trans-differentiation. The previous reports show that both cell types prefer titanium, tantalum, chromium, and DLC over silicon at early time points (7.5 h for hMSCs), but this effect of guidance is lost when the cells are close to confluency (5 days for hMSCs). The previous work also disclosed that the average surface roughness <italic>R<sub>a</sub></italic> was below 2 nm for all studied surfaces, and thus the only relevant topographical cues of the samples studied are the steps (height differences) between the patterns and the background (200 nm).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211428094">16</xref></sup> This refutes the risk that the clear-cut differences seen between different materials and patterns would have been due to differences in surface topography and instead suggests that the differences observed and discussed below are mediated by different chemical compositions and physical patterns of the materials studied.</p>
<p>The early osteogenesis marker ALP was at day 14 both at the mRNA and enzyme activity level highly expressed on the square-patterned and inverse square-patterned titanium surfaces in MSC cultures induced to undergo osteoblastic differentiation. This could be interpreted so that especially the combination of titanium as the cellular substrate, together with patterning, favors a very rapid onset of bone formation. This would be compatible with the general idea of commercially pure titanium being a biocompatible implant material, which is easily osseointegrated and therefore much used in dental implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211428094">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to the initial conclusion mentioned above, all three mid-term markers SMAD1, RUNX2, and OP showed relatively similar profiles, which clearly contradict this interpretation. Also, in this comparison, titanium did relatively well compared with chromium and DLC, but when consideration was paid to all three mid-term biomarkers and on all types of samples, inverse square-patterned, and/or planar tantalum samples looked as the most MSC/osteoblast-friendly substrates. At first, it seems somewhat paradoxical that ALP was so much higher on square-patterned and inverse square-patterned titanium samples than on the corresponding tantalum samples, but this is probably explained by the transient expression ALP during the early phase bone formation and its subsequent down-regulation during the intermediate phase of bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211428094">19</xref></sup> This is compatible with the idea that tantalum and trabecular tantalum are also very bone-friendly biomaterials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211428094">20</xref></sup> In contrast, zeta-potentials of the different materials studied did not clearly associate with any particular aspect of osteogenesis.</p>
<p>It was already mentioned above that biomaterial as well as its patterning seem to play a role for osteoinduction. A third factor of apparent importance emerging from the current data relates to the cell density. Patterned titanium had the highest ALP mRNA and enzyme activity values and looks good at the first sight. Similarly, particularly planar nonpatterned and inverted square-patterned tantalum look quite bad from this point of view because the ALP values in these samples were very low at day 14, lying at the same level as in uninduced control cells. At the second look, planar and inverse tantalum samples have clearly highest levels of all mid-term markers, with the results of all three mid-term markers confirming each other. This suggests that MSCs undergoing osteogenesis had on planar and inverse tantalum samples already passed the early phase osteogenesis and were already engaged in the mid-term differentiation. This fits also very well with the observation that at day 14, the ALP mRNA level was already very low on patterned tantalum samples indicating that the enzyme synthesis was already shut down, but the corresponding active enzyme protein was still somewhat elevated. Indeed, the very same day 14 tantalum samples contained the lowest levels of SMAD1, RUNX2, and OP as mid-term differentiation markers, highly significantly lower than these mid-term markers on the planar and inverse square-patterned tantalum samples. This and many other similar trends in the data suggest that the planar and inverted surfaces, which provide 100% and 67.3% MSC/osteoblast-friendly surface compared with the cell-unfriendly silicon background, respectively,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211428094">16</xref></sup> allow the cells to adhere and spread on the substrate, favoring their osteogenic differentiation. It has been earlier shown that MSC adherence, flattening, spreading, and cytoskeletal tension via activation of RhoA and its effector ROCK kinase, favor osteogenesis and disfavour adipogenesis. The cell seeding density used in this study, 3 × 10<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>, was indeed selected based on this earlier work, which also showed that higher plating densities, 10–25 × 10<sup>3 </sup>cm<sup>−2</sup>, lead to a rounded cell shape, which slows down osteogenesis but drives adipogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211428094">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, the late phase osteogenesis marker, bone mineral formation, clearly shows that MSCs were successfully induced to osteoblasts capable of making mineralized bone matrix. Uninduced control samples contained a few bone mineral nodules or deposits in the fluoromicrographs, and fluorescent hydroxyapatite values were very low compared with any of the samples, which were induced to osteogenesis. This is important, because in contrast to the early and mid-term ‘labile’ or transient markers, this late phase osteogenesis marker is not, in this cellular differentiation assay, transient but permanent, allowing two firm conclusions to be drawn. First, the formation of mineralized bone matrix confirms that the induced cells indeed passed all the early and mid-term differentiation stages analyzed (and also those not analyzed in this study) so that they finally reached the late differentiation state characterized by bone mineral deposition. Interestingly, only cells cultured on planar chromium samples did not, yet by day 28, significantly differ from uninduced control cells; indeed, pure chromium, in contrast to chromium, cobalt, and molybdenum alloys, is not a biomaterial. In contrast to planar chromium, patterning enabled bone mineral formation even on chromium containing cell-unfriendly samples. Second, these late phase marker studies confirm the most important conclusion of this study. They clearly demonstrate that the square-patterned and inverse square-patterned samples performed all better than any of the planar samples. As the cell density was lower on both types of patterned surfaces than on planar surfaces, the difference in the amount of minerals formed per cells is even larger than the difference demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211428094">Figure 6</xref>. Among all the assays and time points analyzed in this study, this is the only one which allows this conclusion to be firmly drawn because bone mineral formation is, so to say, ‘the primary outcome’ in this type of study, and because hydroxyapatite measurements at 28 days showed that mineralization was very much more advanced on patterned and inverse-patterned samples than on planar samples, these differences being also statistically highly significant (all <italic>p</italic>-values were at least &lt;0.001).</p>
<p>It is well known that the topography affects the wettability of the surfaces, which in part regulates cellular responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211428094">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211428094">23</xref></sup> In this study, the only topographical cue for the cells was the edge of the patterns. The surface roughness for all samples studies was similar, with the average surface roughness being &lt;2 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211428094">16</xref></sup>). Also, the water contact angle was rather similar for both planar and patterned samples.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211428094">16</xref></sup> However, the patterning affected the diiodomethane contact angle: all patterned surfaces had a significantly higher contact angle (of diiodomethane) than their planar counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211428094">16</xref></sup> This is a new finding: the patterned samples have a lower dispersive surface energy component but a higher polar surface energy component than their patterned counterparts (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The effect of different surface energy components on cellular responses has not been studied, but this difference might, at least in part, explain why mineralization was improved by patterning of the surfaces.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-0885328211428094" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In conclusion, tantalum, titanium, DLC, and chromium seem to be osteogenesis-compatible materials, in this ranking order. Apart from these chemical cues, physical patterning cues also seem to play important roles for human bone marrow-derived MSCs, which are induced to osteogenesis. This is in part related to the cellular plating densities, because based on earlier reports and current results, osteogenesis is favored by cellular adherence and spreading, i.e., by enough area (space) available for individual cells to adhere to their substrate. It further seems that cells and cell collectives are able to sense the geometric physical cues so that patterned surfaces, be they square-patterned or inverse square-patterned, finally in the long run, always performed better than the planar samples in the late phase bone mineral formation assay. This suggests that the osseocompatibility and osseointegration of implants can be modulated by changing simple, monotonous, and featureless implant–host interfaces to micro-textured and patterned ones, which provide physical differentiation cues.</p>
