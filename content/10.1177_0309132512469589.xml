<p>There are increasing calls from the global environmental change research community for new strategies for translating knowledge into action. Such calls are not new, yet they are often based on the assumption that more solutions-oriented knowledge about environmental problems will lead to desired outcomes. In this progress report, I argue that it is time to shift attention to the issue of change itself, and to question some of the assumptions that reproduce certain types of knowledge and certain types of action over alternatives. I discuss an approach for challenging big assumptions, which draws greater attention to a broad body of social science research that renders many of the paradigmatic assumptions ambiguous or problematic. Finally, I consider the implications for human geography, including whether some of our own disciplinary assumptions are complicit in perpetuating paradigms that contribute to continued global environmental change.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>The environmental change research community seems to be struggling to make sense of the broad disconnect between knowledge and action. There is overwhelming scientific evidence that humanity needs to act quickly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect biodiversity, maintain ecosystem services, restore marine habitats, reduce social vulnerability, manage disaster risk, enhance food security, and respond to many other environmental risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309132512469589">IPCC, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309132512469589">Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309132512469589">UNEP, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309132512469589">UNISDR, 2011</xref>). Yet there appears to be little evidence of action at the pace and scale that is called for by the research. The Rio+20 Conference in 2012 did not add a great deal of optimism to the situation. Instead, society seems to be implicitly adapting to the notion of concatenated crises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132512469589">Biggs et al., 2010</xref>). Is it the role of the scientific community simply to shout louder, or are there other potential pathways towards action?</p>
<p>Increasingly, there are calls for developing new relationships between scientific knowledge and political and social action. For example, the ‘State of the planet declaration’ from the ‘Planet Under Pressure’ conference (2012) makes an appeal for a new, solutions-oriented approach to science:
<disp-quote>
<p>The international scientific community must rapidly reorganize to focus on global sustainability solutions. We must develop a new strategy for creating and rapidly translating knowledge into action, which will form part of a new contract between science and society, with commitments from both sides. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132512469589">Brito and Stafford Smith, 2012</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote> This is by no means a new idea; solutions-oriented approaches to science have been promoted in literatures ranging from sustainability science to action research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132512469589">Kates et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132512469589">Reason and Bradbury, 2006</xref>). Indeed, much has already been written on the science-policy interface, the role of boundary organizations, the communication of science, and the emergence of post-normal and even ‘post’ post-normal science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132512469589">Cash et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309132512469589">Moser and Dilling, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309132512469589">Ravetz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309132512469589">Vogel et al., 2007</xref>). Yet, although the linear model of translating knowledge into action has been long questioned by researchers, it is continually reproduced, based on the assumption that if people just knew, they would of course do something – and, since they are not, there is a need for policies that influence attitudes, behaviors, and choices (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309132512469589">Norgaard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309132512469589">Shove, 2010</xref>). This leaves one wondering whether the knowledge-action gap is caused by something that goes much deeper than the relationship between science and society. Is it possible that we are focusing on the wrong problem?</p>
<p>A problem can be defined as an unwelcome or harmful matter needing to be tackled or overcome, or alternatively as a thing that is difficult to achieve. There is no doubt that the environmental changes that are currently underway are unwelcome or harmful for many reasons, and thus considered to be problems. Addressing environmental change has proven remarkably challenging, and this itself can be seen as a problem. Common to both of these types of problems, however, is a focus on understanding and addressing what is happening to the global environment.</p>
<p>In this third progress report, I will consider that we may in fact be ‘barking up the wrong tree’ by assuming that more solutions-oriented knowledge about environmental problems will lead to the desired changes, or that working on science-policy or science-society interfaces is the best way forward. Although such approaches may eventually lead to the desired outcomes, I will argue that it may be more expedient to shift attention to the issue of <italic>change </italic>itself, including how humans individually and collectively approach change, why change is so often resisted or impeded, and, most important, how systems-scale changes towards sustainability come about. I argue that the gap between knowledge and action is unlikely to be addressed by a new contract between science and society. Instead, the science of global change may itself need to change – i.e. to become more reflective about its own assumptions and paradigms, including those relating to <italic>how</italic> change comes about.</p>
<p>This has important implications for human geography. Although the discipline brings together numerous strands of critical research on change (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0309132512469589">Castree et al., 2010</xref>), human geographers have not yet managed to challenge conventional framings of global environmental change research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132512469589">Gabrys and Yusoff, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309132512469589">Swyngedouw, 2010</xref>). In fact, one could argue that human geography risks falling into the ‘inevitability’ trap, accepting both the problem and the solutions as given, leaving little room for alternative thinking and focusing instead on the practicalities of reducing vulnerability through adaptation. It is easy to argue that human geographers can fill an important void, shifting the emphasis from <italic>environmental</italic> to <italic>change</italic> research. To do so, however, may call for the discipline itself to change.</p>

<title>II ‘We know enough …?’</title>
<p>There is little doubt that complex, non-linear, and potentially irreversible changes to the Earth system are currently underway, and that it is already too late to prevent some of these changes. Indeed, the problems of global environmental change are not simply messy and complex, but hyper-complex. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309132512469589">Scharmer (2009</xref>: 242–243) describes hyper-complex problems as those that exhibit: (1) dynamic complexity, where cause and effect are distant in space and time; (2) social complexity, where conflicting interests, cultures, and worldviews exist among diverse stakeholders; and (3) emergent complexity, defined by ‘disruptive patterns of innovation and change in situations in which the future cannot be predicted and addressed by the patterns of the past’.</p>
<p>Any glimpse through recent issues of scientific journals confirms that we know enough about current risks to take action. Scientists, aware of the implications of their research, are increasingly speaking out and calling for action, often through collective statements, proclamations, or pleas (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132512469589">Gleick et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512469589">Hooper et al., 2012</xref>). At the same time, there is also an enormous body of knowledge on the types of solutions that can promote sustainability. These include calls for new forms of global governance, socio-technical transitions, green economies, behavioral changes, and shifts in values and consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512469589">Barbier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132512469589">Kasser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309132512469589">Loorbach, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132512469589">Rifkin, 2009</xref>). Numerous plans and strategies illustrate that a transition to sustainability is technically possible, and case studies and examples from around the world document the changes that are already taking place, whether in relation to transition towns, ecovillages, alternative agriculture, green urbanism, or sustainable consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132512469589">Beatley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132512469589">Brown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309132512469589">Hopkins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132512469589">Jackson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309132512469589">Magnaghi, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309132512469589">Princen, 2005</xref>). In relation to global environmental change, the existing literature on both the problems and solutions suggests that the much-sought-after transition to sustainability is both necessary and feasible (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309132512469589">Hollender et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132512469589">Raskin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309132512469589">Senge et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>If the science-policy-practice communities arguably know enough about the problems and the potential solutions, why is it that greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase at record high rates, more species and ecosystems are becoming threatened or endangered, and food and water security is becoming even more precarious for many? As discussed above, a missing detail in pursuit of the great leap from knowledge to action may include a better understanding of <italic>how</italic> change comes about. How do ‘we’ change the systems and structures that perpetuate environmental problems, particularly when they are maintained by powerful interests, often including our own? How do behaviors change, particularly when they are firmly embedded in social practices? How can changes be scaled up so that they make a difference? Importantly, how can the potential for coercion, indoctrination, and oppression be reduced in the pursuit of change?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, it may be necessary to focus on understandings of change itself, in all of its dimensions. Change involves ‘to make or become different’, ‘to become new’, or ‘to move from one system or situation to another’. At one extreme, this definition includes the small, incremental changes that are hardly perceptible, and at the other extreme it includes dramatic and highly visible changes. Across this gradient, some changes may represent little more than ‘business as usual’, while others can be considered transformational, in that they lead to something very new and different (including ideas and perceptions of problems) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0309132512469589">O’Brien, 2012</xref>). Importantly, change involves more than the objective, measurable indicators of processes and outcomes that typically form the basis for monitoring and assessment programs. It also includes subjective elements, such as the conscious and unconscious assumptions, beliefs, values, identities, and emotions of individuals and groups that influence perceptions, interpretations, and actions. Subjective attitudes and approaches to change often play a larger role than acknowledged in the global change literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309132512469589">Kahan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309132512469589">Norgaard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132512469589">O’Brien, 2013</xref>). Understanding the interplay between subjective and objective approaches to change may be critical to closing the gap between knowledge and action on global environmental change.</p>

<title>III To change or not to change?</title>
<p>Climate change and biodiversity loss in particular are occurring at a rate, magnitude, and scale that appears to be unprecedented in the evolutionary history of human beings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132512469589">Hetherington and Reid, 2010</xref>). Their non-linear effects have widespread implications for ecosystem functions and Earth system processes, with consequences for both human and non-human species. Importantly, many global environmental risks are caused by human activities. While this is considered by many as evidence of ignorance and irresponsibility, it presents possibilities for agency and responsibility, offering humans the possibility to ‘change the change’. This, however, requires deliberate interventions, as well as a significant investment in resulting outcomes. Not surprisingly, this is where change becomes political, and where moral and ethical issues come to the forefront (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132512469589">Gardiner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309132512469589">Giddens, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309132512469589">Swyngedouw, 2010</xref>). Moreover, this is where the social sciences, humanities, law, and other fields become indispensable to global change research.</p>
<p>Addressing the issue of change is considered to be one of the transformative cornerstones of social science research for global change:
<disp-quote>
<p>The purpose here is to understand what drives individual and collective processes of change, as well as change in social practices. It is to identify what leadership and other capacities are required for successful change to occur, whilst being absolutely clear about the limitations and democratic pitfalls of deliberate processes of change. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309132512469589">Hackmann and St Clair, 2012</xref>: 18)</p>
</disp-quote> This cornerstone of research recognizes that an enormous amount of knowledge has been generated on social change, economic change, organizational change, technological change, and transformation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0309132512469589">O’Brien, 2012</xref>). However, much of this literature has not contributed to a better general understanding of how change occurs or, perhaps more importantly, why in many cases it does <italic>not</italic> occur.</p>
<p>Reviewing the massive literature on change is beyond the scope of this progress report, but arguably it remains far too fragmented to be directly useful for closing the gap between knowledge and action. The literature points to a growing number of theories, approaches, and recipes for change that are considered either competing or incompatible. As sociologist Elizabeth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309132512469589">Shove (2010</xref>: 1273) points out, most social science research has had only a minor impact on climate policy, ‘much of which revolves around a strikingly limited understanding of the social world and how it changes’. Reviewing policy-related reports and the models of change upon which they are based, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309132512469589">Shove (2010</xref>) critiques the widespread focus on attitude, behavior, and choice (ABC) as a model for climate change policy. An alternative model of social change, she argues, involves a weakening of the contemporary rules of the game, a questioning of the status quo, and the introduction of more sustainable regimes into all domains of daily life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309132512469589">Shove, 2010</xref>). Shove further maintains that a behavioral approach to change can be considered incommensurable with a social practices approach, with the latter challenging the dominant paradigm and hence ‘doomed to be forever marginal’ in a world where systems, structures, and institutions have been developed to realize competing goals that are largely incompatible with sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309132512469589">Shove, 2010</xref>: 1283).</p>
<p>Human geographer Erik <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309132512469589">Swyngedouw (2010</xref>) draws attention to the ‘post-political’ context in which climate change is currently discussed, a context that focuses attention on the external measured emissions of global CO<sub>2</sub>, rather than on the problems of unevenly distributed power relations, networks of control and influence, and rampant injustices of the ‘system’. The resulting populist approach to the problem, he contends, forecloses a political framing. In fact, he argues that ‘sustaining and nurturing apocalyptic imaginaries is an integral and vital part of the new cultural politics of capitalism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309132512469589">Swyngedouw, 2010</xref>: 219).</p>
<p>Ironically, in focusing on the need for a new contract between science and society in response to an urgent collective problem, the global change research community may be diverting attention away from the very systems and structures that contribute to environmental problems, and paying little attention to the paradigms and worldviews that underpin them. In a world where social, economic, political, technological, cultural, and environmental problems are intertwined in a hyper-complex system, the knowledge-action gap is not the problem. Instead, the problem is the particular types of knowledge and types of action that inhibit transformative change. For example, an enormous amount of time and energy has been spent on adjusting the ‘constants, parameters and numbers’ related to greenhouse gas emissions through international protocols, emissions trading schemes, new technologies, and other regulatory, managerial, and governance approaches. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309132512469589">Meadows (2008</xref>) suggests that this is the least effective leverage point for systems change, yet is where as much as 99% of the effort is placed.</p>
<p>If many social theories of change are not informing policy and action because they do not fit within currently favored paradigms, perhaps it is time to consider a different approach – one that does not emphasize specific solutions, but rather encourages scientists, decision-makers, and activists alike momentarily to step outside of their favorite paradigm to consider alternative possibilities. Drawing on Kegan and Lahey’s (2009) work on <italic>Immunity to Change</italic>, I describe below what can be considered the Challenge Big Assumptions (CBA) approach to closing of the gap between knowledge and action.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0309132512469589">
<title>IV Challenging big assumptions</title>
<p>Challenging big assumptions, as well as the beliefs that support them, can play a critical role in change processes, particularly those involving complex systems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309132512469589">Meadows (2008</xref>: 162) emphasizes the importance of exposing paradigmatic assumptions, or the shared ideas and ‘great big unstated assumptions’ that constitute our deepest beliefs about how the world works. In a world where environmental, social, political, and economic problems are intertwined, Meadows’ call for mental flexibility and the willingness to change seems highly apt. In fact, she argues that changing paradigms is one of the most effective leverage points for systems-scale change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309132512469589">Meadows, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In describing why people, organizations, and systems do not change, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132512469589">Kegan and Lahey (2009</xref>) use the metaphor of an immune system that is designed to protect against negative impacts, disequilibria, and anxiety. While an immune system plays a very important role in maintaining proper functioning of individuals, organizations, or groups, they note that it can be dangerous when it rejects new material that it needs in order to heal itself or to thrive. In an effort to maintain a dynamic equilibrium, the protection that an immune system creates may limit the capacity to take on new information and ideas. The immune system, they argue, is sustained by tenets in our mental models, or ‘big assumptions’ that are uncritically taken as true: ‘They may be true, and they may not be, but as long as we simply assume they are true, we are blind even to the question itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132512469589">Kegan and Lahey, 2009</xref>: 58). They point to the need to challenge the big assumptions that often unknowingly support actions or behaviors that are no longer useful.</p>
<p>The point of challenging big assumptions is not immediately to address questions of truth, but rather to be aware of the individual and collective mindsets that operate as though certain assumptions are <italic>always</italic> true. Some assumptions may need to be continually tested, particularly in light of new observations, evidence, and research findings. Challenging beliefs and assumptions is an essential part of the scientific process, and it can be considered a prerequisite for inter- and transdisciplinary research collaboration, as it can be used to connect with people who are operating with alternative paradigms, with different mental models, with competing commitments and with different assumptions and beliefs about how the world works. No matter in what domain one works, humans have a tendency to assume that their assumptions are valid.</p>
<p>What would a CBA model for addressing the knowledge-action gap look like? Kegan and Lahey’s (2009) approach involves four steps: (1) identify the goal; (2) identify what is happening instead; (3) identify hidden competing commitments, and (4) identify the big assumptions that underlie these competing commitments. Questioning these big assumptions provides an entry point for loosening the tight reign of mental models and paradigms, which often limit framings of both problems and solutions. It thus provides an important step for moving beyond business as usual.</p>

<title>V From knowledge to action</title>
<p>The ‘State of the planet declaration’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132512469589">Brito and Stafford Smith, 2012</xref>) statement discussed in the introduction provides an opportunity to interrogate some of the big underlying assumptions associated with collective thinking about ‘how’ to change.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Goal</italic>: ‘We must develop a new strategy for creating and rapidly translating knowledge into action’ (e.g. bring knowledge about the science of global change into policy, decisions and practices).</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>What is happening instead</italic>? Decision-makers are not doing enough; much of the public does not seem to be taking risks seriously, with fatalistic attitudes often dominating over individual and collective agency and action; many businesses and governments are rhetorically engaged yet perpetuating rather than challenging systems and social practices.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Competing commitments</italic>: There are many competing commitments associated with current actions to respond to environmental change, including: (a) many are committed to other goals (e.g. economic growth), as well as other problems that need to be urgently addressed (e.g. poverty, conflict, terrorism, health care); (b) many individuals, communities, countries and organizations are committed to modernization and development based on extractive and industrial models of economic growth and the consumption of resources; (c) strong interests are committed to maintaining wealth and power; (d) there is an emphasis on short-term wins over long-term benefits.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Identify the big assumptions underlying the competing commitments</italic>: There are multiple big assumptions associated with each commitment, and these may include the following: (a) each problem is separate, rather than systemically related; (b) economic growth is the only growth that matters, and the models and development solutions that worked in the past can be improved and applied to solve current development problems; (c) power relations and interests cannot be changed, or to do so would call for a massive change in values; (d) humans are a short-sighted species that tends to be reactive, rather than anticipatory.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Once a number of big assumptions have been identified, it may be useful to take a closer look at their veracity, as well as the evidence and beliefs that are consciously or unconsciously used to support them. This does not mean that they are necessarily false; it may simply reveal blind spots in current thinking – i.e. unquestioned assumptions and beliefs may reproduce the same patterns over and over again, with the expectation that different outcomes will result.</p>
<p>For example, the assumption of ‘discrete problems’ often justifies addressing urgent issues such as global financial crises without taking into consideration interactions with the drivers and consequences of environmental change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132512469589">Leichenko et al., 2010</xref>). Political ecology approaches have long demonstrated that environmental problems are not isolated from social, economic, and political issues, and in fact are closely related to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132512469589">Forsyth, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309132512469589">Lawhon and Murphy, 2012</xref>). The ‘economic growth is most important’ assumption that has been the basis for neoliberal economic policies does not take into account alternatives (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309132512469589">Brown and Garver, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309132512469589">Hawken, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132512469589">Jackson, 2009</xref>), nor does it recognize research on the economics of happiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132512469589">Kasser, 2011</xref>), the importance of human relationships, or the implications of changing values and worldview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309132512469589">Hedlund-de Witt, 2011</xref>). Likewise, the assumption that ‘power and interests are fixed’ validates a traditional, hierarchical worldview that perpetuates dominance of some over others based on race, caste, ethnicity, class, gender, age, etc. While the modern, individualistic worldview often replaces social power hierarchies with unequal economic power distributions based on self-, corporate- or group-interests, postmodern and postmaterial worldviews are emerging that are more egalitarian and just (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309132512469589">Inglehart and Welzel, 2005</xref>). While many assume that real change will not happen until values and worldviews change, studies show that social tipping points do not require a majority of the population to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512469589">Urry, 2011</xref>). In fact, as little as 10% of the population holding a strong belief may be enough to trigger social change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0309132512469589">Xie ei al., 2011</xref>). Finally, the ‘short-sighted humans’ assumption has been challenged by research on the role of collaboration in human evolution, as well as on the development of abstract reasoning, vision-logic, self-efficacy, and individual and collective agency over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132512469589">Bandura, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132512469589">Hetherington and Reid, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132512469589">Kegan and Lahey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132512469589">Rifkin, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The point is that all of these big assumptions, when examined more closely, become more ambiguous or problematic. Nonetheless, whether conscious or unconscious, core assumptions and beliefs continuously influence individual and collective actions. This has an important implication for <italic>how</italic> we move from knowledge to action in response to hyper-complex problems. It suggests that the current approach of expecting people/institutions/corporations/governments to change their actions based on scientific knowledge may be ineffective, particularly if immune systems are operating properly and maintaining competing commitments without addressing both hidden and not-so-hidden big assumptions. Whether this calls for a different approach to dialogue and deliberation can be debated (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132512469589">Bohm, 1996</xref>), but at the very least it draws attention to the dominant assumptions and beliefs within global change research itself that perpetuate paradigms, rather than change them.</p>

<title>VI Implications for human geography</title>
<p>Is human geography complicit in the perpetuation of paradigms that contribute to continued global environmental change? Geographers have made important theoretical, empirical, and methodological contributions to global change research, perhaps more so than most other disciplines. Nonetheless, human geographers have failed to shift the focus of the scientific discourse away from ‘the environment’ as the problem and towards an integrated understanding of change based on critical research on space, place, politics, power, culture, identities, emotions, connections, and so on, including the geography of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309132512469589">Lawson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0309132512469589">Skole, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>At a time when the global change research programmes are reorganizing to address sustainability in an integrated, transdisciplinary manner under the ‘Future Earth’ initiative, there is a great risk of maintaining the same assumptions and expecting different outcomes. To move scientific and societal debates forward, beyond one that focuses on ‘inevitability’ and ‘apocalypse’, human geographers have a unique opportunity to shift attention to the broader concept of change. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132512469589">Gibson-Graham and Roelvink (2010</xref>: 342) note, there are many new ways to think about how things change: ‘Theory has taken on a new relation to action – to understand the world <italic>is</italic> to change it’. Thinking about change in new ways may, however, involve questioning our own disciplinary assumptions, as well as the assumptions underlying contemporary science, policy, and practice. There are risks in doing so, but one outcome may be that we end up addressing much more than environmental problems.</p>
