<sec id="sec14-0961203313477223"><title>Objectives</title>
<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with several comorbidities, including hearing and vestibular disorders. We recently described an increase of SLE prevalence in patients with Menierés disease (MD). The aim of this study is to explore if a subset of SLE patients may have a common inner ear disorder and determine the potential relationship with migraine.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0961203313477223"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Eighty-nine patients with SLE (according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria for the diagnosis of SLE) were evaluated for audiovestibular symptoms by a telephone interview carried out by two experienced otoneurologists. Twenty-one patients with SLE were referred to the otoneurology clinic for a detailed clinical history for criteria assessment for MD and a complete audiovestibular examination (audiogram, oculomotor, and caloric testing with video-oculography).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0961203313477223"><title>Results</title>
<p>Recurrent headache was found in 50/89 patients, and 26 of them had diagnostic criteria for migraine. Twenty-four percent of patients reported sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) or episodic vertigo. Among the eight patients (9%) with episodic vertigo, one had criteria for definite MD and another two patients had criteria for possible MD. SNHL was found to be associated with a history of episodic vertigo (Fisher’s test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02), but not with headache or migraine. SLE and episodic vertigo were not associated with tinnitus, migraine, lupus nephritis, antinuclear antibodies or antiphospholipid syndrome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-0961203313477223"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Migraine, SNHL and episodic vertigo are comorbid conditions in patients with SLE, but migraine is not associated with SNHL or vertigo in these patients. However, SNHL and vertigo are associated conditions in SLE, suggesting a common audiovestibular dysfunction.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0961203313477223" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Autoimmunity can affect the inner ear in two ways: as a primary isolated immune-mediated inner ear disorder or as a systemic autoimmune disease (SAD) affecting the inner ear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203313477223">1</xref></sup> Multisystemic, organ-non-specific autoimmune diseases such as Cogan’s syndrome, Wegener granulomatosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and systemic vasculitis may also involve the inner ear, and this is defined as a secondary autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203313477223">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>SLE is a chronic, multisystemic inflammatory disorder of autoimmune etiology, occurring predominantly in young women and characterized by the production of autoantibodies against nucleic acids, proteins, and erythrocytes. Patients with SLE can suffer a series of comorbidities, including infections, arteriosclerosis, coronary arteriopathy, stroke, osteoporosis, and bone avascular necrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203313477223">3</xref></sup> Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has been described in patients with SLE in 21–70% in small case series, but vertigo is considered a rare symptom in these patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203313477223">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313477223">5</xref></sup> The relationship between SLE and inner ear disease has been demonstrated histopathologically in the cochlea,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203313477223">6</xref></sup> but the involvement of the vestibular system is not known.</p>
<p>We recently described an increase of the expected prevalence in SAD in a large cohort of patients with Meniere’s disease (MD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313477223">7</xref></sup> Interestingly, SLE was found to be five times more frequent in patients with MD than in the general population, suggesting that a subset of patients with MD and SAD could have an autoimmune background leading to a cochlear-vestibular disorder. Moreover, SAD was most commonly observed among patients with migraine and MD rather than in subjects with tension-type headache and MD, suggesting a link between migraine and SAD in patients with MD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313477223">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>To explore this hypothesis, we evaluated patients with a diagnosis of SLE with a history of hearing loss or episodic vertigo to identify cases with cochlear or vestibular symptoms that could fulfill diagnostic criteria for MD.</p>
<p>The aim of this study is to identify a subset of patients of SLE with an inner ear disorder and determine their potential relationship with migraine.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0961203313477223"><title>Patient selection</title>
<p>A case series including 103 patients with lupus erythematosus was selected for the study. The authors reviewed all patients with a diagnosis of SLE at the Department of Rheumatology. All patients with SLE diagnosis in the hospital were included in the Department of Rheumatology database. A total of 103 patients accepted, but five patients refused to participate in the study. The missing rate was 4.6%.</p>
<p>Fourteen patients with a diagnosis of cutaneous lupus were excluded, and 89 patients with a definite diagnosis of SLE according to the diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mail3.rheumatology.org/practice/index.asp">http://mail3.rheumatology.org/practice/index.asp</ext-link>) were finally recruited at the Department of Rheumatology, University Hospital of Salamanca, Spain.</p>
<p>The subjects’ written informed consent was obtained to participate in the study according to the Helsinki guidelines, and the hospital institutional review board approved the study.</p>
<p>A telephone interview was performed by two otoneurology experts for all patients with SLE by way of a structured questionnaire to identify audiovestibular symptoms in these patients. The questionnaire included specific items to search for hearing loss, vertigo, chronic imbalance, and headache, including migraine. Patients reporting hearing loss or vertigo were referred to the otoneurology clinic for a detailed clinical history and physical examination.</p>
<p>When patients agreed to participate in the study, they were informed that they must provide information about the number and duration of episodes of vertigo, headache, and hearing loss they had experienced in the last six months. The interview was oriented to identify the type of headache experienced by patients with SLE. Diagnosis of migraine was performed according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (IHS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203313477223">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Standard analytical determinations for autoimmunity included antinuclear antibodies (ANA) by indirect immunofluorescence method (titers of one of 160 were considered positive). Serum concentrations of extractable nuclear antigens (ENAs) were detected by the ZENNIT Ra kit (Menarini Diagnostics), and ENA screening detected the following autoantibodies: SSA/Ro, SSB/La, U1RNP (A, C), RNP70, Scl-70, JO-1, centromere B and Sm. Also, anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) was measured by EliA dsDNA (Pharmacia Diagnostics, Freiburg, Germany). Antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies screening was performed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the PHADIA 250 kit (Phadia EliA). Serum complement proteins C3 and C4 were measured by an immunoturbidimetric assay in an Olympus AU5400 analyzer.</p>
<p>All patients underwent complete otolaryngologic examination and audiologic evaluation with pure-tone audiometry and tympanometry. The diagnosis of MD was defined according to the American Academy Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery guidelines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203313477223">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203313477223">9</xref></sup> A complete neurotologic examination including nystagmus in the primary position, gaze-evoked and head-shaking nystagmus; head-thrust test and standard bithermal caloric test with video-recording were also performed. Vestibule-spinal assessment included the Romberg and Unterberger tests.

<p>Twenty-one patients with SLE reported hearing loss or episodic vertigo and were finally evaluated in the otoneurology clinic. Eight patients (9%) had a history of peripheral vertigo defined as an episode of spinning lasting more than 20 minutes and associated with nausea or vomiting. One patient also described brief episodes of positional vertigo suggesting benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0961203313477223">Table 3</xref> compares patients with SLE with or without audiovestibular disorder. Eleven patients reported subjective hearing loss without vestibular symptoms (12%), but pure-tone audiograms showed hearing loss in 17/89 cases (19%). SNHL was found to be associated with a history of episodic vertigo in patients with SLE (Fisher’s exact test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02), but it was not associated with headache or migraine in our series. The frequency of migraine was the same in patients with SLE with or without hearing loss (19.2% vs 19.0%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.60). Moreover, SNHL was not associated with kidney disease, ANA, or aPL syndrome (APS) positivity (<italic>p</italic> &gt;0.05). Six of 21 patients with SLE and audiovestibular symptoms evaluated had a decrease in C3 or C4 levels and five of six presented SNHL.

<p>Otoneurological examination of patients with SLE and vestibular symptoms did not reveal any vestibular deficit. Caloric testing was normal in six patients, but one woman showed a horizontal canal paresis (68%) and another refused the caloric test. Five patients with vertigo also had an objective hearing loss. In two cases the duration of hearing loss was more than five years, and in one case the duration was only one year.</p>
<p>The woman with canal paresis had a low-tone frequencies SNHL in the left ear, ipsilateral tinnitus, and recurrent episodes of vertigo over the last two years. The mean duration of the spells was one hour and a half and they were associated with vomiting. After excluding other causes of vertigo, this patient was diagnosed with definite Menière’s disease. Interestingly, another four patients reported episodic vertigo and SNHL that were diagnosed as possible MD. One patient had a history of mastoid surgery and another case had a high-tone frequency hearing loss that suggests that these patients were unlikely to develop a definite MD. However, the two remaining patients were a woman with a low-tone SNHL in the right ear and a second woman with a 50-dB pantonal bilateral SNHL with incipient presbyacusis that could fulfill criteria for MD during follow-up.</p>
<p>In patients with SLE and episodic vertigo there was no association with tinnitus, migraine, lupus nephritis, ANA or aPL antibodies (all <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Although migraine was a comorbid condition found in 29% of patients, it was not associated with vertigo, tinnitus, ANA, or aPL (all, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203313477223" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study presents clinical data suggesting that a subset of patients with SLE have an audiovestibular disorder. SNHL was found in 19% and recurrent vertigo in 9% of cases. Migraine is a comorbid condition in SLE affecting 29% of patients with SLE, but we did not find an association between migraine and vertigo or SNHL in patients with SLE.</p>
<p>The relationship between hearing loss and SLE has been previously reported, but its pathogenesis is not known. Hypotheses like autoimmunity, vasculitis, premature presbyacousis, or drug ototoxicity cannot always explain the premature hearing loss in SLE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313477223">10</xref></sup> since there is no evidence of hearing loss during SLE flares.</p>
<p>Our study was not designed to assess the relationship between hearing or vestibular loss and disease activity. Although C4 levels were determined in all cases to monitor disease activity, hearing and vestibular tests were not performed during an SLE flare, and the mechanism of inner ear dysfunction is not known.</p>
<p>Microinfarctions or thrombosis of the capillaries or arterioles in the temporal bone have been proposed to occur in patients with SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203313477223">11</xref></sup> In our study, we found hearing loss in 19% of patients, mainly affecting the higher frequencies. These findings are in agreement with other studies reporting objective or subjective hearing loss in SLE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313477223">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313477223">10</xref></sup> but probably the frequency of SNHL in SLE is higher because sometimes the hearing loss is asymptomatic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203313477223">12</xref></sup> The hearing loss is not associated with ANA or APS, and no biological marker is available to define patients at risk.</p>
<p>In our series, no case of transmission hearing loss was reported, and most patients had SNHL affecting high frequencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203313477223">13</xref></sup> Although five of six patients with hearing loss had a decrease in C3 or C4 levels, further studies are needed to confirm this observation. In contrast, C3 and C4 levels were not altered in patients with MD and were not associated with a worse SNHL in MD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203313477223">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203313477223">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Vertigo in patients with SLE has seldom been reported, being single cases, mostly in pediatric patients, in which vertigo is the main symptom for the diagnosis of SLE (generally with central nervous system involvement), a rare condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203313477223">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203313477223">16</xref></sup> Other studies using questionnaires to identify audiovestibular symptoms in patients with SLE found that 71% of patients reported vertigo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203313477223">10</xref></sup> In addition, abnormal findings in vestibular examination using electronystagmography were found in 50% of patients with SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203313477223">5</xref></sup> In our study, we have diagnosed objective vertigo in eight patients with SLE (9%). These patients had a history of peripheral vertigo defined as an episode of spinning lasting more than 20 minutes and associated with nausea or vomiting. We have used strict criteria in the questionnaire about the symptom (rotatory sensation lasting more than 20 minutes), and for this reason estimated prevalence is probably lower than previously described. Moreover, we found only one of six (16.6%) with vestibular hypofunction in the caloric test among the eight patients with peripheral vertigo.</p>
<p>In our series, five patients had vertigo and hearing loss. Two cases had hearing loss over more than five years but only one year in one case. In that case, it is mandatory to follow up for the diagnosis of MD, since MD appears to be more prevalent in patients with SLE than in the general population. Autoimmunity seems to be associated with pathophysiology in a subset of patients with MD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203313477223">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203313477223">18</xref></sup> and elevations of aPL have been reported in patients with unilateral MD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313477223">19</xref></sup> We found one case of MD in our series of 89 patients, whereas the prevalence estimated in the general population is 75–190/100,000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203313477223">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203313477223"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203313477223">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The prevalence of headache in SLE has been estimated from 32% to 78%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203313477223">22</xref></sup> In our series, the prevalence of headache was 56%, closer to another recent study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203313477223">23</xref></sup> Migraine is also more frequent in SLE than in the general population. We have found 29% of patients with migraine, a comorbid condition in SLE. Although its relationship with the activity of SLE is not confirmed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203313477223">23</xref></sup> some authors have demonstrated an association between headache or migraine and the presence of aPL,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203313477223">24</xref></sup> but our data do not confirm this. We have not found an association between migraine and vertigo, tinnitus, or immunological tests in SLE patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203313477223">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0961203313477223">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>There is no association between migraine and vertigo or migraine and hearing loss in our series, and most of the patients with SLE have migraine as an isolated symptom. In our study, only two cases had vertigo and migraine but they did not fulfill criteria for diagnosis of vestibular migraine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0961203313477223">27</xref></sup> as a temporal association between vertigo and migraine for the diagnosis of vestibular migraine is recommended. To make the differential diagnosis between migraine and vestibular migraine, two episodes of vertigo are needed plus the criteria for migraine defined by the IHS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0961203313477223">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, audiovestibular problems are frequent in our series. MD seems to be extremely prevalent in our SLE patients, so any SLE patient with vertigo or hearing loss should undergo a complete audiovestibular examination. The knowledge of more accurate prevalence and pathogenic mechanisms of MD in SLE deserves further study.</p>
