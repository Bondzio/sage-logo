<abstract>
<p>Since the 1980s, Detroit’s historic building stock of automotive manufacturing facilities has mostly disappeared. Demolition, redevelopment, and abandonment have left little to mark the city’s twentieth-century history as the world capital of the automobile industry. Planning and policy making have been complicit by publicly subsidizing destructive redevelopment and by failing to advocate for retention or preservation of significant structures and complexes. Even today, Detroit’s leadership calls for the demolition of one of the city’s last remaining historic auto factories. This article surveys the disappearance of Detroit’s auto factories and documents the histories of three of the largest complexes: the Chrysler-Chalmers Plant, cleared for a redeveloped factory; the Cadillac Plant, cleared for a failed economic development project; and the Packard Plant, slowly abandoned over sixty years. The article calls for a revised theory and practice of preservation that accommodates the weak markets, imperfect conditions, and informal uses that characterize abandoned industrial buildings in shrinking cities.</p>

<title>Introduction: An Industry and City in Crisis</title>
<p>The post-2007 distress of the American automobile industry resulted in dozens of factory closings across the nation. Many of these losses occurred in the Detroit area, the historic locus of automobile manufacturing in the United States. In this hard-hit region, job losses and production cutbacks garnered front-page headlines, nightly news reports, and blog posts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1538513212471166">1</xref>
</sup> The overwhelming conclusion was that Detroit and Michigan were deeply troubled. Especially after 2007, the problems of Michigan’s “Big Three”—General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler—destabilized formerly solid working- and middle-class communities and cursed many households to perpetual underemployment.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1538513212471166">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Absent from the public debate over Detroit’s and Michigan’s economic and social crisis were the closed—or soon to be closed—factory buildings and complexes. Where factories were mentioned at all, the tacit consensus of political leaders and developers was that reuse or preservation of such structures was difficult if not impossible due to safety concerns, economic viability, and a lack of public interest in the issue.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1538513212471166">3</xref>
</sup> As a result, auto plants were often demolished soon after their closure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1538513212471166">4</xref>
</sup> Yet, these post-2007 closures comprised only the most recent part of a much larger and longer trend of deindustrialization in Detroit, together with the decline and loss of the city’s manufacturing landscape itself. This article examines this loss, which we argue is also a loss to the city’s urban fabric and built heritage.</p>

<title>City, Factory, Decay</title>
<p>Detroit’s well-known moniker of “Motor City” symbolizes the defining impact—economic, social, cultural, and physical—that the automobile industry had on the city’s psyche during the twentieth century. For much of this period, Detroit’s built environment reflected this relationship. This was a factory city, and its numerous industrial buildings embodied the “hard work … conviction, and knowhow that runs generations deep” in Detroiters.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1538513212471166">5</xref>
</sup> More than almost any other industrial city in the United States, automobile factories defined both the landscape of Detroit and Detroiters themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538513212471166">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In the twenty-first century, this traditional relationship between Detroit, automobile production, and the industrial landscape is significantly changed. Since the 1960s, infrastructure development and economic decline have physically fragmented the city, transforming it into a patchwork of freeways, superblocks, and suburban-type housing enclaves.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1538513212471166">6</xref>
</sup> These changes removed swathes of Detroit’s mainly early twentieth-century housing and building stock. Today, as many observers have noted, the city’s landscape is contradictory and often distressing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1538513212471166">7</xref>
</sup> Juxtaposed with vacant lots and abandoned structures are commercial strip malls, casinos, stadiums, and office parks, all surrounded by parking, as well as occasional rehabilitated historic buildings functioning as lofts for the middle class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538513212471166">Figures 2</xref>

<p>Finding traces of the automobile industry that formed and shaped Detroit’s twentieth-century economy is somewhat harder. As late as the 1980s, Detroit’s plants, constructed during the city’s production peak from 1910 to 1960, were impressive brick, steel, concrete, and glass industrial structures occupying strategic urban locations within sprawling constellations of lower-density areas of housing whose inhabitants were economically dependent upon the factories for survival. But as the Big Three experienced progressive economic distress in 1970s and afterward, their troubles played out across the city’s largest automotive sites with disastrous effect.</p>
<p>Detroit once possessed what was perhaps the most significant collection of twentieth-century industrial structures in the United States. Today [2012] most of these former automotive manufacturing sites are vacant lots, surrounded by half-empty, impoverished neighborhoods. The automobile plants that once knit the physical, economic, and social fabric of Detroit together are mostly gone, along with the thousands of jobs they provided and, in many cases, the thousands of homes that once surrounded them. As this article documents, the majority of Detroit’s auto plants were demolished either by neglect, by the automobile industry, or by public officials hoping to reuse plant sites. A few plants were abandoned and left to decay, and only a few remain active. The cumulative effect of these changes has been the relentless erasure of the city’s industrial heritage and an overall deurbanization of the Detroit landscape.</p>
<p>The research methods used in this study were straightforward. During visits to Detroit between 2006 and 2012, the authors explored, photographed, and reviewed both the historic and current states of fifteen of the most significant automotive industrial sites within the city limits of Detroit as established by Hyde in 1980.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1538513212471166">8</xref>
</sup> The authors subsequently selected three of the largest sites—the Cadillac, Chrysler-Chalmers, and Packard plants—and documented their post-1980 transformations. Collectively, the post-1980 experiences of these three plants embodied the three disparate fates of <italic>all</italic> of the fifteen sites: demolition (Cadillac); redevelopment for a new automobile plant (Chrysler-Chalmers), or abandonment (Packard).</p>
<p>Based on this research, this article argues that not only has the city of Detroit lost most of its automotive manufacturing heritage, but that redevelopment, either for new auto plants or for contemporary office parks, has been a significant cause of this loss. In fact, compared to redevelopment, abandonment has been relatively benign. Of Detroit’s largest plants, the best preserved (Packard) is ironically the one that has been abandoned the longest and has thus far been resistant to redevelopment. We argue that this state of affairs is more than simply a testament to difficult economic circumstances; it is the result of myopic redevelopment processes that ignore the city's built environment and manufacturing heritage, as well as a relatively impotent preservation process that is unable to halt most building demolitions in Detroit. We conclude by calling for historic preservationists to develop new approaches to preservation that can confront the shocking and difficult circumstances that confront Detroit today before the remainder of the city’s auto manufacturing heritage is lost. </p>

<title>Automotive Factories in Detroit: Assessing Thirty Years of Change, 1980–2010</title>
<p>By the late 1970s, the US auto industry was in serious trouble and so was Detroit. The past decade had brought the loss of market share to stiff foreign competition, a pair of oil crises, and deep recessions, culminating in the dramatic near bankruptcy of the Chrysler Corporation in 1979–80. Meanwhile, in the wake of 1967’s riots, Detroit suffered accelerated population loss, business closures, property abandonment, and the erosion of its industrial employment base.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1538513212471166">9</xref>
</sup> During the 1970s, the city lost more than 300,000 people, and its 1980 population of 1.2 million was 35 percent lower than its 1950 peak of 1.85 million (by 2010, the city had lost another 450,000 people, lowering its total to 713,777). Detroit’s population decline was strongly linked to its decline in manufacturing employment. Between 1958 and 1982, the city lost 48 percent (98,700) of its manufacturing jobs; almost half of these losses occurred after 1977.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1538513212471166">10</xref>
</sup> While manufacturing was the core of the city’s economy, Detroit’s wholesale, transportation, and retail sectors also showed significant declines. But in the wake of the population and employment losses of the 1970s, the city’s automotive plants largely remained. Hyde’s 1980 survey inventoried the city’s automobile factories and found that most of the vast complexes were intact, though some had been idled, consolidated, converted to new uses, or altered as part of plant enlargement or renovation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1538513212471166">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>These plants were powerfully urban complexes. Most factories fit neatly within underlying city block patterns. Such structures were built to the street line with few setbacks or security buffers. Almost all had a strong visual presence, lending their neighborhoods a dramatic, almost Piranesian contrast of modest homes and looming factory complexes, which served as dramatic focal points in Detroit’s dispersed, horizontal landscape. The juxtaposition of these massive structures with the city’s otherwise low and rather monotonous blocks was noted early by Modernist architect Erich Mendelsohn, who photographed the city extensively in the 1920s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1538513212471166">Figure 6</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1538513212471166">12</xref>
</sup> The urban nature of Detroit’s auto plants meant that these sites were more than merely a collection of architecturally distinctive individual buildings; they were dense assemblages that both individually and in sum, gave Detroit its most unique and defining landscape characteristic, making it visually as well as functionally the “Motor City.” This condition is regrettably almost completely lost today.</p>

</fig>
<p>Detroit’s automotive plants, together with nearby complexes in Highland Park, Hamtramck and Dearborn, were not single buildings but rather small cities of industry. Physically diverse, they were conglomerations of a dozen or more densely packed buildings of varying configurations and eras. Many had been built up over a half-century or more, spreading across multiple city blocks. Some sites possessed the largest structures ever built for automotive manufacturing purposes, with buildings measuring more than 1,000 feet in length, and a few, even more than 2,000 feet. The individual buildings were straightforward, rectilinear structures between one and six stories, taking advantage of new building technologies like reinforced concrete, steel, and plate glass. The bold geometric forms and new structural systems of many plants, including many of those designed by Detroit architect Albert Kahn, have long been noted for their contribution to the history of twentieth century architecture.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1538513212471166">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Our survey (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538513212471166">Table 1</xref>) shows that events during the three decades following 1980 significantly shrank the auto industry’s physical footprint in Detroit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1538513212471166">Figure 7</xref>). In 1980, eleven of the fifteen sites surveyed were still active. Today, only two of the fifteen complexes, the Chrysler-Dodge Half-Ton Truck Plant and the Chrysler Jefferson North plant, produce finished vehicles.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1538513212471166">14</xref>
</sup> Together with two other plants not documented in 1980, these four plants constitute Detroit’s remaining active automotive assembly lines.<sup>

<p>Eight of the fifteen plants documented in 1980 have been entirely demolished, while historic elements survive on the remaining seven documented sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538513212471166">Table 1</xref>). Of these seven plants, five retain, more or less, their historic form and appearance. Perhaps best preserved is the Ford Piquette plant, now the “T-Plex” automotive museum. Three vacant plants are deteriorated, but retain visual integrity: the Studebaker Plant adjacent to the Piquette Plant, the Fisher Body Plant, and the largest of all, the former Packard factory. A fifth plant, the former Plymouth Lynch Road Assembly Plant, is visually unprepossessing but survives as storage and warehousing.</p>
<p>On the other two of the seven sites, surviving historic elements have been subsumed into modern plants and are consequently invisible from the street today. A particularly regrettable loss is that of the Chrysler-Dodge Half-Ton Truck Plant near the city’s northern border at 8 Mile Road. At this structure, designed by Albert Kahn and endlessly reproduced in surveys of architectural history, as well as at the recently demolished (2011) Chrysler McGraw Avenue Glass Plant, historic buildings were either subsumed into modern facilities or renovated so as to remove historic proportions and details.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1538513212471166">16</xref>
</sup> As a result, Kahn’s iconic designs lost their recognizable form, becoming large, fortress-like buildings clad in pale aluminum. Set back from the street and buffered by multiple fences, gates, and land berms, the rebuilt Half-Ton Truck plant seems secretive and unaware of its historic significance.</p>
<p>Demolition, abandonment, and redevelopment: singly or together, these fates describe the totality of Detroit’s historic automotive heritage. Below, we briefly explore the histories of three of the most significant sites—the Chrysler-Chalmers (Jefferson North) plant, the Cadillac plant, and the Packard plant—to better understand how Detroit arrived at Autopia’s End.</p>

<title>Evolution and Devolution: The Story of Three Automotive Plants</title>
<p>To understand in greater detail the processes that have demolished much of Detroit’s automotive heritage, we examined the histories of the Chrysler-Chalmers plant (today Chrysler’s Jefferson North plant), the Cadillac Clark Street plant, and the Packard plant. Each was constructed and operated by a different automobile company and located in a different area of the city (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1538513212471166">Figure 7</xref>). Composed of multiple buildings of varying eras, each plant was also an order of magnitude larger than earlier factories like Ford’s Piquette Avenue or Highland Park plants. In the 1990s, two of the three plants met a fate common to many other former automobile plants. Between 1988 and 1992, the Chrysler-Chalmers complex was mostly demolished and remaining historic elements subsumed into a redeveloped plant, and the Cadillac plant was cleared and demolished in 1998 for a low-density “technology park” that has been only partially built out. Only the Packard Plant, closed in 1956 and fitfully reused in the decades afterward, survived the 1990s, continuing to the present day (2012) to deteriorate into a burned-out, trash-strewn ruin.</p>
<p>None of these three plants were industrial architectural landmarks on the order of Ford’s River Rouge plant<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1538513212471166">17</xref>
</sup> or the Half-Ton Truck plant. But each plant was a collection of both monumental and quotidian structures that physically defined and economically supported their neighborhoods, and together they played an important role in defining Detroit’s cultural fabric and collective memory. And though none of the three feature prominently in architectural history, two (Chrysler-Chalmers and Packard) contained worthy buildings by the prolific Detroit-area architect Albert Kahn, whose better-known work was found elsewhere. </p>
<p>As previously noted, these plants were not single buildings but rather complexes of structures varying in size, configuration, and function. Each plant developed incrementally, responding to changing demand and production technologies during the first half of the twentieth century. During this time, automobiles became increasingly complex, with sophisticated components requiring new skills, innovations, organizations, machinery, and facilities. As plant volume increased and automation took greater hold, Chrysler-Chalmers, Cadillac, and Packard added new buildings to their plants, incorporating each into a vertically and horizontally integrated web of production logistics with new parts and products made on site. </p>
<p>The concentrated growth of each of these plants over a half-century generated a rich complex of different scales and forms on their respective sites. Sanborn maps from 1951, when all three plants were still functioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1538513212471166">Figures 8</xref>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1538513212471166"/>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1538513212471166">10</xref>), show a wide variety of building types, shapes, and sizes. Examination of older Sanborn maps showing different stages of plant construction demonstrate that each plant developed in an accretive manner taking full advantage of its urban site. The Cadillac plant was a particular exemplar of incremental, well-planned factory growth that made the most of its relatively modest plot. This development history is still visible today (2012) at the Packard Plant, where individual buildings dating from the 1910s to the 1950s connect seamlessly to each other while contrasting dramatically in scale with the mostly residential (and severely deteriorated) adjacent blocks. In contrast with this incremental history, the demolition histories of the sites are short. Both the Chrysler-Chalmers and Cadillac plants were the result of fifty plus years of industrial evolution, but each was demolished in the space of less than two years. </p>

<title>Chrysler-Chalmers: Demolition by Redevelopment</title>
<p>Between 1908 and 1918, on the far east side of Detroit, the Chalmers Automobile Company commissioned Albert Kahn to design a new plant adjacent to the Detroit River. Kahn designed a series of minimally ornamented three- and four-story concrete-framed pavilions with open courtyards facing the street and broad front lawns, shrubbery, and flowerbeds that were park-like in appearance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1538513212471166">18</xref>
</sup> The initially semi-suburban design of the Jefferson Avenue South plant was in keeping with its generous site located along the wide boulevard. Early photographs show the plant standing in open country; the surrounding area was just beginning to be subdivided and developed with Detroit’s characteristic freestanding houses on sizable plots of land (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1538513212471166">Figure 11</xref>). As Chalmers plant grew during the first half of the twentieth century, the initially open site would become crowded with industrial structures.</p>

<p>Only two years later in 1910, the Hudson Motor Car Company also commissioned Kahn to build its plant on a site directly adjacent to Chalmers. Founded in 1909, Hudson, along with Chalmers, was one of the many early automobile companies that would be absorbed into the Big Three by mid-century. Hudson’s plant displayed many of the same features as Jefferson South, including a series of concrete pavilions with courtyards that provided needed natural light and air circulation in the days before fluorescent lighting and air conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1538513212471166">Figure 12</xref>). Kahn also designed a two-story office building at the front of the plant, facing Jefferson Avenue. This building was clad in stucco and ornamented with green tiles, giving it a somewhat peculiar Spanish-revival appearance amid its industrial setting.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1538513212471166">19</xref>

<p>The Chalmers Automobile Company was purchased by the growing Chrysler Corporation in 1925. Two years later, Chrysler added the American Motor Body Company, whose plant lay across Jefferson Avenue, to its portfolio, creating a “Chrysler-Chalmers” campus that spanned Jefferson Avenue and would eventually provide the basis for the 1990s-era Jefferson North plant. Between 1924 and 1928, Chrysler spent $1.3 million to add four large buildings and a dozen infill structures designed by local architects Smith, Hinchman, and Grylls to its amalgamated site.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1538513212471166">20</xref>

<p>By 1940, the Chrysler-Chalmers plant had expanded to almost 2 million square feet of floor area in more than two dozen buildings spread across forty-seven acres. During the early years of that decade, Chrysler retooled the plant to produce a number of products for the war effort.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1538513212471166">22</xref>
</sup> Following that period, Chrysler manufactured a number of different automobile lines at the Chalmers plant, including its well-known 300 Series in the 1950s and 1960s. Major construction on the campus wound down in the mid-1950s with a bridge over Jefferson Avenue connecting the Chalmers site to a body plant along Kercheval Avenue, where car bodies were transported on a covered conveyor belt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1538513212471166">Figure 14</xref>). </p>

<p>The consolidation and elimination of smaller automobile companies in the first half of the twentieth century presaged the troubles that would afflict the Big Three in the century’s second half. In 1954, production of Hudson cars in Detroit ceased when the company was sold to the Nash Motors in 1954, forming the amalgamated corporation known as American Motors (AMC).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1538513212471166">23</xref>
</sup> The Hudson plant did not long survive the sale; AMC demolished the plant in 1961, and used the site for storage. And as Chrysler itself began to experience financial problems that would culminate in the company’s bailout and reorganization between 1979 and 1983, the company laid off one-third of its work force and closed twelve factories. In the late 1970s, the Chrysler-Chalmers plant suffered massive employment cuts, idling much of the factory and devastating the lives of nearby workers in the Jefferson-Chalmers neighborhood, many of whom were African American.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1538513212471166">24</xref>

</p>
<p>Chrysler-Chalmers’ present-day Jefferson North campus, constructed between 1990 and 1992, was intended by the city of Detroit to be a significant economic development initiative that would preserve an automobile assembly line within the city. According to one account, the city spent $264 million to “acquire and clear more land for the new plant. That required tearing down buildings, small factories, and houses for blocks around, then cleaning the land of toxic industrial waste.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1538513212471166">26</xref>
</sup> The new, expanded campus north of Jefferson Avenue incorporated the vacant Hudson site, as well as many formerly residential blocks.</p>
<p>In 1992, Chrysler’s Jefferson North Assembly Plant opened at a total cost of $1 billion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1538513212471166">27</xref>
</sup> Intended to produce Jeeps and minivans, the plant’s use of new technologies required the rehiring of less than half of the workers of the old Jefferson South plant.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1538513212471166">28</xref>
</sup> Maynard noted that the city calculated the total public cost of the plant to be $436 million, or “more than $200,000 for each of the 2,100 hourly jobs” at the new plant.<sup>

</sup> The original Chalmers plant site, south of Jefferson, is now used for vehicle and equipment storage.</p>
<p>Today, a traveler on East Jefferson Avenue would find it difficult to uncover any trace of the early twentieth-century Hudson or Chrysler-Chalmers industrial fabric, or to even to recognize that he or she was in an industrial area at all. The entire Jefferson Avenue frontage of the Jefferson North Assembly Facility is lined with grassy berms lightly planted with hardwood trees and protected by a security fence. No structures are visible from the street, lending the complex a forbidding, distinctly military appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1538513212471166">Figure 15</xref>). The near-complete erasure of the surrounding city fabric is even more apparent on the blocks north of Jefferson Avenue, where two large east–west streets end abruptly at security gates. Nearby blocks, now absent of housing, provide ornamental planted areas, security buffers, and landscaped berms both within and beyond the plant boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1538513212471166">Figure 16</xref>). These visual and functional barriers mask the plant from all surrounding streets. Nothing remains of the former Chrysler-Chalmers or Hudson plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1538513212471166">Figure 17</xref>).</p>

The complex’s “front yard” contains a company sign, a large expanse of grass, and a fan-shaped parking area, most of which is behind a security fence. Gates control entry to this single, well-fortified superblock. To the east, the vacant Hudson site is occupied by parking. Outside the plant boundaries, empty lawns and gently meandering sidewalks leading nowhere indicate that the demolished neighborhoods were needed simply to provide a landscape ornament and security buffer for the plant. </p>

<p>In a certain sense, today’s Jefferson North plant is clearly just another faceless part of the “logistics landscape” that characterizes today’s global production and consumption industries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1538513212471166">30</xref>
</sup> By eliminating the surrounding fabric and thereby neutralizing its urban site, Chrysler was able to emulate and impose the global standards that define modern automobile and manufacturing production. Similar standards required the demolition of 15,000 houses at General Motors’ “Poletown” plant in nearby Hamtramck for a similarly faceless plant. But in another sense, the spacious, inhumane landscape of Jefferson-North reflects a city whose historic landscape was so deteriorated and devalued that its erasure for the new plant scarcely raised an eyebrow in the early 1990s. Perhaps, Detroiters were distracted by larger concerns than the plant and so, the nearby neighborhood’s removal escaped notice. Or perhaps no one thought the urbane but technologically obsolete complex mattered any more. In any event, the Chrysler-Chalmers site has been altered nearly beyond recognition, a transformation that one might add has failed to reverse the deterioration of surrounding neighborhoods.</p></sec>

<title>Clark Street Cadillac: Demolition by Economic Development</title>
<p>In 1921, the Cadillac Motor Car Company, a division of General Motors since 1909, decided to consolidate its different Detroit plants onto two large blocks in the middle of west Detroit adjacent to and facing Michigan Avenue, a wide boulevard leading into downtown. Michigan Avenue was a busy artery packed with foot, trolley, and automobile traffic; the city’s main railroad terminal for the New York Central Railroad was nearby, as was the Detroit Tigers baseball stadium. Locating a factory along Michigan both optimized General Motors’ access to railroad transportation and provided a highly visible symbol of corporate power, an industrial reflection of the company’s New Center headquarters located along Woodward Avenue north of downtown.</p>
<p>Cadillac’s new facility, designed by the DuPont Engineering Company of Delaware, was denser than the low-scaled, pavilion-like plants designed by Albert Kahn for Chalmers and Hudson.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1538513212471166">31</xref>
</sup> Cadillac’s plant was a neatly organized grouping of four-to-five-story concrete structures interwoven with light wells and open courtyards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-1538513212471166">Figure 19</xref>). This design in part reflected the spatial limitations of Cadillac’s triangular site. Nestled between rail lines that provided access to shipping, street access to the Cadillac plant occurred along narrow Clark Street, which bisected the plant before passing underneath the railroad line to the south. Cadillac’s collection of consistently designed, street-facing buildings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-1538513212471166">Figure 20</xref>) captured the spirit of Beaux Arts urbanism and lent a nondescript sector of Detroit an almost European splendor similar to General Motors' New Center northwest of downtown.</p>

<p>The closure of Cadillac’s two plants in 1987 put 3,000 General Motors employees out of work. After ten years of abandonment, the site was “cleared and remediated” in 1998 for the “Clark Street Technology Park” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21-1538513212471166">Figure 21</xref>). All historic buildings on the plans site were demolished and “replaced with several customized tenant structures.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1538513212471166">36</xref>

<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1538513212471166">37</xref>
</sup> The Park’s first tenant, auto parts manufacturer Vitec Corporation, invested $50 million in a new plant, receiving almost $18 million in city and state funding. With five-year contracts from GM and Chrysler totaling $680 million, the company built a 10-acre, 150,000-square-foot plant on the site that Vitec initially estimated would employ 100 people, with the potential to expand to 350.<sup>

</sup> By this time, five other smaller ventures had also built or signed on for space at Clark Street. By the early 2000s, additional incentives had slightly increased employment at the park. In 2003, Vitec received an additional $11.5 million in property tax exemptions to create ten new jobs and retain twenty existing ones.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1538513212471166">40</xref>
</sup> But our field study indicated that the Technology Park was more than half vacant in mid-2009 and that employment at the site totaled no more than 500 people. This is well short of the 1,000 jobs initially projected by the State of Michigan and a fraction of the thousands once employed by Cadillac on the site.</p>
<p>Similar to Chrysler-Chalmers, nothing remains of the once-urbane and attractive Cadillac plant today (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22-1538513212471166">Figures 22</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig23-1538513212471166">23</xref>). The site east of Clark Street, once home to Cadillac’s office headquarters, is fenced off and contains only a thin successional landscape and scattered rubble. The western half of the site is occupied by a single-story industrial shed (Vitec) and a one-story office structure (FedEx) that, if not for their location on Clark Street, would not look out of place in a technology park anywhere in the United States. The limited, low-density, architecturally negligible redevelopment of Cadillac’s Clark Street plant has at least avoided the wholesale destruction of nearby city blocks that characterized Chrysler’s Jefferson North redevelopment. In 2006, city blocks near Clark Street still contained vacant, multistory industrial structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig24-1538513212471166">Figure 24</xref>) as well as many dilapidated wooden homes. But the Cadillac plant itself was lost.</p>

<title>Packard: Demolition by Neglect?</title>
<p>The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were fertile ground for the formation of dozens of new automobile corporations like the Packard Motor Car Company, established in 1902. Founded in Warren, Ohio, Packard quickly relocated to rapidly expanding Detroit to be closer to its competitors. Like Chalmers and Hudson, it too commissioned Albert Kahn to design its manufacturing complex in the city. Located along East Grand Boulevard, Detroit’s early version of a ring road, the plant would eventually total nearly 100 buildings, of which at least ten were designed by Kahn. Although the early structures of the Packard plant were “standard mill construction” with heavy walls and floors supported by bearing walls of iron and steel, Packard’s Building Number 10, added in 1905, was heralded for its innovative use of reinforced concrete.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1538513212471166">41</xref>
</sup> Number 10 was uniquely characterized by larger windows, almost no ornamentation, and reduced interior columns. Its floors were concrete instead of wood, and it was effectively fireproof. The building’s use of cement showed Kahn to be not only prolific but a technologically proficient and innovative designer.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1538513212471166">42</xref>

</p>
<p>An aerial photograph of the Packard plant from 1939 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig25-1538513212471166">Figure 25</xref>) shows the “gigantic, almost suprasensory scale” that drew Erich Mendelsohn to Detroit.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1538513212471166">43</xref>
</sup> Even today (2012) this contrast remains a visual hallmark of the Packard facility. In 1939, a continuous wall of buildings two-to-five stories high and nearly one kilometer long directly faced a modest neighborhood of single-family houses across an ordinary city street. As the Packard complex grew and diversified over the next forty years, the striking contrast between its national scale of automotive production and the adjacent local scale of worker housing increased as well. Just like Cadillac, Chrysler-Chalmers, and many other Detroit plants, the Packard plant was a diverse archipelago of concrete and brick amid a sea of modest wooden dwellings.</p>

<p>The decline of the Packard Corporation in the 1950s was fast and dramatic. Saddled with cars that were expensively priced and inefficient to build, the company could no longer compete with the increasingly nimble production and lower-priced automobiles of the Big Three. Even Packard’s merger with Studebaker, forming the short-lived Studebaker-Packard company, was not enough to keep the company in good health. The new corporation’s Detroit plant was an unsustainable liability and the plant closed in 1956. Studebaker-Packard Executive Roy Hurley, perhaps foreseeing the troubles of the future, did his best to have the complex demolished. He “expressed the view that the whole Packard complex on the Boulevard was a slum. He tried to have the city tear it down to save the estimated $5 million that it would cost to raze a property valued at only $1 million.” Ultimately, the Studebaker-Packard corporation wrote off their losses by selling the entire complex to “a rug merchant for $750,000.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1538513212471166">44</xref>

</p>
<p>Since 1957, the Packard site has been privately owned and operated as a small-scale industrial park. Gradually, however, its tenancy declined. In the mid-1990s, up to eighty-five manufacturing tenants occupied parts of the plant, but by 2006, only one building remained partially occupied, and the rest of the facility was essentially vacant and thereby open to a range of illegal, illicit, and unauthorized activities, including vandalism, dumping, homeless occupations, parties, art installations, and a guerrilla garden.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1538513212471166">45</xref>
</sup> In late 2010, the site’s single remaining tenant—a chemical company employing nine workers—one one-thousandth of the nine thousand plant employees working on the site fifty-four years earlier—announced that it would relocate to the suburbs. At the same time, the city declared its intention to “eventually” demolish the plant and “present the owner with the bill.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1538513212471166">46</xref>
</sup> Thus far, the city has failed to carry out its threat, but the plant’s owner has also recently (2012) pledged to demolish the structure should funds become available.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1538513212471166">47</xref>
</sup> Certainly in Detroit’s current woeful economic climate, there is no prospect of viable proposals that might renovate the building to market standards.</p>
<p>The unlikely survival of the Packard plant, against the wishes of both the public and the private sectors, has made the collection of structures a highly visible symbol of Detroit’s decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26-1538513212471166">Figure 26</xref>). In recent years, the plant has become a regular subject of ruins photography, particularly the crumbling bridge connecting factory buildings across Grand Boulevard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig27-1538513212471166">Figures 27</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig27-1538513212471166">28</xref>).<sup>

<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1538513212471166">49</xref>
</sup> Packard’s state is not only an embarrassment to Detroit officials, but a literal hazard to Detroit emergency workers: Firefighters let suspicious fires in 2009, 2010, and 2011 simply burn themselves out, as the complex is too overgrown and unstable for equipment to access. And in 2012, the site’s threatened demolition made the Packard plant a perverse tourist attraction, with dozens of tourists visiting the site daily to capture the spectacle of Autopia’s end before its greatest surviving landmark vanished forever.<sup>

<title>Preservation in Crisis: A Possible Future for Detroit’s Automotive Industrial Sites</title>
<p>Since 1980, Detroit has lost almost its entire stock of historic automotive manufacturing plants. These complexes, as we have documented, were urban and architectural spectacles of industry, Detroit’s equivalent to Buffalo’s grain elevators or New England’s textile mills. Beyond that, the plants were significant elements of Michigan’s rich automobile manufacturing history and keystones of local industrial culture and neighborhood social fabrics. While the plant closures were in many ways unavoidable, the result of inexorably shifting forces of competition, consolidation, and consumption, the plants’ almost ubiquitous demolitions were not. The plant losses are both regrettable and poignant, for without them, Detroit today lacks not only visible markers of the defining force in its history, but the very structures that in many other cities have proved to be catalysts for cultural activity and economic revival and symbols of pride in the twenty-first century. Instead Detroit has succeeded, within the short space of thirty plus years, in removing almost every significant automotive manufacturing complex constructed during the previous seventy years.</p>
<p>Despite the diminution of the city’s industrial stock, industrial preservation constituencies have had little voice in hindering factory demolitions, or even in providing a public voice against their destruction. The recent history of Detroit has provided abundant evidence of precisely the contrary: “planning” and other neighborhood concerns have had little or no role when retention of automotive manufacturing is at stake.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1538513212471166">51</xref>
</sup> Detroit’s disregard of its built heritage also runs counter to broad historic trends in which the value of standing buildings increase as fewer of their building type remain. Even as today the Packard and Fisher Auto Body plants are popular spectacles of ruin, there is little discussion of their preservation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1538513212471166">52</xref>
</sup> Given the post-1980 histories of Detroit’s historic auto plants, it is unlikely that the Packard and Fisher structures will be standing in a decade.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1538513212471166">53</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While preservation has been conspicuously absent from the dialogues over the future of Detroit’s automotive sites, economic development has dominated them. The economic benefits of plant retention and technology park redevelopment in Detroit certainly remain open for debate, but from a preservation and design perspective the effects of economic development have been nothing short of ruinous. Given the evident struggles for economic success that have afflicted the Cadillac plant, it is ironic that there is a dearth of critical dialogue about the meaning and efficacy of economic development initiatives in Detroit today. The reality is that most of Detroit’s demolished automotive sites simply remain vacant; demolishing them accomplished little in terms of economic development, and cost much in terms of built heritage. By viewing “success” as the clearance of automotive plants for potential new activity regardless of the quality, success, or even existence of these ventures, Detroit’s economic development actors—public, private, and nonprofit—collaborated at the Cadillac and Chrysler-Chalmers sites, and likely many others, in erasing the industrial fabric of the city as effectively as any enemy bomber.</p>
<p>What if even a small fraction of the hundreds of millions of public dollars that went into economic development at Chrysler-Chalmers and Cadillac alone had gone into the simple stabilization or securing of some of the historic plant buildings? What if some of the buildings of these plants still stood today, sealed, intact, and awaiting future use? Certainly, securing these plants would have required only a small portion of the funds spent to condemn, demolish, and (only partially successfully) redevelop their sites—with the added benefit of preserving the buildings themselves. </p>
<p>Historic preservation’s impotence in stopping or even critiquing the demolition of Detroit’s historic automotive heritage can easily be seen as the inevitable shortcoming of nonprofit advocacy in the face of a relentless and opaque “growth machine” of public and private agencies obsessed with retaining and favoring powerful business interests.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1538513212471166">54</xref>
</sup> This much is incontrovertible, and preservationists should not shoulder blame for failing to halt in Detroit what many preservationists have failed to halt elsewhere.</p>
<p>But we think that preservation in Detroit, and in deindustrializing cities in general, has another shortcoming, a conceptual one. In these places, the field lacks a robust theoretical framework with which to imagine a future for buildings with no conceivable reuse in contemporary markets. As described by more than one textbook, American historic preservation practices are generally dependent on market-based adaptive reuse strategies requiring private or not-for-profit investors, developers, and stewards.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1538513212471166">55</xref>
</sup> But what if there is no conceivable developer-driven reuse for a building or complex? In Detroit, at least, this is the dilemma facing closed automotive complexes, but preservationists have as yet had no answer. </p>
<p>We believe that if the few remaining historic automotive plants in Detroit are to survive, and by extension if similar such hard-to-reuse structures are to survive elsewhere, that new models of historic preservation must be conceived. Otherwise, the survival of even a remnant of one of the world’s great industrial heritages is at serious risk of extinction. Detroit’s condition is extreme, but it is far from unique. In the American Rust Belt and in similar deindustrialized areas in Europe and the former Soviet Union, preservation and planning challenges for technologically obsolete buildings are immense.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1538513212471166">56</xref>
</sup> As urban designers and planners ponder the possibilities for “design after decline,” preservationists would do well to do the same: to imagine a future for monumental industrial structures in cities or regions where economic problems are significant and ongoing, where state funding and preservation capacity is limited, and where conventional preservation strategies have thus far failed.<sup>

<title>Three Preservation Alternatives</title>
<p>Three industrial preservation mechanisms already in practice at a small scale in Detroit offer a window into what an alternative industrial preservation paradigm might look like. The first is that of nonprofit stewardship: ownership and operation of a structure or complex of structures by nonprofit advocates committed, above all, to their preservation and reuse. The second, operating at a small scale in Detroit but at a much larger scale in economically healthier cities such as Boston, is the reuse of industrial structures for new economy-based startup industries in biotechnology and information technology. The third, least formal in nature, least conventionally acceptable, and most unexplored at present, is “Do-It-Yourself” (DIY) use: unstructured or semistructured inhabitation and activity in buildings by artists, entrepreneurs, and local residents. While no one of these mechanisms alone is ideal, we propose that some combination of the above provides the most productive lens with which to view the possible partial preservation of structures such as the Packard plant.</p>
<sec id="section10-1538513212471166">
<title>The T-Plex</title>
<p>The low-cost, privately directed restoration of the 1904 Ford Piquette plant has occurred under the auspices of local auto enthusiasts who are the owners and stewards of Henry Ford’s first significant factory. As the T-Plex, the building operates as a not-for-profit museum, housing an extensive collection of Model Ts and Model As and other automobiles, equipment, documents, and ephemera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig28-1538513212471166">Figure 29</xref>). Its principal assets, like those of many transit museums around the country, are the sweat equity and enthusiasm of its volunteers. The T-Plex raises money from donors, rents the plant for events, and pursues government and foundation grants, but its budget is small and the organization has no full-time employees. Nevertheless, it has succeeded in preserving, in excellent working order, a foundational industrial site—the place where Henry Ford conceptualized his idea for the assembly line and where the first Model Ts were produced. Similarly, low-budget enthusiast organizations have succeeded in stabilizing and reusing important industrial era structures in St. Louis at the former Lemp Brewery and in Buffalo at the former New York Central Railroad Station. (A subsequent study will document these “market-less” preservation practices in more detail.<sup>

<p>The T-plex is a single, relatively small industrial building, but the three plants examined in this article were much larger, sprawling complexes varying in age, configuration, and function. Of the fifteen such plants surveyed by Hyde in 1980, only the Packard plant retains a critical mass of historic structures today—an impossible prospect for conventional preservation. The complex is severely deteriorated, with a variety of structures that no single user or owner could ever hope to rehabilitate fully. Little wonder that local advocacy efforts like the group Preservation Wayne have focused on residential neighborhood conservation and cultural corridors rather than hard-to-preserve sites like Packard.<sup>

<title>Tech Town</title>
<p>Sites of Packard's scale may benefit from a second, more conventional preservation mechanism: the innovation- and technology-led rehabilitation of industrial structures. Not far from the Packard plant, the TechTown public–private partnership sponsored by Wayne State University has achieved notable success.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1538513212471166">60</xref>
</sup> Located along the central corridor that follows Woodward Avenue north from downtown, TechTown’s forty-three-acre-campus spreads across multiple blocks containing a former Burroughs Adding Machine factory and other adjacent factories and commercial buildings, including some formerly owned by General Motors dealerships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig29-1538513212471166">Figure 30</xref>). Unlike the T-Plex, TechTown’s approach is dependent both on foundation funding and on rental income from tenants. But the partnership’s conservation of historic buildings takes a more flexible, respectful, and successful approach to industrial heritage than the <italic>tabula-rasa</italic>-driven Clark Street Technology Park that replaced the Cadillac plant. One example is TechTown’s rehabilitation of a former seventy-year Cadillac dealership, closed in General Motors’ post-2007 reorganization and currently being mothballed for conversion to offices. Yet, even TechTown struggles to reuse larger buildings such as the abandoned and deteriorated “Tech Three” building south of its campus.</p>

<p>TechTown represents an important aspect of the creative continuum that is beginning to modestly reshape and reoccupy abandoned industrial Detroit. It is not inconceivable that TechTown, or a similarly structured organization, might play a role in rehabilitating limited areas of semiabandoned complexes like Packard if issues such as ownership were resolved. In hybrid of the economic-development-driven preservation of Tech Town and the enthusiast-driven preservation of the T-Plex, a coalition of local organizations led by the Woodward Avenue Action Association is attempting to gain access and ownership of Ford’s nearby Highland Park complex, while planning for its reuse as a center for automotive tourism and mixed use development.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1538513212471166">61</xref>
</sup> The preservation of this plant (mostly being used for storage in 2012), the historic location of the first automated moving assembly line and the revolutionary five-dollar-a-day wage, is far from assured. The coalition lacks significant economic backing and the political support enjoyed by TechTown. Environmental liability issues also cloud the complex’s future, and its owner recently demolished the significant and likely reuseable Records Storage Building.<sup>

<title>Do-it-Yourself: Experiments in Informal Preservation</title>
<p>While enthusiast- and technology- driven preservation models are compelling precisely because they are familiar models that have demonstrated success, a third potential preservation model is smaller scale, less formal, and more incremental. Over the past five years, entrepreneurs and creative residents of Detroit have embraced a DIY ethic of business development, new media, art, and place-based experiment, all in dynamic combination with the city’s historic building stock, including the ruins of the Packard plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig30-1538513212471166">Figure 31</xref>). In so doing, Detroit’s greatest liability—its seemingly relentless decline of ruined or dilapidated historic buildings—has evolved into one of the city’s most significant and visible cultural assets. The national media, led by the <italic>New York Times</italic>, has taken note. In 2010–11, stories about new businesses, creative culture, urban experiments, and locally based small-scale development projects paralleled those tracking the city’s more familiar narrative of decline.<sup>

Such DIY or insurgent actions, playfully engaging the present semiabandoned condition of Detroit, suggest the existence of a small, but emerging constituency passionate about the creation of culture within the city’s dilapidated physical fabric. While Detroit’s unofficial “artists in residence” are engaged in individual creative gestures, not wider scale conservation, there is little question that their efforts are sincere and that they have garnered significant national attention. These cultural practices have little to do with the economic-development-driven efforts that have demolished former automobile plants like Cadillac; their very visibility derives from their juxtaposition against a compelling industrial setting, not their erasure of it.</p>

<title>Market-less Futures for Detroit’s Industrial Heritage</title>
<p>Rather than facing almost inevitable demolition for conventional economic development strategies, sites such as Packard might conceivably survive as places for cultural production under nonprofit stewardship. The demolition of Detroit’s automotive manufacturing heritage under the economic-development-driven policies of the past thirty years argues that the conventional wisdom of market-driven preservation will not work at this scale in Detroit, and instead that preservationists must widen their conception of preservation theory and practice to incorporate the conservation of industrial structures such as the Packard or Fisher plants under alternative scenarios.</p>
<p>What if, rather than pursuing an office park or industrial reuse scheme whose developer might demand demolition of all existing buildings in addition to millions of dollars in public subsidies, or instead of arguing for federal or state funds to demolish the Packard plant, the city of Detroit embraced Packard in its current state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26-1538513212471166">Figure 26</xref>)? Bizarre as this scenario might seem, it pales in the face of the impossibility of a conventional actor willing or able to transform the complex into a prosperous center of new industry. Admitting this impossibility opens the door for a new conception of Packard’s buildings and their site. </p>
<p>Embracing Packard in its current state would begin with two actions: first, bringing the site into public ownership,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-1538513212471166">65</xref>
</sup> and second, conveying the site to a nonprofit steward or stewards whose priorities would be to conserve what remained while ensuring, facilitating, and encouraging the reuse of the site for any and all interested parties with cultural or social purposes. Such a conveyance of the Packard site to a responsible steward would permit targeted, incremental investments to improve or rehabilitate the property, if and when demand coalesced. In the interim (the foreseeable future), moderate securitizing of the site, while perhaps allowing occupation by informal agents such as the site’s current “caretaker” to continue, would provide opportunity for artistic experiments and practices that would be unique to Detroit. <sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-1538513212471166">66</xref>
</sup> The city may be in ruins, but its ruinous state is among its most compelling qualities. </p>
<p>Preserving the Packard plant as a semiruin is less radical than it might seem. Examples of postindustrial sites with substantial elements of their industrial past remaining may be found in places as diverse as the Ruhr Valley, Germany and in Albany, California. Near the city of Duisberg, a river valley heaped high with slag, coal mines, and steel plants was preserved and redesigned in the 1990s as the Emscher Landschaft-Park (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig31-1538513212471166">Figure 32</xref>). Industrial preservation at Emscher is part of the emerging landscape urbanism movement, in which buildings, landscapes (both designed and natural) and industrial waste are perceived as a single complementary environment whose current meaning stems from their vast scale and seemingly incompatible mixture of uses, structures, textures, and activities.<sup>

</sup> Emscher exists because of a benevolent tradition of architectural and urbanistic practice in Germany known as the IBA or International Building Exhibition. IBAs in recent decades have reimagined both urban and rural spaces, exploring such issues as shrinking cities, urban rehabilitation, and sustainable waterfronts.<sup>

<p>An ocean and a continent away, a much more accidental confluence of factors has created the unique postindustrial environment known as the Albany Bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig32-1538513212471166">Figure 33</xref>). A former landfill projecting into San Francisco Bay became, after a series of failed traditional development proposals, a locus for informal activity ranging from public art to dog-walking to homeless encampments. Unappealing from a conventional parks and regulatory perspective, the Albany Bulb has engendered a wide public constituency dedicated to preserving a unique environment in San Francisco Bay.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-1538513212471166">69</xref>
</sup> Despite this, public actors persist in attempting to regulate and control informal uses in the space, much as New York State has done with a once similarly vibrant postindustrial site in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.<sup>

<p>Much like the Albany Bulb, a former landfill on San Francisco Bay that is a site for culture, recreation, and informal activity, the Packard Plant has in its ruin become a kind of sublime landscape. Preservation practice and theory should consider acknowledging the plant’s new meaning, rather than demolishing it as a safety hazard for new “economic development” <italic>Source</italic>: Flickr (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sweetiepiepress/2681865234/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/sweetiepiepress/2681865234/</ext-link>).</p>

<p>Germany’s fortuitous combination of state support, cultural valuation of design and memory, and preservation of postindustrial sites is an unlikely possibility in Detroit, where both municipal and corporate cultures have proved themselves dedicated to traditional development models. Yet even in the Motor City, a vibrant DIY culture, together with other actors has generated an ample range of activities on the Packard site that demonstrates a potential equal to Emscher Park. Understanding that Packard, once a factory, is now as much landscape as it is a cluster of buildings might promote a broader understanding of the plant as a site to be simultaneously left to nature, informally and opportunistically occupied, and perhaps even conventionally redeveloped. This understanding might in turn influence a sea change in the mind-sets of the panoply of professionals driving the industrial redevelopment efforts that have thus far resulted in the demolition of most of Detroit’s industrial heritage. In similar fashion, the delightful and revolutionary High Line in Manhattan has made other American cities reconsider their own neglected elevated rail lines.</p>
<p>Detroit is a damaged but broad canvas. Expansive and only semioccupied, the city provides space for both conservativeand experimental building and conservation practices undertaken by a diverse array of parties vested in the improvement of the city. Certainly, the remaining pieces of Detroit’s exemplary industrial past deserve to exist within this urban environment. But many of Detroit’s citizens already appreciate the city as a wholly new condition in which the unique industrial heritage generated in the past can survive through unconventional means. Detroit provides plenty of space for conventional solutions like office parks and (even) new automotive plants, but it also needs space in which its unique industrial heritage can be experienced by residents and visitors of its brilliant industrial past.</p>
<p>In Detroit and other shrinking cities, residents deserve better than to see their rich built heritage demolished and replaced with vacant lots, surface parking, office parks, and fortress-like industrial complexes that have negligible architectural and urban qualities and debatable economic value. The remaining fragments of the city’s industrial legacy, in contrast, provide a valuable opportunity to give postindustrial cities a visual identity, to preserve a sense of pride in their citizens and to foment creative cultures and industries that attract interest and eventual investment. In turn, the survival of such sites might promote a redefining of preservation practice and theory by suggesting that the field abandon its market-driven ideology in favor of a “mixed media” of solutions and ideas.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-1538513212471166">71</xref>
</sup> In Detroit, Autopia’s end may yet leave a material heritage of industrial monuments behind. Only Detroiters themselves can determine whether or not the city can set a new example for shrinking cities in the years to come.</p>

<p>The basis for marketless or DIY industrial preservation is closely allied with “public history” as discussed by Dolores Hayden, <italic>The Power of Place: Urban Landscapes as Public History</italic> (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1995), and Andrew Hurley, <italic>Using Public History to Revitalize Inner Cities</italic> (Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press, 2010). Similarly spirited industrial preservation efforts are occurring with Buffalo’s (NY) historic landscape of concrete grain elevators. See Lynda Schneekloth, Ed., <italic>Revisiting Concrete Atlantis: Buffalo Grain Elevators</italic> (Urban Design Project, University of Buffalo, State University of New York, 2006). </p>
