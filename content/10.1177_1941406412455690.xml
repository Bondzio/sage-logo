<p><italic>Background</italic>. In this pilot study, we examined school-aged children’s familiarity and willingness to try fruits and vegetables (FV) and the impact of a 6-week school-based snack feeding intervention on familiarity and consumption of FV. <italic>Methods</italic>. In all, 190 fourth- to sixth-grade students from a rural Lower Mississippi Delta (LMD) school participated. Measures included surveys assessing familiarity and willingness to try FV and direct observation of FV snack consumption. <italic>Results</italic>. At baseline, the majority of students provided correct name recognition for 6 of the 11 snacks offered, whereas name recognition increased significantly for the other 5 FV postintervention. Similarly, previous eating experience increased for 7 of the 11 FV offered. On average, a higher percentage of the fruit (54% to 98%) and vegetable (49% to 50%) snacks offered were consumed by the students. Willingness to try and grade level were the strongest predictors of fruit and vegetable snack consumption. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. These results suggest that an FV snack feeding intervention can increase the familiarity, and thereby potentially, the amount of FV consumed by LMD school children. Further research is warranted to determine if the positive effects of such programs extend beyond the school environment and into the home.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Childhood obesity is a national and international public health threat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412455690">1</xref></sup> In the United States, approximately 15% of children 2 to 19 years old are classified as overweight and 17% as obese.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941406412455690">2</xref></sup> In Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, the combined rates of childhood (age 10-17 years) overweight and obesity exceed the national average with prevalence ranging from 36% to 44%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1941406412455690">3</xref></sup> Even higher rates are observed in the largely impoverished Lower Mississippi Delta (LMD) region of this tristate area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941406412455690">4</xref></sup> The short- and long-term health implications of this crisis are becoming more evident. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, osteoarthritis, and type 2 diabetes—health conditions previously believed to be limited to overweight/obese adults—are now comorbidities commonly present in pediatric populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941406412455690">1</xref></sup> Furthermore, childhood obesity often tracks into adulthood, perpetuating the adult obesity epidemic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1941406412455690">5</xref></sup> Given these sobering statistics, effective strategies that promote both weight loss and healthy weight management in children are needed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412455690">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1941406412455690">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>One strategy, among several, advocated by the Expert Committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics to combat childhood obesity is consuming the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA)–recommended daily servings for fruits and vegetables (FV).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1941406412455690">8</xref></sup> These range from 4 to as many as 10 servings, depending on the child’s age and gender.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1941406412455690">9</xref></sup> Most FV have high water and fiber content with low energy density,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412455690">6</xref></sup> properties that may promote a healthy weight through decreased total energy intake and increased satiety.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1941406412455690">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941406412455690">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1941406412455690">11</xref></sup> Unfortunately, less than 12% of US children, 9 to 12 years old, meet the USDA recommendations for daily servings of FV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1941406412455690">12</xref></sup> Low FV intakes have also been observed in children residing in the LMD region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941406412455690">13</xref></sup> Factors associated with lower FV consumption in children include decreased preference for FV,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1941406412455690">14</xref></sup> lower socioeconomic status, male gender, older age, low parental intake, and decreased availability at home and school.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1941406412455690">15</xref></sup> Children’s unwillingness to try healthy foods was also reported as a reason for their low intake of FV by LMD adults participating in community-based focus groups, although no empirical data were available to support this notion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412455690">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The majority of US children are enrolled in school, consuming 1 and sometimes up to 3 meals per day in this setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1941406412455690">17</xref></sup> Hence, schools can provide a natural environment in which children can learn and engage in healthy eating practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1941406412455690">18</xref></sup> Several school-based nutrition interventions, focused specifically on increasing FV consumption, have demonstrated positive results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1941406412455690">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1941406412455690"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1941406412455690"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1941406412455690"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1941406412455690">23</xref></sup> These studies used a combination of intervention components such as classroom curriculum, food service staff trainings, point of purchase messaging, positive reinforcement (praise and rewards), take home assignments, family involvement, and food tastings. The USDA’s Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1941406412455690">24</xref></sup> is a simplistic initiative that provides no-cost FV snacks to participating schools. However, schools have the option of integrating other complimentary components, such as newsletters or classroom curricula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941406412455690">25</xref></sup> An evaluation of the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program’s impact on urban and rural Mississippi 5th, 8th, and 10th graders revealed that familiarity with FV improved across all grade levels, willingness to try FV increased in 8th graders, and fruit intake (based on self-reported dietary assessment) increased in the 8th- and 10th-grade students. To the best of our knowledge, the effects of such minimal intervention on objectively measured FV consumption in elementary school children have not been evaluated. Therefore, the objectives of this pilot study were to (<italic>a</italic>) assess fourth- to sixth-grade LMD elementary school children’s familiarity with (name recognition and experience eating) and willingness to try FV snacks; (<italic>b</italic>) evaluate the potential of a school-based FV snack feeding intervention to increase children’s familiarity with and consumption of select FV; and (<italic>c</italic>) determine if associations existed between familiarity, willingness to try, and consumption of FV.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The School Kids Access to Treats to Eat (SKATE) pilot study was conducted with fourth- to sixth-grade students enrolled at a rural elementary school located in Hollandale, Mississippi. One hundred percent of the students at this school were eligible for free or reduced school meals with a 95% participation rate. Approval for the study was obtained from the Research Advisory Committee, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas and the Institutional Review Board, University of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg, Mississippi.</p>
<sec id="section3-1941406412455690">
<title>SKATE Fruit and Vegetable Feeding Study</title>
<p>The SKATE pilot study was a 6-week, in-school, FV snack feeding trial in which children’s familiarity (recognition and prior eating experience), willingness to try, and consumption of FV were measured. All students in fourth to sixth grade at the target school were invited to participate. Teachers assisted with the distribution and collection of parental consent and child assent forms. Children who provided written assent and obtained parental consent were enrolled in the study. Prior to implementing the snacking intervention, the school principal formed an Advisory Committee, composed of 6 lead teachers and the school food service director. The committee was commissioned to work with researchers to develop a workable protocol that would allow children to benefit from nutritious snacks with minimum disruption to the school day. It was determined that FV snacks would be offered 3 times per week over a 6-week period. The snacks consisted of 12 fruits (green and red apples, apricots, cantaloupe, red and green grapes, kiwis, mandarin, clementine, and navel [offered twice] oranges, pears, and tangerines) and 5 vegetables (broccoli, baby carrots, yellow squash, grape tomatoes, and zucchini).</p>

<sec id="section4-1941406412455690">
<title>Food Recognition/Eating Experience and Willingness to Try</title>
<p>Prior to the start of the feeding trial, each student’s baseline familiarity (recognition of and prior eating experiences with) and willingness to try 12 FV (red apples, apricots, cantaloupe, red and green grapes, kiwi, navel oranges, pears, tangerines, tangelos, baby carrots, and grape tomatoes) was determined. To measure familiarity, each child was first asked to name the foods after viewing flash cards depicting both the exterior and interior of the target FV. Children’s responses were recorded as yes or no to correctly naming the food. Next, children’s responses to inquiries regarding past eating experience with each food were recorded as yes or no. The same procedures to test baseline familiarity were repeated postintervention. To assess children’s baseline willingness to try the planned FV snacks, the WillTry survey and the same set of picture flash cards were used. The development and validation of the WillTry survey in this population of children has been described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1941406412455690">26</xref></sup> Briefly, the WillTry survey consists of 25 items, including 4 general questions regarding the child’s willingness to try a new fruit, vegetable, food or casserole; 12 questions related to the child’s willingness to try specific FV; 1 multipart question addressing “where” the child would be willing to try new foods (home, relative’s house, friend’s house, restaurant, and church); 2 items addressing picky eating; 1 question addressing healthy eating; 1 item addressing whether food choice is based on appearance; and 4 demographic questions (age, interviewer-recorded gender, number of brothers, and number of sisters). For willingness to try a specific food, children were shown a flash card and then asked if they would be willing to try the food item pictured. Responses were originally recorded as <italic>No</italic> (1), <italic>Not Certain</italic> (2), <italic>Maybe</italic> (3), or <italic>Yes</italic> (4). However, based on results of the validation study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1941406412455690">26</xref></sup> the <italic>Maybe</italic> and <italic>Not Certain</italic> categories were collapsed into a single category with the values rescored accordingly (scale 1-3). Higher scores indicated a greater willingness to try a food item.</p>

<title>Feeding Procedures</title>
<p>Trained research assistants preweighed (to the nearest whole gram) and labeled each snack with an identification number using a Tanita KD300 kitchen scale (Arlington Heights, IL). Snacks ranged from 30 to 110 grams in weight and were cut into units appropriate for the specific food (slices for apples and kiwi, cubes for cantaloupe, wedges for oranges and tangerines, and halves for canned apricots), or served as small whole pieces (grapes, baby carrots, and grape tomatoes). Containers were either 4-ounce portion cups with lids or small plastic sandwich bags. Prior to snack distribution, teachers were asked to identify enrolled students who were absent that day. At the start of each afternoon snack period, a short presentation was made regarding the snack item to be offered. The brief presentation included naming the fruit or vegetable snack and sharing several fun facts about the specific snack item with the students. Subsequently, the children were allotted 20 minutes to consume the snack in the cafeteria with research staff and teachers monitoring any food swapping, sharing, or hiding. At the end of the snack period, students were instructed to return all containers, plastic silverware, and remaining food refuse to the staff. Subsequently, containers plus refuse were weighed, followed by reweighing of the empty container after the refuse was discarded. This allowed for calculation of each snack’s consumption amount on an individual student basis. Proportional intake was derived by dividing the consumption amount (prefeeding snack weight − postfeeding refuse weight; in grams) by the prefeeding snack weight (in grams).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.2, (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Only the 11 FV on the WillTry survey that were included in the food recognition/experience and subsequently served as snacks, were used in the individual snack analyses. All 12 of the foods on the WillTry survey and all 17 of the served snacks were used in the overall analyses. Demographic characteristics (age and gender), familiarity (recognition and experience), and willingness to try responses are presented as frequencies. χ<sup>2</sup> test, Fisher’s exact test, or Cochran–Armitage trend test were used to determine significant associations among grade, gender, familiarity, and willingness to try FV. Additionally, McNemar’s tests were used to determine if significant changes occurred in recognition of and previous eating experience with the FV from baseline to postintervention. Snack consumption is presented as mean proportional intake. For the overall analyses, mean familiarity, willingness to try, and proportional intakes were computed. Multivariable linear regression analysis, using a beta distribution, was used to predict proportional intake of the FV snacks with grade, gender, recognition, experience, and willingness to try responses included in models as predictor variables. Interaction terms were also included for recognition with experience, recognition with willingness to try, and experience with willingness to try. Backward selection was used until only those variables significant at the .05 level remained in the models. The beta distribution is used for variables, such as proportions, whose values range from 0 to 1 (inclusive). Subsequent post hoc testing for group differences using the Tukey method was performed for grade and WillTry response categories.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Of the 214 fourth- sixth-grade students attending the rural elementary school, 190 (88%) were enrolled in the study, and 98% (n = 187) of those enrolled, completed the study. Of those students who completed the study, 38% (n = 71) were in fourth grade, 24% (n = 44) in fifth grade, and 39% (n = 72) in sixth grade. Almost all the students were African American (based on anecdotal observation as information on race was not collected) and approximately half (55%) were male.</p>
<sec id="section8-1941406412455690">
<title>Food Recognition, Experience, and Willingness to Try</title>
<p>The children’s baseline and postintervention responses to questions concerning familiarity and willingness to try (baseline only) the 11 specific FV snacks are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1941406412455690">Table 1</xref>. At baseline, recognition ranged from 9% (apricot) to 100% (baby carrot and red grape), previous eating experience ranged from 46% (apricot) to 100% (red apple), willingness to try ranged from 30% (grape tomato) to 96% (red grape), and unwillingness to try ranged from 0% (red apple) to 5% (cantaloupe). No significant differences existed among the grades for familiarity of any of the 11 FV (data not shown). However, a significantly small proportion of fifth graders were willing to try kiwi than either fourth or sixth graders (77% vs 96% and 94%, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .005). No significant differences existed between the genders for recognition (data not shown). However, females were significantly less likely to have previous eating experience with apricots (37% vs 53%; <italic>P</italic> = .03), more likely to have experience with tangerines (78% vs 64%; <italic>P</italic> = .04), and more willing to try kiwis (98% vs 85%; <italic>P</italic> = .007) compared with their male counterparts.</p>

<p>Children’s proportional intake of the 11 FV snacks is also presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1941406412455690">Table 1</xref>. The sample sizes varied for these foods since not all students were present on days on which snacks were served. Mean proportional intake for the individual FV snacks ranged from 50% (baby carrots and grape tomatoes) to almost 100% (kiwis and red grapes). Overall (average of all snacks combined), mean proportional intake was 67%.</p>
<p>Results of the regression analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1941406412455690">Table 2</xref>. To simplify the table, only significant categorical predictor variable results (means and corresponding standard deviations) are presented. Mean proportional intake differences were apparent among grades for kiwi, apricot, baby carrot, tangerine, and grape tomato. Sixth graders consumed significantly less kiwis than fourth or fifth graders, more apricots than fifth graders, and more baby carrots and tangerines than fourth graders. Fourth graders consumed significantly less grape tomatoes than either fifth or sixth graders. Mean proportional intake differences were also apparent among baseline willingness to try responses for kiwi, baby carrot, cantaloupe, and grape tomato. Children indicating at baseline that they were unwilling to try kiwi consumed significantly less of this fruit than children who were ambivalent about trying or willing to try kiwis. Additionally, children who were ambivalent about trying baby carrots, cantaloupe, and grape tomatoes consumed significantly less of these snacks than children who were willing to try them. A mean proportional intake difference was apparent for experience in pears only. Children who indicated they had previous eating experience with pears at baseline consumed significantly more of this snack than children who did not have this experience. For overall intake, grade and mean willingness to try were significant predictors in the model. Sixth graders consumed significantly more of the FV snacks than fourth graders, and for every one point increase in mean willingness to try (average of all FV), mean intake increased by 70%. Gender and baseline recognition were not significant predictors of proportional intake for any of the individual FV snacks or when all snacks were combined.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this pilot study suggest that SKATE, a school cafeteria-based FV snack feeding intervention, increased fourth- to sixth-grade, rural, LMD student’s familiarity with several FV. Furthermore, a high percentage of the fruit (54% to 98%) and vegetable (49% to 50%) snacks offered were consumed by the students. Importantly, the program was well received by students as both participation (88%) and retention (98%) rates were high and may be the direct result of the involvement of teachers and administrators in the planning and implementation of the study.</p>
<p>At baseline, the majority (97% to 100%) of students provided correct name recognition for 6 of the 11 FV offered as snacks. Postintervention, name recognition increased significantly for the other 5 FV in which children were able to demonstrate improvement. Similarly, eating experience increased for 7 of the 11 FV offered as snacks, suggesting that the majority of children tried the snack items. For 3 of the fruits, no improvement was possible since baseline eating experience was already 100% (or very near to it). In addition, both accurate name recognition and previous eating experience were associated with increased willingness to try the FV snack items. This is supported by previous research suggesting that familiarity of both the taste and visual properties of foods can increase a child’s willingness to try these foods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1941406412455690">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1941406412455690">28</xref></sup> Notably, increased familiarity with specific FV was also reported in another cafeteria-based free FV snack program conducted with both similar-aged and older children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941406412455690">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Prior to the snack-feeding trial, the majority of students in this study were willing to try the planned FV snacks. This suggests that the belief held by LMD adults concerning their children’s unwillingness to try healthy foods (eg, FV) as being responsible for lack of consumption of such foods is unsubstantiated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1941406412455690">16</xref></sup> Student’s willingness to try was higher for fruits than for vegetables, which is consistent with previous research suggesting that children have a higher preference for fruits as compared with vegetables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1941406412455690">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1941406412455690">30</xref></sup> Willingness to try and grade were the strongest predictors of individual as well as overall FV snack consumption amounts. In general, sixth-grade students were more willing to try the target FV, including some less common fruits (cantaloupe and tangerine). Older students may have greater willingness to try more foods as their tendency to dislike new foods decreases with age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1941406412455690">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1941406412455690">32</xref></sup> Unfortunately, we did not assess change in willingness to try the target FV. However, in 2 similar studies, positive changes in willingness to try FV were observed postintervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1941406412455690">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1941406412455690">33</xref></sup> Interestingly, many students who answered “maybe” or “no” to willingness to try a food, consumed at least part of the food in the current study. However, the results from students who were unwilling to try the foods should be interpreted cautiously as the sample sizes were small. Regardless, simply offering a food to children may lead to consumption even with prior statements to the contrary. In fact, studies have shown that exposure alone is effective in modifying children’s food preferences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1941406412455690">34</xref></sup> It is also possible that the peer-group setting in which the snacks were offered or the role modeling provided by the teachers were reasons for the children’s unexpected consumption. Both group consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1941406412455690">35</xref></sup> and role modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1941406412455690">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1941406412455690">37</xref></sup> have been shown to increase children’s FV intake. Finally, hunger alone may have been a motivating factor for the children’s consumption as the snacks were provided at or near the end of the school day.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1941406412455690">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study is not without limitations. The study was conducted in a rural, LMD, predominately African American school with a 95% free lunch participation rate limiting the generalizability of the findings to children in other geographic areas of the United States. A large portion of the data was self-reported from fourth- to sixth-grade children and is therefore dependent on a child’s truthfulness. Additionally, these self-reported data may have been subject to bias as a result of providing socially desirable responses. No data were collected assessing FV consumption at other school or home meals. Hence, the effects of the intervention on total FV consumption could not be assessed. Finally, many of the FV were familiar to the students at baseline and we introduced far fewer vegetables than fruits. Future studies should include less familiar FV, particularly vegetables, since consuming a wider variety of FV is associated with positive health outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1941406412455690">38</xref></sup> However, because multiple exposures may be necessary to increase liking (and hence consumption) of unfamiliar foods,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1941406412455690">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1941406412455690">39</xref></sup> longer interventions that include multiple offerings of unfamiliar FV should be considered in the design of future school-based FV snacking studies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1941406412455690" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>These results suggest that a school-based FV snack-feeding intervention can increase the familiarity, and potentially, the amount of FV consumed by LMD elementary school children. Additionally, while consumption amounts of the FV snacks were positively associated with increased willingness to try, even those students indicating they were unwilling to try a specific food did consume at least a small portion of the item. Further research is warranted to determine if the positive effects of such programs extend beyond the school environment and into the home.</p>
