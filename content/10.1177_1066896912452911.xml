<abstract>
<p>Multinucleated epithelial giant cells mimicking viropathic effect or dysplasia have been documented in the gastrointestinal tract, specifically in the esophagus and colorectal polyps. This finding has been associated with either inflammation or hyperplasia in prior case series. The authors report the first occurrence in the small intestine involving a 30-year-old woman without a coexisting inflammatory or hyperplastic process. The multinucleated epithelial giant cells featured numerous homogenous nulei (mean 9 nuclei, range 5-18) limited to duodenal villi. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong positivity for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and negativity for herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella simplex virus, and cytomegalovirus. In situ hybridizations for adenovirus and Epstein–Barr virus were also negative. Despite a lack of a specific etiologic agent, evidence suggests multinucleated epithelial giant cells are the consequence of inflammation, chronic injury, or cellular degeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multinucleation is a cellular phenomenon that occurs in a variety of benign, malignant, and infectious conditions. The mechanisms by which cells differentiate into multinucleated giant cells remain unclear,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896912452911">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896912452911">2</xref></sup> but multinucleation of epithelial cells has been documented in several organ systems and attributed to a limited number of etiologies. Most commonly, epithelial multinucleation is the consequence of viral infection or cell cycle dysregulation leading to dysplasia. Another form of multinucleated cell is the multinucleated epithelial giant cell (MEG), a change of unknown cause, but one that may mimic viropathic effect or dysplasia in epithelial tissues. It can be challenging to distinguish these morphologic changes from an authentic viral infection or dysplastic process.</p>
<p>Multinucleated epithelial giant cells have been previously described in the gastrointestinal tract. Three case series, with a total of 59 patients, have examined this entity, 1 involving active esophagitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896912452911">3</xref></sup> and 2 in association with colonic hyperplastic polyps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896912452911">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912452911">5</xref></sup> All cases were found in the setting of significant inflammation or a hyperplastic lesion, but no causative agent of the MEGs was identified. Interestingly, the case of MEGs we present is not only the first described in the small intestine but also the first without pathologic or clinical evidence of an inflammatory process or mucosal injury. We investigated the clinical, endoscopic, histologic, and immunohistochemical features in an effort to determine a cause for the MEGs.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 30-year-old woman underwent evaluation for an 8-year history of intermittent nonradiating, epigastric abdominal pain and dyspepsia. Additional medical and surgical history includes acne, depression, and an uncomplicated appendectomy in 2005. Her comprehensive workup, including basic blood chemistry, complete blood count, liver function panel, and urinalysis, was unrevealing. The patient’s medications included compliant use of omeprazole, minocycline, venlafaxine, and combination ethinyl estradiol and norgestrel. Upper endoscopy was significant for a small hiatal hernia but was otherwise unremarkable. The second part of the duodenum was biopsied.</p>
<p>The duodenal mucosa had narrow, long villi lined by enterocytes and interspersed goblet cells with fewer than 20 intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 enterocytes. The quantity and architectural arrangement of crypts were normal with an acceptable degree of mixed inflammation in the lamina propria. Numerous multinucleated (mean 9 nuclei, range 5-18) epithelial giant cells were found in the surface epithelium of the villi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912452911">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896912452911">2</xref>). Approximately 1 in 3 villi contained at least one MEG (mean 2 MEGs per affected villus, range 1-2) with either an apical or basal location in the epithelium. The nuclei were overlapped with hyperchromatic, irregular membranes, but no nucleoli, inclusions, or atypical mitoses were present. No relationship was noted between the intraepithelial lymphocytes and MEGs.</p>

<p>Immunohistochemically, MEGs demonstrated strong positivity for keratin AE1/AE3 and were negative for herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella simplex virus, and cytomegalovirus. Ki-67 showed an absence of proliferation. In situ hybridizations for adenovirus and Epstein–Barr virus were also negative.</p>
<p>The patient continued to experience intermittent epigastric abdominal pain after endoscopy. Ultrasound and abdominal computed tomographic scans detected a 4.6 × 4.5 × 4.1 cm mass in segment III of the liver. The mass was laparoscopically resected and subsequently diagnosed as focal nodular hyperplasia. Her postoperative course was uncomplicated. Eight months following surgery, her abdominal symptoms had completely resolved.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Identification of pathologic conditions on endoscopic gastrointestinal biopsies may be challenging and recognition of mimickers of clinically significant lesions is critical. The atypical appearance of MEGs simulates viral cytopathic effect or dysplasia and awareness of this seemingly benign change is important to prevent undue clinical intervention. Neither this patient’s case nor any previously described series in the gastrointestinal tract,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896912452911">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896912452911"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912452911">5</xref></sup> vulva,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912452911">6</xref></sup> skin,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896912452911">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896912452911"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896912452911">9</xref></sup> or epididymis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896912452911">10</xref></sup> has identified the stimulus originating such cells. Viral or other infectious agents have not been detected by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, or electron microscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896912452911">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896912452911"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912452911"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912452911"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896912452911"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896912452911"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896912452911"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896912452911">10</xref></sup> MEGs have also not demonstrated a dysplastic evolution as shown by immunohistochemical markers for increased proliferation or microsatellite instability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896912452911">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896912452911"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912452911">5</xref></sup> Proposed hypotheses for pathogenesis include a reaction to inflammation or hormones, cellular degeneration, or a drug response. The fact that such cells have been identified in the epithelium of multiple organ systems suggests that this cellular transformation may be a distinct entity and should be regarded as a rare type of giant cell.</p>
<p>Currently, well-recognized varieties of benign giant cells include Touton, Langhans, and foreign body. Each has distinct cytologic and nuclear arrangements and is associated with a particular assortment of disease states. Touton giant cells are characterized by a ring of nuclei surrounded by foamy cytoplasm and are often found in fatty lesions such as fat necrosis and xanthomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912452911">11</xref></sup> Langhans giant cells feature an arc- or ellipse-shaped series of nuclei contained within the cytoplasm of several fused macrophages and are seen in granuloma-forming diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896912452911">12</xref></sup> Foreign-body giant cells are recognized by their disorganized and scattered nuclei contained within a pool of cytoplasm and are generated as a response to the presence of foreign material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912452911">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Multinucleated epithelial giant cells also have a characteristic morphology: a cluster of overlapped, hyperchromatic nuclei in a cell confined to surface or luminal epithelium. Although no particular pathologic response is presently associated with MEGs, they have a propensity for inflammatory lesions, but they may also be seen in apparently normal tissue.</p>
<p>Multinucleated epithelial giant cells are uncommon. Singh and Odze<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896912452911">3</xref></sup> collected 14 patients with esophageal MEGs by combining a 5-year personal collection of such cases with a retrospective search of surgical pathology files at 2 major medical centers. Kambham et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896912452911">4</xref></sup> documented 23 cases of MEGs in hyperplastic colon polyps from 21 patients by merging both personal files and a 4-year retrospective review of surgical pathology material at a major medical center. These patients are a part of more than 300 cases currently recorded in the literature.</p>
<p>Even though no specific etiology has been identified, MEGs likely are the product of a benign process due to the absence of affiliated clinical symptoms or deviations in expected clinical outcomes of affected patients. Evidence suggests they are the result of an inflammatory mechanism, chronic injury, cellular degeneration, or, in this patient, a possible drug reaction from chronic use of minocycline for treatment of acne. The tetracycline family is well regarded for its potent anti-apoptotic effects through interaction with caspases, cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, and other apoptosis pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896912452911">14</xref></sup> Suppression of apoptotic signals may be one mechanism by which MEGs form. It is likely that multiple mechanisms exist that result in MEG production and despite negative ancillary testing, a viral process still remains a possibility. MEGs are an important finding to differentiate from infection or dysplasia in the evaluation of a limited mucosal biopsy.</p>
