<abstract>
<p>This paper provides a spatial analysis at precinct level of the 2001 referendum of the Allianz Arena, a professional soccer stadium in Munich in Germany. While at the city level voters clearly supported the sports arena, voters in proximity of the proposed site opposed the project. Voters in proximity of an alternative site instead supported the project. We conclude that residents expected net costs of proximity to stadia and engaged in the referendum in order to shift the stadium away from their neighborhood. These findings indicate that sport facilities may exhibit a NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) character, which stands in contrast to the evidence available for the United States. Proximity costs and benefits of sports facilities apparently vary across sports and countries.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There has been considerable investment in sports stadia in many countries in the past two decades.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1078087411423644">1</xref></sup> The regional effects of these arena or stadium projects<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1078087411423644">2</xref></sup> are controversial. As a rule, ex post investigations that consider the replacement effects and appropriate costs reveal that the income, tax revenue, and employment effects that are frequently cited by the supporters of stadium projects are negligible at best (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1078087411423644">Matheson 2008</xref>). Therefore, in recent times, arguments concerning stadium projects have shifted toward the political benefits, urban development arguments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078087411423644">Ahlfeldt and Maennig 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1078087411423644">Maennig and Schwarthoff, forthcoming</xref>), gains in civic pride, and “feel good” and happiness effects during the staging of sports events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1078087411423644">Matheson 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1078087411423644">Groothuis, Johnson, and Whitehead 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1078087411423644">Süssmuth, Heyne, and Maennig 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1078087411423644">Kavetsos and Szymanski 2010</xref>). However, there are no ex-post evaluations of stadium projects that consider all these effects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1078087411423644">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Assuming rational behavior of voters (and political decision makers in cases of positive stadia decisions with no precedent stadium polls), positive decisions on subsidies for stadium construction or renovation indicate an increase in utility for the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1078087411423644">Matheson 2008</xref>). In addition (or in contradiction) to tangible and intangible benefits at the metropolitan level, (public) facilities such as sports stadia may exhibit diverging localized effects. So far the literature has suggested largely positive localized effects of sports arenas and stadia on location desirability up to a range of approximately three miles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1078087411423644">Tu 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078087411423644">Ahlfeldt and Maennig 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1078087411423644">Feng and Humphreys 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078087411423644">Ahlfeldt and Kavetsos 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078087411423644">Ahlfeldt and Maennig 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078087411423644">Carlino and Coulson (2004)</xref> find positive effects of professional sports on rents that are limited to city cores. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078087411423644">Dehring, Depken, and Ward (2007)</xref> find positive property price effects of a stadium announcement in Dallas but negative effects for a stadium project in Arlington, Texas. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087411423644">Coates and Humphreys (2006)</xref> find more localized proximity benefits related to sports arenas when analyzing voting behavior on subsidies for stadium construction and renovation. Finally, the home-voter hypothesis established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1078087411423644">Fischel (2001)</xref> has to be taken into account: Homeowners will vote in favor of projects that they expect will raise the value of their real estate properties. Empirical support for this hypothesis is provided, for example, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078087411423644">Brunner, Sonstelie, and Thayer (2001)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078087411423644">Brunner and Sonstelie (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1078087411423644">Hilber and Mayer (2009)</xref>, and most closely related to our study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078087411423644">Dehring, Depken, and Ward (2008)</xref>, who show that the spatial voting pattern in public referendum on a sports stadium could be partially explained by preceding real estate price reactions to a series of announcements. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078087411423644">Ahlfeldt (2011)</xref>, exploring the voting behavior on a large-scale urban development project within a rental environment, shows that renters, in contrast to homeowners, may oppose public initiatives if they associate increases in the local area valuation. The rationale is that a demand-driven increase in the cost for living space, despite coming together with an increase in neighborhood quality, could be forced to consume too much—if not the wrong—neighborhood quality at the expense of the consumption of nonhousing goods. For the subject referendum, these findings imply that given that real estate markets discount properties on potentially negative effects of stadia, homeowners, for a given level of (perceived) negative effects, would strictly have larger incentives to vote in favor of a stadium than renters.</p>
<p>Opposition to the location of NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) facilities—a mixture of public good at the metropolitan level (benefits as feel good etc.) and bad at the local level (costs related to noise and pollution)—has become a much-discussed issue in the political economy literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1078087411423644">Frey, Oberholzer-Gee, and Eichenberger 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1078087411423644">Kuhn and Ballard 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1078087411423644">Wolsink 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078087411423644">Bellettini and Kempf 2008</xref>). A key feature of these facilities is that they are considered necessary or desirable by at least a majority within society, while being opposed by almost everybody living in the neighborhood where the facility is located. Hence, the allocation of these facilities is nontrivial; interest groups often emerge to influence political decision makers.</p>
<p>Such strong opposition among residents in the vicinity of the proposed site also was present in the case of the Allianz Arena, the home venue of German professional football club FC Bayern Munich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078087411423644">Dürr 2001a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078087411423644">Ahlfeldt et al 2010</xref>). We empirically investigate the 2001 referendum on the Munich Allianz Arena using spatial analyses comparing voting behavior in the proximity of the existing, proposed, and alternative venues in order to infer expected impact on utility. Our analysis shares similarities with Coates and Humphreys’ (2006), who found proximity benefits of U.S. football and basketball arenas, and with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078087411423644">Dehring, Depken, and Ward’s (2008)</xref>, who attributed the market response to an announcement of a sports stadium based on the distance of a transaction to the location of the stadium. Existing empirical analyses of referendums on cultural institutions also point to positive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1078087411423644">Rushton 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1078087411423644">Schulze and Ursprung 2000</xref>). In contrast, our results point to a NIMBY characteristic of the investigated sports facility: a public good at the metropolitan level but bad at the local level. Besides the novelty of this result, we add to the literature by extending the empirical approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087411423644">Coates and Humphreys (2006)</xref> by a number of spatial configurations, including the use of continuous distance measures, spatial autoregressive models, and kernel residual regressions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1078087411423644">4</xref></sup> The analysis of expected proximity net benefits associated with a European football stadium facilitates inference on the generalizability of the U.S.-based evidence.</p>

<title>Stadium Referendums and Proximity Effects</title>
<p>Because the whole population can potentially participate in the decision regarding the subsidization of stadium projects, for example, through public consultation, the process constitutes direct democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1078087411423644">Fort 1997</xref>). In such a case, the citizens can decide whether the local authority or city in question should support the relevant stadium project with public funds. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1078087411423644">Fort (1997)</xref>, there were 29 public consultations regarding stadium projects in the United States between 1974 and 1996, of which 12 decided in favor of the project. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1078087411423644">Mondello and Anderson (2004)</xref> showed that in the United States in the period 1990-2000, 20 of 26 public consultations regarding stadium projects decided in favor of the project. The public consultation considered here is the first and only consultation as yet undertaken with regard to a stadium project in Germany.</p>
<p>If one assumes that the voters participating in a public consultation concerning a stadium project adhere to the economic principle of maximization of benefits, the result of the vote can be interpreted as the expected benefit to the electorate of the relevant project. The citizens vote for the subsidization of the project if positive benefits are expected and against the subsidization if negative effects are expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087411423644">Coates and Humphreys 2006</xref>). Overall, there have been only a few general scientific analyses of public consultations concerning sports stadia or providing empirical evidence of the behavior of the voters at the polls in such public consultations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1078087411423644">Fort (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1078087411423644">1999)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078087411423644">Blair and Swindell (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078087411423644">Brown and Paul (1999)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1078087411423644">Mondello and Anderson (2004)</xref> examined public consultations in the field of sport either in a general form or in a theoretical context. The only reports to assess empirical models of behavior at the polls in public consultations concerning sports stadia are those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078087411423644">Agostini, Quigley, and Smolensky (1997)</xref>, although without spatial reference, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087411423644">Coates and Humphreys (2006)</xref>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078087411423644">Agostini, Quigley, and Smolensky (1997)</xref> examined two public consultations between 1989 and 1996 concerning the construction of a new baseball stadium in San Francisco. They showed that at the spatial level of the constituencies, there existed statistical correlations between the sociodemographic characteristics of these constituencies and the percentage approval of the stadium project by the voters. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087411423644">Coates and Humphreys (2006)</xref> analyzed a public consultation from the year 2000 concerning the renovation of a football stadium in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and two public consultations between 1999 and 2000 concerning the construction of a new basketball arena in Houston, Texas. In these, they expanded the empirical approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078087411423644">Agostini, Quigley, and Smolensky (1997)</xref> in that, besides the sociodemographic variables of the constituencies, they also considered geographical variables that reflected the distance of the constituency from the location of the stadium. This allowed conclusions to be drawn regarding the voting behavior of citizens living in the immediate vicinity of the sports stadium. The results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087411423644">Coates and Humphreys (2006)</xref> showed that in Green Bay, the voters in the immediate surroundings of the football stadium were more likely to give their consent to the subsidized renovation than were those living further away; and in Houston, the voters living in direct proximity to the planned new basketball arena were more likely to give their consent to its subsidized construction than were voters in the surroundings of the old, previously used basketball arena. From this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087411423644">Coates and Humphreys (2006)</xref> concluded that the net benefits of stadia and arenas locally can be limited to areas in the immediate vicinity of the stadium location. Sources of proximity benefits for neighboring residents include reduced transport cost to the facilities and potential to earn money from selling beverages and food or renting out parking or increasing house prices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1078087411423644">Tu 2005</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1078087411423644">5</xref></sup> It is, however, worth noting that proximity to a large professional sports facility can induce proximity costs as well. The regular presence of a large number of spectators in the neighborhood may lead to problems of congestion, noise, and insecurity, to some degree depending on the local customs and behavior of crowds of fans.</p>

<sec id="section4-1078087411423644">
<title>The Project</title>
<p>Professional football in the Bavarian capital of Munich is shaped by the two sports clubs TSV 1860 München and FC Bayern München. Before the construction of the Olympic stadium for the 1972 summer Olympic Games, both of these Munich professional clubs used the municipal stadium at Grünwalder Strasse<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1078087411423644">6</xref></sup> as their home ground in the top divisions of the German Bundesliga and the DFB (Deutscher Fussball Bund) cup. After the 1972 summer Olympic Games, FC Bayern München turned its back on the Grünwalder stadium and, from that time, the first team played at the modern Olympic stadium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1078087411423644">N.N. 2007</xref>). Only in the 1995-1996 season and for several subsequent seasons did TSV 1860 München also switch to the Olympic stadium, which previously had been unpopular with the TSV 1860 fans because it was used predominantly by their local rivals FC Bayern München (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078087411423644">Beer 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, the Olympic stadium also became unpopular with the club directors and fans of FC Bayern München. The stadium had originally been designed for athletics events at the start of the 1970s and no longer met the demands of a modern football stadium, with little scope for the considerable increases in takings through traditional ticket sales. To solve this problem, various plans to renovate the Olympic stadium or to build a completely new stadium for football only were discussed in the following years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1078087411423644">Pauli 2001</xref>). However, the planned renovation of the Olympic stadium was difficult because the distinctive tent-like construction of its glass roof, regarded as an emblem of Munich, had to be retained, and any changes to the stadium required the consent of the architect and the copyright holder, Behnisch. After long negotiations, the architect’s office of Behnisch withdrew its own renovation plans after numerous misgivings expressed by individuals engaged in the protection of historical monuments, architectural experts, and art historians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078087411423644">Dürr 2000b</xref>).</p>
<p>When the planned renovation of the Olympic stadium fell through, pressure increased on all those involved in the issue of the stadium. In the summer of 2000, Germany’s bid to host the 2006 football World Cup was accepted. The city of Munich intended to apply to stage the opening game of the tournament, becoming an international media center with the most prestigious and modern football stadium possible. This “top World Cup stadium” was cited as an important prerequisite for a successful Munich bid by those responsible for the allocation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1078087411423644">7</xref></sup> To gain approval by citizens, the president of FC Bayern München, Franz Beckenbauer, who was also president of the organizing committee for World Cup 2006, announced that if the referendum was rejected, his club would seek an alternative location outside of Munich and would be renamed “FC Bayern” (without “München”) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1078087411423644">N.N. 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1078087411423644">Ude 2001</xref>). A PR agency was hired to manage the campaign “Ja zum neuen Stadion. Ja zu München” (Yes to the new stadium. Yes to Munich) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1078087411423644">Mrazek 2002</xref>), but no focus of this campaign on areas surrounding the proposed stadium was obvious. The intention that the new stadium be a widely recognized landmark for the city of Munich was manifested by the hiring of the architects Herzog and DeMeuron.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1078087411423644">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Eventually, at the start of 2001, the two clubs FC Bayern München and TSV 1860 München agreed to the construction of a separate new stadium, purely for football, with a seating capacity for about 66,000 spectators, as soon as the city agreed on a suitable location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1078087411423644">N.N. 2001a</xref>). In the course of these developments, five possible locations in Munich were examined for their suitability by representatives of the clubs and politicians. The potential locations were Freiham on the western outskirts of the city, the south Olympiapark, the central university sports grounds<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1078087411423644">9</xref></sup> in the neighborhood of the old Olympic stadium, an area near the new exhibition center in Riem, and an area in Fröttmaning<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1078087411423644">10</xref></sup> in the northeast of Munich (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1078087411423644">Dürr 2001b</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078087411423644">Figure 1</xref> shows the sites considered and the proportion of “yes” votes at voting precinct level.</p>

<p>Of the five locations, Riem and Freiham were the first to be ruled out. Freiham had neither an underground train station nor a motorway connection at its disposal, and the site was intended to be used primarily for biotechnical research. The area in Riem was in neither municipal nor state possession, so a financial framework could not be guaranteed and its completion on time before the World Cup might have been achieved only with difficulty. The traffic problem in Riem was also a great hindrance, especially should trade fairs and football matches occur at the same time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1078087411423644">Hornberger 2001b</xref>). After a further stadium summit meeting in May 2001, the ZHS grounds and Fröttmaning locations proceeded to the final round. From a short-term perspective, the south Olympiapark site was difficult to develop for structural reasons. Strong protests from the residents there were also taken into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078087411423644">Dürr 2001c</xref>). For similar reasons, the location at the ZHS grounds was also ruled out.</p>
<p>Despite higher than expected infrastructure costs for the extension of the motorway connections and an underground station, Munich city council voted for the Fröttmaning location in July 2001. To legitimize future dealings between the city and the citizens regarding the issue of the stadium, a public consultation on the construction project in Fröttmaning based on the city council decision was set for October 21, 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1078087411423644">Hornberger 2001</xref>). In this public consultation, titled “Stadium Construction in Fröttmaning—World Cup 2006 Football in Munich,” the citizens of Munich were asked whether they were in favor of the city council:</p>
<list id="list1-1078087411423644" list-type="bullet">

<list-item>

</list-item>
</list>
<p>Therefore, although the city would support the stadium project by surrendering the property<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1078087411423644">11</xref></sup> and sharing the infrastructure costs, the actual financing of the construction of the new stadium would be left to the clubs FC Bayern München and TSV 1860 München. The clubs had estimated a total investment of 400 million DM (approximately €205 million) for the construction of the stadium.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the public consultation on October 21, 2001, 902,061 citizens entitled to vote were called upon to make a final decision regarding the stadium. Of the 338,225 citizens who took part in the vote, a significant majority of 65.7% voted in favor of the construction of the new stadium. The result of the vote and the 37.5% voter turnout were the highest in a Munich public consultation since their introduction in 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1078087411423644">N.N. 2001e</xref>&amp;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1078087411423644">f</xref>). Ultimately, the city of Munich won the right to stage six games of the football World Cup 2006, including the opening game on June 9, 2006. An international media center for the 20,000 journalists reporting from the World Cup was also established in Munich. The city, regional government, and federal government contributed about €210 million for the development of transport links to the new stadium. The city of Munich raised little more than half of this, providing €107 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1078087411423644">N.N. 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>The area examined in this work refers to the autonomous administrative city of Munich, the capital of the Free State of Bavaria. At the time of the assessment, October 21, 2001, some 1,259,730 inhabitants were living in Munich, in an area of 310.41 km<sup>2</sup>. Munich was thus the third largest city in Germany in terms of the number of inhabitants and was, at the same time, the most densely populated large German city, with a population density of 4,058 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>. The municipal area of Munich, within the boundaries of October 2001, was subdivided into various spatial units: 25 municipal districts, 106 constituent districts, and 455 subdistricts. Besides the spatial structuring of the municipal districts, the municipal area could be further fundamentally subdivided into 656 voting precincts or electoral wards at the time of the assessment. However, in the event of smaller ballots, such as a public consultation, a different division of the voting precinct was made for reasons of cost and a lower than expected turnout. Accordingly, for the public consultation concerning the building of the new stadium, the municipal area was divided into only 311 voting precincts.</p>
<p>The absolute “yes” and “no” votes for each voting precinct have been made available by the Munich district administration department. Among the total 311 voting precincts, there were 50 absentee ballot districts (Briefwahlbezirke), which cannot be further considered in this assessment because of a lack of spatial classification by the Munich electoral office. The postal vote districts accounted for 60,054 of the total 338,225 votes cast. After the absentee ballot districts are subtracted, 261 constituencies or polling stations remain in the actual assessment, in which 278,171 Munich voters cast their votes on polling day.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1078087411423644">12</xref></sup> All of the data used in this assessment were obtained from the Munich statistics office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1078087411423644">München 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1078087411423644">N.N. 2001f</xref>) upon request. All data strictly refer as close as possible to the time of the vote on October 21, 2001, and the smallest possible spatial unit. Data on the demographic structure of the population eligible to vote, such as their age, sex, and the proportion of foreigners to Germany and to the EU, were available and represent the status on September 30, 2001. Those eligible to vote in the public consultation were all German nationals or nationals of other EU member states, who had reached the age of 18 on polling day and who had been registered as predominantly resident in Munich for at least three months. Data on the status of car ownership for December 31, 2001, were available. The total car ownership was adjusted to exclude the number of company vehicles. These data were available at the level of the 656 voting precincts and aggregated to the 261 precincts according to the official register.</p>
<p>Other data obtained from the Munich statistics office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1078087411423644">München 2007</xref>) included details of unemployment and the distribution of purchasing power. The unemployment records were made available in units of “unemployed in each subdistrict” at the level of the 455 voting precinct subdistricts and reflect the status in December 2001. The record of purchasing power was derived originally from a prognosis of the consumer research society Gesellschaft für Konsumforschung (GfK) in Nürnberg, for the year 2004. Here, “purchasing power” means the income of a household available for consumer purposes, adjusted for taxes and social security contributions. The data on unemployment and purchasing power have been adjusted to the level of the 261 voting precincts with the use of GIS and standard area interpolation techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078087411423644">Arntz and Wilke 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1078087411423644">Goodchild and Lam 1980</xref>).

<sec id="section7-1078087411423644">
<title>Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Model</title>
<p>In the Munich public consultation chosen as the central theme here, the behavior at the polls can only be analyzed in terms of the descriptive population-related characteristics of the constituencies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1078087411423644">13</xref></sup> The OLS method was used in the studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087411423644">Coates and Humphreys (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078087411423644">Agostini, Quigley, and Smolensky (1997)</xref> for the empirical analysis of the voting behavior in the consultations concerning the abovementioned American stadium projects. By adopting this method of analysis, optimal comparability between the results calculated in this work and the results of those authors should be possible.</p>
<p>The following regression model describes the behavior at the polls at the constituency level in Munich. The dependent variable, <italic>pcvy<sub>i</sub></italic>, represents the percentage of yes votes in the respective constituencies <italic>i</italic> in the Munich public consultation. The explanatory variables are, on one hand, the economic and demographic characteristics of the voters in constituency <italic>i</italic> and, on the other hand, the distance variables that represent the proximity of constituency <italic>i</italic> to the location of the planned stadium in Fröttmaning, to the already existing Olympic stadium, and to the other stadium locations discussed in this work. We did not consider the ZHS grounds and the south Olympiapark site separately, as their effects will be captured by the Olympic stadium because of their geographic proximity. The regression equation is thus:</p>

First, and of primary interest, we use a set of spatial variables to capture local costs and benefits that voters associate with the stadium. Second, we use a set of control variables to condition our estimated proximity effects on the socioeconomic characteristics of the resident population. This is done to avoid estimated proximity effects being confounded by attributes that affect voting decisions and are spatially correlated with stadium locations. The variable selection is guided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087411423644">Coates and Humphreys (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078087411423644">Agostini, Quigley, and Smolensky (1997)</xref>. Specifically, control variables are supposed to capture consumption and any other benefits and (opportunity) costs that selected population groups may associate with the project. We consider age and gender to account for varying associated consumption benefits and the local unemployment rate to cover expectations related to potential labour market effects linked to stadium construction. In addition, citizens of other EU member states, who were allowed to vote in the referendum, are included owing to their limited attachment to local football geography and their interest in keeping taxes low. We also include purchasing power as a proxy for household income, although the direction of influence of higher-income groups on the share of “yes” votes is somewhat unclear a priori. On the one hand, higher-income groups could show a higher level of support for the new stadium because it causes a higher consumption utility. For example, richer people can afford to visit the stadium more frequently, and the new iconic facility, which has a large number of business seats, was designed to satisfy the demands of more-affluent spectators. On the other hand, the opportunity costs of public investment should be higher for high-income voters because they are subject to higher tax rates. Specifically, they would be reluctant to support expenditure programs that could potentially lead to cuts in educational or cultural services, among others.</p>

<title>Spatial Autogregressive (SAR) Model</title>
<p>Spatial dependency requires differentiation between the two major forms. On one hand, neighboring observations may affect each other, which can lead OLS estimates to be biased and inconsistent. This would result from residents taking into account preferences of neighbors when choosing to vote in favor or opposition of the project. This dependency can be dealt with by the application of a spatial lag model. On the other hand, a spatial dependency in the error term can occur because of a spatial correlation in measurement errors or omitted variables. In the present analysis, it is likely that there are residential characteristics influencing the preference toward the project that do not capture the sociodemographic controls. A spatial error correction model can take into account this dependency and yield consistent estimates in the presence of this form of dependency. Methodological aspects of spatial error and spatial lag models are covered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087411423644">Anselin (1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078087411423644">2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078087411423644">Anselin and Bera (1998)</xref>.

Consistently, we find that precincts with an above-average proportion of people aged 25 to 35 exhibit a relatively lower share of yes votes, while the share of non-Germans from EU member states remains insignificant in all models.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1078087411423644">16</xref></sup> The share of yes votes is increased in precincts with a higher proportion of people aged 18 to 25 or 60 and above, or precincts that are characterized by a large share of male or unemployed population, while the opposite is true for precincts with a particularly high purchasing power per capita. Following the argument developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087411423644">Coates and Humphreys (2006)</xref>, these results may be explained by distinct consumption benefits that population groups expect to derive from the projects.

<p>This hypothesis can be rejected on the basis of the OLS results, which suggest that in proximity of the Olympic Stadium, the share of yes votes was up to 4.5 percentage points higher compared with the respective neighborhood. This corresponds to an increase in the share of yes votes of about 6.1% compared with the city average. Impact decreases with increasing distance from the Olympic Stadium, becoming insignificant within the 3000-4000 m (<italic>Olympic3k-4k</italic>) distance ring. In the neighborhood of Fröttmaning, the proposed site for the Allianz Arena, we find the opposite pattern. A strong opposition reveals a share of yes votes 53.7% below the Munich average within the 0-1000 m (<italic>Frött0k-1k</italic>) distance ring. The estimated impact again decreases with distance, becoming insignificant at a range of 4000-5000 m. The results for the alternative sites suggest a small increase in the share of yes votes within a much more limited range.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1078087411423644">Tu (2005)</xref>, we replace the inner distance rings with interactives of the neighborhood dummies and continuous distance measures for the existing (Olympic Stadium) (<italic>Olympic4k</italic> × <italic>Distance to Olympic St.</italic>) and proposed (Fröttmaning) (<italic>Frött5k</italic> × <italic>Distance to Fröttmanning</italic>) sites in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1078087411423644">Table 3</xref>. In this specification, the impact of proximity to the considered locations on the voting outcome is allowed to vary linearly with distance to the sites within the determined impact areas (4000 m in case of the Olympic Stadium, and 5000 m in case of Fröttmaning). The results depicted in column 1 confirm a significantly positive impact in the case of the Olympic Stadium (up to 8.6%) and a negative impact in the case of Fröttmaning (up to −49%), both decreasing with distance and becoming zero after approximately 3350 m for the Olympic Stadium site and 4220 m for the Fröttmaning site. However, considering the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078087411423644">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1078087411423644">3</xref> results (column 2) it is evident that only proximity effects derived for the proposed location in Fröttmaning—but not for the existing site (Olympic Stadium)—are robust to spatial dependency in the data. Therefore, one cannot reject that the proximity effects attributed to proximity to the Olympic Stadium are an artifact of unobservables that are correlated across space. The results for the vicinity of the proposed site are stable in terms of magnitude (up to −46.1%) and range (approximately 4390 m). The same picture emerges from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1078087411423644">Table 4</xref>, where we employ the spatial configuration based on first-, second-, and third-order contagious zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087411423644">Coates and Humphreys 2006</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1078087411423644">Figure 3</xref>). Again, one finds a positive although relatively weak impact for proximity to the Olympic Stadium (<italic>Olympic1</italic>), while for Fröttmaning (<italic>Frött1</italic>) there is a negative and much larger impact. In the case of the Olympic Stadium, the coefficient for Zone 2 (<italic>Olympic2</italic>) is weakly significant, while that for Fröttmaning (<italic>Frött2</italic>) is not significant at conventional levels (all OLS). This pattern can be explained by voting precincts in proximity of Fröttmaning being much larger compared with those in the vicinity of the Olympic Stadium. Again, coefficients on spatial impact variables defined for the site of the Olympic Stadium are not significant in the SAR model. The weakly and statistically significant coefficient for <italic>Frött3</italic> (SAR) is potentially attributable to some of the respective precincts being located in the sphere of influence of existing and alternative sites of the Olympic Stadium, namely, ZHS-Gelände and Olympiapark Süd (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1078087411423644">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Two of the considered alternative locations have not received attention in the empirical investigations so far because of their location in the very neighborhood of the existing Olympic Stadium and the potential overlap of impact areas: Olympiapark Süd and ZHS-Gelände. In particular, ZHS-Gelände north of the Olympic Stadium represents an interesting location since it was in the final round with Fröttmaning and, hence, would have been the most natural site to be considered in case of a failure of the referendum. To investigate whether there are any location-specific particularities in those neighborhoods, we extend <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078087411423644">Table 2</xref> specifications by two sets of distance rings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1078087411423644">Table 5</xref>. The revealed pattern of impact varies considerably in comparison to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078087411423644">Table 2</xref>. The hypothesis of no impact of proximity to the Olympic Stadium on the share of yes votes can no longer be rejected, conditional on proximity to the introduced alternative sites. Similarly, there is no significant impact revealed for proximity to Olympia Park Süd. However, the hypothesis of no impact is rejected consistently in all three specifications for the three inner distance rings surrounding ZHS-Gelände, pointing to robust proximity effects at that site. Since the impact on the share of yes votes becomes insignificant beyond the 3- to 4-km distance ring surrounding ZHS-Gelände, we use a 0- to 4-km ring dummy (<italic>ZHS4k</italic>) in combination with an interactive term of <italic>ZHS4k</italic> and <italic>distance to ZHS-Gelände</italic> similar to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1078087411423644">Table 3</xref> specifications to allow the conditional impact on yes votes to vary with proximity to the site. Results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1078087411423644">Table 6</xref> are robust to spatial dependency. According to our final parametric model specification, there is a positive impact on the share of yes votes of up to 10.7% (OLS) and 9.5% (SAR) in the vicinity of the ZHS-Gelände area, diminishing with distance and zeroing out at approximately 3,800 m (OLS) and 3,870 m (SAR). Almost similar to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1078087411423644">Table 3</xref>, there is a negative impact on the share of yes votes in vicinity of the Fröttmaning location of up to 48.5% (OLS) and 46.1% (SAR), also diminishing with distance and disappearing after approximately 4,260 m (OLS) and 4,380 m (SAR). The estimated scope of the impact areas is in line with the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1078087411423644">Tu (2005)</xref>, who found a 5 km (3 miles) range for U.S. football stadium (FedExField) that is comparable to the Allianz Arena in terms of spectator capacity.</p>
<p>In the final step, we employ a nonparametric estimate as a cross-check to work out whether we used the “correct” parametric specification. We examine the residuals of the nonspatial baseline regression in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078087411423644">Table 1</xref>, column 1. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1078087411423644">Figure 4</xref> shows kernel regressions on residuals, demonstrating how unexplained variation in share of yes votes can be attributed to the location of the proposed (Fröttmaning) and alternative (ZHS-Gelände) sites. Comparing nonparametric kernel regressions to the parametric estimates taken from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1078087411423644">Table 6</xref> (column 1), there is consistency in terms of estimated magnitudes and ranges, confirming the appropriateness of parametric specifications discussed above.</p>

<title>Interpretation and Policy Issues</title>
<p>The Allianz Arena project, including the large amounts of public investment in transport infrastructure, enjoyed acceptance among residents at the metropolitan level as reflected by the clear majority vote. Possible explanations include expected direct or indirect economic impact, consumption benefits of holding soccer matches in a more comfortable arena or the civic pride of having more competitive home teams because of increased revenues, hosting FIFA World Cup 2006 matches or getting a new architectural landmark for the city.</p>
<p>At the same time, our results indicate the expected proximity cost of having a professional sports facility in the neighborhood. It is evident that residents in the neighborhood of the proposed site of Fröttmaning for the Allianz Arena, the home venue of German professional football club FC Bayern Munich, voted in strong opposition. One can observe a reduction in the share of yes votes of up to 46.1% compared with the Munich average, declining with increasing distance from the proposed site and becoming zero after approximately 4,380 m (2.7 miles) (SAR). Our results further suggest an above-average support in the referendum within the vicinity of the most probable alternative site ZHS-Gelände of up to 9.5%, diminishing with distance and becoming zero after 3,870 m (2.4 miles) (SAR). Both findings are in line with residents expecting a decline in utility from stadium construction and consequently wishing to prevent their own neighborhood to be reconsidered as a stadium location. The project considered possesses the key characteristics of a NIMBY facility: a mixture of public good at the metropolitan level (indicated by the clear majority vote) and public bad at the local level (indicated by the robust proximity cost) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1078087411423644">Frey, Oberholzer-Gee, and Eichenberger 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1078087411423644">Feinerman, Finkelshtain, and Kan 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The strong opposition at the proposed stadium site is in contrast to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087411423644">Coates and Humphreys (2006)</xref>, whose analysis of referendums in Greenbay and Houston points to evidence of direct or indirect proximity benefits related to the presence of professional sports stadia. Apparently, net-proximity effects may vary across countries, cities, projects, and/or sports.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1078087411423644">17</xref></sup> Possible explanations include diverging national and/or local regulations. In some countries such as the United States, it might be easier for people living in the neighborhood of stadiums to generate income by selling souvenirs, meals, and drinks to stadium visitors. In a similar vein, income may be generated by renting parking places on private properties in the vicinity of U.S. stadia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087411423644">Coates and Humphreys 2006</xref>). Second, proximity effects arising from reduced transport costs may differ from nation to nation. Third, different home ownership structures have to be taken into account. Germany has one of the lowest owner-occupier rates, especially in urban regions. In contrast to the United States, most residents are tenants in Germany. Homeowners will vote in favor of projects that they expect will increase the value of their real estate properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078087411423644">Brunner, Sonstelie, and Thayer 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078087411423644">Brunner and Sonstelie 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1078087411423644">Hilber and Mayer 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078087411423644">Dehring, Depken, and Ward 2008</xref>). Within a rental environment, renters, in contrast to homeowners, may oppose public initiatives if they anticipate valuation increases in the local area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078087411423644">Ahlfeldt 2011</xref>). Fourth, the characteristics of the facility may play a role.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1078087411423644">18</xref></sup> Larger facilities are more likely to induce the formation of NIMBY groups. If the facility is part of a larger project that extends to collateral infrastructure investments with specific benefits for neighboring residents or induces reductions in effects otherwise perceived as negative, the NIMBY characteristic may disappear. Examples of such extensions are parks, new (public) transport connections, and reurbanization strategies for the local area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1078087411423644">19</xref></sup> Unconventional stadium designs, sometimes branded as “iconic,” “landmark,” or “signature” architecture, may also significantly contribute to valuation of the project in its proximity and induce positive visual externality and amenity effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078087411423644">Ahlfeldt and Maennig 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078087411423644">2010</xref>). Fifth, the type of sport to be played in the facility may influence the perceptions of neighboring residents. This is related to the behaviors, habits, and cultures that are specific to fan groups associated with different sports and regions. One example of local particularities is the German soccer fan “culture,” which might induce a higher proximity cost because of the relatively large number of supporters who follow their team to away matches. The regular presence of up to several thousand emotionally involved supporters of the away team side-by-side with rival home team supporters can create a violent and undesirable atmosphere in and around a stadium. In addition, different sports involve different numbers of home games at different frequencies and thus differences in the balance of perceived positive and negative externalities, as is true for other facility uses. Other structural differences between nations or cities, such as team history and performance, league popularity, facility financing and the rate of regional economic growth, may well influence metropolis-wide acceptance, but may also contribute to the NIMBY phenomenon.</p>
<p>Finally, the absence of robust proximity effects at the location of the existing Munich Olympic Stadium deserves some attention. By drawing on the idea of residential sorting and assuming proximity cost to be similar at different locations, voting pattern could be interpreted in a way that residents in proximity to the existing site (Olympic Stadium) receive some extra proximity benefit compared with the expectation of residents neighboring the proposed site (Fröttmaning) and the alternative site (ZHS-Gelände), possibly because of stronger preferences for consumption of sports.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1078087411423644">20</xref></sup> Alternatively, one may observe a self-selection of residents in the vicinity of the Olympic Stadium who are less sensitive to sports-related proximity costs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1078087411423644">21</xref></sup> One may also consider that professional sports represent experience goods whose benefits residents can only ascertain upon consumption. Similarly, adaptive preference may play a role, that is, upon experience residents become accustomed to costs and develop strategies to avoid related disutility and, possibly, maximize utilities. Finally, the pattern of results may be interpreted as a form of risk premium imposed by voters in the proximity of the projected (alternative) site because of uncertainty about the mix of local costs and benefits, which results in opposition to the project. Similar phenomena may occur in cases of voting or bargaining on the location of other NIMBY facilities that not only generate local cost but also a limited degree of local benefit, such as airports, rail lines, power plants, wind turbines, and other public infrastructures.</p>
<p>A final assessment of whether NIMBY characteristics of facilities diminish over time would necessitate alternative strategies, such as contingent valuation, since referendums are held very infrequently. Comparison to econometric ex post analyses on real estate price effects would also allow for interesting insights. This is a question that certainly deserves further research. If local costs of NIMBY projects indeed tend to be overvalued from an ex ante perspective, then processes of direct democracy will not lead to efficient locations of NIMBY facilities. Similarly, asymmetric incentives for investment in lobbying would arise. In case of votes with smaller majorities than in the Allianz Arena referendum, persistency of a NIMBY facility location may result, even if, from the perspective of a social planner, relocation would be efficient.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1078087411423644">22</xref></sup></p>

<p>To interpolate the unemployment or purchasing power data from the original level of the 455 subdistricts or 106 constituent districts to the level of the 261 voting constituencies investigated, the method recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1078087411423644">Goodchild and Lam (1980)</xref> was applied. The assumption was made that from the spatial point of view, the data are homogeneously distributed over the source region. Therefore, it was assumed that the purchasing power per inhabitant was evenly distributed over the area of an individual constituent district, and that the same was valid for unemployment for the individual subdistricts. For spatial interpolation, a distinction must also be made between absolute countable data, such as the number of unemployed individuals per subdistrict used here, and proportional data, such as those for purchasing power per inhabitant in each constituent district used here. Therefore, to convert the unemployment and purchasing power data, various weighting matrices were applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1078087411423644">Goodchild and Lam 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078087411423644">Arntz and Wilke 2007</xref>).

<p>We consider the proportion of non-Germans from EU member states, since they were allowed to vote in the referendum.

<p>To sharpen the insight that the variety of local voting behaviors might be less because of nationwide differences, it should be mentioned that Denver voters did not support financing of the CO Denver stadium financing, whereas surrounding counties did support it.

<p>One can reject that residents sort with respect to car ownership because of congestion problems. Neither is car ownership per capita negatively correlated with proximity to the existing site (Olympic Stadium) nor is it positively correlated with proximity to the proposed site of the Allianz Arena at Fröttmaning. Considering car ownership per capita in regression analysis does not change the pattern of the estimation results.</p>

<p>This scenario obviously does not apply to the case of Allianz Arena. Residents in the neighborhood of the projected site, despite strong incentives, were too small in number to effectively engage in the lobbying while at the same the powerful agenda setter worked toward a fast decision. However, the outcome could differ if competing locations are more similar in terms of density of population.</p>
