<abstract>
<p>This study investigates the meaning and usage of the term <italic>wang-ta</italic> and other terms for bullying-like phenomena in an Eastern culture, South Korea. Data were obtained from 113 participants, ranging from young children to adults. Age-related differences in usage were found, in part developmental, but also suggesting some recent historical changes perhaps due to fashion in usage of terms especially in adolescence. Nevertheless, the term <italic>wang-ta</italic> and related terms all emphasize social exclusion, and this is argued to reflect the collectivistic nature of South Korean society.</p>

<p>Bullying in Western cultures is widely defined as a “systematic abuse of power” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261927X12446602">Rigby, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261927X12446602">Smith &amp; Sharp, 1994</xref>): aggressive behavior that is done repeatedly to another person who cannot defend himself or herself easily and that includes a power imbalance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261927X12446602">Olweus, 1993</xref>). The most common form is verbal (e.g., name calling), but it can be physical (e.g., hitting), indirect (e.g., rumor spreading), or relational (e.g., social exclusion; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X12446602">Björkqvist, Lagerspetz, &amp; Kaukiainen, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Bullying</italic> is an English term, and there is often no equivalent word in other languages that closely corresponds in meaning to it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261927X12446602">Smith &amp; Monks, 2008</xref>). Cultural differences in the meaning of terms to indicate bullying-like behaviors may be just linguistic. However, there may also be actual cultural differences in the nature of bullying-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12446602">Koo, Kwak, &amp; Smith, 2008</xref>). For example, compared with Western bullying, Japanese <italic>ijime</italic> is defined more in terms of the victim’s mental suffering in a group setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X12446602">Morita, Soeda, Soeda, &amp; Taki, 1999</xref>), and the phenomena occur more often using indirect than physical aggression and by a group of people rather than individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X12446602">Kanetsuna &amp; Smith, 2002</xref>). These differences may reflect a more collectivistic nature of social relationships in Japan than Western cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X12446602">Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X12446602">Kanetsuna, Smith, &amp; Morita, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>With regard to school bullying, studies in Western societies consistently show age-related trends in the definitions of bullying (younger children have a broader concept of bullying than older children, typically not using the imbalance of power criterion) and in the aggressive and bullying behaviors actually used (a shift from physical to indirect and relational forms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261927X12446602">Smith &amp; Monks, 2008</xref>). Although studies of bullying initially focused on school contexts, adult bullying, especially in the workplace, has become an important issue since the 1990s. The definition is similar to that of school bullying in terms of emphasizing persistent and repeated negative actions that are intended to intimidate or hurt another person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261927X12446602">Olweus, 1993</xref>); in the workplace, these negative actions are performed to a person in a weaker position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261927X12446602">Zapf &amp; Einarsen, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In South Korea, there are several terms to indicate bullying-like phenomena: <italic>gipdan-ttadolim</italic> (collective isolation), <italic>gipdan-gorophim</italic> (collective harassment), or <italic>hakkyo-pokryuk</italic> (school violence). Although these terms have been used interchangeably in earlier Korean studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261927X12446602">Koo (2005)</xref> found that most were not used by middle school pupils (during the period 2002-2003); instead, pupils used another term, <italic>wang-ta</italic>. This is a slang term, apparently popularized among school pupils since the late 1990s, to indicate either a bullied person or the bullying behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261927X12446602">Koo, 2005</xref>). <italic>Wang</italic> is both a noun and a prefix meaning “king” or “big,” and <italic>ta</italic> is a short version of <italic>ttadolim</italic> (isolation) or <italic>ttadolida</italic> (to isolate). Thus, <italic>wang-ta</italic> means severe exclusion. Apart from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261927X12446602">Koo (2005)</xref>, there has been no systematic investigation of the terms used for bullying behaviors from pupils’ points of view, nor on use of the term <italic>wang-ta</italic> beyond school age, or how Korean people perceive and distinguish <italic>wang-ta</italic> from other terms for aggressive behavior. This study aimed to examine the meaning and the usage of the term <italic>wang-ta</italic> (and alternatives to <italic>wang-ta</italic>) across different ages and contexts.</p>
<sec id="section1-0261927X12446602" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>One hundred and thirteen participants were interviewed during 2008, individually or in small focus groups (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X12446602">Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261927X12446602">Lee, Smith, &amp; Monks, 2011</xref>, for fuller methodological details). They were in seven age-groups: preschool children (5-6 years), lower elementary school pupils (7-9 years), upper elementary school pupils (10-12 years), middle school pupils (13-15 years), high school pupils (16-18 years), mothers (30s-40s), and workplace employees (20s-50s). They came from one preschool, three academic institutes (running private after school classes for school pupils), two companies, and mothers who had school-age children from Seoul.</p>
<p>Six cartoons/descriptions of different types of bullying-like behavior were shown to help structure participants’ discussion about bullying-like behavior: physical individual, verbal, social exclusion, rumor spreading, breaking other’s belonging, and physical group aggression (or setting an impossible deadline, for workplace). Participants were asked “What is <italic>wang-ta</italic>?” and “Do you use this term?” (now or in the past). Interviews continued with an open format, to gather information about why <italic>wang-ta</italic> was or was not used, and about other terms that might be mentioned.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0261927X12446602" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The interviews were recorded and transcribed and analyzed by grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X12446602">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>). The main theme emerging, naturally relating to the general question asked, was <italic>definitions</italic>, with two categories within this, meaning of <italic>wang-ta</italic> and usage of <italic>wang-ta.</italic> By grouping together related concepts, one subcategory was identified within meaning and two subcategories were recognized within usage.</p>
<sec id="section3-0261927X12446602">
<title>Meaning of <italic>Wang-Ta</italic></title>
<p>Generally, <italic>wang-ta</italic> was used to indicate social isolation, although sometimes used to refer to rumor spreading or group physical aggression. Across all ages it was described as isolating one person, however, the subcategory <italic>passive or active isolation</italic> refers to how this isolating behavior varies by age.</p>
<p>Responses of children from preschool and lower elementary school pupils who knew the term were similar (in terms of isolating), but not detailed, for example, “A loner,” “Not getting along.” However, upper elementary and middle school pupils, and workplace personnel, explained the term <italic>wang-ta</italic> more fully, with the manner of isolation in <italic>wang-ta</italic> extended in more active and intentional ways, such as ignoring or avoiding the victim. In upper elementary and middle school pupils, it reached the point of describing the victim in terms of “abnormality,” for example, “It means staying alone, abnormal”; they also linked it with physical aggression and rumor spreading, such that the victim suffered by social exclusion but also in other ways from group actions.</p>
<p>Workplace personnel reported <italic>wang-ta</italic> as exclusion of and ignoring one person and did not make a link with physical aggression, but they noted that total exclusion was unlikely to occur, for example, “Complete exclusion cannot happen,” “Each person has a necessary relationship with other people, we are connected by work.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0261927X12446602">
<title>Usage of <italic>Wang-Ta</italic></title>
<p>Most participants did not use the term <italic>wang-ta</italic>, although they understood it. This was related to two subcategories, <italic>generational differences</italic> and <italic>reason for not using</italic>.</p>
<p><italic>Generational differences</italic> refer to differences by age, which appeared explicable in terms of generational differences or historical factors. All pupils from upper elementary, middle, and high school (except one upper elementary pupil) reported that they did not currently use the term <italic>wang-ta</italic>. High school pupils said that they had used <italic>wang-ta</italic> in the past, whereas upper elementary and middle school pupils had not used it in the past either. Young employees in their 20s and 30s reported having used the term <italic>wang-ta</italic> for describing a victim in their school years; some of them reported still using the term. In contrast, people more than 40 years had not used the term <italic>wang-ta</italic> when they were at school, nor currently. Mothers reported that they sometimes used <italic>wang-ta</italic> when talking about their children but also used other terms, <italic>gipdan-ttadolim, gipdan-gorophim</italic>, or <italic>hakkyo-pokryuk</italic>, which were more “official” terms recommended by the Korean Ministry of Education.</p>
<p><italic>Reason for not using</italic> refers to diverse reasons why participants did not use the term <italic>wang-ta</italic>. Absence of <italic>wang-ta</italic> behavior was reported as a reason by some lower elementary and high school pupils, and workplace personnel, for example, “We don’t use <italic>wang-ta</italic> because we don’t have it.” Childishness of the term <italic>wang-ta</italic> was also indicated by high school pupils and workplace personnel, for example, “It is for children.” Some workplace personnel and mothers reported having heard the term from their children and used it to describe their children’s issues, but did not use it themselves in adult discourse.</p>
<p>Use of alternative terms was reported among upper elementary, middle, and high school pupils. They used other terms for describing an excluded person, depending on the level of isolation. For example, “We don’t use <italic>wang-ta</italic>, but use <italic>jjin-ta</italic> a lot”; no Korean dictionary includes <italic>jjin-ta</italic>, but its meaning is a slang term belittling a clumsy or tactless person, the clumsiness being characteristically caused by a disability, for example, stammer, learning disability. Another example is, “<italic>Eun-ta</italic> means eun-gun-hi (implicitly)” (isolated implicitly, so it was vague whether someone was a <italic>wang-ta</italic> or not, because the person had been isolated only a few times and not in an obvious way)”, “<italic>Jun-ta</italic> means junche (whole)-ta, it’s the same as <italic>wang-ta</italic>” (<italic>jun-ta</italic> means a victim isolated not only by pupils in a class, but in the whole school, and thus an extreme isolation).</p>
<p>Interestingly, workplace personnel reported they did not use the term because they did not express their negative attitudes towards a <italic>wang-ta</italic> (victim) in a public way, for example, “We think of someone as <italic>wang-ta</italic> but don’t talk with others about what we have done to them . . . We show with behaviors not with words.” The usage of the term seems to be a taboo among adults in the workplace, perhaps related to a more implicit aspect of bullying in the workplace.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>Wang-ta</italic> was widely recognized across all ages as indicating social exclusion. Especially among upper elementary and middle school pupils, it included aggressive acts by a group of people (social exclusion, but sometimes also physical aggression or rumor spreading). <italic>Wang-ta</italic> means basically an isolated person who does not fit into a group; sometimes the person is characterized as different and even abnormal. The perspective of viewing a victim as abnormal, rather than simply indicating an isolated person, is maximized in the new term, <italic>jjin-ta</italic>.</p>
<p>Historical changes in the use of terms by Koreans are noticeable. Generational differences support this; adults in their mid 40s to 50s said that there were no victims called <italic>wang-ta</italic> in their childhood, that is, about 30 years ago, but adults in their mid 20s and early 30s said that the term <italic>wang-ta</italic> was used in their class. Absence of the term <italic>wang-ta</italic> among older employees in their school years does not mean the absence of a victim, since exclusion is a pervasive aspect of social life.</p>
<p>Also, high school students stated that they had used <italic>wang-ta</italic> at middle school (3-4 years ago); middle school students stated that they had not used it at elementary school (3-4 years ago). If pupils’ recollections are correct, then around 2005-2006, <italic>wang-ta</italic> was used only among middle school pupils but not among elementary pupils. It was used widely by middle and high school pupils in 2002-2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261927X12446602">Koo, 2005</xref>). Thus, the term is “trendy”; terms and the use of terms have been changing, although an emphasis on social exclusion (<italic>-ta</italic>) has remained.</p>
<p>Adolescents do not simply invent new words to say the same thing. Their new words reinterpret the world and resolving the old with the new (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X12446602">Eckert, 2003</xref>). Among Korean pupils aged 10 to 18 years, the term <italic>wang-ta</italic> may have not been effective enough for expressing a socially isolated victim because the term had been already well known across Korean society, and it was regarded as a general term. They might have needed a new term to distinguish bullying phenomena in their culture from that in other age-groups. The term <italic>jjin-ta</italic> represents not only an isolated person but also how the victim is seen by others (i.e., abnormal, disabled). Korean pupils aged 10 to 18 years seem to have chosen this previously existing term and inputted their own meaning onto it to represent their peer culture.</p>
<p>Mothers kept the terms that were used in the 1990s, which were recommended by the Korean Ministry of Education; their lack of change of usage may imply that they were less sensitive to the trend of the phenomenon that currently happens among school pupils.</p>
<p>Workplace personnel did not have any general terms for indicating aggressive behaviors. This does not necessarily mean that bullying-like behaviors are less common among this group, as this may reflect different characteristics between school and the workplace. A somewhat similar situation was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X12446602">Rainivaara (2009)</xref>, in Finland. The author found that in difficult, exploitative, or conflictual workplace relationships, there were relatively few strongly negative behaviors and that people used distancing and avoidance as ways of coping; “Silence appears to be a significant factor in the maintenance of a bullying relationship” (p. 68). This may reflect the more hidden nature of workplace bullying compared with school bullying; the behaviors can be performed in a more sophisticated way, such that it is often unclear how much the perpetrator’s intention was involved.</p>
<p>The emphasis on social exclusion in South Korean terms for bullying may reflect a more collectivistic aspect of bullying in South Korea than in Western societies. In this respect South Korean bullying may be more similar to Japanese <italic>ijime</italic>; in both cases, definitions emphasize group processes of exclusion, and in schools, this is primarily within the social group of the class, and with a higher ratio of perpetrators to victims than is usually found in Western societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X12446602">Kanetsuna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12446602">Koo et al., 2008</xref>). Group norms play a primary role in modifying attitudes toward bullying. In-group bullying norms have been found to increase the acceptability of bullying behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261927X12446602">Ojala &amp; Nesdale, 2004</xref>). In collectivistic cultures, people are interdependent with their in-groups, giving priority to the goals of their in-group, and shaping their behavior primarily on the basis of in-group norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X12446602">Hofstede &amp; Hofstede, 2005</xref>). These differences between Eastern and Western forms of bullying are likely to have implications for the nature of intervention strategies to reduce bullying.</p>
<p>In summary, this study shed new light on the usage of the term <italic>wang-ta</italic>, or South Korean bullying. The broad age-range of interviewees, and questions around usage and non-usage, allowed us to reveal not only age changes but also to suggest patterns of generational change and trends or fashions, especially among adolescent youth. At all ages, however, social isolation was a dominant, though not exclusive, feature of <italic>wang-ta</italic> or of alternative terms such as <italic>jjin-ta</italic> or <italic>eun-ta.</italic> Finally, we speculate that this usage, as with other behavioral aspects of <italic>wang-ta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12446602">Koo e al., 2008</xref>), and as for Japanese <italic>ijime</italic>, in turn reflect a more collectivistic aspect of social relationships in South Korea than in Western cultures.</p>
