<abstract>
<p>This article brings together semiotics and literary theory, and notes the intrinsic and historical connectedness between words and images. It discusses the ‘language’ of Shaun Tan’s graphic novel <italic>The Arrival</italic> and describes the use of traditional language as illustration, and the use of image as language. In doing so, it notes the work of the Russian theorist Bakhtin on the chronotope, and the related idea, developed by the author of this article, of the visual chronotope as a tool of semiotic analysis.</p>

<p>This article emerges out of literary perspectives and reflects the increasing impact – critical and creative – of semiotics in the field not only of children’s literature but of literature in general. Whilst traditionally the term ‘literature’ referred to verbal texts, and ‘literary criticism’ concerned itself with words and the way they are used and arranged as the carriers of communicative intent, both such purviews are now undergoing some interesting changes. These changes are likely to have been generated by two late 20th-century influences – the development of icon-dominated digital media such as the internet, and increasing scholarly and creative respect for children’s literature (particularly picture books). However, this article argues that literature, the will <italic>to story</italic>, has a history of intimately entwined words and images and that these changes may not represent enlargement as much as they represent a return (with enhanced understandings) to roots.</p>
<p>Traditionally, in the West as well as in many parts of the East, images have been used alongside verbal text in books designed to educate young children, offering cues and clues as they learn to read. A picture of an apple teaches the word ‘apple’ (or ‘APPLE’): the image provokes knowledge of the word. It is perhaps an irony that poetry – commonly regarded as the ‘highest’ genre in the literary hierarchy, the most abstract, the most profound, sparing of words, and as Genette said, announcing itself by its spaces – is often judged in terms of its <italic>imagery</italic>, that is, by its capacity to provoke <italic>pictures-in-words</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470357212454091">David Crystal (1994</xref>: 423) defines imagery as ‘language that produces clear or vivid mental pictures’. That is, it is the poet’s intent (and a measure of his or her skill) to use words – language – in such a way as to construct a visual picture that is ‘seen’ in the mind of the reader.</p>
<p>What then does a series of pictures in the context of a sustained and sophisticated literary narrative do? By its very ‘pictureliness’ it is already there for the eye to see. I am suggesting that this is a different sort of imagery – a reversed imagery, if you like; that, to adapt Crystal’s definition, such pictures, ordered in a sustained literary narrative, constitute ‘a language that produces clear or vivid’ mental pictures that carry <italic>words</italic>, that indeed unleash ideas that are articulated in the mind in words. In this context of thought, this article explores Shaun Tan’s graphic novel <italic>The Arrival</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470357212454091">2006</xref>), with particular reference to evolving (and sometimes contentious) ideas about literature, language and text, and begins an argument that its images and imageries are constituted not as <italic>pictures-in-words</italic> but rather as <italic>words-in-pictures.</italic></p>
<p>Literature, in a post postmodern world, has come to refer to sustained texts involving language – including not only non-fiction such as popular science, but also including <italic>as language</italic> the images of graphic novels, such as <italic>The Arrival</italic>. Graphic narratives are not new; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470357212454091">David A Beronä (2008)</xref> traces their roots through wordless books and woodcut novels from 1918–1951, noting in particular the works of such artists as Frans Masereel (1889–1972), Lynd Ward (1905–1995), Helena Bochoráková-Dittrichová (1894–1980), and Laurence Hyde (1914–1997). Graphic narratives also bear a family relationship, in varying degrees, to comic books, and comic and cartoon traditions and conventions. Indeed, most other well-known graphic works, such as Art Spiegelman’s <italic>Maus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470357212454091">1991[1986]</xref>) which won a Pulitzer Prize Special Award in 1992, or <italic>Ethel and Ernest</italic>, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470357212454091">Raymond Briggs (1998</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470357212454091">Figure 1</xref>), incorporate words as part of a sophisticated but recognisable comic book style; such words commonly express first person dialogue, or indications of time and place.</p>
<p>What is new I think (and notwithstanding <italic>Maus</italic>’s Pulitzer Special Award) is the acceptance of graphic novels as <italic>literature</italic> – and as prize-winning literature, competing in an open field alongside respected writers of more conventional works. This reflects a significant and deeper shift in ideas about language in general, and about ‘reading’ in particular. Images in narrative are no longer ‘viewed’; they are ‘read’, with all the implications that that term carries in the meaning-making process. Unravelling this shift through a discussion of a graphic novel such as <italic>The Arrival</italic> reveals some surprises.</p>

<p>In books such as <italic>Maus</italic> and <italic>Ethel and Ernest</italic>, words remain an essential part of the carriage of narrative. <italic>The Arrival</italic>, on the other hand, does not use words at all; the depiction of language is there but as incomprehensible signs that are not actually part of the carriage of story but rather part of the story being told (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470357212454091">Figure 2</xref>). Language – that is, the traditional script of written language – functions not as language <italic>per se</italic>, but as part of the illustrations.</p>

<p>In the late 20th century, traditional ideas of language, as written and spoken communication based around letters and alphabets, changed to include the multimodal ‘languages’ of images and signs. Thus reading has come to refer to the reading of images and signs (as indicated by the inclusion of ‘Visual Literacy’ in school curricula). <italic>The Arrival</italic> was not Picture Book of the Year but Book of the Year in the 2007 NSW Premier’s Literary Awards, winning against such heavyweights as Robert Hughes and Peter Carey. Tan ‘wrote’ this book; he is quoted as saying <italic>(Sydney Morning Herald</italic>, 2–3 June 2007: 11): ‘It’s not for anybody; it’s for everybody. I don’t write for any single audience.’ This award was treated with concern and some perplexity – not the least of which was that of the author when, following the usual custom, he was asked to read a selection from his book to the gala literary audience. (He spoke about the challenges of storytelling through image, the importance of the book to him as a record of the experiences of so many, and his inspiration in part from seeing New York and Ellis Island.)</p>
<p>Of course, this idea of image as written language is almost a reversion to roots. The letters of alphabets are descended from a long heritage of written signs being used to convey meaning – letters themselves are signs that convey meaning. From the beginning, images have carried not only representation but story. The centuries old rock art in places such as remote Australia are read into story by knowing eyes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470357212454091">Figure 3</xref>), and told into story both in words and in other media (such as dance) by elders and community. Image evokes response that is complex, culturally coded, and aesthetic but that in thought and response seeks at some point, at least to some degree, to break out into sound, into words.</p>

<p>The relationships between words and images are profound. The familiar concept of <italic>imagery as pictures-in-words</italic> is a reminder of the innate <italic>visuality</italic> of literature, of its aims and intentions to create images in the mind’s eye of that being described. The idea of <italic>words-in-pictures</italic> is a timely reminder of the origins of written language: of the first signs ‘written’ on Mesopotamian clay tablets; of the simplified drawings of pictograms that were stylised representations of objects; of more abstract ideograms that over time gathered broader meanings that could be ‘read’ through context. When the idea of the representation of <italic>objects</italic> shifted to the idea of using script to represent <italic>sound</italic>, in Egypt and Sumeria through the use of a childish game (the <italic>rebus</italic>), words and syllables were indicated by pictures of objects or by symbols whose names resembled in sound the sound of the intended words or syllables (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470357212454091">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1470357212454091">5</xref>).</p>

<p>In contrast to the 600 plus signs of ancient cuneiform, the hundreds of hieroglyphics, and the thousand or so Chinese characters, the advent of the alphabet brought an economy of sign, from the vowel-less Phoenician alphabet to the Aramaic and Hebrew alphabet of the Old Testament, to the 24 letters of the 5th-century Greek alphabet and thus to the Roman/Latin alphabet which is now the most widely used alphabetic writing system in the world.</p>
<p><bold>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</bold></p>
<p>Alphabet letters are the building blocks of <italic>words</italic>, which it is significant to remember are also <italic>visual signs carrying meaning.</italic> Unless there is a physical disability, it is the initial visual stimulus of letters running together to form words and sentences which stimulates the mysterious alchemy of cognitive and metacognitive processes, culturally and socially – and personally – coded, that constitute meaning-making. Those marks on the page miraculously release images and imageries that pertain to all the senses: sight, sound, touch, smell, as well as to movement, feeling, place, memory, and emotion. There is controversy about how this happens and the neural processes involved; American psychologist Julian Jaynes (1976, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470357212454091">Manguel, 2007</xref>: 8) postulates that when writing was first invented, ‘reading’ may have been aural perception, that is, in his words, ‘hallucinating the speech from looking at its picture symbols’. Susan Greenfield, a neuroscientist, writes that for all the senses ‘there is also the enigma of the first person subjective element’ which turns perceptions into ‘unified wholes, shot through with memories, hopes, prejudices, and other internalised cognitive idiosyncrasies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470357212454091">Greenfield, 1997</xref>: 53). But there is no doubt that the initial provocation in reading written language is the sight (or in the case of Braille, the feel) of the actual letters and words.</p>
<p><bold>FEAR SUNSET CHOCOLATE</bold></p>
<p>However, as noted earlier, <italic>The Arrival</italic> by Shaun Tan is a novel that contains no words. There is some ‘writing’ but it is writing in no known language – and it is the very strangeness of this language that is the point. Language can be exclusive as well as inclusive. Nonetheless, this book is replete with words-in-pictures that construct a powerful story in much the same way as words do. Multiple small images, many in strips almost like the Portuguese ‘stories in little squares’ (<italic>história em quadradinhos</italic>) act as letters and words that come together to build image-equivalents of sentences, and paragraphs and chapters – or coherent, connected meaning making. It is a powerful example of storytelling which through withholding words sets up a democratic readership that transcends any particular language group, although it does follow Western conventions of reading from front to back, and from left to right. (It could conceivably be read from the back as a retrospective.) That its images are placed in a book, as narrative, hails a <italic>reader</italic> who will read, and is a marker of story and story conventions.</p>
<p>The book begins with drawings of a selection of images that appear unrelated: a paper bird, a clock, a hat and towel hung on a hook, a cooking pot and spoon, a child’s drawing, a cracked teapot, a chipped cup and saucer alongside some travel documents, a half-packed suitcase, and a family portrait (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1470357212454091">Figure 6</xref>). These images operate as letters and/or words do in verbal text and constitute the first ‘sentences’ of narrative – setting the scene for the first ‘chapter’ of introduction. After two pages of the small images (word surrogates, pictograms), they build into a full-page image which situates the unfolding story, introduces the characters, and creates a sense of impending movement and change (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1470357212454091">Figure 7</xref>). For these early images are loaded not only with description and setting the scene; they are also loaded with connotations and associations which inaugurate the rich imageries and motifs that are to thread their way all through the book, unleashing in a stream of visual consciousness ideas of hearth and home, warmth of fire and comfort of food, companionship of table, love of family. All these work together to construct what we could call a semiotics of belonging, which becomes a <italic>leit-motif</italic> and provides both absence and presence, both narrative tension and cohesion. The cracked teapot, the two cups with tea yet to be drunk, are part of both belonging and incipient loss. Indeed the book is structured around ideas of belonging and not belonging, and, in common with a familiar children’s book narrative pattern, the idea of home and away and home again (as in Beatrix Potter’s <italic>Peter Rabbit</italic>, 1902, Maurice Sendak’s <italic>Where the Wild Things Are</italic>, 1992; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357212454091">Johnston, 2010[2001]</xref>, for a further discussion of this) and countless others – all of course based around the pervasive narrative theme of the odyssey or quest. In <italic>The Arrival</italic> the ‘home again’ does not relate to the same home in the same country; rather, it is a transplanting of home – and its familiar bits and pieces, its signs and symbols, into the new, as part of establishing belonging. It is a story about a new way of coming home.</p>

<p>At this point, I want to insert a brief note concerning children’s picture books, about which there is an extensive critical literature on word–image relations (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470357212454091">Hunt, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470357212454091">Johnston 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357212454091">2010[2001]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470357212454091">Moebius, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470357212454091">Nikolajeva and Scott 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470357212454091">Nodelman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470357212454091">Stephens, 1992</xref>). However, as the above implies, this literature in the main focuses on the relationship between the words of the text and the pictures of the text, and how each contribute to the telling of story, often in various sophisticated interplays – as interrogation, subversion, consolidation, supplement, amplification and so on. A well-known often quoted example is <italic>Rosie’s Walk</italic>, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470357212454091">Pat Hutchins (1968</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1470357212454091">Figure 8</xref>); the verbal text of this little story consists of one sentence describing a hen taking a walk; the visual text shows what happens to the fox (completely unmentioned in the verbal narrative) which is pursuing her. The actual story of the walk emerges out of what the words and pictures do together. Another wonderful example is the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470357212454091">John Burningham classic, <italic>Come Away from the Water, Shirley</italic> (1977</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1470357212454091">Figure 9</xref>); the verbal text consists solely of parental (presumably) instructions to a little girl on an outing to the beach, whilst the visual text depicts the primary visual world of the beach transcended by the secondary world of the imaginative adventure taking place in the child’s mind.</p>

<p>Many well-known children’s book author/illustrators have created wordless picture books – Anno, Ezra Jack Keats, Raymond Briggs (<italic>The Snowman</italic> was turned into a video by Sony and became an Academy Award nominee), Tomie de Paola, Gregory Rogers, Quentin Blake, Eric Carle, David Weisner, Istvan Banyai, and Chris Van Allsburg, just to name a few. Perhaps the best known Australian wordless picture books are those by collage artist Jeannie Baker. <italic>Window</italic> (1992) and <italic>Belonging</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470357212454091">2004</xref>) have become environmental classics but it is interesting to note that, in these books, story emerges from the construction of chronological sequence – out of pictures which also contain easily discerned language clues, such as birthday cards and invitations.</p>
<p>I am arguing something rather different here: not that story emerges from verbal/visual interplay, nor from word clues planted in the text. There is no verbal text written in the images of <italic>The Arrival</italic>, there are no comprehensible words; its story grows out of images and imageries, standing alone, and that function as powerful ‘words-in-pictures’.</p>
<p>Nor are the pictures static. The early fragments may be (and are probably intended to be) but, as the pages turn, the little squares accumulate and accelerate to provoke a strong sense of the moving image, as in filmic sequence. There is a meticulous construction of a series of visual frames that portray sequential actions with only small time differences, in close-up. In the early part of the book, for example, a set of images of hands not only expresses movement but also helps to give a paradoxical emphasis on both human ‘doingness’ and human helplessness that is continued throughout the book: hands pack and wrap, touch, fashion paper cranes, clasp, clutch, hold photographs, and eventually have to let go. This technique is used to great effect throughout.</p>
<p>It has a dual effect – that of juxtaposing the intensely personal against a sense of the inexorable, and that of the forward thrust of film narrative. Thus the first full page picture (see above, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1470357212454091">Figure 7</xref>) functions as a <italic>mise-en-scene</italic>, bringing the elements of composition together to set up space and story, establishing the everyday domesticity of the relationship between the man and the woman, constructing a <italic>before</italic> that sets up and cues an expectation of an <italic>after</italic> that will somehow relate (and does, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1470357212454091">Figure 13</xref>), and establishing the mood of the narrative that is to follow.</p>
<p>The subdued sepia colours of the graphic surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470357212454091">White, 2005</xref>) of the book help to convey a sense of an earlier time, a history, of subtle difference. The book itself may be likened to an old photograph album; a particular family photograph, relating to the first full scene, and encoded as a sort of memory and emotional <italic>mise-en-abyme</italic>, becomes a sign of both togetherness and loneliness at one point in the novel, when the protagonist arrives in the strange new country and symbolically finds his family in his suitcase. It is however more interesting to note that the tones and grain of the graphic surface (Tan used pencil on paper) also recall old movies, and that the images again can be likened to a sequence of moving pictures (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1470357212454091">Figure 10</xref>), such is the impression of forward momentum and in many cases the close temporal relationship of one image to the next.</p>

<p>So the microcosm of the familiar and the family is increasingly filled with signs of departure. In the next full page, the images are brought together as the small world of kitchen is left and the family venture into a threatening macrocosm, where what appears to be a dragon-like monster is on dangerous prowl. In the double page spread that immediately follows, the shadow of the dragon’s tail becomes multiple tails, twitching all over a blank city where the only other sign of life is the movement of the little family (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1470357212454091">Figure 11</xref>). Personal lives are obviously being irrevocably disrupted by external events.</p>
<p>Kress and Van Leeuwen, in their <italic>Reading Images: The Grammar of Visual Design</italic> (1996), note that a sense of movement across the page from left to right tends, at least to Western readers, to emphasise process, and that such process – ‘vectors’, ‘tension’, ‘dynamic forces’ – relates in general terms to the doing, being or having of verbs. There is I think what we could call a <italic>vectorial fragility</italic>, a cross-the-page visual implication of vulnerability, of tension, in the depiction of the family walking to the station.</p>

<p>The ‘little squares’ depicting parting and departure – the train, the play and gift of the paper bird, the tears, the hugs, again the hands (some from the focalisation of the child), and finally, the train steaming into a distant dot (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1470357212454091">Figure 10</xref>) – interject human emotion and response. The last page of this chapter (or fascicle) shows the dejected figures of the woman and child returning through the empty streets, menaced by tails that just might be, in this illustration, smoke. This provokes questions relating to modality (‘realness’ or not of that which is depicted) and the phenomenology of perception.</p>
<p>The next section begins with the photograph being unwrapped on board the ship – the protagonist gropes for the loved and familiar in a tumble of memories and sense of distance <italic>en abyme</italic>. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470357212454091">Istvan Banyai’s <italic>Zoom</italic> (1995)</xref>, the images move out from the intimate into two long shots of the boat crossing the ocean seemingly endlessly, interspersed by a double-page spread of miniature and similar sky-scapes. Here is a visual iteration and reiteration of time and space as at once external and internal, subjective and objective, and of both the overwhelming ‘bigness’ of the individual human condition and the overwhelming ‘smallness’ of the individual human condition. For in the huddles of humanity on board the boat, hunched together against the cold and perhaps fear of the unknown, desperately using words to record experience and connect with loved ones fading further and further away, there is a thematic implication of the whole human predicament: the frailty of life yet each individual’s personal dramatic and all-consuming engagement with it.</p>
<p>The paper bird – fashioned like an origami crane – elaborates a textual and intertextual metaphor of hope and foreshadows the immigrants’ first sight of the strange birds of the new place. Birds as a sign of landfall and hope reach back to the Old Testament story of Noah’s Ark. Derrida has described metaphor as a form of economy, and this simple visual depiction of odd birds, like and yet not like, is a literally figurative expression of the interrogation of the known as it is reshaped by the unknown – likeness undone and redone by not-likeness.</p>
<p>So the protagonist arrives in a new world that is marked by alienating difference and unintelligible strangeness, and endures the de-humanising experiences of physical examination, being a number, queuing for acceptance, being questioned but unable to communicate. In the series of moving images that again emphasise hands – hands checking and making files and issuing a passport or entry visa – there is a stark reminder of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470357212454091">Claudine Herrmann’s (1981</xref>: 168) statement that ‘the disposition of space for man is above all an image of power, the maximum power being when one can dispose of the space of others.’</p>
<p>As hands take the time to smoke a cigarette and consider the disposition of this one man’s space, they are ironically detached and remote; there is a semiotic implication of an averted and disinterested gaze as officials eventually allow the stamp of identity on the new arrival’s tiny world, and the world that he carries in his suitcase. But even after all this, and despite the overwhelming strangeness, the man, tentatively but bravely, begins to populate his new world (inner? outer?) with a balloon of hope – one of many other tiny and delicate bubbles of hope hovering over the enormously strange city to which he has gained entry but which is so far marked for him (and the others) by deracination, dislocation and non-belongingness.</p>
<p>In 2000, working with Bakhtinian theory, I developed the idea of the visual chronotope as a semiotic tool of analysis of picture book art and illustration (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470357212454091">Johnston, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470357212454091">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470357212454091">2010[2001]</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357212454091">Bakhtin (1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357212454091">1986</xref>) adapted into his discussion of the novel the mathematical term ‘chronotope’ (<italic>xronotop</italic>) to describe the relationships in narrative between people and events, and time and space. This was inspired by Einstein’s theory of relativity which re-described time not as the objective absolute of Newtonian physics, but rather as relative to the position of the observer, and thus expanded the traditional notion of ‘setting’ to include, intrinsically, time.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In the literary artistic chronotope, spatial and temporal indicators are fused into one carefully thought-out, concrete whole. Time, as it were, thickens, takes on flesh, becomes artistically visible; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to the movements of time, plot, and history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357212454091">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>: 84).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The visual chronotope refers to the representation in pictures of the relationship in picture books between people and events on the one hand, and time and space on the other. As noted in the earlier references to children’s literature, conventional picture books have both verbal and visual text. Each of these constructs a chronotope which sometimes match and sometimes do not. In a picture book, the verbal chronotope is likely (but not always) to relate to the actual time and place of story, whilst the visual chronotope may lift thematic implications beyond the specific into that more general time–space akin to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470357212454091">Bakhtin (1986</xref>: 1–9) called <italic>great time</italic>, ‘the perspectives of centuries’.</p>
<p>I have earlier described certain picture books in terms of two types of chronotope identified by Bakhtin, the <italic>intervalic chronotope</italic>, where as part of the narrative two different constellations of time and space play out against each other, and where their interaction means that ‘both take on metaphoric significance‘ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357212454091">Bakhtin, 1981</xref>: 165), and the <italic>adventure novel of everyday life</italic>, where ideas of ‘metamorphosis’ or ‘transformation’ are linked with ‘identity’ as part of an ‘idea of development’ which ‘unfolds not so much in a straight line as spasmodically, a line with “knots” in it’ (p. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357212454091">1981</xref>: 113; also see Johnston 2010[2006]). The conjunctions of time and space in <italic>The Arrival</italic> bear some relationship to these, but may productively be better considered in terms of a rather different chronotope, the <italic>chronotope of threshold</italic>, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357212454091">Bakhtin (1981)</xref> describes only sketchily, and relates to the work of Dostoevsky, more in terms of the idea of the conventional threshold, such as front doors and halls. But the idea of the chronotope of threshold is ‘highly charged with emotion and value’ and it has as its most fundamental characteristic ‘crisis and break in life’ (p. 248).</p>
<p>Threshold implies a crossing over – a stepping out, a before and after, acting on decision. <italic>The Arrival</italic> has only one text, a visual one, but the idea of the chronotope of threshold helps identify where and how its characters and events intersect with layers of time and space both to describe the experiences of this one man and at the same time to escalate thematic concerns beyond the telling of this one story. We are drawn into the narrative (literally) after the decision has been made; the protagonist is packing to leave his home and wife and daughter to emigrate to another, unnamed country, there to find work and then later send for his family to join him. It is a decision that will change his (and their) life. At this moment, time and space are simultaneous; it is a crisis in biographical time, from which there will be no turning back. The images of the train becoming smaller and smaller as it steams into the distance (and thus focalised by the wife and child who watch, but arguably also internally focalised and imagined by the departing father), and of the boat crossing the seas (which obviously cannot be seen by those aboard but which is cleverly represented here as part of how they see themselves in relation to both time and space), stress the momentousness of this break. These images – like the images of the skyscapes – however mark a different sense of time: the visual chronotope indicates that the threshold has been crossed, and on the boat, in the same space, both inner and outer time is stretched out, seemingly endless.</p>
<p>In this way, Tan’s pictures, in their varying sizes and shapes and their subject matter, reach beyond themselves to represent both exterior and interior worlds, inner-ness and outer-ness. In his comments on discourse, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357212454091">Bakhtin (1981</xref>: 292) writes that there is a ‘living impulse’ [<italic>napravlennost</italic>] that ‘reaches out beyond’ the ‘naked corpse’ of the word; ‘to study the word as such, ignoring the impulse that reaches out beyond it’ is, he says, ‘senseless’. If we transpose these comments from words as meaning-making to images as meaning-making, we can identify <italic>napravlennost</italic> in <italic>The Arrival</italic> as being visual and verbal, aural and sensual, desperate and emotional, <italic>seen</italic> in the phenomenological representation of the unfamiliar, <italic>read</italic> in the multiple stories of escape and migration implied in the narrative, <italic>heard</italic> in the sound of marching boots, <italic>felt</italic> in the fear of flight and escape. Further, in bringing ‘readers’ deeper and deeper into the subjective experience of one man’s arrival, travelling with him from departure to landfall and from parting to reunion (and privileging readers with his perceptions), plot, event, character, time and place are extended beyond him, layered with glimpses of other stories of other departures and arrivals in other times and other places, imbricated wordlessly but <italic>wordfully</italic>.</p>
<p>For the images of <italic>The Arrival</italic> provoke a language that is both <italic>of</italic> words and <italic>beyond</italic> words. This is very much so in the story of the man in the new country who befriends the protagonist. His story is by implication told in a language many of us would not understand, but we know the story. Fear and lack of agency is made visible in harsh horizontal and vertical angles, and is chronotopically extended by the depiction of being both physically and metaphorically underground. The visual chronotope is brushed and glossed by historical realities with which we are all too familiar. By dipping in and out of known historical past and present, this tale within the tale expands allegorical figurative meanings into an awful indictment of lived and living history.</p>
<p>Just as Eco writes that smoke is a semiotic of fire only when you cannot actually see the fire, I wonder whether images may be the strongest semiotics of words when you can’t actually see the words. The readership is certainly unbound by any specific language knowledge. Each step on this man’s story is a picture in itself – from leaving loved ones to his desperate efforts to communicate and find work; from being confronted with alien animals and food to eventually finding work in an overwhelmingly inhuman factory assembly line. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470357212454091">Kress and Van Leeuwen’s (1996</xref>: 119–158) grammar uses the notion of ‘volumes’ and ‘masses’, each with their own ‘weight’ and ‘gravitational pull’, to relate to participants; in the images of the factory in which the arrival finds work the most powerful participants are the huge machines and the faceless systems which created them.</p>
<p><italic>The Arrival</italic> is a powerful interrogation of the idea and imageries of ‘home’ – as here and/or there, past and/or present, physical and/or spiritual, owned and/or not owned. If home is belonging, belonging only comes when the protagonist is reunited with family, and for the first time a sense of what we could refer to as <italic>homing present</italic> emerges amid the distortions of difference. But the sense of ‘homing in’, with all the idiom means, has been present, if not since departure, certainly since arrival. There is also a sense of generative responsible carryover, as in the last two pages the man’s little daughter, now quite ‘at home’ – and at play – in the new place, assumes centre stage as helper to another new arrival.</p>
<p>The tools of analysis we have available – semiotics, multimodal grammars that provide ways of reading the directional movements of tropes and vectors, the visual chronotope – offer means of interpretation that save the conclusion from the triteness of a happy ending: Tan could have finished the book with the family reunion meal, the new coming home. Instead he chooses to show that this story is only one of many; there are many other arrivals and there will continue to be, and each has a role to play for those who come after.</p>
<p>This is an important book, charging its readers with a significant political message. From the beginning the endpapers have marked not the representation of a single reality, or of a universal humanity and unity <italic>per se</italic>. Being human is most of all an intensely personal condition of <italic>multiple singularities</italic> – of individualities. This book is about difference, and its implicative surface appearance which may be ambivalent and ambiguous, may be positive or negative. We are reminded of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470357212454091">Amartya Sen’s (2006)</xref> comments about the alienation of identity – that identity must be seen beyond a single descriptor, such as race or gender or appearance or occupation or history. Tan’s egalitarian script summons a moral imagination and encourages subjunctive empathies in relation to heterogeneity – empathies that are sorely needed in the 21st-century world.</p>
<p>There are two other brief points to make. First, it must be noted that this wordless book is actually about the power of language – the significance of oral language, of nominative and interrogative vocabularies – in helping not only to communicate but to constitute how we relate to the world around us. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470357212454091">Edward O Wilson (2002</xref>: xvii), in his letter to Henry Thoreau in the prologue of <italic>The Future of Life</italic>, writes: ‘The beginning of every science is the description and naming of phenomena. Human beings seem to have an instinct to master their surroundings that way. We cannot think clearly about a plant or an animal until we have a name for it.’</p>
<p>In <italic>The Arrival</italic> drawings are used to communicate and teach words – just as they are, for example, in children’s alphabet books. Written language returns to its roots. Words in pictures breed words, and pictures in words. Written or drawn, reading signs is a part of our long shared human history. In a global world, with global technologies, images can and often do represent a universal communication. Given the convention of reading from front to back, and left to right, <italic>The Arrival</italic> can be read by anyone in any language, and when its images break out into thoughts and ideas in the minds of readers, no translation will be necessary.</p>
<p>Second, <italic>The Arrival</italic> is not an ‘easy’ read; I am sure it was not an easy ‘write’. It is dense and detailed, and imagination has to be invoked in making links and connections, and attributing significance. Attention has to be given. But the significance of books such as this is in what they reveal about the absolute and unbounded creative capacity of humans to find new (old?) ways of telling story, new ways of creating literariness. The images of the 21st-century graphic novel are stained with a rich literary past and inflected with centuries of storytelling.</p>
<p><italic>The Arrival</italic> is influenced by the experiences of Tan’s family and, as even more strongly testified in <italic>MAUS</italic> and <italic>Ethel and Ernest</italic>, it asserts the graphic novel as a strong vehicle for the carriage of personal story, or of personal response to the stories of close others. Indeed, lived life may well be remembered more in images than in words – in synaptic releases neuron to neuron, like high resolution snapshots that are faster than any words could ever catch, but that words seek to express perhaps after the event. As in other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470357212454091">Tan books, such as <italic>The Red Tree</italic> (2001)</xref>, imageries of growth are powerful metaphors of hope (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1470357212454091">Figure 12</xref>); the more the immigrant ventures forth, the more signs of growth and hope there are.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470357212454091">Bakhtin (1981</xref>: 250) wrote that the chronotope ‘provides the ground essential for the showing-forth, for the representability of events’. The image of the reunited family, as well as representing a traditional narrative unity, refers back to that early image – the <italic>mise-en-scène</italic> – which began the story, which provided the ground for the showing-forth of events. That was a kitchen in what is now another place, another subjective space, no longer personally inhabited except in memory. There is a subtle visual chronotope here of the now – a sense of present, of having arrived – that carries over the accoutrements (signs) of the past. The threshold has been crossed. This image – implied in the first scene, now realised – is not the conclusion of the book; as noted above; Tan makes it clear that arriving does not finish. People and events, and time and new place, have for this moment come together in perfect synch, after having suffered separation and disjunction. And this image of the now is overlaid with a strong sense of Bakhtin’s <italic>great time</italic>: a sense that extends the time beyond the now into a universal. People and events, time and place slip beyond themselves and the specifics of their own story, past themselves and the specifics of their own place, and through themselves and the specifics of their own emotional experience, into a sense of a universal mythic of new life and new beginning – of new ways of coming home. In the image of the daughter helping another little girl find her way, there is a busting out of neat conclusion into the dynamics and uncertainties of an unending future. However, in the image of a family gathering around food, breaking bread (or something like it) together (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1470357212454091">Figure 13</xref>), there is, as words-in-pictures as surely as pictures-in-words, a gentle collusion of personal, collective and symbolic spaces. Home becomes – beyond time and place – simply the company of loved ones.</p>
