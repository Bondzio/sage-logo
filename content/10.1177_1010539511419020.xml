<abstract>
<p>Antenatal clinical breast examinations (ANCBEs) performed by physicians or nurses during prenatal care visits are recommended by the Department of Health in Taiwan. This study aimed to assess the level of acceptance of ANCBE in Taiwan and the determinants associated with behavior toward them. This was a clinic-based study conducted from 30 November 2008 to 30 April 2009 by using a structured questionnaire for 492 pregnant women. Only 2.8% of the patients received ANCBE, and 95.9% were not aware of the availability of ANCBE. History of breast surgery and awareness of ANCBE availability were significantly associated with receiving ANCBE (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Furthermore, multiparity was statistically different for the awareness of ANCBE availability (<italic>P</italic> = .04). Acceptance of ANCBE was determined by personal history of breast surgery and awareness of ANCBE availability.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The incidence of breast cancer has increased 4-fold in the past 2 decades and has been the most common female cancer in Taiwan since 2003.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539511419020">1</xref></sup> A previous study showed that there is a remarkable difference in the trend of female breast cancer incidence between Taiwanese and Caucasian Americans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539511419020">2</xref></sup> The peak incidence for Taiwanese was between 45 and 59 years, and the median age at diagnosis is 45 to 49 years; the incidence rate for Caucasian Americans is increasing with age and the plateau at around 75 to 84 years. A recent study revealed the peak age for breast cancer in the Asia countries and the Western countries at 40 to 50 years and 60 to 70 years, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539511419020">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, the incidence and mortality of breast cancer in Asia are rising. In the West, the incidence of breast cancer is increasing but mortality is decreasing. Early detection leads to favorable outcomes for breast cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539511419020">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The wider context of breast cancer screening in Taiwan can be found on the Web site of the Bureau of Health Promotion, Department of Health, Executive Yuan, Taiwan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bhp.doh.gov.tw">http://www.bhp.doh.gov.tw</ext-link>), including biennial mammography examinations for all women aged 45 to 70 years and for those women aged 40 to 45 years with a family history of breast cancer since 2010. Accessibility to medical facilities is a pivotal determinant of breast health in Taiwan. Antenatal clinical breast examinations (ANCBEs) performed by physicians or nurses during antenatal care visits are recommended by the Department of Health in Taiwan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539511419020">5</xref></sup> ANCBE are free in Taiwan since they are a crucial part of antenatal education.</p>
<p>Our study aimed to assess the level of acceptance of ANCBE in Taiwan and the determinants associated with behavior toward clinical breast examinations.</p>

<sec id="section2-1010539511419020" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>This was a clinic-based study conducted from 30 November 2008 to 30 April 2009 at Taiji Maternal–Fetal Clinic (TMC) in Taipei, Taiwan. TMC is a referral center providing a thorough fetal health survey, including genetic counseling and fetal ultrasound examinations. The participating pregnant women in this study had received primary antenatal care at local clinic or district hospital and were then referred to TMC. All respondents had the opportunity to find out about and/or receive ANCBE during their hospital visit.</p>
<p>This study was conducted using a structured written questionnaire. The questionnaire was introduced and completed at prenatal health interviews. Demographic data, including age, marital status, education, job status, number of children, categorized yearly income, and status of commercial health insurance coverage were recorded. Data on history of breast surgery, family history of breast cancer, ANCBE availability awareness, and ANCBE given by a physician or nurse were also recorded. The associations of ANCBE availability awareness and behavior toward clinical breast examinations and history of breast surgery or family history of breast cancer were then determined. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Changhua Christian Hospital.</p>
<p>Logistic regression analysis of receiving clinical breast examinations and awareness of ANCBE availability was performed. Participants were categorized by age (&lt;30 years vs ≥30 years), parity (parity 0 vs ≥1), education (high school or less vs more than high school), and yearly income (&lt;1 000 000 vs ≥1 000 000 TWD [1 USD = 28-33 TWD]).</p>
</sec>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 493 pregnant women referred from primary obstetric care units to TMC for advanced fetal examinations completed the structured questionnaires. One woman who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and received total mastectomy 6 years previously was excluded. The characteristics of the remaining 492 women are show in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539511419020">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The present study showed that acceptance of ANCBE was determined on history of breast surgery and awareness of ANCBE availability.</p>
<p>The probability of developing pregnancy associated breast cancer increases as women delay childbearing into their third and fourth decades of life. Pregnant women may delay seeking evaluation of breast masses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539511419020">6</xref></sup> Consequently, it is important to be aware of having thorough breast examinations during antenatal care visits. Women should start to be concerned about breast health at an earlier age, particularly in Taiwan. ANCBE during the first trimester of antenatal care visits are recommended by the Department of Health in Taiwan; however ANCBE programs are rarely supervised in Taiwan. In our opinion, ANCBEs play a crucial role in antenatal education for women.</p>
<p>Breast imaging screening is uncommonly used because of the increasing density of the breasts in pregnancy, and because it is perceived to be a potential risk to the fetus thereby increasing the anxiety of the patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539511419020">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, there is a high rate of false-negative findings in mammography examinations during pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539511419020">8</xref></sup> The diagnosis of breast masses during pregnancy remains clinically challenging. Performing clinical breast examinations during the initial visits for prenatal care, and clinical breast examinations based on symptomatology and aggressive differential diagnoses for suspicious breast masses are recommended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539511419020">9</xref></sup> A delay in diagnosis of breast cancer of several months in pregnant women has been reported by several studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539511419020">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539511419020"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539511419020"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539511419020"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539511419020">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Inquiring about breast changes and not delaying evaluation of breast masses during pregnancy were recommended for clinical practice in a recent review study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539511419020">9</xref></sup> With an improved acceptance of ANCBE, health care providers can facilitate early diagnosis, contributing to efficient breast health care.</p>
<p>ANCBE provides a scheme of early detection of breast cancer by health care providers in low resource settings. However, a recent study showed that only 1% and 2% of women received clinical breast examinations by physicians and nurses, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539511419020">15</xref></sup> In our study, 2.8% received breast examinations by a physician or nurse during the current pregnancy. Antenatal care providers seldom perform ANCBE. Furthermore, a history of breast surgery and awareness of ANCBE availability were significantly associated with receiving ANCBE. Obviously, previously having undergone breast surgery increased concerns of breast health for the pregnant women. The women who were aware of ANCBE availability were also willing to receive ANCBE.</p>
<p>In our study, the percentage of the awareness of ANCBE availability was as low as 4.1% of the participants. Furthermore, increasing the level of awareness of ANCBE availability played an important role for processing ANCBE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1010539511419020">Table 2</xref>). The associations of the awareness of ANCBE availability and education level, income, status of commercial health insurance coverage, job status, or history of breast surgery were not statistically significant, except for women with multiparity (who had a higher awareness). In the logistic regression model, age and yearly income showed odds ratios of 1.67 and 2.28, respectively. Older pregnant women may have a higher parity than younger pregnant women. Women with higher parity have more accessibility to and are more familiar with the procedures and facilities that health institutes offer. Consistent with the higher income, they are apt to take health promotional information and receive free general health examinations.</p>
<p>Women’s knowledge of antenatal care was reported by studies, and these studies showed that maternal health could be improved by enhancing women’s knowledge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539511419020">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539511419020">17</xref></sup> Furthermore, a previous study demonstrated that attendance in an antenatal care clinic is one of factors having significantly effect on the duration of breast feeding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539511419020">18</xref></sup> The authors claimed that maternal and child health services by health care providers or the Primary Health Care Centers of the Ministry of Health should be reinforced.</p>
<p>A higher education level did not improve the patients’ awareness of ANCBE. Antenatal education should be independent of school education, as it is not only responsible for fetal health but also women’s health. A recent study demonstrated that the obstetrician’s role in pregnancy associated breast cancer by performing routine ANCBE might lead to prompt and timely examinations of otherwise asymptomatic breast masses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539511419020">19</xref></sup> The strategy for antenatal care by the Department of Health in Taiwan includes 10 free antenatal care visits, thorough physical examinations, including clinical breast examinations, routine urine checks, and checks for sexually transmitted diseases. These checks are recommended for the first antenatal care visit to ensure maternal fetal health. ANCBE provide an opportunity for health care providers to educate women about normal breast composition, variability, and breast cancer, to encourage regular clinical breast examinations and provide advice on receiving medical evaluation if any masses or abnormalities are detected. Furthermore, the practice of ANCBE will increase the awareness of the importance of breast examinations in pregnancy.</p>
<p>The major limitation of this study was that the survey was conducted at an arbitrarily selected setting in an urban area so that it can not be generalized to the population of Taiwan. The potential bias is that we can only claim the applicability of the findings to the women accessed. Studies with much larger and representative samples in Taiwan are warranted. However, by training clinicians and nurses on antenatal education and skills, there is a potential to support and promote ANCBE in order to increase service rates. This is probably a much simpler solution than repeating this study on larger, more diverse study populations.</p>
<p>The present study characterized the acceptance of ANCBE on a history of breast surgery and ANCBE availability awareness. Health care providers do not often perform clinical breast examinations during antenatal visits. We demonstrated a definite need to improve ANCBE availability awareness. With improved ANCBE availability awareness and the level of practice, health care providers can facilitate early diagnosis, contributing to improved women’s breast health.</p>
<p>In summary, awareness of ANCBE availability has not been well recognized, and the rate of utilization of the program is low. We recommend that antenatal education should be independent of school education as it is not only responsible for fetal health but also for women’s health. Health care providers need to be aware of the importance of thorough breast examinations at the first trimester antenatal care visits.</p>
