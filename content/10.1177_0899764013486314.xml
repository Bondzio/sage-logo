<p>The literature on faith-based organizations (FBOs) includes few articles examining the larger religious context for faith-based nonprofits or the role of specific religions in FBO strategies. While articles on faith-based organizations or religious philanthropy are scattered throughout <italic>NVSQ</italic>, the last special issue on this topic (Milofsky &amp; Cnaan Small Religious Nonprofits, Vol. 26, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764013486314">1997</xref>) is more than 10 years old. This symposium brings together articles focusing on the policy and religious contexts that influence FBO behavior to understand the dynamic between government, communities, and their FBOs. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0899764013486314">Milofsky (2008</xref>, p. 203) notes, organizations can only be understood “in relation to the communities in which they are embedded.” Most articles in this issue define FBOs as nonprofits founded by religious institutions with a primary function separate from worship. As such, we exclude congregations from our discussion, but some articles refer to FBOs attached to congregations or adjudicatories like a diocese such as Catholic Charities.</p>
<p>This symposium came out of the <italic>Faith and Organizations</italic> Project, research fostered by FBO leaders outside of the policy context that influences most literature on this topic. A national research/practice initiative started in 2001 by a request from religious and FBO leaders from several faiths, the project focused on the relationship between faith communities and their nonprofits in a comparative framework. (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.faithandorganizations.umd.edu">www.faithandorganizations.umd.edu</ext-link>). Originally, the symposium planned three articles from the <italic>Faith and Organizations Project</italic> by Schneider, Wittberg, and Sinha focusing on different aspects of the context for FBO action and supported by a literature review on FBOs. This symposium expands on that original concept by including Göçmen’s comparative article from Europe, which explores how the important relationship between church and state influences the role of FBOs in a particular national context. An analysis of the history of U.S. church–state relationships is also included in this introduction as further discussion of the context for FBOs.</p>
<p>Our exploration of the context for FBOs starts with an introductory literature review by Bielefeld and Cleveland that outlines the scope of recent nonprofits publications on FBOs in the United States, discusses definitions of FBO, and FBO typologies regarding the role of religious tradition in their work and methodological issues. Bielefeld and Cleveland’s second article on the kinds of services U.S. FBOs provide and their relationship with government follows their overview article. This is followed by Göçmen’s discussion of the role of FBOs in national social welfare systems in Europe. We then turn to the U.S. context. The next two articles explore the religious context for U.S. FBOs with Schneider’s article on religious support systems and Wittberg’s article on umbrella organizations. Finally, we round out our discussion with Sinha describing the combined impact of the policy and religious context on U.S. FBOs after the faith-based initiative.</p>
<p>The two literature review pieces by Bielefeld and Cleveland describe the scope and major topics in the literature on FBOs. In their overview literature review piece in this issue, Bielefeld and Cleveland note the proliferation of publications on FBOs following the White House faith-based initiatives and Charitable Choice provisions in 1996 welfare reform legislation. They describe the various typologies created to characterize FBOs and outline the debate over methodology to study FBOs, noting a tension between the use of qualitative and historical research to understand nuanced behavior, and the more common reliance on quantitative surveys or experimental design research preferred by government and some social sciences. Their second article provides an overview of the literature comparing FBOs to secular providers and discusses the literature on the dynamic between government and FBOs.</p>
<p>Sinha looks at how FBOs simultaneously respond to policy and religious contexts as she explores how FBOs from different religions changed after the federal faith-based initiatives. Sinha reports that small, African American FBOs were the only organizations in her study to receive new government grants after these two initiatives went into effect. Older, established organizations reasserted their religious identity and reached out to their faith communities after the faith-based initiative. It is unclear if renewed emphasis on their religious roots came from the freedom to be more openly religious or attempts to keep federal funding in response to the emphasis on smaller, more openly religious institutions. However, many organizations showed no change after this initiative.</p>
<p>Schneider and Wittberg explore the religious context for FBOs. Both policy makers and researchers presume that FBOs draw on the faith traditions and resources of their sponsoring religious communities. Building on an earlier article exploring the role of religion in FBO structures and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0899764013486314">Schneider &amp; Wittberg, 2011</xref>), Schneider demonstrates how different religions organize support systems for their FBOs and demonstrates how each system influences the resource structures and behavior of FBOs:</p>
<list id="list1-0899764013486314" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Institutionalized</italic> systems (Catholic, Jewish) centralize planning and fundraising, encouraging collaboration among FBOs from that religion, based on theology highlighting community-wide responsibility for those in need.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Congregational</italic> systems (Mainline Protestants, Quakers, some African American churches) rely on individual congregations or coalitions of congregations to support FBOs. These post-reformation systems draw on the importance of individual congregations and personalized religious calls to service in guiding support for FBOs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Network</italic> systems draw on individuals who share common religious beliefs to support organizations. FBOs relying on network systems primarily come out of Evangelical traditions, which highlight spirit-led action through believers coming together to support a cause.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Sinha uses Schneider’s typology to understand how FBOs from different religious traditions responded to the faith-based initiatives. Wittberg notes that institutionalized religions (Catholics and Jews) are more likely to create sophisticated umbrella organizations that provide planning, fundraising, and resource sharing support than Mainline Protestants, Quakers, and Evangelicals.</p>
<p>Wittberg shows how religions have used their umbrella organizations as a mechanism to maintain faith traditions in FBOs. Comparing umbrella organization structures across religions, Wittberg explores how existing nonprofits theory on umbrella organizations applies to FBOs, expanding theoretical constructs to address the unique role that FBO umbrella organizations play for their member organizations. She demonstrates that FBO umbrella organizations have many commonalities with secular umbrella organizations but also provide programming or materials to help FBOs from a particular religion clarify their faith base to their staff and others. These FBO umbrella organizations serve as representatives of their faith to other religions and secular authorities.</p>
<p>Both policy and nonprofit scholars have analyzed the impact of neoliberalism, a governing philosophy that emphasizes devolving social welfare provision from national governments onto state and local government or private institutions and supports market competition among providers. Neoliberalism comes out of reinterpretations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0899764013486314">Esping-Anderson’s (1990)</xref> description of liberal welfare states like the United States as having limited public benefit programs offered to a small percentage of the population through means testing. The impact of neoliberalism on social welfare provision has become a major focus in policy and academic debate although noticeably absent in mainstream U.S. professional schools of public administration and nonprofit management.</p>
<p>Göçmen’s study of four European welfare regimes introduces <italic>NVSQ</italic> readers to different effects of neoliberalism on various welfare states and suggests alternative theoretical analysis that highlights the role of the historical evolution of state, religious, and civil society structures in understanding the current role of faith-based institutions in social welfare provision. Göçmen demonstrates how the institutionalization of religion and the evolution of the voluntary sector in each nation state, after creation of modern welfare states in the late 19th century, influenced how France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Sweden responded to global policy interest in the U.S. faith-based initiative. FBO’s current role in social welfare provision comes out of historical church–state relationships in each county and the evolution of the voluntary sector. Göçmen’s article shows that a single philosophy like neoliberalism is insufficient to explain nuances in the role of religious institutions in individual nations because of the complex historical evolution of social welfare systems.</p>
<sec id="section1-0899764013486314">
<title>The Policy Context for the Role of FBOs in the United States</title>
<p>Göçmen’s approach also helps us understand the evolution of the faith-based initiative and its impact on U.S. FBOs. Compared to the four European cases included in her study, the United States is perhaps the quintessential liberal welfare state. The U.S. federal welfare state only developed in the 1930s with Roosevelt’s New Deal programs, but these limited, means tested supports only served a small portion of the population in need. Federal social welfare only became an entitlement in the 1970s, with the passage of Medicare for the elderly and disabled, combined with welfare rights protests that led to federal standards for evaluating who received public assistance. Even at its height in the 1970s, the U.S. social welfare state provided much lower benefits to a smaller percentage of the population than in any other developed country, with states determining benefit levels and implementation details. The attack on the welfare state started with Reagan in the 1980s, with the entitlement for public assistance ending in 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0899764013486314">Trattner, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The voluntary sector, and religious institutions in particular, provided most social supports throughout U.S. history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0899764013486314">Cnaan, Wineburg, &amp; Boddie, 1999</xref>, pp. 116-128; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0899764013486314">Trattner, 1994</xref>). While many programs were run directly by congregations, historical literature reports the creation of a wide array of religious-based organizations early in U.S. history. As the country grew, FBOs became an even larger provider of health, social welfare, and education in the United States. Catholics and Jews established institutions for their own populations that grew into service systems that now serve people from all religious backgrounds, often with government funds. Many of the settlement houses and other social welfare institutions that came out of the social gospel movement and other faith-based responses to the industrial revolution evolved into secular institutions, but some retain connections to their founding religions. African American churches served as centers for their communities, rapidly developing a wide array of institutionalized supports. FBOs have also dominated the government-sponsored refugee resettlement system since World War II.</p>
<p>Despite the understanding that separation of church and state is a hallmark of the U.S. system, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0899764013486314">Hall (2005)</xref> reminds us that each state had an institutionalized church until disestablishment in the first half of the 19th century. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0899764013486314">Hall (2005)</xref> describes how Protestant leaders responded to disestablishment by developing theoretically secular nonprofits that carried forward their Christian values. Scholars of the evolution of Catholic and Jewish social welfare, health, and education systems often note that they were created to keep their coreligionists out the Protestant dominated public and nonprofit systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0899764013486314">Bernstein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0899764013486314">Gleason, 1995</xref>). Even when the U.S. social welfare system was at its strongest, faith-based institutions provided services under contract to government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0899764013486314">Monsma, 1996</xref>). African American churches have also consistently provided services under government contract through separately incorporated entities often affiliated with congregations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0899764013486314">Lincoln &amp; Mamiya, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0899764013486314">Littlefield, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0899764013486314">Sinha, 2013</xref>). Separation of church and state was mandated by a series of rules stipulating that faith-based providers needed to offer services in a secular setting.</p>
<p>Using Göçmen’s theoretical framework, the historical system in the United States that preceded Charitable Choice and the Faith-Based Initiatives consisted of a strong institutionalized voluntary sector with a significant FBO component that provided most social welfare services. The federal government had historically played a minor role in social welfare provision, deferring to state and local government to set levels of benefits and administer social welfare programs. While the state eventually provided income support and some other social benefits itself, the majority of government social welfare programs were contracted out to nonprofits, including FBOs. Although separation of church and state dictated that funding could not go to religious institutions, FBOs that did not openly indicate religion in their programming were eligible for government funds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764013486314">Bielefeld &amp; Cleveland, 2013b</xref>, pp. 468-494). The major health programs (Medicare, Medicaid) were voucher systems that paid faith-based and secular hospitals alike, and multiservice FBOs were major players in local social welfare systems throughout the United States.</p>
<p>In this framework, Charitable Choice and the Faith-Based Initiative represent an effort to return to the heavily religiously based social welfare system of the 19th century rather than a new initiative to involve faith communities in social welfare systems. Charitable Choice and the Faith-Based Initiatives of the Bush and Obama presidencies both continued the historic role of FBOs in the U.S. social welfare system and attempted to change the rules for FBOs receiving contracts. New elements included allowing FBOs to acknowledge religious affiliations more openly. In her analysis of the impact of these two initiatives on FBOs in this issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0899764013486314">Sinha (2013)</xref> notes that after the faith-based initiative several established FBOs in her sample reestablished their religious identity in their materials, mission, and rationale for program approaches. The literature on which FBOs participated in government-funded initiatives uniformly shows that few organizations that openly used religion in their programming sought or received government funds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764013486314">Bielefeld &amp; Cleveland, 2013b</xref>, pp. 468-494).</p>
<p>Both Charitable Choice and the Faith-Based Initiatives attempted to encourage congregations and small FBOs to provide government services. The focus on congregations and small FBOs came from a belief that they would provide better services, or at least leverage faith community resources better than the agencies providing government contracted services already. While lobbying for federal funds by evangelicals undoubtedly spurred the charitable choice legislation, a 1997 <italic>NVSQ</italic> special issue on small religious nonprofits noted a resurgence of interest in small FBOs because “a great deal of significant action happens informally and in small-scale, local, congregational efforts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764013486314">Cnaan &amp; Milofsky, 1997</xref>, p. S3). In fact, the introduction to that <italic>NVSQ</italic> special issue noted that “many nonprofits that presently are secular” have religious roots, citing Catholic Charities, Lutheran Family Services, and Jewish organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0899764013486314">Cnaan &amp; Milofsky, 1997</xref>, p. S3). Given this prevailing view of FBOs already contracting with government as secular, the faith-based initiatives targeted more explicitly faith-based institutions. In contrast, Wittberg’s, Schneider’s, and Sinha’s articles in this symposium show how established organizations like Catholic Social Services, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services, and the Jewish organizations, embedded their faith traditions into their work while continuing to appear secular.</p>
<p>The literature on these new federal efforts to expand the number and type of FBOs uniformly reports failure as most of the FBOs receiving government funds had received contracts in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764013486314">Bielefeld &amp; Cleveland, 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0899764013486314">Kennedy &amp; Bielefeld, 2006</xref>; Sinha, 2012). All note that there was little new money accompanying these initiatives. Instead, social programs have continually been cut across the board, leading to widespread reports of FBOs facing increased needs and serving many more people. As such, devolution has meant increasingly sending more people to the FBOs and secular nonprofits for help rather than strengthening an already existing partnership between religious institutions and the state.</p>
<p>Göçmen’s framework also focuses on the nature of the voluntary sector in understanding the role of FBOs. Given the size, diversity, and strength of the U.S. voluntary system in comparison to most other countries, the articles in this special issue highlight features of this institutionalized nonprofit system for FBOs. For example, Wittberg’s and Schneider’s articles describe the Jewish federation system as a highly evolved incorporated umbrella organization for Jewish nonprofits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0899764013486314">1</xref></sup> In contrast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0899764013486314">Harris, Hutchinson, and Cairns (2005)</xref> describe a U.K. Jewish planning system that has the same goals, but is not as formally organized as the U.S. system. Both Wittberg and Schneider describe Catholic Charities as the nonprofit arm of the Catholic Church and a Lutheran social service system with significant ties to local congregations. Göçmen shows that Caritas (Catholic) and Diakonie (Lutheran) are even more institutionalized in Germany where they are formally recognized as the social service arms for their communities based on historical precedence. Thus the dynamic between church and state combines with the institutionalization of the voluntary sector to determine the role of FBOs in social welfare systems.</p>

<title>Research Methods for Studying FBOs</title>
<p>As a group, these articles demonstrate that national policy, historic structures, religious traditions, and the nature of the voluntary sector influence the structure and behavior of FBOs. They also show that a variety of research methods are necessary to understand the context for FBO behavior. Three of the articles in this issue come out of comparative case studies developed for the <italic>Faith and Organizations Project</italic> using ethnography, the qualitative, holistic approach used by anthropologists and some other disciplines. Detailed information on the project and its methods are offered here for Schneider, Wittberg, and Sinha’s articles.</p>
<sec id="section3-0899764013486314">
<title>Faith and Organizations Project Introduction and Methods</title>
<p>The <italic>Faith and Organizations</italic> project examined four aspects of the relationship among faith communities, FBOs, government, and other stakeholders: (1) the relationship between faith communities and the FBOs they either founded or currently sponsor, (2) the ways that religious culture plays out in the structure and programming of FBOs, (3) the role of FBOs in their sectors (interactions with government, other funders, other organizations providing similar services), and (4) relationships with people served by the organization. The pilot study (2004-2006) provided preliminary data on all four topic areas, while the latter <italic>Maintaining Vital Connections Between Faith Communities and their Organizations Study</italic> (2008-2010)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0899764013486314">2</xref></sup> focused primarily on the first two questions.</p>
<p>The project included four types of comparisons: (1) across religions and denominations, (2) among organizations providing different kinds of services, (3) variations stemming from the nature of the current connection to the founding faith community, and (4) the role of organization size, age, funding sources and other organizational characteristics. Research compared the experience of Catholics, Mainline Protestants, Jews, Muslims, Evangelicals, Quakers, and African American Christians.</p>
<p>The project studied a wide range of agencies in four broad service areas: social services (from multiservice organizations like Catholic Charities to congregation-sponsored blessing rooms), health care and senior services (hospital systems, retirement communities, clinics, congregation-sponsored seniors programs), education (K-12 religious schools), and community development projects (community development corporations, emergency services, youth enrichment). With the exception of one Evangelical congregation’s emergency services ministry, all organizations were either 501c3 nonprofits or congregation-sponsored entities with a separate bank account and advisory committee. They ranged in size and age from small ministries in existence for less than 5 years to multimillion dollar organizations several hundred years old with multiple locations. Depending on the religion or denomination, guidance and support activities may be carried out primarily by congregations, by higher level adjudicatories like Jewish Federations, an archdiocese or a Quaker Yearly Meeting, by intermediary organizations, such as Friends Services for the Aging, or a combination of any of these institutions.</p>
<p>The research focused on linked institutions—for example, a congregation and the school that it had founded. We also included several interfaith organizations sponsored by anywhere from 4 to 30 individual congregations. Interfaith usually meant sponsorship from a variety of Mainline Protestant denominations, sometimes with one Catholic parish or Quaker meetings added to the mix. Jewish and Catholic communities, through their umbrella institutions of the Federation, Order, or Archdiocese, were responsible for a full range of organizations, and we chose two or three institutions under those umbrella organizations for intensive study. Catholic religious orders at a national or regional level were responsible for numerous schools and hospital systems. To understand the nature of these relationships, we focused on several levels of faith community institution engagement. For example, our research on Order-sponsored Catholic hospitals included research on the national office of the Order, the health system office that oversaw all the hospitals, and a single hospital located under this umbrella organization in Baltimore.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0899764013486314">
<title>Method</title>
<p>These three articles offer examples of comparative case study research, combining several qualitative techniques to examine aspects of organizational behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0899764013486314">Yin, 2003</xref>). These cases rely on multimethods ethnography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764013486314">Schneider, 2006</xref>), using a strategically selected sample of organizations to allow generalizations both within categories such as religion and across organizations. Generalizable findings are determined through clarifying common patterns, while the richness of the differences among organizations and across community contexts is retained.</p>
<p>Research looked at connections at two levels: (a) the faith community’s understanding of their sponsorship and support role for all FBOs affiliated with the faith community and (b) specific relationships with selected organizations. The study design involved two phases: (a) an intensive research phase comparing religions and types of organizations in the Mid-Atlantic (Philadelphia, Baltimore, Annapolis, Washington, D.C., and their surrounding regions) and (b) an expansion phase that involved testing a self-assessment instrument and some less intensive research in additional organizations per faith in the South (South Carolina), Midwest (Chicago, Ohio), and Mid-Atlantic. The pilot focused on 11 FBOs in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., and the <italic>Connections</italic> study included 81 FBOs and faith communities. Research used a combination of the following methods:</p>
<list id="list2-0899764013486314" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>History of the faith community’s development of and evolving relationship with selected FBOs</italic>. Histories were developed using a combination of any existing histories of the organization or faith community, review of relevant primary sources generated by the religion or organizations, and interviews with people knowledgeable about FBO guidance in that faith; or the relationship between the faith community and specific organizations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>In-depth interviews with current and former key individuals from the faith communities and organizations</italic>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Participant observation in faith community stewardship activities and selected organization events related to faith community stewardship</italic>. Participant observation means attending activities relevant to research questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764013486314">Schneider, 2006</xref>). These vary by faith tradition and include faith community committee meetings, presentations by FBOs to the faith community, organization board meetings, annual meetings, and events for the larger community. Participant observation opportunities included administrative meetings, celebratory events, and volunteer activities. While observing, researchers also interviewed participants informally.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Analysis of recent and ongoing written materials produced by the faith community and FBOs</italic> (board and committee minutes, outreach and recruitment materials, theological materials related to charity and justice activities, etc.).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These various data were drawn together and used to (a) develop comprehensive pictures of each organization/faith community relationship and (b) provide comparative material for general analysis. We used several standard ethnographic analysis techniques to understand our findings (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0899764013486314">Schneider, 2006</xref>). Analysis was developed both by the research group in joint meetings and phone calls as well as individual scholars. A final step involved comparing our research to other relevant case study and quantitative research.</p>
<p>Taken together, these articles show how comparative case studies can build toward an understanding of the way community context influences the strategies of FBOs. They focus on the role of community institutions as moderating influences on FBOs that offer guidance, additional resources, and structures for FBO behavior. As such, they suggest both alternative research strategies and expand analysis to see FBOs as contributors to the U.S. social service system because of their community context. Seeing FBO behavior as fostered by religious traditions and values, regardless of FBOs’ ability to meet funder and regulatory requirements, lends new meaning to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0899764013486314">Salamon’s (1995)</xref> partnership concept as FBOs embody civic engagement for religious communities in efforts to meet larger community goals.</p>
