<p>Much current research fails to provide in-depth explanations as to how and with what resources frontline employees deal with incidents where customers display dysfunctional behaviour. By drawing on theory of implicit knowledge and practical judgement this paper aims to explain this and conceptualize inherent structures and sub-mechanisms, central to service marketing. The analysis is based on in-depth interviews and narratives from four different industries, each representing service provision wherein customer misbehaviour is found to be frequent. The results display linkages between the central dimensions of dealing with customer misbehaviour. When incidents of misbehaviour occur they are met by tactics ranging from routinized action to more analytical and strategic approaches. These tactics are guided by underlying mechanisms in the form of practical judgements based on rules, balanced adjustment or reflection, with the judgements in turn being informed by implicit knowledge based on norms, schemes, or multi-perspective thinking. The study reveals patterns of linkages between these.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Research on customer misbehaviour has contributed to our understanding of the down side and disharmonious aspect of marketing. The phenomenon of customers who deliberately act in a dysfunctional, thoughtless, or abusive manner and cause problems for the company, its employees, and other customers have been captured under different <italic>labels</italic> – such as ‘jaycustomers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470593112457741">Lovelock, 1994</xref>); ‘aberrant consumer behaviour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470593112457741">Fullerton and Punj, 1993</xref>); ‘dysfunctional customer behaviour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470593112457741">Harris and Reynolds, 2003</xref>); ‘deviant customer behaviour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1470593112457741">Moschis and Cox, 1989</xref>); and ‘problem customers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470593112457741">Bitner et al., 1994</xref>). The very existence of these behaviours has implications, especially for frontline employees who have to deal with such issues on a day-to-day basis. Incidents of abuse and mistreatment by customers have been found to be so frequent and have such a profound effect on frontline employees, the organization as a whole, and other customers present during incidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470593112457741">Harris and Reynolds, 2003</xref>), that employees adopt different strategies in order to cope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1470593112457741">Reynolds and Harris, 2006</xref>). Because of this, dealing with aberrant or threatening customers is an important issue, especially in service marketing.</p>
<p>However, much current research fails to provide in-depth analysis of <italic>how</italic> frontline employees handle incidents where customers misbehave (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470593112457741">Fisk et al., 2010</xref> for an overview), and explain why and with what resources employees deal with them as they do – a need addressed in the literature (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470593112457741">Babin and Babin, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470593112457741">Bitner et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470593112457741">Harris and Reynolds, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1470593112457741">Reynolds and Harris, 2006</xref>). Existing research on customer misbehaviour has mostly been occupied with understanding the background causes and triggers to customer misbehaviour and consequences for organizations and employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470593112457741">Fisk et al., 2010</xref>). To analyse how organizations and frontline employees cope with dysfunctional behaviour is an important research issue but we argue that it is not sufficient for our understanding of theory and practice of marketing – especially service marketing. Uncovering the very formation of action on the part of the employees also seems to be critical. </p>
<p>Our starting point, as will be evident in the following, is that formation of action (tactics) at employee level in dealing with customer misbehaviour is highly emotional, drives employees to shield themselves, and to instantly, and not always adequately, cope with the situation. Responses like these are reported in research on coping (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1470593112457741">Reynolds and Harris, 2006</xref>). However, action is also linked to other resources, such as knowledge and skills, active or activated during interaction. More specifically, we theorize on, and confine this study to, how frontline employees’ implicit knowledge and skills in service provision informs practical judgement; that is, how responses are made, acceptances are reached, and outcomes sought.</p>
<p>The relevance of this research is also seen in the light of the recent discourse on value co-creation, a conception based on the notion of services as interactions and value as an outcome realized in use (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470593112457741">Ballantyne and Varey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1470593112457741">Prahalad and Ramaswamy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1470593112457741">Vargo and Lusch, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1470593112457741">2004b</xref>). This conceptualization emphasizes that service encounters are co-creation entities whereby the services rendered by the firm are matched by the services that consumers provide to the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1470593112457741">Vargo and Lusch, 2004a</xref>) – that is the service-centred view. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1470593112457741">Oliver (2006</xref>) explores conceptually (but not empirically) the dynamics underlying this symbiosis in terms of mutual satisfaction (or dissatisfaction) and bi-directionality, the latter referring to the assessment and fulfilment of the other party’s needs. This implies that value, rather than being added during a separated and non-interactive production and consumption process, is co-created, realized, and assessed in interaction, during the simultaneous production and consumption process (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1470593112457741">Salomonson et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>This logic is also valid for interactions where value potentially or actually is destroyed – e.g. customer misbehaviour whereby employees need to act – the focus of this paper. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1470593112457741">Plé and Cáceres (2010</xref>) claim, customer misbehaviour can have adverse consequences leading to actual value co-destruction. See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470593112457741">Echeverri and Skålén (2011</xref>) for a conceptualization of these two sides of value formation in the relation between frontline employee and customer. According to the service-centred view, the knowledge and skills located within the organization – e.g. the competence of the employees, shared cultures, and information systems – and in the environment – e.g. customer skills, national cultures, and institutional frameworks – drive value formation. The implication is that value formation in the interaction between frontline employees and misbehaving customers is seen as interactively co-created – or co-destroyed. It is only when the knowledge and skills, or the operant resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1470593112457741">Vargo and Lusch, 2004a</xref>), are active or activated that value formation takes place.</p>
<p>In the paper, drawing on our empirical study of employee tactics (actions or dealing practices) and research on implicit knowledge, we demonstrate how three main categories of tactics, differentiated on the employees’ ability to reflect on various aspects, are traced back to specific forms of practical judgements and implicit or tacit knowledge. Our understanding of this is coloured by practice theory as elaborated in previous marketing research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470593112457741">Echeverri and Skålén, 2011</xref>; Schau et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1470593112457741">Skålén, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1470593112457741">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1470593112457741">Warde, 2005</xref>) and helps us to illuminate and analyse the micro practice of the subtle resources used and judgements made by frontline employees. Practice theory holds that action is only possible and understandable in relation to common and shared practices and that social order is constituted by practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470593112457741">Bourdieu, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470593112457741">Foucault, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470593112457741">Giddens, 1984</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470593112457741">Chia (2004</xref>: 32), practices are ‘background coping skills’ on which actors unconsciously draw in order to manoeuvre in everyday life. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1470593112457741">Warde (2005</xref>) argues that practices comprise a temporally unfolding and spatially dispersed nexus of behaviours that include practical activities, performances, and representations or talk. Practices are, thus, combinations of mental frames, artefacts, technology, discourse, values, and symbols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470593112457741">Orlikowski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1470593112457741">Schatzki, 2006</xref>). A particular combination of these different building blocks constitutes practices which, for example, can be ‘routinized ways in which bodies are moved, objects are handled, subjects are treated, things are described and the world is understood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1470593112457741">Reckwitz, 2002</xref>: 250). Following practice theory in our analysis, we thus conceive of employee actions as background skills that simultaneously limit and enable interactions between frontline employee and customer.</p>
<p>By investigating incidents of misbehaviour and customer abuse during service encounters from an employee perspective, our study aims to contribute to the rigour and relevance of service marketing, entailing implications for service operations, employee training, and management support.</p>
<p>In this regard, the theoretical contribution is how underlying structures of knowledge and skills are related to practical judgement and the tactics used by employees in practice. The analysis is oriented towards micro elements such as procedures – explicit rules, principles, precepts, and instructions, also called ‘discursive knowledge’ or ‘know-what’; understandings – knowledge of what to say and do, skills and projects, or ‘know-how’; and engagements – ends and purposes that are emotionally charged insofar as people are committed to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470593112457741">Echeverri and Skålén, 2011</xref>; Schau et al., 2009). By this we specifically contribute to existing research on customer misbehaviour.</p>

<title>Literature review</title>
<p>Among the wide range of different types of misbehaviour faced by frontline employees, which is reported in the literature we find customer rage and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1470593112457741">Grove et al., 2004</xref>); shoplifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470593112457741">Babin and Babin, 1996</xref>); vandalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470593112457741">Goldstein, 1996</xref>); sexual harassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470593112457741">Gettman and Gelfand, 2007</xref>); drunkenness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470593112457741">Bitner et al., 1994</xref>); and illegitimate customer complaints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1470593112457741">Reynolds and Harris, 2005</xref>). What is also reported is a growth in the number of violent incidents against frontline employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1470593112457741">Huefner and Hunt, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1470593112457741">Nelms, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1470593112457741">Rose and Neidermeyer, 1999</xref>), as well as increased aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470593112457741">Gabriel and Lang, 1997</xref>). Some research even suggests that customer misbehaviour is the norm rather than the exception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1470593112457741">Harris and Reynolds, 2004</xref>) and that frontline employees thus exposed may even experience this as an unconscious ‘toxicity’, something that has a long-lasting negative effect on employees' feelings, the work environment, and their relationships with customers and other employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1470593112457741">Stein, 2007</xref>; see also research on consequences of customer misbehaviour by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470593112457741">Harris and Reynolds, 2003</xref>). </p>
<p>In fact, these observations drive the research interest of coping strategies at frontline level and as such make the issue critical for service marketing. We argue that the literature is largely occupied by phenomena such as what types of specific tactics are used, what attitudes are involved, what kind of recovery actions could be identified and what the implications are for employees or organizational procedures. However, although recognized as important, knowledge on the formation of tactics when dealing with customer misbehaviour seems to be limited. Further, we account for current conceptions as well as the debate concerning the concept of implicit (or tacit) knowledge in relation to practical judgement and show how this theory may be drawn on in order to address the limitations of previous research. We articulate how this can be done.</p>
<sec id="section3-1470593112457741">
<title>Employees’ coping strategies</title>
<p>There are several examples in previous studies of how employees handle misbehaving customers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1470593112457741">Reynolds and Harris (2006</xref>) demonstrate 15 coping tactics that restaurant personnel use before, during, and after acts of dysfunctional customer behaviour. Tactics used include: (before) mentally preparing for work, changing one’s clothing, and observing patrons; (during) ignoring or bribing customers, using emotional labour such as faking sincerity and politeness, altering personal speech patterns, or manipulating the servicescape by removing ashtrays or glasses; (after) temporary isolation from others, talking to colleagues, or gaining revenge by, for example, sneezing deliberately on a customer’s food before serving it. Some of these tactics are also noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470593112457741">Hochschild (1983</xref>) in her extensive research on flight attendants and bill collectors. </p>
<p>A general coping strategy involves ‘turning off’ emotions and acting without displaying any authentic feeling. She also notes that flight attendants resist their customers’ demands by working more slowly. Another strategy involves protecting one’s sense of self (e.g. identity, self-esteem) by rationalizing and interpreting the event in a manner that flatters the interpreter and appears reasonable to him or her but is not quite so reasonable, perhaps, to an impartial outsider. Further examples of coping strategies include employees acting behind customers’ backs or to ‘get back’ at customers. One example, occurring at Disneyland, was service personnel separating couples or tightening safety belts too hard (Noon and Blyton, 1997). Coping strategies also involve employees needing social distance, e.g. being apart from their customers in an isolated area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470593112457741">Edvardsson and Gustavsson, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1470593112457741">Reynolds and Harris (2006</xref>) suggest that employees adopt informal strategies in order to cope with deviant customer behaviour and are thus ‘not simply passive to acts of deviant customer behaviour and managerially espoused customer sovereignty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1470593112457741">Reynolds and Harris, 2006</xref>: 106). Frontline employees are therefore more reflexive and more adaptive in their work than previous studies have indicated.</p>
<p>Within this area of research, we also find research focus on attitudes towards negative critical incidents (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470593112457741">Lewis and Spyrakopoulos, 2001</xref>) as well as recovery actions and implications for organizational procedures (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470593112457741">Lewis and Clacher, 2001</xref>). This stream of research generally illustrates different actions used by employees to protect or shield themselves from outbursts or excessive demands, rather than focusing on the kind of knowledge resources and practical judgement that informs such action.</p>
<p>Our paper is a complement to research on coping tactics outlining a framework that explains how the formation of coping tactics is realized. Initiating such an articulation requires a systematic (qualitative) empirical study of the practical judgements made in dealing with customer misbehaviour (e.g. assessments, intuitive responses, association paths, etc.). We do this by drawing on theory of implicit (tacit) knowledge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1470593112457741">
<title>Implicit knowledge and practical judgement</title>
<p>The relevance of the construct implicit knowledge is seen in the fact that the actions employees use in service encounters, to cope with emotionally charged dysfunctional behaviour, include a number of skills, know-how, capabilities, and experiences – a wide range of more fuzzy knowledge resources. The literature also gives reasons to put analytical efforts to these fuzzy knowledge resources beyond the more salient phenomena such as reflective thinking, decision making, and interpretations, i.e. what people perform. In regard to our purpose, it is evident that we can expand our comprehension of employees dealing with customer misbehaviour by examining their ongoing practices and paying attention to instances of implicit knowledge structures and practical judgement procedures, both discussed in this section.</p>
<sec id="section5-1470593112457741">
<title>Implicit knowledge</title>
<p>Much current thinking in relation to crisis management, learning from failure and practice-based studies, reveals the significant role of implicit knowledge – a specific mode of knowing – in explaining actions such as in service encounters. Implicit knowledge is traditionally discussed in terms of tacit knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1470593112457741">Nonaka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1470593112457741">Polyani, 1967</xref>), and more recently in terms of processual knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1470593112457741">Kakihara and Sørensen, 2002</xref>), or knowledge-how (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470593112457741">Gourley, 2006</xref>), necessary for practical judgement. This notion is originally based on the idea of separating knowledge into explicit and tacit, first introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1470593112457741">Polanyi (1958</xref>), where ‘tacit knowledge’ is believed to escape representations and measurement but still matters when undertaking specific operations and activities. It is thought of as something mute and inarticulate that we cannot fully explain. In this paper we coin this tacitness as ‘implicit’ due to our assumption that it is within reach of human investigation, possible to articulate and communicate, and not a mysterious residual. We argue that including implicit knowledge is a fruitful step to take for more in-depth analyses of employees dealing with customer misbehaviour. However, this proposal is open to certain objections discussed in the following passages.</p>
<p>In research, the notion of tacit knowledge has been found to be a profound philosophical question and the concept has no clear-cut definitions. A widespread view of tacit knowledge within organizational settings is the knowledge-based view of the firm displayed in the knowledge management literature. It holds that tacit knowledge can be managed as an organizational resource and has been shown to be important for the success of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1470593112457741">Nestor-Baker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1470593112457741">Wagner and Sternberg, 1985</xref>), as well as being important for the work of organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470593112457741">Baumard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470593112457741">Hall, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470593112457741">Lubit, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1470593112457741">Prahalad and Hamel, 1990</xref>). The field of knowledge management has produced a number of studies of how tacit knowledge is created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1470593112457741">Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1470593112457741">von Krogh et al., 2000</xref>), disseminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470593112457741">Davenport and Prusak, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470593112457741">Dixon, 2000</xref>), and used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470593112457741">Boisot, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470593112457741">Choo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1470593112457741">Pfeffer and Sutton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1470593112457741">Seely-Brown and Duguid, 2000</xref>). In knowledge management discourse, tacit knowledge is said to be ‘embedded’ in ‘repositories’ (e.g. individuals, roles and structures, organizational practices, culture, and the physical structure of the workplace) or ‘reservoirs’ (e.g. organization members, tools, and tasks, and combinations of these three elements) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470593112457741">Argote and Ingram, 2000</xref>: 152–3); or ‘materialized’ into ‘knowledge object[s]’ such as documents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470593112457741">Garavelli et al., 2002</xref>: 270). Furthermore, tacit knowledge is deeply rooted in each individual's actions and experiences, as well as in the ideals, values, and emotions they embrace. Subscribing to the view that knowledge is not like other resources, numerous writers argue (with a sigh of resignation) that there is one component of knowledge that we cannot fully codify and represent; that there always is something indeterminate, fluid, and ambiguous in knowledge – which is thought of as the tacit component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470593112457741">Baumard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1470593112457741">Lam, 2000</xref>). Although some doubt if it can be managed like other forms of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1470593112457741">Grant, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1470593112457741">Teece, 1998</xref>) it is claimed to be central for individual action even if research efforts on this is limited.</p>
<p>The existence of and the possibility to articulate implicit (tacit) knowledge are thought of as both philosophical and methodological questions, having historical roots. Our current understanding of the concept of implicit (tacit) knowledge can be attributed to the work of authors such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470593112457741">Baumard (1999</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470593112457741">Collins (2001</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470593112457741">Janik (1988</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1470593112457741">Neisser (1976</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1470593112457741">Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1470593112457741">Reber (1989</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1470593112457741">Schön (1983</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1470593112457741">Scribner (1986</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1470593112457741">Simon (1973</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1470593112457741">von Krogh and Roos (1995</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1470593112457741">Wagner and Sternberg (1986</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470593112457741">Baumard (1999</xref>) traces implicit knowledge structures back to the ancient Greek concept of ‘phronesis’, as the result of experience that cannot easily be shared, as knowledge that is personal, profound, non-scientific, and ‘generated in the intimacy of lived experience’. In line with that, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470593112457741">Fukami (2007</xref>: 4) labels this ‘practical wisdom’ and describes it as ‘the ability to interpret and adapt knowledge to a particular context, situation, or problem’.</p>
<p>As shown in the literature, mainstream understanding of the tacitness of knowledge has been subject to debate, in particular when it comes to the concept’s elusive and immeasurable characteristic. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470593112457741">Armstrong and Mahmud (2008</xref>) demonstrate that tacit knowledge is derived from several distinguishing characteristics such as knowledge that people do not know they have (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470593112457741">Forsythe et al., 1998</xref>), and which resists articulation or introspection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470593112457741">Cooper and Sawaf, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1470593112457741">Morgan, 1986</xref>). In contrast with this view <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470593112457741">Boisot (1998</xref>) says that there are three ‘quite distinct variants’ of tacit knowledge: (1) ‘Things that are not said because everybody understands them and takes them for granted’; (2) ‘Things that are not said because nobody fully understands them. They remain elusive and inarticulate’; and (3) ‘Things that are not said because while some people can understand them, they cannot costlessly articulate them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470593112457741">Boisot, 1998</xref>: 57). </p>
<p>Such a definition underscores the ‘implicitness’ of this kind of knowledge and makes it relevant for analysis in the context given in this study. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1470593112457741">Perraton and Tarrant (2007</xref>) argue that the concept of tacit knowledge is merely a term given to a phenomenon that the observer thinks that he or she does not understand; used as such, it gains no explanatory power. However, they also note that, despite tacit knowledge being neither codified nor even capable of being codified or communicable in language, it can nevertheless, apparently, be communicated between people within firms and organizations provided they have a sufficiently common degree of cultural understanding. It may even be communicated between firms and over distances, and its transfer may be formally contracted between firms. This puts it within reach of examination. Hence, although tacit knowledge may be considered by some to be a bane to articulation, others consider it to be measurable (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470593112457741">Ceci and Liker, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470593112457741">Forsythe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1470593112457741">Sternberg and Grigorenko, 2001</xref>), arguing that it cannot be understood through direct articulation but must be inferred from actions and statements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470593112457741">Forsythe et al., 1998</xref>). In line with this view <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470593112457741">Gourley (2006</xref>) proposes a framework suggesting that different kinds of knowledge are related to different kinds of everyday behaviour. Knowledge, by this account is managed indirectly through managing behaviour. To gain understanding of employees’ implicit knowledge structures thus requires an understanding of their ongoing practices.</p>

<title>Practical judgement</title>
<p>Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470593112457741">Baumard (1999</xref>) who claims that there are two sides to tacit knowledge: (1) ‘a cognitive dimension, e.g. paradigms, mental models, representations’; and (2) ‘a technical dimension, e.g. know-how, expertise applied to a specific context’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470593112457741">Baumard, 1999</xref>: 59), it seems to be suitable to disconnect the concept of implicit knowledge from practical judgement. Implicit knowledge is always enacted in a practical dimension of doing, performing, assessing in different situations. In line with this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470593112457741">Insch et al. (2008</xref>) propose a multidimensional model of the underlying dimensions of tacit knowledge, adding to Baumard’s (1999) cognitive and technical skills dimensions a third dimension that incorporates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1470593112457741">Wagner’s (1987)</xref> concept of a social dimension of tacit knowledge, e.g. knowledge of self, tasks, and other people. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470593112457741">Hager (2000</xref>) makes a related point when arguing that much of what gets classified as tacit knowledge actually appears to be the professional exercise of judgement, problem solving in novel circumstances – agents could give an account of their reasons and may often have to do so (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1470593112457741">Perraton and Tarrant, 2007</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1470593112457741">Styhre (2004</xref>) points out, knowledge is the totality of a human being’s capacities and skills and must be examined as such, not through his or her abilities to express, represent, or codify these capacities. In brief, knowledge must be examined as knowledge and not as a text or a symbolic system. This is also demonstrated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470593112457741">Beckett’s (2008)</xref> conceptual analysis of holistic competence, where the term judgement-in-context is central, referring to sensitivity to specifics in the immediate workplace context and the employees’ actions in making judgements regarding how to proceed. Judgements are practical in the sense of being appropriate to the context in which they are embedded. Hence, to unearth the formation of employees’ coping strategies we need to address implicit knowledge structures as well as practical judgements made in the interaction.</p>

<title>Study design and methodology</title>
<p>Due to the complexity of the phenomenon of employees’ dealing with customer misbehaviour and the problematic issue of data gathering, we used a methodological design based on personal in-depth interviews. This qualitative approach enabled us to gain a deeper insight into the employees’ work situations and how they experience and respond to customer misbehaviour; or, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470593112457741">Miles and Huberman (1994</xref>) describe it, to locate the meanings people place on the events, processes, and structures of their lives. The employees’ perspectives thus take centre stage (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470593112457741">Bryman, 2004</xref>). Another advantage of qualitative data is that it can provide richness and holism with a strong potential for revealing complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1470593112457741">Miles and Huberman, 1994</xref>). Data was gathered from four different industries in Sweden: insurance services, mobility services, metro services, and bus/tram services. We chose them since each represents a working environment with a high level of customer contact and a form of service provision where customer misbehaviour is found to be frequent (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1470593112457741">Fellesson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102a-1470593112457741">Fellesson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1470593112457741">Salomonson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1470593112457741">SEKO and Kommunal, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1470593112457741">Swedish Work Environment Authority, 2008</xref>). </p>
<p>Transportation employees need to provide good service for travelling customers; but they also have a control/sanction function since they often need to check if customers have paid for their tickets. This implies an inherent tension between service and control/sanction which leaves them exposed to situations of customer misbehaviour (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1470593112457741">Suquet, 2010</xref>). Transportation employees are also often first in line to receive complaints when the bus/tram/metro is delayed or cancelled. In the mobility services the employees sometimes have to refuse customers' requests to travel, often because of limitations regarding the amount of transport available. These employees serve customers who, due to their physical and/or mental problems, often do not have any other option than to travel with these mobility services. This can trigger different forms of customer misbehaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1470593112457741">Echeverri et al., 2009</xref>). </p>
<p>Employees in the insurance industry also sometimes have to face misbehaviour after having provided negative decisions to customers (Åberg, 2007). Activities within these types of service provision thus result in customers sometimes facing unfavourable and negative decisions, resulting in customer misbehaviour. The large number of customer contacts also implies that the employees sometimes meet customers that seemingly misbehave for other reasons, such as drunkenness or individual psychological factors.</p>
<p>In the insurance and mobility services studied, customers are served by phone. In the metro and bus/tram services, encounters are face-to-face. Examples of customer misbehaviour faced by employees include verbal abuse, such as insults, foul language and screaming, unreasonable demands related to the service, accusations, lies, drunkenness, and even threats of physical violence. None of the interviewed employees had been given any special instructions or formal training in how to deal with different sorts of customer misbehaviour. There was no such education in the organizations studied.</p>
<p>A total of 63 employees were interviewed: 11 claim adjusters from the insurance industry; seven employees from the mobility services industry; 11 metro frontline workers (ticket collectors); and 34 bus/tram drivers. Due to greater access we chose to interview more bus/tram drivers. The employees were selected on the basis of being in daily contact with their customers. We also sought a variation in age (ranging from 25–60), experience (from 2–25 years in their profession), and gender (40 men and 23 women), mirroring the uneven gender distribution in the chosen service industries. The interviews lasted between 45 minutes and 1.5 hours and took place in a private room at each company. In order to obtain rich and vivid narratives of encounters with misbehaving customers, we constantly asked the respondents to exemplify, explain, and reflect upon their experiences of these encounters and how they handled misbehaving customers. This research approach is suitable when striving to obtain a deeper understanding of how people act in a certain way, and why, when handling critical situations. By using a mix of closed and open-ended questions we discovered actions taken and practical judgements made (e.g. assessments, decision making, and interpretations). By examining the employees’ ongoing practices, we expanded our comprehension of the underlying implicit knowledge structures – inferred from employees’ actions and statements (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470593112457741">Forsythe et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The joint collection and analysis of data ended when we experienced theoretical saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470593112457741">Glaser and Strauss, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1470593112457741">Strauss and Corbin, 1998</xref>). Transcriptions of the interviews were coded using the qualitative analysis program NVivo, identifying the categories, concepts, and variables of key importance. Mainly, the data was coded non-prejudicially, i.e. without a priori coding schemes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1470593112457741">Strauss and Corbin, 1998</xref>). Initial codes were clustered into emerging categories, concerning (i) types of tactics which the employees used in relation to customer misbehaviour; (ii) practical judgements made in respect of the respondents’ own behaviour; (iii) instances of implicit knowledge referred to when elaborating on the narratives. Although specific misbehaviour incidents were found in the narratives and documented systematically, in the paper we limit our analysis to actions (‘dealing’ as practice). Iterative reflections on the empirical material finally contributed to the conceptualizations made in the paper. In order to further increase the possibility of obtaining credible results, we used triangulation in the form of different ‘investigators’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1470593112457741">Lincoln and Guba, 1985</xref>); all three authors respectively examined the data individually and discussed the analysis jointly. Our choice of four different cases is an attempt to strengthen the representativeness of our findings.</p>

<sec id="section8-1470593112457741">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Corresponding to previous coping research, it can be seen in our empirical data that employees’ management of misbehaving customers involves a range of different tactics (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470593112457741">Hochschild, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1470593112457741">Noon and Blyton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1470593112457741">Reynolds and Harris, 2006</xref>). The customer interaction as such gives rise to this diversification, but it is also obvious that the formation of tactics involves other moderating factors explaining the link between incidents and tactics. As will be evident below, we identify a more or less salient judgement procedure, mirrored in the narratives and including typical response approaches. On a practical level, this judgement guides employee behaviour (e.g. tactics). Further, these different forms of practical judgements are informed by structures of implicit knowledge, underlying the judgement of customer misbehaviour.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470593112457741">Figure 1</xref> displays the overall linkages between key dimensions in dealing with managing customer misbehaviour. The model illustrates how misbehaviour incidents pertain to practical judgement in the concrete display of responses (tactics). Practical judgement per se is informed by implicit knowledge of various kinds. The relationship between practical judgement and implicit knowledge should be perceived as lying on different levels vis-à-vis tactics. Incidents of customer misbehaviour are directly moderated by a judgement procedure before being manifested in tactics. During various judgement procedures, implicit knowledge is brought to the fore.</p>

<p>In this section we first report on findings in relation to (i) <italic>tactics</italic> identified in the empirical material. Categories of tactics are characterized and second, are commented on in relation to (ii) <italic>patterns of links </italic>to practical judgement and implicit knowledge.</p>
<sec id="section9-1470593112457741">
<title>Tactics</title>
<p>Tactics are intentional behaviours practised on the basis of both a given misbehaviour incident and practical judgements made. Three levels of tactics are distinguished, ascending from a more or less routinized manner to a higher degree of reflection over various aspects, goals, and consequences for both the organization and the customer.</p>
<sec id="section10-1470593112457741">
<title>Routine</title>
<p>First, incidents of customer misbehaviour can be dealt with using an action labelled <italic>Routine</italic>. Some incidents do not seem to generate much reflective response, consequently the employee acts immediately and in a seemingly spontaneous manner. This category is close or almost similar to coping (see coping research presented in our literature review). In this category, we noticed six different tactics: hanging up, referring to rules, ignoring, lying, arguing, and apologizing. A typical routinized tactic is the action of ending the conversation without trying to resolve the customers’ initial problem. This strategy seems to be particularly triggered when customers use foul language or act in a rude and insulting way, as illustrated in the following quote.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>They can be verbally</speaker>
<p>abusive but they cannot hurt me physically. So, I can say to a customer: ‘Swearing is unacceptable so you either behave in a civilized way or I’ll hang up’. It’s no more difficult than that. And if they don’t behave, and just carry on … Click! Gone!</p>
</speech>
<p>Another example is to handle the situation by referring to organizational rules or procedures. Due to organizational restrictions, the employees deny the customers’ requests while at the same time avoiding personal attack. However, the employee does not reflect upon any alternative solutions for the customer. One employee in the mobility services industry expresses how she handled an angry customer, by referring to rules, thus:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>So I explained to her in a calm way:</speaker>
<p>‘Yes, but unfortunately we’re not allowed to drive these and it’s a decision that’s been made by municipal management so there’s nothing we can do’.</p>
</speech>
<p>Paradoxically, organizational restrictions are often the source of customer misbehaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1470593112457741">Rosenthal et al., 2001</xref>), while also being used by employees to diminish deviant behaviour. Ignoring the customer is yet another example of how difficult customers are managed. Corresponding to Reynolds and Harris’s (2006) study, employees described how they sometimes disregard misbehaving customers. By letting the customer talk, and not paying him/her very much attention, employees manage to keep calm while the customer is letting off steam. We interpret this type of action as a neutralizing approach, leaving the customer and the employee in ‘status quo’. Another routine-based tactic described by the employees is lying to customers. Using dishonest explanations is a way of effectively dismissing difficult customers. This was not, however, a frequently used tactic. One example of its use was dealing with customer misbehaviour in the form of drunkenness, when the employee lied about the fact that many other calls were on hold.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Most people</speaker>
<p>understand, but not all. Especially not those who’ve been drinking. They really like to keep the conversation going. […] It’s often true, but not always [that there are many other customers on hold]. It depends on how tiresome the person is. You notice when someone is very talkative.</p>
</speech>
<p>Two additional actions identified in the same category of routine-based tactics concern either arguing with the customer or assuming responsibility and apologizing for the situation. As for the former action, we found examples of situations where employees actively resisted customer misbehaviour and held the customer solely accountable for the situation. Routine-based tactics, enacted by ‘telling the customer off’, were especially common in situations where customers acted in an authoritarian way and did not listen to what the employee was saying. The opposite mode of action expressed by employees, in respect of routine-based tactics, was assuming the entire blame instead and apologizing for the incident, albeit not actually solving the customer’s problem. In this way, they avoided an escalating incident. Routine-based actions seemed to be mostly applied when customers refuse to listen or are perceived as particularly difficult to handle, but it is not confined to such situations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1470593112457741">
<title>Situational</title>
<p>In our empirical material we also found several tactics representing more elaborative responses, even though the employees are emotionally affected or upset, whereby the employees react in a more rationalizing way, referring to diverse aspects and consequences. Tactics based on situational consideration point to the conscious control of action characterized by an expressed willingness to solve a problem rather than just enduring or reducing it. Furthermore, this action also indicates the employees’ ability to consider the customers’ situation. Within this category we found that explaining to the customer is a common tactic used by employees. This is differentiated from merely referring to the rules or arguing with him/her, since the employee also ‘educates’ the customer. In doing so, they are able to calm the customer down and also strengthen the possibility of avoiding the same situation again with that specific customer. Explaining how the service is enacted is, therefore, an action that illustrates how employees take more extensive implications into account. The excerpt below demonstrates an employee’s reasoning as regards her own perception of the importance of understanding, and how she tries to apply that when interacting with misbehaving customers:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>[…]</speaker>
<p>to try to get the customer to understand why this has happened. Because, without that understanding … I’m the kind of person who really needs to know why I do the things I do because, otherwise, it won’t mean anything. It’s really important and I try to do that to other people as well. If they have some understanding, there’s usually no problem.</p>
</speech>
<p>Another way is to use humour and joking to reduce incidents of misbehaviour and to try instead to turn them into positive experiences for the customer:<speech>
<speaker>Then you ask:</speaker>
<p>‘There’s no other day [when you can travel]? You can’t have dinner on Sunday instead? Because then there are some really good times available [to book for travel]’. You try and turn it into a positive thing, saying: ‘I promise that the weather will be much better on Sunday’. Or something like that. You joke with them.</p>
</speech>
</p>
<p>The situational tactics also include solving the customers’ problems by taking the initial causes of customers’ misbehaviour into consideration. In our study, this was done in two different ways; either the employees tried to get the relevant facts from customers, despite their misbehaving, in order to solve things; or the employees offered alternative solutions to the customers’ problems. An employee explained this:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>There are many things</speaker>
<p>you can do. Change the [travel] times, before lunch or after lunch. Or suggest: ‘Do you really have to go shopping so early? There’s much more time in the evenings. You’re all alone and you can get as much help as you need in the grocery store’. Many customers appreciate that. They say: ‘Yes, you’re right!’. If you provide good solutions, you’ll be able to sort things out. It’s really rewarding.</p>
</speech>
<p>Finally, within the category of situational tactics, we also note employees handling customer misbehaviour by handing over to someone else. This can involve situations of misbehaviour where the customer threatens the employee, when he/she and the employee are not getting along due to some previous failure in their interaction, when he/she does not calm down, or when he/she is acting in an authoritarian way and demanding to speak to management. The following excerpt demonstrates how the employee does not simply dismiss the misbehaving customer but instead tries to solve the situation by letting the customer talk to someone else within the organization:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Or ask someone else</speaker>
<p> to take the call. It’s not wrong. If something gets really inflamed. Then you can say: ‘Please hold and I’ll put you through to my colleague’. Then you transfer the call and things usually turn out for the better.</p>
</speech>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1470593112457741">
<title>Contextual</title>
<p>A third category of employee tactics, when handling misbehaving customers, is characterized by critical reflection on tasks, goals, and additional conditions such as organizational goals and the customer’s situation. We labelled these tactics as being based on contextual consideration. For example some employees express how they react to customer misbehaviour by giving them enhanced service.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Of course,</speaker>
<p>the customer should get the most benefit from it. Because, at the end of the day, that makes them happy. They’re happy afterwards, and I know it. So, if I arrange a really good journey for this customer, he might think: ‘S**t, it wasn’t really necessary for me to get so angry’.</p>
</speech>
<p>In some situations, giving enhanced service also entailed the employee disregarding internal organizational rules in order to assist the customer. Another form of contextual tactic is that employees try to relate to the customer’s life situation. One such example is when employees of the municipality’s mobility service consider how customers calling to book transportation may have different disability problems:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>A lot of the time, it’s</speaker>
<p> part of their illness. Eventually, you learn which customers have problems affecting the way they act. I mean, we aren’t all the same. No persons are alike. We all have different characteristics. Some of them don’t mean anything bad by what they say.</p>
</speech>
<p>Within the category, we have also identified actions aimed at establishing a personal relationship with the customer. By doing this, they evade problematic incidents and are also in a position to prevent and reduce future customer misbehaviour.</p>
<p>Based on the empirical results, we conclude that customer misbehaviour is met with distinct tactics when managing customers. We also conclude that these tactics are of different sorts, each illustrating different levels of reflection (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470593112457741">Table 1</xref>). More importantly, the fact that these separate tactics are related to the employees’ ability to consider various consequences as well as previous experiences implies that the employees’ knowledge structure guides the formation of tactics. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470593112457741">Table 1</xref> each category is noted along with a short description.<table-wrap id="table1-1470593112457741" position="float">

</table>
</table-wrap> It shows that each of these main categories of tactics is related to a specific practical judgement that concerns the employees’ reason for acting in a certain way. Further, the table also shows how implicit knowledge is related to the practical judgement made. These links are elaborated on in the next section.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1470593112457741">
<title>Pattern of links</title>
<p>As already mentioned, we argue that it is fruitful to separate more diffuse intuitive knowledge resources (implicit knowledge that it is possible to represent and communicate) from more salient phenomena such as assessments, decision making, interpretations (practical judgement) e.g. what people perform (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470593112457741">Baumard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470593112457741">Hager, 2000</xref>). Implicit knowledge influences practical judgement, which in turn drives action. In enacting the various practical judgements, different resources are at hand and in use. These are not always verbally expressed, instead being referred to as implicit knowledge. In understanding the meaning of the practical judgement made, this implicit knowledge is a key element since this type of knowledge is used in the management of customer misbehaviour incidents. Or, in other words, why employees act the way they do is dependent on implicit knowledge.</p>
<p>Within the three major types of tactics used (Routine, Situational, and Contextual), we identify (as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1470593112457741">Table 1</xref>) three different forms of practical judgement (Rules, Balanced adjustment, and Reflection) and three implicit knowledge resources (Norms, Habitual schemes, and Multi-perspective). Based on our findings that customer misbehaviour is met by distinct tactics which are guided by practical judgements informed by implicit knowledge, we identify three patterns: (1) Routine – Rules – Norms; (2) Situational – Balanced adjustment – Habitual schemes; (3) Contextual – Reflection – Multi-perspective. These combinations explain the formation of employees’ tactics when handling customer misbehaviour.</p>
<sec id="section14-1470593112457741">
<title>Routine – Rules – Norms</title>
<p>As regards the first tactic, routine, we identify a practical judgement form interpreted and labelled <italic>Rules</italic>. This form guides the routinized tactics. Employees’ reactions suggest an impulsive and intuitive approach to misbehaving customers, such as checking the level of importance or finding a neat way of getting rid of them (and their problems). Rule-based judgement not only refers to but is also restricted to previous experiences and solutions, or ‘normal’ ways of handling customers, not taking into consideration for example the customers’ point of view. This is, in a sense, practical judgement by rule-of-thumb or by following specific instructions within the organization. Most importantly, this action reduces the complexity of the situation; hence, the issue at hand is managed smoothly and effectively by habitual behaviour. </p>
<p>Furthermore, in our perspective, practical judgements are always formed by an implicit knowledge structure. Seeing that routinized tactics and rule based judgement are foremost characteristics of employees’ habitual behaviour and perceptions of human beings, the implicit knowledge resource rests upon <italic>norms</italic>, i.e. rules are enacted by experiences and learned norms. In this regard, social competence is a key resource, as is learned nonverbal behaviour. By means of multimodal communication beyond words, employees have an impact on their customers. Further, norms can be ethical (what one is supposed to do or not), or organizational (the way employees normally handle negative incidents at a specific company). When employees refer to some kind of rule-of-thumb, this displays a fundamental ethical norm regarding what constitutes a good way of acting. Organizational norms refer to explicit or implicit procedures, but could also reflect a specific corporate culture. On this level, subjective values and different work experiences are basic implicit resources explaining why practical judgement sometimes takes the form of being rule-based. Norms also include the way that one, as a human being, wants to be treated. For example we identified situations where employees terminated calls because they felt personally mistreated by customers. Similar to findings within coping research, such actions are closely linked to emotionally charged responses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1470593112457741">
<title>Situational – Balanced adjustment – Habitual schemes</title>
<p>Employees’ tactics based on the situational consideration identified in our study are more complex than routine based tactics, since they not only consider previous experiences but also institutional issues. When employees reflect on and consider various consequences, this is done by a form of practical judgement procedure, which we interpret and label as ‘Balanced adjustment’. Balancing different options on the basis of their consequences, or considering the customer viewpoint both constitute examples of such a practical judgement procedure. This, in turn, calls for a specific, implicit knowledge resource, which we label ‘Habitual schemes’. These can be cognitively elaborated, for instance when employees refer to different scenarios (‘If I do this, A and B will probably happen and lead to … ’); or refer to balanced adjustments based on different possible consequences in either a short- or long-term perspective. Implicit resources include knowledge of organizational functions, other organizational instances, and responsibilities; for instance they consider how an action in one part of the organizational system may have a negative impact somewhere else.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1470593112457741">
<title>Contextual – Reflection – Multi-perspective</title>
<p>The practical judgement that guides contextual tactics is a form that reflects the ability to see beyond present conditions. This ‘reflection’ form of judgement emphasizes long-term thinking and reflections upon alternative ways of doing things. Hence this specific form reflects on personal action using cognitive loops (see theory on ‘double loop learning’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470593112457741">Argyris and Schön, 1978</xref>). As the following quotation illustrates, it is a mode that takes into account the long-term consequences, based on employees’ experiences.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>During the early</speaker>
<p>years, it affected me. You got offended. Why do I sit here and take all this s**t? I can’t do anything. It’s not something I can change, but I still get a lot of s**t. But over the years, and the longer you’ve been here, you understand why it’s like this. So there’s no point in getting offended – try to talk about it and try to be friendly to the customer. So that, next time, it’ll be better.</p>
</speech>
<p>Considering the emphasis on employees’ ability to address a number of objectives, the implicit knowledge structure lies on a ‘multi-perspective’ approach to misbehaviour incidents. Alternating optional objectives or alternating between perspectives (often, misbehaviour incidents are linked to other organizational actors) are both instances of implicit knowledge being used to manage customer misbehaviour. Within this category, we find instances of taking into account the customer’s entire life situation, as well as organizational goals.</p>
</sec>
</sec>

<sec id="section17-1470593112457741">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>By means of this practice-theory based examination of the links between different misbehaviour incidents and the tactics chosen which focus on employees’ knowledge and skills, we identify fundamental structures and mechanisms of dealing with customer misbehaviour, such as three distinct judgement procedures, each based on different implicit knowledge resources. These are, in a sense, an explanation of why and by which resources employees act the way they do. The model presented grasps the essential dimensions. In a study such as this, one can expect to find various subcategories of practical judgement and implicit knowledge being used as resources, as we did. The taxonomy described will hopefully guide further investigation. A more surprising finding, and fundamental aspect, is the diversified levels of reflection found in the material, ranging from the simple to the more elaborate. The results should be perceived against the backdrop of limited contemporary knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the management of customer misbehaviour. The background causes of customer misbehaviour, consequences, and different forms of coping tactics do not give the full picture. Based on the empirical study and its main findings, we put forth some comments on the existing theory of managing customer misbehaviour.</p>
<p>In relation to the research field of tactics, the study supports the observation made in earlier research that employees adopt informal tactics to cope with deviant customer behaviour (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1470593112457741">Reynolds and Harris, 2006</xref>). The reflexive side of this is elaborated in our study and reveals a taxonomy that differentiates tactics on different levels, in comparison to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1470593112457741">Reynolds and Harris (2006</xref>), ranging from the simple to the more elaborate. Within each level, subcategories are identified which cluster key tactics used by employees in different service industries. Further, earlier studies of tactics focus on coping strategies, i.e. how to ‘survive’ and ‘protect oneself’ against customer misbehaviour. In connection with what is known thus far about employees’ tactics, we see that employees reflect on and consider customer and organizational issues and, in doing this, they manage the interaction. This indicates a more active behaviour pattern which makes it more relevant to label actions as tactics, in turn revealing a more reflective thinking.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the distinction between practical judgement and implicit knowledge structures is important as it points to employees’ ability to adapt their behaviour to the immediate situation. The practical judgements made (rules, balanced adjustment, reflection), which form employee tactics, are grounded in embodied practice and embedded in context. It concerns previous experiences and solutions, or ‘normal’ ways of handling customers (e.g. rule-of-thumb, specific instructions within the organization), as well as procedures of greater complexity (based on, among other things, institutional issues, the customer's situation, and long-term thinking) such as balancing different options and reflections on alternative ways of doing things. This can be related to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470593112457741">Beckett’s (2008)</xref> conceptual analysis of holistic competence and the term judgements-in-context which concerns sensitivity to specifics in the immediate workplace context, as well as the employees’ actions when making judgements regarding how to proceed.</p>
<p>The study also gives structure to the different types of implicit knowledge resources used (Norms, Habitual schemes, Multi-perspective). We label these as implicit knowledge; a form of underlying capacity or competence that employees possess. As demonstrated in the case of the implicit knowledge resource labelled multi-perspective, employees alternate between optional objectives or between different perspectives. We found instances where employees took both organizational and customer perspectives into account when managing customer misbehaviour. This adds to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470593112457741">Insch et al. (2008</xref>) regarding the social dimension of knowledge, e.g. knowledge of self, tasks, and other people. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1470593112457741">Herbig et al. (2001</xref>) affirm the fact that, when dealing with critical situations in person-related services, experience-guided working is of the utmost importance. In a similar way, drawing on our study, we can conclude that employees’ abilities to relate to and shortly reflect upon previous incidents, in terms of integrating implicit knowledge structures, are also critical for enabling value co-creation in service encounters. This has not been reported elsewhere.</p>
<p>By examining practical judgement and implicit knowledge, we have discovered which underlying mechanisms form tactics in the management of customer misbehaviour – an answer to the basic research question of why they act as they do. Taken together, our findings suggest that employees have different approaches when it comes to handling a misbehaving customer, where the main difference is the ability to elaborate and reflect on various aspects and taking different viewpoints into consideration. In our study this is mainly represented by the employees’ referring to both involved actors such as the customer, the company and themselves; and over long-term consequences for these actors. By performing tactics based on contextual consideration and taking a multi-perspective stand, employees not only contribute to the value co-creating process, but also have opportunities to influence fundamental contradictions within service production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470593112457741">Korczynski and Ott, 2004</xref>). </p>
<p>As convincingly argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1470593112457741">Korczynski and Ott (2004</xref>), the growing focus on ‘sovereign customers’ and its infusion in organizations, which is, at the same time, built on rational and bureaucratic processes, brings forward intrinsic contradictions. These contradictions are displayed both between bureaucratic and customer-related norms, and within the use of these customer-related norms, specifically in regard to front-line employees’ representation of these norms. However, by reflecting on various viewpoints, employees seem to manage this contradictory situation, not merely by reducing or ignoring it but instead accepting the conflict and trying to resolve it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the employees’ point of view, when drawing from implicit knowledge as a resource in dealing with misbehaving customers, employees also perform emotional work as they adjust their responses to customers. In the adopted practice theory perspective, implicit knowledge structures are understood as embedded in individual's ideals and values, as well as emotions. This point is particularly crucial for service workers, as the ability to perform emotional labour is an extensive part of their work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470593112457741">Hochschild (1983</xref>) argues that this ‘ability’ is detrimental for employees. Being required to display feelings that they do not feel will confuse their identity and will leave them alienated from themselves. </p>
<p>In a similar way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1470593112457741">Stein (2007</xref>) argues that the ‘toxicity’ of service work undermines employees’ autonomy, seeing that they are ‘polluted’ by environmental and organizational restrictions that limit their ability to act. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470593112457741">Bolton and Boyd (2003</xref>) take the rather opposite strand, stating that emotional labour is practiced in several ways and therefore has dissimilar consequences. Enacting ‘professional prescriptive emotional labour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470593112457741">Bolton and Boyd, 2003</xref>), as do our respondents, points to opportunities for work autonomy as well as a way of raising their professional status vis-à-vis the customer. Hence, employees’ ability to act on practical judgement and implicit knowledge discloses a much more positive and constructive representation of service work.</p>
<p>Therefore, and as a final remark, we would like to draw attention to a positive aspect of this disharmonious side of service marketing – the fact that employees’ competence and ability can turn negative incidents into positive encounters. Often, employees are skilled customer managers who are able to reflect on and synthesize a variety of aspects and consequences. In particular, taking a multi-perspective stand seems to be an effective way to deal with customer misbehaviour and can lead to a higher degree of value creating process as well as opportunities for employees to gain control over their working conditions. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470593112457741">Fisk et al. (2010</xref>) recognize, widespread customer misconduct also communicates to organizations that its rules or the procedures that are used to enforce them are either too rigid or too loose. Employees’ knowledge from such encounters can be used to enable value co-creation and to create improved service systems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1470593112457741">
<title>Conclusions and contributions</title>
<p>The point of departure of this study is that employees dealing with misbehaving customers, besides causing emotionally charged coping responses, are related to fuzzy knowledge and skills. The basis of competence in making practical judgement is the intertwining of know-how and know-why, grounded in embodied practices (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470593112457741">Echeverri and Skålén, 2011</xref>; Schau et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1470593112457741">Warde, 2005</xref>). As discussed, the judgement procedures and implicit knowledge resources used can in a sense be seen as explanations of why employees act the way they do. By drawing on theories of implicit knowledge and practical judgement we contribute to research on customer misbehaviour – e.g. coping strategies at employee level – elaborating on the fundamental question of why they act as they do. The issue has not been studied systematically and referred strands of research have not sufficiently mapped out the underlying mechanisms active in the practical judgement in which frontline employees are engaged.</p>
<sec id="section19-1470593112457741">
<title>Theoretical contributions</title>
<p>The study confirms some earlier research findings and further contributes to the field of management of customer misbehaviour within service marketing, especially by gaining more in-depth insights of the sub-mechanisms of coping tactics, knowledge that has been called for in existing research review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470593112457741">Fisk et al., 2010</xref>). As noted, previous research on employees’ coping tactics generally illustrates different actions used by employees to protect or shield themselves from outbursts or excessive demands, rather than focusing on the kind of knowledge resources and practical judgement that inform such strategies.</p>
<p>
<italic>First</italic>, by broadening the empirical context for research into <italic>dealing</italic> with customer misbehaviour, we have gained additional insights into the tactics used when facing dysfunctional customer behaviour. Much research has focused on employees’ coping tactics within the hospitality industry, e.g. hotels, restaurants, and bars (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1470593112457741">Reynolds and Harris, 2006</xref>). Here, four different service contexts are included (insurance services, mobility services, metro services, and bus/tram services) by which we further extend the research to new empirical fields. <italic>Second</italic>, by investigating the underlying structures and mechanisms with which employees deal with customer misbehaviour, the study contributes new knowledge. Theoretically, the study proposes explanations linked to the processes of practical judgement inherent in service provision. Three diverse types of judgements; i.e. Rules, Balanced adjustment, and Reflection are noticeable among frontline service employees. Definitions and conceptualizations of these are included. <italic>Third</italic> we display three types of implicit knowledge resources: Norms, Habitual schemes, and Multi-perspective, which include important resources for managing customer misbehaviour. Taken together, these constitute the underlying mechanisms that inform practical judgement. <italic>Fourth</italic>, the different types of tactics identified, i.e. Routine, Situational, and Contextual, each correspond to specific forms of judgements made and implicit knowledge used, and we see how different levels of elaboration can be identified in both practical judgement and implicit knowledge. In comparison with research on employees’ coping tactics and actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470593112457741">Hochschild, 1983</xref>; Noon and Blyton, 1997; Reynolds and Harris, 2006); attitudes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470593112457741">Lewis and Spyrakopoulos, 2001</xref>); and recovery actions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470593112457741">Lewis and Clacher, 2001</xref>) when dealing with customer misbehaviour, our study brings new knowledge on employees’ formation of tactics on different levels. To conclude, as these sub-levels have not been previously conceptualized the paper provides a substantial theoretical contribution.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1470593112457741">
<title>Managerial implications</title>
<p>The tactics shown can be used by managers for training new employees, in connection with team-building activities, and in advancing quality perceptions at the customer level. Depending on the type of incident, varying degrees of reflection will be needed. Expanding the range of behaviour competencies among personnel is a good investment. Supporting inter-personnel learning is a promising measure, including the ethical issues of demeanour (relevant in the given context). Minor actions seem to be promising with regard to dissolving customer misbehaviour, e.g. giving customers explanations, apologizing for any inconvenience, assuming responsibility for problems, displaying a willingness to help and draw customer information to the attention of the company’s back-office. However, a more experienced employee has a more elaborated ability to reflect and a more elaborated base of implicit resources to use during the process. Experience is not necessarily linked to the amount of years spent in a service occupation; rather, it is linked to the ability to reflect on job performance, to the experience of various ways of dealing with customers, to values of conduct, and to insights into other aspects of the organization, etc. This demands more multi-perspective thinking at the individual level, with implications for recruitment procedures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1470593112457741">
<title>Limitations and future research</title>
<p>The results, contributions, and managerial implications discussed above are, by nature, specifically linked to the empirical context under study. However, the insights and proposed explanations made can analytically be generalized to other areas of industry. Structures and mechanisms that explain the very essence of dealing with customer misbehaviour can be found in a wide range of other service industries. Further, this study does not cover all the relevant factors. Other factors can be identified on a macro level, e.g. organizational contingencies (corporate procedures, organizational and industrial regulations, control functions, etc.). </p>
<p>Future research could explore the possible effects that the formal education of employees in dealing with customer misbehaviour could have on implicit knowledge structures as well as practical judgement made. Including such factors is beyond the focus of this study (also due to the employees’ lack of education on this subject), as is also the case with issues linked to sociological micro mechanisms, e.g. human interaction (turn-taking procedures, relationship dynamics, psychological mood, sense-making, interactive coherence, asymmetric dominance, etc.). The ways in which employees approach a customer, ask questions, use technical devices, etc. are factors that may have an impact. Furthermore, and as noted above, how to manage customer misbehaviour is strongly related to emotional aspects of service work. Although this matter has been studied previously, there is still a need for further research that links knowledge structures to emotional responses. This study excludes such issues because of the need for a limited research focus. However, such issues make promising subjects for further research.</p>
