<p>We have come to expect bold, sweeping arguments from Francis Fukuyama but his latest book definitely surpasses any of his previous ones in the bold sweep department. It is the first of a planned two-volume project covering the emergence, and frequent decay, of political institutions from the beginning (and even before that) to today. This first volume, <italic>The Origins of Political Order</italic>, covers the period from primate politics to the eve of the French and Industrial revolutions. In it Fukuyama aims to lay bare the historical sources of the three main components of political order—effective state formation, the rule of law, and political accountability—as a basis for a better understanding of their fate in the modern world in the second volume. Fukuyama sees himself as extending and elaborating upon the foundations laid by his “mentor” Samuel Huntington in the magisterial <italic>Political Order in Changing Societies</italic>, particularly in establishing processes of political and institutional development as irreducible to “more fundamental” economic or social factors.</p>
<p>In Part I of the book, Fukuyama presents the basic assumptions that will inform his analyses. Citing widely from the literatures on evolutionary psychology, biology, anthropology, and primatology, he argues that we humans are inclined to nepotism, to violence but also social cooperation, to becoming emotionally attached to rules and norms, and to seek status and legitimacy. These traits in turn imply that: (1) the primordial state is one of “patrimonialism,” favoring one’s kin and close associates; (2) that effective social cohesion cannot be based on self-interest alone but requires legitimacy and authority; (3) that institutions tend to resist change until they are met with catastrophic (often violent) crises; and (4) that the painstaking process of building effective political institutions is punctuated by frequent relapses to a more primitive patrimonialism.</p>
<p>The core of the book consists of three sections dealing with each of the three major aspects of political development. In Part II, on state building, Fukuyama recounts how the first non-patrimonial state (i.e., a centralized bureaucracy based on merit rather than kinship) was created in China during the Qin and Han periods in the two centuries BC under the pressure of incessant warfare and benefitting from a relatively weak kinship-based aristocracy. This set the stage for a ruthless, unconstrained centralized government which has survived to the present day, many rebellions and feudal-patrimonial relapses notwithstanding. Similar results were obtained, for a while, in the Muslim world where the requirements of warfare and conquest and the need to overcome tribal rivalries led to the invention of professional armies and administrations staffed by slaves from the conquered territories who could not pass on their privileged positions to their offspring or kinsmen. This system was perfected by the Ottomans. While it was effective in staving off nepotism, venality and corruption for some time, “eventually [it] succumbed to the natural human desire of their elites to pass on status and resources to their children” (p. 215) as the slaves became a new aristocracy eventually repatrimonializing the state. India provides an interesting contrast in that there the dominance of the Brahmins and the caste system prevented rulers from ever forming any state as brutally effective as China’s or the Ottoman’s. Finally in Europe, Fukuyama claims, the Catholic Church effectively undermined the strength of kinship relations and promoted a much more individualistic orientation as a result of its early assault on extended patrilineal kinship ties and rights.</p>
<p>Part II deals with the rise of the rule of law, the idea that “there is a preexisting body of law representing the will of the whole community that is higher than the will of the current government and that limits the scope of that government’s legislative acts” (p. 253). This idea became prevalent in Europe primarily as a result of the effective separation of Church and State that resulted from the Concordat of Worms, and the successful depatrimonialization of the Church by the imposition of celibacy on the priesthood by the energetic Pope Gregory VII. This produced a powerful bureaucratic hierarchy independent of secular authority which was able to rationalize and uphold canonic law as primary and superior to secular law and to produce an independent class of jurists capable of interpreting the law. It also provided Europe’s secular rulers with a model of a modern, bureaucratic, and rule-governed administration for their later state-building efforts. This evolution contrasted sharply with that of the Muslim world, as well as that of Orthodox Christianity, where religious leaders gradually came under the sway of secular ones creating a form of caesaropapism.</p>
<p>To trace the rise of accountable government, which “means that the rulers believe that they are responsible to the people they govern and put the people’s interests above their own” (p. 321), Part IV focuses, sensibly enough, on Europe. From the late Middle Ages onward, European rulers were forced to modernize their states as a result of almost continuous warfare, but they did so under circumstances quite different from those faced by the Qin and Han emperors almost two millennia earlier. These included respect for the rule of law, an entrenched aristocracy of varying strength, and a range of forms of consultation and local self-government bequeathed by feudalism and early Common Law traditions. The different regimes that emerged were largely the outcomes of a four-way struggle between kings, upper nobility, gentry, and the third estate, with the peasantry in a mostly subsidiary role. Depending on the degree of mobilization and alliances among those resisting the king’s efforts to increase his powers, the outcomes ranged from the victory of the principle of “no taxation without presentation” (Britain, Denmark), to predatory and ultimately failed oligarchy (Hungary, Poland), to weak absolutism (France, Spain), or at the other extreme, strong absolutism (Russia). The British case is particularly important in that it was the only one to produce a combination of <italic>all three</italic> elements of political development, a strong state, the rule of law, and political accountability. The Glorious Revolution that produced this remarkable outcome was itself, according to Fukuyama, the product of a unique combination of historical forces: the early solidarity and self-government at the local level resulting from the very early individualizing force of Christianity, the strength of Common Law traditions and the legal profession, the extraordinary cross-class solidarity in Parliament, and religion (particularly dissenting Protestantism) as a mobilizing force. Protestantism also played a major role in Denmark, he argues, in that it produced a literate peasantry capable of mobilizing in the defense of its own interests.</p>
<p>In the final section of the book, Fukuyama sums up the theoretical payoff of his vast tour through time and space and gives a brief preview of things to come in Volume Two. Somewhat disappointingly, however, he mostly reiterates the <italic>premises</italic> with which he started his inquiry to begin with: the biological basis of politics, the importance of ideas and of historical accidents and the ever-lurching danger of political “decay” either due to our biological proclivities toward nepotism and conservatism or to the strength of vested interests. Fukuyama warns us repeatedly that his is not “a genuine predictive theory, since outcomes are the result of so many interlocking factors” (p. 438). Fair enough. But a couple of pan-human proclivities plus a lot of historical accident does not really amount to much of a theory at all.</p>
<p>Moreover, the said proclivities turn out to do remarkably little of the explanatory work in Fukuyama’s accounts and where they do, they are not particularly original. I have no difficulty in principle with the proposition that institutions will tend to backslide towards patrimonialism “in the absence of other norms and incentives” (p. 450). But this does not strike me as a particularly novel observation. The question is whether we can say something more interesting about the conditions under which such “other norms and incentives” are successfully created and maintained—and Fukuyama has precious little to say on this. When it comes to the one major case of “decay” due to institutional rigidity, the case of the French <italic>ancien régime</italic> being unable to reform itself, the causal mechanism turns out not to be our innate conservatism but a set of well-entrenched vested interests successfully blocking all major attempts at reform. This may be perfectly plausible but only because we have heard it so many times before, from precisely those rational choice theorists, among others, that Fukuyama heaps scorn upon at every opportunity he gets. Ideas, finally, surely matter, but how and when? There has been a growing consensus on this point among sociologists, political scientists, and even economists—but neither they nor Fukuyama have moved much beyond this starting point so far.</p>
<p>Finally, his explanation for the rise of accountable government in Northwestern Europe invokes precisely the same “social” factors—those to which processes of political development were not supposed to be reducible—that were the mainstay of the more carefully argued explanations offered by the likes of Barrington Moore and Michael Mann. The former is not cited at all by Fukuyama and the latter only once in connection with a secondary point. This is all the more stunning since Mann’s <italic>The Sources of Social Power</italic> covered almost exactly the same territory as Fukuyama does. In fact, for someone seeking to “recover something of the tradition of nineteenth-century historical sociology” (p. 24) Fukuyama displays painfully little familiarity with that tradition or its present-day heirs. He mentions Parsons once, as an exponent of the modernization theory that Huntington helped in “killing off,” and refers to him as “Weber’s protégé.” Durkheim, together with Marx, stands accused of claiming that religions were <italic>deliberately</italic> created for the purpose of binding communities together.</p>
<p>But then, this is clearly not a book intended for an audience of professional social scientists, much less specialists. The reader will find none of the careful weighing of the historical evidence for and against particular explanations that characterize the work of Moore or Mann. Fukuyama argues by means of anecdotes, hand-picked examples, and plain proclamations. This makes the book a relatively easy read, to be sure, but not a work of social science.</p>
