<abstract>
<p>A presidential administration transition is a crucial time for establishing an effective governance style and reflects the president’s own personality. Presidents are concerned with building a coherent, cohesive team as they move from their electoral victory to implementing their vision for the country through legislative successes. A successful president displays an entrepreneurial mind-set as he proceeds throughout his 1st year to achieve early legislative victories, which establish the president as an effective president. This entrepreneurial approach requires cold-blooded politics and eschews inordinate concern for individuals, issues, and policies, and, this entrepreneurial approach is predicated on nimble governance and shrewd implementation. Nimble governance is choosing among alternative priorities, avoiding blunders, and maneuvering in the face of opposition. Shrewd implementation results in a few, carefully selected initiatives that are announced early, lobbied energetically, enacted swiftly, and executed boldly. These criteria are applied to the inaugural year of the Clinton presidency.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Assessing the success of any president is an endeavor fraught with difficulties. The period of a transition is perhaps even more complex as the scope of actors involved complicates the analysis. Yet, by studying the transition period, we may draw insights into how generally successful presidents established a successful administration, how unsuccessful presidents weakened their administration from their earliest decisions, and how those presidents who stumbled early, yet were able to learn from their mistakes, managed to right their administration to achieve their legislative priorities.</p>
<p>While accepting that a transition begins with the electoral victory, no comparable day exists for marking the termination of the transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1056492611423424">Walker &amp; Roepel, 1986</xref>). Assessing success in presidential transitions requires establishing the length of the transition. Popular mileposts frequently cited are the period from election to swearing in or through the president’s first 100 days. Noting the raft of initiatives during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s inaugural 1933 administration, journalists compared that administration’s efforts to the 100 days of Napoleon’s campaign after escaping Elba—a period where Napoleon rallied his army, regained Paris, restored his monarchy, fought all of Europe until defeated at Waterloo, and abdicated his crown again. With the Rooseveltian comparison, Americans have appropriated the 100-day period as an unofficial benchmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1056492611423424">Neustadt, 2001</xref>). Yet, the 100-day mark is too short a period to accurately assess how well prepared a president is for his 4-year period of governance.</p>
<p>For this study, the period examined is from election through the end of the 1st year in office. This period was selected as it provides sufficient time to observe the president and his advisors shifting from a campaign mode to a governance mind-set; this almost always involves efforts to heal political wounds within the winning political party and to reach out to the Washington elite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1056492611423424">M. J. Kumar, 2008b</xref>). Decisions must be made on priorities, policies, and appointees. The inaugural address, which defines the incoming administration’s aspirations, is delivered and shapes and influences the 1st year of effort. From appointees, to supporters, to bureaucrats, to other elected party officials, and even to the loyal opposition, this address informs the actions taken during the inaugural year. Finally, at the end of the inaugural year, the administration has experienced the full cycle of the Washington political year, and thus, routines to handle political, economic, and social issues have been established; excluding crises, the administration has established its tenor for dealing with issues. Thus, we believe that this 1st year of governance provides a sufficiently robust period to examine a presidential transition without being too short in which to draw any useful insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1056492611423424">Walker &amp; Roepel, 1986</xref>). Using the full inaugural year provides a basis for comparison and extends somewhat past the traditional “honeymoon” period that newly elected presidents enjoy as the public watches the president’s early actions and the opposition is still assessing how to counter the new executive’s popularity and policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1056492611423424">Neustadt, 2001</xref>). Carter’s honeymoon, by most estimates, lasted until September of his 1st year; Reagan’s also lasted until September; and, George H. W. Bush’s appeared to last until late in his 2nd year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056492611423424">Jones, 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1056492611423424">
<title>Judging the Success of Transitions</title>
<p>The criteria on which the success of a transition is judged are elusive. One can judge a new administration by the efficiency of the machinery deployed to promote decisions and actions, by the prompt appointment of capable executives to steer the government effectively and fairly, by how well the administration satisfies its many claimants, or by whether the president and his staff are translating his campaign rhetoric into successful legislative proposals and effectively implementing his policies and programs. We feel that none of these criteria are complete by themselves. In other words, the criteria are essential but not sufficient in assessing efficacy.</p>
<p>The reality of U.S. politics and the peculiarities of the presidency guarantee that each of these defensible ideals is insufficient. Every administration wishes for, and strives to, affect efficient machinery and appoint capable executives. The striving for an efficient transition, though, is more a bureaucratic virtue than a democratic value. Although capable executives are available, the necessity to weigh the appointees’ political skills, balance multiple competing constituent groups when selecting various political appointees, and still have someone who can lead his or her department in line with the president’s vision presents challenges. Many times, it is only after numerous years have elapsed that the capability of a particular appointee can even be evaluated.</p>
<p>A hopeless task for all politicians, much less a president, is satisfying all the interested political claimants in the extended government community. It is impossible for a president to attempt to reconcile the many interests that extend from federal employees out to the legions of interest groups and lobbyists extending further into diplomatic missions and beyond to the state and local governments. Holding any administration to its campaign platform is to argue that national leaders are omniscient, that their preliminary proposals on new policy initiatives and programs are invariably correct, and that presidents and their advisors cannot learn from their campaigns. Campaign initiatives are similar to war plans. In battle, it is often said that plans do not survive the first shock of combat, and campaign promises are too often altered by the impact of political and budgetary limitations. Thus, defining the national interest is a hopeless injunction. Furthermore, domestic and international events are impossible to predict, new issues emerge, and circumstances change. From this, it is apparent that if we ask of presidents to deliver only what they have promised, they are doomed to fail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1056492611423424">Walker, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering the above discussion, what then is a sensible standard of success for presidential transitions? We argue that the new chief executive should act with vision, foresight, and an understanding of how to meet competing constituencies’ needs—in other words, deft political leadership and management. One of the earliest of political philosophers, Niccolo Machiavelli, believed a leader needed an analytical attitude unencumbered by a sense of shame or guilt. Successful political management required a leader to control, rather than be victimized by, events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1056492611423424">Deluga, 2001</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1056492611423424">Machiavelli (1910)</xref> articulated a vision of political leadership and management:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A Prince should know how to use the beast’s nature wisely, he ought of beasts to choose both the lion and the fox; for the lion cannot guard himself from the toils, nor the fox from wolves. He must therefore be a fox to discern toils, and a lion to drive off wolves.</p>
<p>To rely wholly on the lion is unwise; and for this reason a prudent Prince neither can nor ought to keep his word when to keep it is hurtful to him and the causes which led him to pledge it are removed. (p. 60)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A successful president understands and deploys nimble governance, the lion, and shrewd implementation, the fox. Nimble governance is a concept frequently cited (although having little agreement as to its specific meaning) in literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056492611423424">Bronfman, Lehn, &amp; Schwartz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056492611423424">Chernoff, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1056492611423424">Lehn, Patro, &amp; Zhao, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1056492611423424">Santiso, 2004</xref>). Some have defined political leaders who use nimble governance as follows: makes and implements better decisions, faster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1056492611423424">Thornbury, 2003</xref>); focuses high-level attention, coordinates policy responses, and builds momentum for action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1056492611423424">Patrick, 2010</xref>); is capable of implementing and enforcing policy reform and has an accountable bureaucracy responsive to shifts in policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1056492611423424">Santiso, 2003</xref>); and facilitates rapid decision making and redeployment of assets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1056492611423424">Sun, Lan, &amp; Ma, 2009</xref>). Drawing on these preceding definitions and the inchoate usage found in most of the academic literature, we define nimble governance as choosing among alternative priorities, avoiding mistakes, successfully maneuvering in the face of overwhelming opposition, persuading supporters, and appeasing opponents in Congress. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1056492611423424">Table 1</xref> provides a list of the characteristics of nimble governance and shrewd implementation.</p>

<p>Concomitantly, shrewd implementation often has been invoked in the literature, although again in a manner of common understanding rather than specific definition (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1056492611423424">Robertson, 1989</xref>). When more fully articulated, shrewd implementation has been discussed as “adroitness required for the proper understanding of its applicability, suitability, and credibility” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1056492611423424">P. Kumar, 2006</xref>, p. 3); energetic action that neutralizes or splits opposition to desired policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1056492611423424">Pratt, 1982</xref>); careful study, patient determination, calculated coalition building, and meticulous reflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1056492611423424">Freshwater, 2007</xref>); and an assessment of the potential political costs and benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1056492611423424">Robinson, 2007</xref>). Again, building on the above discussion, we define shrewd implementation as announcing new policies and programs early, lobbying new initiatives energetically, enacting them swiftly, and executing them boldly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056492611423424">Brody &amp; Page, 1975</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-1056492611423424">
<title>Nimble Governance</title>
<p>Drawing on the framework discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1056492611423424">Walker’s (1993)</xref> examination of the transitions of the Carter, Reagan, and George H. W. Bush transitions, we will begin by examining the issues of nimble governance and shrewd implementation.</p>
<p>In all transitions, newly elected presidents make specific choices from their litany of campaign promises. Every campaign promise cannot be proposed and enacted during the transition, much less within the 4 years of a presidential term. The strategic executive looks to the future of the administration as a marathon to be endured and completed rather than a sprint to be won. A sage president will select several dominant issues and focus on them; perhaps six or seven more may be championed by the new president’s cabinet heads or shepherded by the president’s party through Congress with little more than the president’s blessing. The nation does expect that the new president’s focus in office will be similar to his focus during his campaign. Yet, we should also anticipate that the actual details of new policies and programs will be modified by a new president’s interaction with the electorate and by his confrontation with domestic and international realities; however, a successful president cannot allow a dissonance to arise between his stated goals for the administration and the earliest confronted issues tackled by the administration.</p>
<p>Blunders must be cautiously sidestepped. Appointing administrators or promoting issues that ignite government and citizen opposition sap a new administration of its political capital. Adroit maneuvering is imperative in the success of any transition. Invariably, presidents and their advisors misjudge and underestimate their opponents particularly in the opening weeks of a new administration. New, successful administrations are agile in creating an environment of order and congeniality with the old and new centers of power within the government. Political missteps will occur to every administration, especially during the transitional period, and the most successful presidencies are adept at graceful exits from ill-considered misjudgments and are proficient at redirecting attention to new issues.</p>
<p>Acquiring supportive coalitions and disarming opponents are other important criteria for measuring successful presidential transitions. The president invariably faces a new Congress that is also in a state of transition and has its own priorities. Thus, the president’s early actions must be effective in co-opting others’ issues and support and then blending all into a coherent legislative agenda. His charisma, grace, and style are essential in reconciling his own party’s disaffected members and affiliated interest groups. Also requiring attention are the leaders of the opposition party, especially those in Congress, who also should be acknowledged, consulted for their concerns, and soothed. Once charmed, these members of his own party, the opposition, and powerful outsiders can then be enticed into coalitions that later must be constantly created, recast, and then recreated issue-by-issue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1056492611423424">
<title>Shrewd Implementation</title>
<p>Finally, a successful administration must see to the implementation of its agenda. Once priorities are selected, new policies must be designed and announced at the inauguration. Soon, thereafter, programs must be sent to Congress, and the coaxing, cajoling, and logrolling that characterize presidential–congressional negotiations begin. As noted previously, all administration initiatives cannot be enacted during the transition. Yet, if the administration is to retain the initiative, new policies must be announced and subsidiary programs enacted in the early months of the transition.</p>
<p>Overall, a creative attitude toward transitions and to the office of the presidency combines politics, policy, and administration. Nimble governance and shrewd implementation are necessary elements for any successful executive transition; for a presidential transition, they are crucial components. These two critical aspects of political management allow newly elected presidents to take risks for later success or “profit” in the ongoing negotiations of the presidential enterprise. Thus, governance and implementation require cold-blooded politics that forgo inordinate concern for specific individuals, issues, and policies, which might become an impediment to the incoming administration. Presidents must protect their reputation to provide effectiveness and freedom for maneuvering in the political arena. They must not squander these assets by protecting friends, advocating for issues not yet ready for action, or blindly promoting policies advocated by electoral allies.</p>
<p>The true mettle of the successful president managing politically is the ability to channel the nation’s mood while dealing with political proponent and opponent. A nonthreatening public style is crucial to success in the Byzantine maneuvering that characterizes workaday Washington. Thus, to be successful, the achievement-oriented, successful presidency is wrapped in an aura of authoritative competence and reassurance for easy acceptance by national elites and mass publics. Another key to successful transitions in a federalized democracy is the reputation, prowess, and political savvy of the president himself. Because he is the sole individual held accountable by the electorate for the national well-being, his agenda is the focus. Successful policy initiatives, which are also effectively implemented in this most disaggregated, and intransigent, political system are precious and, as such, to be celebrated by all.</p>
<p>Domestic and foreign issues define the criteria (i.e., nimble governance and shrewd implementation) through two lenses. Unquestionably, these realms require different levels of experience and confront new presidents with quite dissimilar demands. In the very complex arena of national security or foreign policy, continuity would seem to be warranted during the transition. On the international stage, the number of actors to be engaged is much greater than in domestic affairs. The subtleties and nuances of diplomacy are esoteric. Furthermore, the history and precedents of relationships with other nations and the many U.S. alliances are so extensive that any adjustment must be approached with the greatest consideration and care. In domestic affairs, the difficulties of movement are as great, but the pressures, the actors, the coalitions, and the precedents already set are more accessible and intelligible to incoming presidents and their administrations. Because the president and his advisers have, after all, been campaigning throughout the nation during the preceding months, domestic issues are better understood. For most presidents, foreign policy is indeed foreign and often inchoate at the beginning of the presidential administration. Yet in the end, new policies must be initiated in the foreign and domestic arenas during the transition, or the president is likely to be overwhelmed by the priorities of those outside the White House (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1056492611423424">Light, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>To summarize, successful transitions require the development of an astute political management approach on the part of the president. Newly elected presidents in democratic political systems must present themselves as effective national leaders using a blend of the nimble lion and the shrewd fox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056492611423424">Burns, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1056492611423424">Walker, 1993</xref>). How rapidly, well, and early a newly elected president masters the nuances of executing his office influences the successes of his entire term in office. To some extent, the period from election through the completion of the inaugural year may be viewed as a political and entrepreneurial venture in that the president, having never exercised such great and vast political power, must develop and articulate a national agenda during the campaign, convince voters to select it by electing him, and then learn the levers of Washington power to execute the new venture on which the president campaigned. In other words, a newly elected president must use his transition and inaugural year so that he may develop adroit political leadership and management skills to position himself to be able to exploit the entirety of his political term in executing his political agenda. We now focus on one specific presidential transition.</p>

<sec id="section5-1056492611423424">
<title>Assessing a Presidential Transition</title>
<p>Having established these criteria, we will briefly apply them to the Clinton transition. This recent Democratic Party presidential transition exemplified interparty change as Clinton’s administration succeeded 12 years of Republican Party control of the executive branch. We will assess this transition in terms of nimble governance and shrewd implementation. We will also consider whether we found a leader who managed to be both a lion and a fox.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton assumed the mantle of president-elect in November 1992 after defeating the soon-to-be one-term President George H. W. Bush. The election had been a hard-fought contest between three major contenders (H. Ross Perot was the first credible, national, third-party candidate in decades) and had revolved around issues of economy and jobs. The United States was beginning to emerge from a recession, and there was a national debate over the wisdom of entering into a free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. Unlike most previous presidents, Clinton could claim little mandate to establish a different course for the nation as he had won only 43% of the popular vote; yet, he was well positioned to implement the policies on which he had campaigned as the Democratic Party controlled both the House of Representatives and the Senate. As noted by historian John Burke, Clinton had “an obvious skill in ‘campaigning for policy’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056492611423424">Burke, 2000</xref>, p. 6). Thus, the Democrats were eager for Clinton to set the agenda for the nation, and he appeared ready for the challenge of directing legislative victories after running such a disciplined and focused campaign.</p>
<p>The promise of a new direction was quickly tempered by the numerous missteps of the president-elect. The missteps were so frequent and so public that his transition is generally viewed as undisciplined and unfocused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056492611423424">Burke, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056492611423424">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1056492611423424">M. J. Kumar, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1056492611423424">Maranto, 2004</xref>). In examining presidential transitions, Burke noted that the “Clinton presidency did not hit the ground running; it stumbled out of the blocks in worse shape than any modern presidency. Even Jimmy Carter looks accomplished by comparison—no small feat” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056492611423424">Burke, 2000</xref>, p. 6). The evident chaos of the transition lacked political nimbleness and shrewdness and was saved only by the grace of the honeymoon period all new chief executives are fortunate to experience. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1056492611423424">Table 2</xref> highlights Clinton’s political management skills (i.e., nimble governance and shrewd implementation) in his inaugural year.</p>

<p>Determined to have a cabinet that reflected the diversity of America, Clinton and his small inner circle concentrated on the selection of his team. The extreme focus on his cabinet officers detracted from any deep thinking about the players and processes that he would employ within his own White House staff to achieve his legislative priorities. Clinton even acknowledged in his own autobiography that he hardly spent any time on White House staff member selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1056492611423424">Clinton, 2004</xref>), and the <italic>New York Times</italic> observed that the “skeletal transition board has only met twice and is still trying to work out a time-table to present to Mr. Clinton for his most important transition decisions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056492611423424">Friedman, 1992</xref>, p. A1).</p>
<p>The lack of engagement with the organization of his staff was most obvious with the procrastination in naming a chief of staff. With the election date decided as November 3, it was not until mid-December that he announced that Mack McLarty would serve in the position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492611423424">Wellford, 2008</xref>). A childhood friend of unquestionable loyalty, McLarty would prove to be ill-equipped to handle the complexities of operating within the political sphere of Washington, D.C. His inexperience as a staff member (he was a <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 company CEO), combined with his lack of political insight, and desire to play the role of honest broker impeded his ability to effectively control and direct the White House staff and serve Clinton. The selection of such a poor choice as chief of staff reflected directly on the president-elect’s haphazard decision-making style.</p>
<p>Even with his chief of staff in place, Clinton procrastinated further on selecting members of his White House staff. It was not until 5 days prior to the inauguration that Clinton named his senior staff members, which resulted in no one being familiar with their new positions or having the opportunity to ask their outgoing predecessors questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1056492611423424">M. J. Kumar, 2008b</xref>). The Presidential Records Act of 1978 requires the outgoing presidential records depart with the exiting administration (with the exception of the White House Counsel’s office and the National Security Council); thus, there was no institutional memory waiting the incoming administration staff. As a result, they floundered on their roles and responsibilities, and struggled with the issues facing them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492611423424">M. J. Kumar, 2008a</xref>). The late selection of White House staff severely disrupted early coordination of policy initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492611423424">Wellford, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Though he did overlook the value that his own staff would bring to the success of his legislative agenda, Clinton’s intense focus on building the best cabinet possible did not materialize as expected. The goal of having 500 to 600 appointees in place by the end of the first 100 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056492611423424">Bruce, 1996</xref>) was unrealistic, and Clinton’s team succeeded in having only 42 confirmed by that time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492611423424">M. J. Kumar, 2008a</xref>). Early successful decisions quickly morphed into bad choices. Richard Riley, the former governor of South Carolina, was placed in charge of personnel operations and Warren Christopher, a trade negotiator for Kennedy and State Department official for Carter, was selected as the transition director. By naming his personnel director as secretary of education, he may have made a shrewd decision for the cabinet position; however, the choice hampered the nascent administration’s ability to prepare itself to govern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492611423424">M. J. Kumar, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1056492611423424">Maranto, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492611423424">Wellford, 2008</xref>). Burke quotes one transition staff member stating,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The personnel process was a complete disaster. They put Dick Riley in charge of it and then named him secretary of education. And he immediately moved out of it, and that deteriorated into a complete mess; it was just chaos . . . there were no real people with experience running it. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056492611423424">Burke, 2000</xref>, p. 295)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The problem of preparing to govern was exacerbated when Warren Christopher was named to be secretary of state. Both men removed themselves from their transition jobs while the administration was still in transition to prepare themselves for their Senate confirmation proceedings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1056492611423424">Wellford (2008)</xref>, White House transition advisor to president-elect Clinton, stated that the transition was “crippled” by the departure of the two key transition leaders.</p>
<p>Clinton wanted a cabinet that reflected the diversity of the United States, from a gender and a racial perspective, and, it was in his next cabinet selections that he experienced the first scandal of his administration (starting even before being sworn into office). Women’s rights groups agitated for a woman to be selected for one of the big four cabinet positions (i.e., State, Defense, Justice, and Treasury). Clinton announced his cabinet secretaries along with appropriate counterparts in various councils (e.g., secretary of defense with members of the National Security Council). As he named his State Department team, Defense Department team, and Economic team with men all taking the secretary positions, the pressure was increased on Clinton to name a woman to be attorney general. In selecting someone to serve as his attorney general, Clinton was neither shrewd nor nimble.</p>
<p>When his first choice, Zoe Baird, was named as attorney general–designate, many perceived that Clinton was a weak executive who could be pressured into making particular decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056492611423424">Burke, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492611423424">Drew, 1994</xref>). The supposed weakness, however, paled as Baird’s nomination ran into a political firestorm over her employing an illegal child care worker and family driver. The two employees were illegal immigrants, and Baird had failed to pay social security taxes on the individuals’ salaries. Clinton’s team did not appreciate the political sensitivities that would arise with the revelation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492611423424">M. J. Kumar, 2008a</xref>). The political tide was turning against his nominee, yet he refused to withdraw her name and only relented the day after his inauguration when Senate Democratic leaders informed him that she could not be confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492611423424">Drew, 1994</xref>). George Stephanopoulos recognized the administration’s lack of political sensitivity as he commented on the Baird nomination, “We should have never let Baird’s nomination get as far as it did, but our systems failed us at every crucial step” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1056492611423424">Stephanopoulos, 1999</xref>, p. 118).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the systems proved little better when, in early February, Clinton’s team leaked to the press that Kimba Wood, a federal district court judge, was the new nominee for attorney general. Realizing that Wood’s similar problem with an illegal immigrant as a child care worker would generate a new firestorm, President Clinton withdrew her nomination. Regrettably, the administration had again demonstrated its lack of political sophistication and management skills. Reviewing Clinton’s first 100 days in office, a <italic>New York Times</italic> editorial likened the search for an attorney general to being “snakebit” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492611423424">“Bill Clinton’s hundred days,” 1993</xref>). The president did not have his attorney general sworn in until March 12, 1993, when Florida State attorney general Janet Reno finally took the oath of office.</p>
<p>The search for a confirmable attorney general was not Clinton’s only evidence of political blindness in the Justice Department. A holdover from President George H. W. Bush’s administration was directing the department because Webb Hubble, a former law partner of Hillary Clinton and slated to be the Number 2 official in Justice, was slow in getting confirmed. He noted that, “the media began focusing on what they called a leadership vacuum at Justice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1056492611423424">Hubbell, 1997</xref>, p. 185). A few months into the administration, another appointment political crisis erupted. Lani Guinier was nominated to be head of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department. A law professor, she had written academic articles concerning racial discrimination. The articles proved to be controversial, and she was dubbed a “Quota Queen” by <italic>The Wall Street Journal</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1056492611423424">Bolick, 1993</xref>). After the controversy erupted, Clinton read the controversial articles for himself, felt he could no longer support her nomination, and withdrew it. Senator Joe Lieberman, a Democrat from Connecticut, reflected on the haphazard vetting of Clinton’s nominees by his White House staff and stated, “If they didn’t know [about her academic articles], they did a bum job of review. If they did know and didn’t stop the nomination, their judgment is off” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492611423424">Drew, 1994</xref>, p. 206).</p>
<p>Though he stumbled badly during his transition period, Clinton had reassured the nation that he would remain focused on his campaign agenda. He created the National Economic Council and announced it at a December press conference. Shortly afterward, in mid-December, he held a 2-day economic conference that demonstrated his attention to the U.S. economy. Citizens wanted the new president to succeed, and shortly after assuming the office, his poll numbers revealed 58% approved of his job performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492611423424">M. J. Kumar, 2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>Clinton’s agenda was broad. Reviving the economy was his primary focus with both a stimulus and deficit reduction program to be proposed. He intended to comprehensively reform health care—a plan would be before Congress within the first 100 days. Welfare would be overhauled. He would present to the legislature college-loan and the AmeriCorps community-service proposals. Vice President Gore would have his reinventing government program presented to Congress. Clinton proposed community development banks and enterprise zones. He failed to understand that he needed to focus on a few major projects at a time and not try to do everything in his 1st year. During the transition period, Bruce Lindsey, a Clinton advisor, noted that, “We had no time line before we came in. No one sat down and said, ‘if you do A, B, C is your plate too full?’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492611423424">Drew, 1994</xref>, p. 36). At the 100-day mark, some in Clinton’s administration were questioning whether far too much had been heaped onto the legislative plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1056492611423424">“Bill Clinton’s hundred days,” 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Besides lacking the shrewdness to ensure that nominees were picked early and were confirmable, Clinton was also not nimble. A campaign speech that advocated allowing homosexuals to serve in the military to a gay and lesbian group had drawn little interest. That changed when a reporter asked Clinton if he intended to work on changing defense policy now that he was president (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1056492611423424">M. J. Kumar, 2008a</xref>). Clinton was not well briefed on the issue and his poorly considered comments alienated vital constituencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1056492611423424">Mathews, 1993</xref>). Not sufficiently appraised on the complexity of the issue, Clinton and his administration were not prepared for the weeks of negative political coverage. The controversy became so heated that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, during a speech at the Naval Academy, advised that if military officers found the plan morally unconscionable, they should resign. Congressional ire increased, and it became apparent that Congress might override any executive order that Clinton might issue. His poorly staffed comments, in the 1st month of his administration, generated a crisis in civil–military relationships. To defuse the situation, Clinton referred the issue to his secretary of defense, Les Aspin, to study for 6 months. The new policy of “Don’t ask. Don’t tell” quieted the furor, but no one was satisfied, and Clinton had once again demonstrated that he was ill-attuned to political sensitivities. William Waybourn, director of Victory Fund, a political action committee raising funds for gay and lesbian political candidates, commented on the ill-timed and needless distraction of the subject, “The whole issue was very costly. Basically, it took a new administration and dropped it on its head for three months . . . And what did we have? Nothing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1056492611423424">Yeager, 1999</xref>, p. 205) Clinton lost 20 points in his favorability rating in the first 2 weeks of his presidency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056492611423424">Drew, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The new president did demonstrate some adroitness in his actions. Having campaigned on reviving the economy, he wanted his budget to set a new path. Clinton sought to accomplish three things with his first budget: (a) a stimulus program, (b) human capital investment, and (c) a deficit reduction program. Unfortunately, poor legislative liaison with the Senate after the plan had passed the house resulted in the stimulus dying as the White House felt no need to accept a moderate compromise with Republican Senators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1056492611423424">Stephanopoulos, 1999</xref>). Jobs training and education essentially met the same fate when Clinton learned that a 1990 legislative budget agreement had established spending caps through 1995 that limited these programs to less than a paltry US$1 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1056492611423424">Reich, 1997</xref>). Yet, he was able to steer his US$1.5 trillion budget outline through in record time, and it passed in August, although it required Vice President Gore’s tie-breaking vote in the Senate after squeaking through the House 218-216.</p>
<p>One notable legislative accomplishment steered through Congress was the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Unfortunately, the Kimba Wood nomination had cratered, and Wood’s statement to the press was released the same day as Clinton was to sign the FMLA into law. Thus, Clinton’s successes were too frequently overshadowed by his stumbles. His administration demonstrated little of the adroitness of his campaign.</p>
<p>Clinton’s political judgment continued to be questionable through his 1st year in office in small and great matters. A US$200 haircut onboard Air Force One as the aircraft sat on the Los Angeles International tarmac reportedly delayed other planes and generated another firestorm that had nothing to do with Clinton’s ability to govern. The campaign promise to reduce the White House staff by 25% became an embarrassment as Clinton’s team was unable to accurately determine how many people worked on the staff and then indicated that it might not be achievable at all. The reductions that were attempted had the appearance of ham-handed political firings such as the 20-person reduction in the White House correspondence unit and wholesale firing of the White House travel staff. A success for Clinton that he achieved was the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Opposed by a majority of Democrats, Clinton succeeded in getting the bill passed with Republican support. Although he had campaigned as a “New Democrat,” questions arose about how successful a president could be who worked against his party.</p>
<p>The minor embarrassments paled in comparison with the political missteps on one of his signature campaign efforts: comprehensive health care reform. Originally, the proposed legislation was to be presented to Congress by May. The complexity of the health care reform led to the date slipping to July, and then it slipped again to September. The decision to place his wife, Hillary Clinton, in charge of the reform effort was not well received by all legislators, and she failed to keep Congress informed, thereby alienating many members. Eventually, the health care reform effort was put off until 1994. Like health care, welfare reform, which was on the agenda for 1993, had to be shifted to a later date. Clinton’s inaugural year closed with a signature event; on November 30, 1993, he signed into law the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which instituted for the first time the requirement for background checks prior to firearm purchases.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The transition of a presidential administration is a crucial time for establishing an effective governance style and reflects the president’s own personality. Presidents are correctly concerned with building a coherent and cohesive team as they seek to move from their electoral victory to implementing their vision for the country through legislative successes. A successful president will display a political leadership and management mind-set as he proceeds throughout his 1st year, the inaugural year, to achieve early legislative victories. We have argued that this political management approach requires cold-blooded politics and eschews inordinate concern for specific individuals, issues, and policies; this political management approach is predicated on nimble governance and shrewd implementation. Presidents must preserve their reputation for effectiveness and their room for maneuver. Nimble governance is choosing among alternative priorities, avoiding blunders, and successfully maneuvering in the face of opposition. Shrewd implementation results in a few, carefully selected initiatives that are announced early, lobbied energetically, enacted swiftly, and executed boldly.</p>
<p>This study applied the preceding criteria to the inaugural year of the Clinton presidency. Clinton did not display a deft political management style in his 1st year in office. Although he had some significant legislative victories in his 1st year in office, such as NAFTA, FMLA, and the Brady Bill, Clinton stumbled more than most of his predecessors. He was neither nimble in extricating himself from untenable positions nor shrewd in positioning himself to successfully sell his agenda to Congress or the American people. His unfocused and undisciplined decision-making style, commencing with the indecision in naming his chief of staff during the transition, would reverberate throughout his 1st year in office. Indeed, Clinton’s transition year was a year marked and marred by avoidable missteps. Clinton would gain a successful executive footing only with the naming of a new chief of staff in 1994 and the takeover of the House and Senate by the Republican Party during midterm elections that year. These events forced the Clinton White House to find discipline and focus. Though the inaugural year was rocky, at the end of Clinton’s full first term, Americans elected him to another term (the first Democrat to serve two, full elected terms since Franklin D. Roosevelt [1932-1945]).</p>
<p>During Clinton’s full first term, the economy began what would turn out to be the strongest period of growth in U.S. history. Unemployment declined from 7.4% when he was elected in November 1992 to 5.4% when he was reelected in 1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1056492611423424">St. Louis Federal Reserve, 2011</xref>). Unable to push through his policy initiatives in the second half of his first term (welfare reform was the last major policy initiative win of his first term), he increased his presidential stature as he successfully countered the Republican legislative initiatives. In a budget battle with the Republican-controlled Congress during the winter of 1995/1996, the last year of Clinton’s first term, the Republicans were perceived by the electorate as the instigators of the federal government shutdown, which rebounded to Clinton’s increasing popularity. Thus, for Clinton, a stumbling inaugural year with noted legislative accomplishments was followed by 3 years of deft political management and only limited further accomplishments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1056492611423424">Burns &amp; Sorenson, 2000</xref>, criticized Clinton for not advocating for significant policy changes after the debacle of Hillary Clinton’s health care plan in 1994). Had Clinton used more nimble governance and shrewd implementation during his inaugural year and not attempted to put health care reform into a too long list of 1st-year priorities, he might have been able to build the political coalitions necessary to pass health care reform. Yet, with the debacle of health care reform behind him, the economic rebound that continued to grow throughout his presidency significantly contributed to Clinton’s reelection and public perception of a successful presidency (notwithstanding the mistakes and missteps of the inaugural year). With the ever-strengthening economy, the voters of 1996 decided that Clinton had indeed remained focused on the right issue as he promised with his 1992 campaign slogan, “It’s the Economy, Stupid.”</p>
<p>This article offers the opportunity for further research on understanding the nuances of political management for executives ascending to the most senior position within a complex organization and learning how to structure the administration and deploy the resources so that they may establish an early record of success. This case has specifically examined a governmental organization. We leave it to others to examine the differences that leaders of nonprofit organizations or for-profit enterprises face in persuading multiple, competing constituencies.</p>
