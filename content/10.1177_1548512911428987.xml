<p>The foundational concept of Network Enabled Capability relies on effective, timely information sharing. This information is used in analysis, trade and scenario studies, and ultimately decision making. In this paper, the concept of <italic>visual analytics</italic> is explored as an enabler to facilitate rapid, defensible and superior decision making. By coupling analytical reasoning with the exceptional human capability to rapidly internalize and understand visual data, visual analytics allows individual and collaborative decision making to occur in the face of vast and disparate data, time pressures and uncertainty. An example visual analytics framework is presented in the form of a decision-making environment centered on the Lockheed C-5A and C-5M aircraft. This environment allows rapid trade studies to be conducted on design, logistics and capability within the aircraft’s operational roles. Through this example, the use of a visual analytics decision-making environment within a military environment is demonstrated.</p>

<title>1. Introduction and motivation</title>
<p>In today’s modern warfighting environment, decision makers are faced with an increasingly complex and challenging task. They must take large amounts of often disparate data and <italic>synthesize</italic> it into a meaningful whole. They then must <italic>analyze</italic> the data, including the consideration of consequences, alternatives and uncertainty, both in the data and their conclusions. Finally, they must apply <italic>human judgment</italic> to conclude, propose and communicate potential outcomes. Often these decision makers must do this in the face of political considerations, time pressure and unknown or incomplete data.</p>
<p>Within the context of Network Enabled Capability (NEC), good decision making is critical to success. The foundational principle of NEC relies on effective and timely information sharing between all key entities, in order to provide an enhanced military capability. This enhanced military capability is characterized by such indicators as improvements in situational awareness, increased effectiveness of command and control, better and faster management and delivery of logistics supply chain and greater precision and speed in delivery of appropriate force.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548512911428987">1</xref></sup> Each of these rely on effective, timely and appropriate decision making. Decision making relies, in turn, on the effective and timely sharing of information.</p>
<p>While conceptually simple, the implementation of this information sharing is laden with considerable challenges. The first of these is the vastly disparate types of information that are generated from a wide variety of sources. Textual data, data provided in written form, is extremely plentiful and comes from such sources as documents, newspapers, email and webpages. Textual data is also a common information form provided by subject matter experts (SMEs). Databases, on the other hand, represent an organized collection of information, usually for a specific purpose. As such, it may or may not be straightforward to retrieve and analyze the relevant pieces of data necessary for a particular analysis. Image and video data are often provided via satellite and other media means, and can be difficult to interpret and combine with other data forms. Finally, sensor data is that information provided by myriad sensor technologies, and can represent characteristics such as location, temperature, light, temporal features and radiation. Combining these very different types of data and extracting meaningful relationships and conclusions from them can be extremely challenging.</p>
<p>In addition to the different types of information that exist, the sheer quantity of information is an issue. Studies show that in 2002, the world produced 5 exabytes of new, stored physical data (print, film, magnetic and optical) and close to 18 exabytes of streaming data in the form of telephone, radio, television and the internet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548512911428987">2</xref></sup> Predicted growth rates for the generation of new data at the time of the study were 30% per year. The University of California, Berkeley and the International Data Corporation (IDC) had estimated that by 2010 the amount of digital data produced annually would be of the order of 1 ZB. Addressing the audience at the C4ISR Journal Conference in October 2009, Air Force Lt. Gen. David Deptula said, ‘In the not-too-distance future, we’ll be swimming in sensors and drowning in data’. Finding the useful, relevant nuggets of information for a particular analysis in this massive amount of data is a challenging and multi-dimensional task.</p>
<p>Finally, the quality of the information that is to be shared must be thoroughly understood. What defines ‘good’ data must be articulated in the context of the particular analysis, as well as determining when information should be discarded or ignored. The sources of the data need to be considered and assessed for reliability and timeliness. Perceived or known uncertainty in the data must be evaluated and presented appropriately.</p>
<p>It is not, however, enough to rely solely on the sharing of information to induce effective decision making. Decision making is an outcome of <italic>analysis</italic>, which is a critical component of <italic>analytical reasoning</italic>. Analysis is generally understood to be the process by which something is studied to determine its fundamental characteristics and to gain insights into its underlying relationships. To do this, analysts engage in analytical tasks such as assessment, forecasting, developing options and pattern recognition. In addition, analysts use a variety of analytical techniques, such as diagnostic, contrarian and imaginative thinking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548512911428987">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Regardless of the analytic technique or task, the ultimate outcome of analysis is meant to be a judgment (or set of judgments) about a particular subject. This judgment is achieved through a reasoning process that includes proper consideration of all relative information. In addition, analysts make, test and examine assumptions, and explore alternatives. By its nature, analysis is an iterative process, with certain chains of reasoning leading to the development of further issues that need exploring, and often producing new information that then needs to be considered. Often analysis is enhanced when conducted within a collaborative environment, allowing an amalgamation of interpretations and judgments. The result of all of this is meant to be a defensible, reasonable and supportable judgment upon which effective and successful decisions may be made.</p>
<p>The emerging field of <italic>visual analytics</italic> has recently been considered as a key enabler for decision making under data-intensive situations such as those discussed above. Defined as ‘the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548512911428987">4</xref></sup> visual analytics is most often discussed in the context of large, complex systems. Developing a visual analytics framework for such a complex system can be daunting, however. Issues such as data use and data reduction, scalability of both software and visual systems and the incorporation of new and developing technology and ideas can lead to implementation challenges. In addition, overcoming familiarity bias can be difficult. Gaining acceptance for novel and innovative yet unfamiliar tools and processes, such as those represented by a new research field, and then convincing people to put those tools and processes into everyday use can be formidable, especially if it means transitioning to new ways of thinking. One way of overcoming the twin barriers of implementation and dissemination is to provide meaningful, representative examples that demonstrate the usefulness of a new toolset within a familiar context.</p>
<p>This paper presents one such representative example. A visual analytics environment was developed around the Lockheed C-5A and C-5M aircraft. Its original purpose was two-fold. The first was to create an environment to allow both engineers and top-level decision makers to rapidly conduct trade studies that compared the effectiveness of the C-5A and the C-5M, in order to support continued resource commitments to the C-5 modernization program. The second purpose in creating the environment was to demonstrate the usefulness of visual analytics tools for decision making and, through showcasing such an environment to a variety of potential users, allow them to become familiar with and proponents of such tools for future, more complex analysis. The C-5 comparison was chosen as an ideal example for this second purpose because it was a familiar, manageable example that nonetheless relied on the synthesis of a large amount of diverse data in order to draw conclusions. Many results would be intuitive, thus lending credibility to the tool itself, yet still the tool was used to provide some unexpected insight, demonstrating one of the advantages of a visual analytics environment. By showcasing a smaller, reasonable environment, users could extrapolate the usefulness of such a tool to more intricate analysis.</p>
<p>Likewise, the purpose of this paper is two-fold. The first is to expose the concept of visual analytics to a potentially new set of users, the military modeling community. Sufficient background and potential advantages and shortcomings of visual analytics are presented, designed to acquaint the unfamiliar reader with the basic concepts of this new decision-making capability. The second purpose is to present a small yet relevant, accessible example of a visual analytics framework. By demonstrating the interface and analytic capabilities of such a tool, understanding of the visual analytics process is enhanced. Extrapolations of the potential of visual analytics may thus be facilitated from the small vehicle-centered example here to the more complex systems that embody the NEC framework. The paper proceeds as follows. The history and emerging field of visual analytics is briefly described, and its relationship with traditional visualization and data mining techniques discussed. Dissemination is presented as a challenge of visual analytics, and the use of representative pilot deployments discussed. Next, an example of visual analytics is presented in the form of a decision-making environment centered on the Lockheed C-5A and C-5M aircraft. This environment allows rapid trade studies to be conducted on design, logistics and capability within the aircraft’s operational roles. Capabilities of the tool are briefly described, and trade study capabilities are discussed.</p>

<title>2. Visual analytics</title>
<p>When the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center occurred, they forced government agencies and emergency response teams to react in real time at a level that has since gone unparalleled. This involved trying to amass critical information (much of which was missing or simply unavailable), assessing a complex and rapidly changing situation and making decisions under extreme pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548512911428987">5</xref></sup> The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), established in 2003 in response to the attacks, took as its mission to secure the American homeland and protect the American people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548512911428987">6</xref></sup> In order to achieve this mission, the DHS further established goals and objectives that, in turn, identified key enablers in a variety of fields and disciplines that would facilitate the achievement of these goals. The emerging field of <italic>visual analytics</italic> was one such enabler. In 2004, the DHS chartered the National Visualization and Analytics Center (NVAC) to help with their overall anti-terrorist goals by leveraging their extensive experience as ‘a national and international resource providing strategic leadership and coordination for visual analytics technology and tools’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548512911428987">7</xref></sup> An underlying grand challenge that emerged from the attacks was<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548512911428987">4</xref></sup><disp-quote>
<p>…the analysis of overwhelming amounts of disparate, conflicting, and dynamic information to identify and prevent emerging threats, protect our borders, and respond in the event of an attack or other disaster. This analysis process requires human judgment to make the best possible evaluation of incomplete, inconsistent, and potentially deceptive information in the face of rapidly changing situations.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This grand challenge led directly to the NVAC’s major objective of defining a Research and Development agenda for visual analytics. The resulting document, <italic>Illuminating the path: the R&amp;D agenda for visual analytics</italic>, was published in 2005 and has become the definitive resource for the emerging field of visual analytics.</p>
<p>As defined in <italic>Illuminating the path</italic>, visual analytics is ‘the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces’. This deliberately vague definition was chosen to allow both broad research in a wide range of established areas and facilitate innovative and pioneering research into independent and unconventional research areas that were not otherwise covered in existing fields.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548512911428987">8</xref></sup> Although still considered a relatively new research area, visual analytics as a discipline has grown rapidly since its inception. In 2005, five university-led Regional Visualization and Analytics Centers (RVACs) were established at the University of North Carolina/Georgia Tech, Penn State University/Drexel University, Stanford University, Purdue University and the University of Washington to provide research, training and education programs in the emerging field.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548512911428987">9</xref></sup> In 2006, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) hosted the first international Symposium of Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST), which has since evolved into an annual conference.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548512911428987">10</xref></sup> Also in 2006 came the creation of the joint National Science Foundation (NSF) and DHS program on the Foundations of Data and Visual Analytics (FODAVA), which was renewed in 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548512911428987">11</xref></sup> Journals and magazines dedicated special issues to the exploration of emerging research and applications into visual analytics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548512911428987">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548512911428987"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548512911428987">14</xref></sup> Efforts such as these have paved the way for research into visual analytics, leading to hundreds of scientific publications in the area, patents specific to the field, demonstrations of applications and online books, all leading to<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548512911428987">8</xref></sup><disp-quote>
<p>…compelling evidence that the young visual analytics community has been able to gradually carve out its own signature areas and contribute to new and unique analytical reasoning applications.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As its definition infers, visual analytics is a hybrid science, combining visualization techniques with analytics. The human eye/brain interface has an extraordinary capability to rapidly recognize patterns and features, as well as anomalies, in extremely complex visual data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548512911428987">15</xref></sup> Leveraging this ability and coupling it with the analytical reasoning process allows information to be internalized more rapidly, theoretically leading to better and faster decisions. Visual analytics combines ‘the art of human intuition and the science of mathematical deduction to directly perceive patterns and derive knowledge and insight from them’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548512911428987">16</xref></sup> Visual analytics allows the decision maker to interface with and explore their data, to identify and understand trends, to identify emergent behavior and to organize information.</p>
<p>Coupling visual representations with analytical reasoning creates new capabilities for the analyst/decision maker. Visual analytics combines the cognitive reasoning process with a perceptual one, leading to faster, more concise analysis. It gives the user the ability to engage and interact with the data, and this interaction not only increases understanding and internalization of the information presented, it facilitates superior judgments with limited time investment. Another significant advantage of visual analytics is the ability to graphically represent the range of variability associated with the critical decision variables. This provides a decision maker with a dramatic improvement regarding their true understanding of the potential range of impacts associated with their decisions and therefore this should transfer to dramatically improved decisions. Overall, the use of a visual analytics framework results in faster, better and more defensible decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548512911428987">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both the visualization process and the analytical reasoning process depend on information, in the form of data. Data mining is ‘the process of exploring abstract data in the search for valuable and unexpected patterns’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548512911428987">17</xref></sup> Based on this and similar definitions, many people infer that visual analytics is actually a special case of data mining. This is indeed an area of contention between practitioners of both fields. Visualization by itself is clearly a useful data mining technique. However, merely developing new and innovative visualization techniques is rarely sufficient to induce insight about a particular set of data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548512911428987">18</xref></sup> Usually, data mining techniques employ sophisticated algorithms that automate the process of searching for patterns. However, data mining techniques are often biased towards looking for something specific.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548512911428987">19</xref></sup> While efficient, automation can miss unexpected or novel patterns that may occur. Teoh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548512911428987">20</xref></sup> contend this is exactly why a visual analytics approach is preferred over algorithmic data mining: it should be used when users are interested in exploring data to learn about it, especially when they do not know exactly what they need to discover from the data. In addition, data mining does not identify patterns or trends that may occur <italic>between</italic> data sets, especially those that are of dissimilar form. By providing appropriate visual representation of the data to the analyst, as well as providing additional (and often disparate) information, the human capability, including intuition, for finding relationships in noisy, non-numeric and incomplete data may be maximized.</p>
<p>A final advantage to using a visual analytics formulation for decision making is the capability to make trade studies, and thus decisions, in real time. It is acknowledged that the initial setup time for a good visual analytics environment can be significant. However, once the tool is created and populated, it may be used virtually instantaneously to conduct rapid trades, change assumptions and requirements and play ‘what if’ games with different scenarios. In fact, Christian Chabot, CEO of the visual analytics software company Tableau Software, asserts that the primary reason their customers are using visual analytics is to save time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548512911428987">21</xref></sup> The goal of a good environment is to rapidly acquaint an analyst with data and ideas with which they are not necessarily familiar. This interactive ability of the environment allows decision makers to explore the impacts of their choices and to defend their ultimate judgments.</p>
<p>As identified in <italic>Illuminating the path</italic>, there are four main focus areas in the visual analytics discipline: analytical reasoning techniques, visual representations and interaction techniques, data representation and transformations, and production, presentation and dissemination. Although there has been copious research and literature in the first three areas, the ultimate success of visual analytics lies in the fourth challenge, predominantly dissemination. Technology transition can be difficult, regardless of subject area. Visual analytics, in particular, has some unique characteristics that make its transition into mainstream use exceptionally challenging. Because visual analytics combines new software with a visual interface, users are not only expected to learn how to use a new tool, they are also expected to <italic>think</italic> differently: the software/interface goal is to promote insights and think creatively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548512911428987">22</xref></sup> This twin challenge can pose a perceived formidable barrier to the new user. Keim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548512911428987">23</xref></sup> explicitly state that user acceptability is a key challenge for the mainstream implementation of visual analytics, primarily due to users’ refusal to change their working routines. They further conclude that<disp-quote>
<p>The advantages of visual analytics tools need to be communicated to the audience of future users to overcome usage barriers, and eventually tap the full potential of the visual analytics approach.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Scholtz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548512911428987">22</xref></sup> recognize the use of pilot deployments for successful and rapid technology transition of visual analytics, in which the software/interface is placed in an operational environment for a limited number of users. Often, the number of operational tasks performed is limited. The goal of pilot deployments is to demonstrate the operational value of the tool to the user community, and ideally should use real-world data to solve real-world problems. The tool may or may not have undergone formal evaluation to be of use in this respect. While pilot deployments must be representative to be beneficial, this does not imply they need to be overly complex or rely on massive amounts of data. In ‘Demystifying visual analytics’, Chabot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548512911428987">21</xref></sup> argues that the idea that people adopt visual analytics primarily to see and understand both massive and complex data is an unfortunate stereotype. While acknowledging that visual analytics is indeed a ‘fantastic’ tool in these situations, he goes on to contend that not only is visual analytics equally useful with both small and large data, but also that people spend substantially more time working with small data sets than with large ones. In addition, on the subject of complexity, Chabot asserts that most important questions are simple, that simple questions are answered much more quickly using visual analytics and that even complex questions are often best answered using simple visualizations. Indeed, although there are some caveats, Miller<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548512911428987">24</xref></sup> shows that humans can only reliably distinguish between roughly seven categories when making a judgment. Although there are many good examples of visual analytics as applied to large, complex problems, including the financial application WireVis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548512911428987">25</xref></sup> the investigative analysis tool Jigsaw,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548512911428987">26</xref></sup> web-based scalable reasoning system SRS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548512911428987">27</xref></sup> and IN-SPIRE, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s visual document analysis tool,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548512911428987">28</xref></sup> showcasing only those visual analytics solutions that apply to large, complex problems helps perpetuate the stereotype. What is needed are smaller, accessible examples of visual analytics that can be rapidly integrated and understood by the user, and then trusting the user to be able extrapolate the usefulness of the methods and tools to more complex problems.</p>

<title>3. Strategic airlift decision-making environment</title>
<p>The C-5 strategic lift military transport aircraft has been a successful asset to the US military services for almost 50 years. Its longevity and usefulness are a result of its large cargo bay dimensions allowing side-by-side vehicle transport, loading and unloading from both the nose and tail, landing gear for multiple airfield surface types and other design features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548512911428987">29</xref></sup> However, it has suffered from less than ideal mission capable rates for many years and often requires significant amounts of maintenance and repair time for every flight hour.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548512911428987">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1548512911428987">30</xref></sup> As a result, over the years the C-5 program has undergone a number of reviews, both technical and strategic, to identify its role in the future. From these deliberations two programs, the C-5 Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) and Reliability Enhancement and Re-Engining Program (RERP) have been initiated in response to the decision that airlift superiority of the C-5 was too essential to abandon and also too expensive to replace.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548512911428987">31</xref></sup> Those C-5 aircraft that have completed the upgrades in both of these programs are designated with the title C-5M Super Galaxy. In order to continue and potentially expand the program amidst budget cuts and increased scrutiny, models and analysis have been developed to support, emphasize and defend the need for upgrading the existing C-5As into C-5Ms.</p>
<p>A visual analytics environment for decision making has been created around the C-5A and C-5M aircraft.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548512911428987">32</xref></sup> The goal behind the creation of the environment was two-fold. The fundamental concern from the beginning of the effort was that although the initial analysis team had clearly identified all the improved performance characteristics of the C-5M, such as lower failure rates, greater cargo capacity, less impacted by high altitude and high temperatures in terms of limiting the cargo capacity, greater range, etc., there was no clear comparison on how the improved performance characteristics would provide value in an Operational Scenario – such as delivering a fixed amount of cargo between two locations as quickly as possible with a given number of aircraft, or delivering a steady daily amount of cargo between two locations over a continuous period of time using a fixed number of aircraft. Such a decision-making environment would be invaluable in support of continued resource allocation for the C-5 AMP and Re-Engining Program. Rapid development of the tool was deemed important, and the interface needed to be designed to be suitable for a diverse group of users, from engineers to top-level management. The data sets powering the models were fairly straightforward, yet copious and disparate. An interface was desired that would allow the user to pick and choose which information they needed and to enable real-time trade studies at the user’s discretion. Finally, although in this particular study some trades would have been able to be conducted through manual or automatic manipulation of the data, these trades would need to be predetermined and programmed. It was desired to have an environment that allowed unformatted and new trade studies to be conducted, rather than preselected trades.</p>
<p>The secondary goal for the environment’s creation was to provide a pilot deployment in the form of a relevant example for the use of visual analytics within the corporate and professional culture. It was thought that the C-5 trade environment could effectively demonstrate the use of a visual analytics tool by providing a familiar yet relevant problem. Most trade studies and enquiries using the tool would serve to confirm or reinforce expected conclusions, lending a sense of validity and confidence in the tool. Yet the tool could potentially be used to find unexpected or unintuitive results. Both of these traits, confirming a hypothesis as well as facilitating new insights, are hallmarks of the visual analytics method. The tool was meant to be showcased both in-house and to the military analysis community at large, to demonstrate the power and usefulness of the visual analytics framework. By starting with a manageable example, the extrapolation of the framework to more complex analyses is enabled.</p>

<title>3.1 Creation of the environment</title>
<p>The creation of any visual analytics environment always occurs in two parts: the models or information that support the underlying analytical reasoning process, and the visual interface that allows the user to interact with the models. For the strategic airlift tool, the fundamental performance, operational and logistics data for the C-5A and C-5M was provided by Lockheed Martin. This data was transformed into a series of models. The Python programming language, with a discrete-event model simulation package called SimPy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548512911428987">33</xref></sup> was then used for flying the missions and executing the model in order to obtain the data that was eventually processed and presented in the visual interface. The resulting models were validated by the original customer and were considered correct to the extent that they had been developed. Simplifying assumptions, such as not accounting for wind speeds and no specific refinement associated with on load and off load times at different locations or for different cargo, were found to be acceptable.</p>
<p>There are a variety of software tools and scripting languages that enable the development of a good visual interface. In this particular case, the JMP software package, developed by the SAS Institute,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1548512911428987">34</xref></sup> was found to offer the best combination of capabilities, interactivity and analysis options. In addition, its portability allows the subsequent environment to be utilized both on individual desktops and large-scale visualization environments, such as the Georgia Institute of Technology’s Collaborative Visualization Environment (CoVE) facility. Primarily a statistical analysis package, JMP has impressive visualization capabilities and easily allows for the creation of interactive analysis. JMP itself can perform almost all of the tasks during the development stages of such a tool, including the design of experiments, neural net creation and other surrogate modeling techniques, analysis, visualizations, interactivity and optimization.</p>
<p>Throughout the development of the tool, constant customer and user input was used to tailor both the visual interface and the underlying model development.</p>

While seemingly quite compact, the tool is physically broken down into various outline boxes, each box representing a category or group of related inputs or outputs. These boxes contain interactive graphs, slider bars or other interfaces to allow dynamic entering of inputs or adjustments to the underlying assumptions for how and which outputs are displayed. The layout follows guidelines that were found to be successful in the creation of other visual analytics environments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548512911428987">35</xref></sup> with input and assumptions (including aerial ports of embarkation, debarkation, en route refueling location, mission type, mission payload, temperature, fleet size and repair rates) entered on the left-hand side of the tool, and outputs (including mapped airfield locations and node-edge scenario representation, three-dimensional (3D) flight paths, required allocated fleet size, time required to complete the specified mission and logistics metrics) on the right-hand side. Allowing the users to open and close only those boxes of inputs and outputs of interest facilitates tailoring the tool towards a specific analysis.</p>

<title>3.2.1 Mission scenario inputs and outputs</title>
<p>Inputs to the environment correspond to those values and assumptions that the decision maker either has control over or would like to explore. A mission scenario is defined, at a minimum, with an aerial port of embarkation (APOE), an aerial port of debarkation (APOD) and a payload to deliver. All other necessary parameters are initially defaulted. With an APOE, APOD and mission payload, the airlift logistics model has sufficient information to calculate the number of days to close and other logistics output metrics.</p>
<p>The APOE is selected with a drop down box, shown below in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1548512911428987">Figure 2</xref>. The relevant information associated with this airfield, namely the elevation and runway length, are automatically displayed after selection.</p>

</fig>
<p>Two common APOEs for C-5 missions, Dover and Travis Air Force Bases, are listed in addition to the first option, ‘Select APOE,’ which opens up a separate window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1548512911428987">Figure 3</xref>). The ‘Selecting an APOE’ window provides a map with more than 36,000 airfields in the current Lockheed Martin airfield reference database, colored by country.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548512911428987">36</xref></sup> Having the choice of so many airfields actually demonstrates a visual analytics concept. Although current practice and scenario analysis would probably eliminate many of these airfields from consideration, future analysis, based on new political or strategic realities, may bring those airfields into play. There was no inherent benefit to eliminating current ‘non-practical’ air bases from an environment-development point of view. Indeed, because the data was contained in a single database, more effort would have gone into providing an algorithm to limit the data. This limitation would have also introduced biased assumptions in the tool, and these assumptions would have needed to be communicated to the user in order to retain confidence in the resulting analysis. The data is there if the user needs it, and can be hidden if not needed. Thus the tool is capable of current and future analysis needs. If additional information is sought about the airfield, right clicking and selecting ‘Row editor’ opens up a window with all the pertinent data related to that airfield. This allows a cursory check to see if constraints are satisfied if relevant to a given mission, such as surface material (e.g. concrete, asphalt) or runway width.</p>

</fig>
<p>This kind of interface for inputting data and initial assumptions shows the power of tailoring an analysis for users needs. Basic input may be used for initial analysis, yet the user is offered the opportunity to fine-tune the inputs at a more detailed level. In this example, the user has a variety of ways of choosing an airfield: choosing from a preselected ‘most often used’ list, choosing from a comprehensive list sorted by country or clicking on a map. They may proceed with their runway selection, or examine the runway in more detail, down to the surface material or runway width level. This capability for diverse input and output is repeated throughout the environment.</p>
<p>Other inputs and assumptions to develop the initial scenario utilize similar interfaces to that of the APOE discussed above. An APOD may be selected, similar to APOE selection, with the additional option of selecting an unspecified location. This allows users who are unwilling to share a destination in a group setting an opportunity to satisfy the scenario requirements without revealing the intended APOD, illustrating the concept that useful analysis may still be supported, even with sensitive or proprietary data. As inputs are selected, output screens begin to be populated. Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1548512911428987">Figure 4</xref> is a representative flattened earth flight path, useful for confirming the inputs visually, as well as giving an initial sense of scenario geography.</p>

</fig>
<p>Similarly, selecting type of mission and payload produces different initial output formats. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1548512911428987">Figure 5(a)</xref>, either ‘Overseas Contingency Support’ or ‘Crisis Deployment’ may be selected. When selecting the first type, the user is likely more interested in <italic>how few aircraft</italic> are required to maintain support of some overseas base with supplies on a daily basis. The latter is concerned with <italic>how quickly</italic> a total amount of payload can be delivered to a destination and, thus, time is the output metric of performance.</p>

</fig>
<p>Traditional and custom payloads may be input, and the payload may be confined to actual physical restrictions, or be allowed to float free for some types of ‘what if’ analyses. Outputs showing corresponding loading curves can be shown indicating the actual cargo weight the aircraft can carry. Certain types of payload will not allow complete usage of the total cargo volume available, called a ‘cubed-out’ condition. For example, the space, or volume, above an M1 Abrams tank will, in general, not be used for additional payload. If a mission with a large total payload requires multiple flights, the payload per flight (and therefore the maximum take-off weight) will vary across the fleet of aircraft allocated for the mission.</p>
<p>Some distances between the APOE and APOD are too long for either of the C-5 platforms to reach without stopping en route to refuel, regardless of the payload weight. Furthermore, some distances may be reachable, but with very small payloads, which would in turn require more flights since the payload per flight could be excessively low. The threshold established in the model is set at 50,000 pounds. Thus, if a mission scenario is set such that the actual payload transported per flight must be less than 50,000, an en route location for refueling is required. The model will, in essence, not fly the mission since flying an empty or near empty C-5 is considered too inefficient. Finally, en route locations may be desired to capitalize on the higher maximum payload limits of the C-5M. Based upon the payload–range curve (presented in later sections), distance is effectively traded for payload. Thus, in some situations, a larger payload per flight will be beneficial to either the time to close or other logistics metrics, such as total flight hours, cost of fuel or utilization.</p>

<sec id="section7-1548512911428987">
<title>4. Trade capabilities</title>
<p>The tool facilitates a variety of useful trade studies, both between the C-5A and C-5M, and looking at each aircraft independently. While the trade capabilities discussed below are rather straightforward, it is through the power of the visual environment and its underlying models that these trades may be accomplished extremely rapidly, also allowing a variety of trades to be conducted both in isolation and in tandem. In other words, a much more comprehensive analysis of comparisons between a huge range of possibilities is enabled. This leads to a faster generation of results and understanding of the data, and can also lead to unexpected insights, an example of which is discussed below. Although currently trades are enabled only between the C-5A and C-5M, due to development goals, it would be straightforward to add additional aircraft (such as the C-17 or C-141) to the environment to enhance more sophisticated fleet mix trades.</p>
<sec id="section8-1548512911428987">
<title>4.1 Payload–range curves</title>
<p>The payload–range curve is the primary differentiator for most comparisons between the C-5A and C-5M platforms. At the most rudimentary level, it illustrates the performance advantage of the M platform over the A. On a one-to-one scale, the trading of payload for range and vice versa can be used to make simple comparisons between the capabilities between these platforms. For example, at most payloads less than 200,000 lbs, the C-5M can fly almost 1000 nm further than the C-5A. For identical distances, the C-5M can carry an additional 50,000 lbs.</p>
<p>With the parameter of selectable en route locations for refueling added, more interesting trades are available. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1548512911428987">Figure 6</xref>, the distance from the APOE to the APOD is 5619 nm and, flying directly, the C-5M can carry 126,490 lbs. If the C-5A were to fly direct, it would only be able to carry around 74,500 lbs. Instead, it stops over at an air base in Spain (a distance of 3377 nm from Dover) and thus can carry 174,989 lbs. The C-5M flies directly to the APOD with about 50,000 lbs less of payload, but this is balanced with the additional time for landing, refueling and taking off and other resources (i.e. cost to maintain base) required by the C-5A. In this case, the payload size, and thus the number of flights required to close the mission, is traded against having an en route refueling stop or not.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section9-1548512911428987">
<title>4.2 Aircraft repair rates</title>
<p>One of the advantages of the RERP is an expected increased reliability of the C-5M over the C-5A, resulting in an overall increased mission capable rate. This is projected as a result of a number of improvements and upgrades, including more reliable engines and other parts, and increased diagnostic capability of the status of the various subsystems.</p>
<p>The underlying model and tool account for the increased reliability in two ways. The first, the break rate, is defined as how often an aircraft breaks down and requires repairs at an airfield, expressed as a percentage. Thus, if one aircraft has a 10% break rate, before one in every 10 take-offs, it will have to undergo repairs, and be delayed a certain amount of time for the repairs. The second way reliability is adjusted is through repair rates. Once an aircraft has entered the broken down state, a repair time (viewed as a mission delay) is applied. The repairs are divided into four length categories, and each one of these categories has an assigned repair rate, expressed as a percentage, determining the delay or repair time once an aircraft breaks down.</p>
<p>The user can change both the break rates and the repair rates for each of the four categories and two platforms. Together, the four probabilities creating the probability density function (PDF) for each platform are summarized with a cumulative distribution function (CDF). Ideally, the PDF is more heavily weighted on the lower time categories, meaning that the repairs do not increase the down time, and the break rate itself is also lower. Using appropriate inputs, the C-5M offers two ways in which it is more reliable than the C-5A: its break rate is lower (10.5% versus 17% for the A) and its PDF is slightly skewed more to the left as compared to the PDF of the C-5A. Similar comparisons by looking at the CDFs illustrate the more reliable C-5M as well.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1548512911428987">
<title>4.3 Number of days to close</title>
<p>One of the most important output metrics used to compare aircraft is the time to close. The time to close is calculated in hours but expressed in days. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1548512911428987">Figure 7</xref>, the number of days to close the mission (delivering a total of 37.5 million pounds to a specified APOD), is shown as a distribution, where the C-5M fleet close the mission on average almost 8 days faster than the C-5A. The number of aircraft allocated for this mission is also presented in the table on the top, as well as other useful statistics, including the mean days to close and the standard deviation, whether an en route would be required, the total payload for the mission and the payload per flight for each of the platforms.</p>
<fig id="fig7-1548512911428987" position="float">
<label>Figure 7.</label>
<caption>
<p>Screen shot of number of days to close outline box.</p>
</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1548512911428987-fig7.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The distributions and the corresponding mean and standard deviations are dependent upon the input factors. As a result, the distributions will shift to the left and become narrower as the repair and break rates improve (i.e. repair rates for 0–4 hours increases and break rate decreases). With the model serving as a transformation between repair rates and number of days to close, investigations into how much improvement in terms of reliability the C-5M needs to experience to reach a specific objective can be investigated.</p>
<p>Similar to other analyses, making a trade between the number of days to close and stopping en route to refuel can be performed. Refueling can have interesting effects on the number of days to close, depending on the location of, or distances between, the APOE, APOD and en route location(s). Since stopping to refuel allows larger payloads, fewer flights are needed, resulting in potential time and fuel savings. However, delays are also experienced during the descending, refueling, take-off and ascending segments. Furthermore, the location for en route refueling may be considerably off the direct line between the APOE and APOD, adding time and fuel costs to the resultant increased distance. Therefore, in some cases it may be more economically advantageous to stop over, but at the expense of some other factor, such as time or number of flights. Similarly, closing the mission quickly may be preferable, but would require more aircraft and perhaps be more expensive. Lastly, all of these trades are dependent on the mission scenario itself including the locations of all airfields involved, their parameters, including temperature, elevation and runway length, and of course the type and amount of payload determined by the mission.</p>
<p>One of the greatest benefits to this interactive comparison tool, however, is to allow the user to make these trade-offs in real time and dynamically test out scenarios, adjusting parameters and investigating the design space with sensitivity analyses. All of this results in a capable and useful tool to compare platforms and perform conceptual mission planning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1548512911428987">
<title>4.4 Logistic metrics</title>
<p>The cost of fuel, the gallons of fuel, flight hours and utilization are the four metrics considered most useful for high-level, conceptual mission planning and platform comparisons. In order to obtain the cost of fuel for a particular mission, the model multiplies the gallons of fuel output with the user-defined price of fuel, entered via a slide bar up to four dollars per gallon (this upper limit is easily changed within the model). The gallons of fuel values for each platform are calculated using surrogate models originally created from proprietary fuel burn data provided by the contract sponsor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548512911428987">36</xref></sup> The flight hours metric is also calculated with regressed response surface equations for each leg of the mission. Once the time for each leg is calculated, they are summed and then multiplied by the number of total flights required, determined by the total mission payload and the payload per flight as designated from the payload–range curve. The last metric, utilization, is a simple ratio of the total time the entire fleet is flying or the actual flight hours, over the total time of the mission multiplied by the allocated fleet size.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1548512911428987">
<title>4.5 Tandem trades</title>
<p>The trades discussed above are straightforward. The environment, however, easily facilitates more complex trades. In addition to conducting specific trade studies between the C-5M and C-5A, the environment allows an individual analysis to be performed to investigate the capability and expected performance on each platform in isolation. Such a situation is useful when comparisons are unnecessary and instead the user would like to focus on how best to use the platform of choice against all the other input parameters. The user can analyze expected times to close based on fleet size as well as identify how much it will cost in terms of fuel and what sort of requirements in regards to reliability will have to be met to obtain the desire outcome. The utilization metric coupled with the other output metrics can give a first estimate at the risk level of such a scenario. Low utilizations levels may be an indication that crew and other maintenance technicians will not be overtaxed with high turnaround times and will be able to respond quickly to plans, schedules and routes that require changing. On the other hand, high utilization levels may indicate higher efficiency, but potentially at a greater risk, since more individuals are occupied closer to their maximum work output and bottlenecks may be imminent if additional pressures are placed upon the system.</p>
<p>The number of days to close can be traded with fleet size. Having an equal number of aircraft for each platform fly the mission will provide the time difference to close. Similarly to the payload per flight, the time to close can be aligned and predictions can be made of how many more C-5As are needed to match the time a smaller fleet of C-5Ms requires to close. Both of these can involve en route locations for only one platform, both platforms or neither platform. In the first case, the trade considers the time to descend, refuel, take-off and ascend for the one platform (usually the C-5A). Although this effectively results in a time delay, the increase in payload per flight may actually overcome the time penalty. Thus, at some distances, the C-5A with an en route location will require a smaller fleet size as compared to the C-5M, with an equal time to close. For this, the user must now consider the trade of the cost to maintain an additional base somewhere perhaps halfway between the APOD and APOE, and having a larger fleet size to maintain, assuming an equivalent mission capable rate. Allowing the C-5M to stop over for refueling as well, will likely reduce the number of the C-5Ms required to close in the same time, but the increased cost to maintain the base counters the savings from a reduced fleet size.</p>
<p>Considering reliability, particularly the break and repair rates, adds two more dimensions to the trades just discussed. One way to match the time to close of a smaller C-5M fleet size without refueling at an en route location to that of a C-5A, which will stop over, is through increasing the repair rates and decreasing the break rate of the C-5M. The model allows real-time calculations of how improving the repair times will roll up into the overall mission time to close metric. For some mission scenarios this will play a major role, especially with a high number of required flights. In addition, the user can identify objectives and goals for improving the C-5M reliability parameters to reach a specified capability (i.e. time to close for a given mission scenario).</p>
<p>Finally, all of the above ‘input’ metrics are traded against the logistic output metrics: cost of fuel, number of flight hours and utilization. Increasing reliability will likely increase utilization, and decrease the time to close. The cost of fuel is dependent on the payload per flight, and therefore also on the selection (or not) of an en route selection and the mission scenario itself. Adjusting the fleet sizes will not alter the total flights hours, but the utilization is highly dependent on the number of allocated C-5s. The total flight hours is, however, highly dependent on the en route location, and in particular if the en route location is significantly off the typical direct flight path. Fuel is similarly dependant on the path selected and will, in some cases, be less with a stopover to refuel. This is the result of a cross-over point where stopping over is less expensive because of the expected increase in the payload per flight. However, with a saving in fuel and potentially a saving in the fleet size, the time to close may increase, thus bringing the trade between time to close and fuel cost into the lengthy list of potential trade-offs.</p>

<sec id="section13-1548512911428987">
<title>4.6 Unexpected insight</title>
<p>One example of a relatively unintuitive insight that the visual analytics environment did reveal was how many additional legacy aircraft are required to equal the time to deliver a fixed amount of cargo, as compared to the modernized aircraft under relatively likely circumstances. For instance – for a scenario of moving approximately 5500 tons from Dover to Bagram, Afghanistan, and using only 10 of each type of aircraft, the following results are found in terms of days to deliver: the C-5A would take approximately 28 days, whilst the C-5M would take approximately 17 days. Therefore, the C-5A takes about 65% longer to deliver the cargo. It will take 20 C-5As versus 10 C-5Ms to achieve the same result – obviously a substantial increase. This comparative insight is repeated over and over in analyzing a variety of likely scenarios – essentially the number of legacy aircraft required to equal the performance of the modernized aircraft is noticeably greater than just evaluating the percent improvement in operational outcomes when comparing equal numbers of aircraft.</p>

<title>5. Conclusion</title>
<p>Visual analytics is a powerful enabler that could help achieve NEC goals. By combining analytical reasoning with the extraordinary human capability to ingest and understand visual data, visual analytics facilitates rapid, defensible and superior decision making in the face of vast and disparate data, uncertainty and time pressures.</p>
<p>This paper presents a visual analytics framework that was used to develop a decision-making environment to allow rapid analysis and trade studies to be conducted between two military strategic platforms, the C-5A and C-5M. The primary development goal of the decision-making environment was to enable rapid trade-off analysis between the two strategic platforms, in support of continued resource allocation for the C-5M program. The secondary development goal was to showcase the power of a visual analytics environment through the use of a relevant, accessible pilot deployment, in order to facilitate cultural and corporate use of such tools. Both of these goals were met. The decision-making environment was demonstrated to Air Mobility Command (AMC), aircraft operators, United States Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) staff, the Tanker Airlift Control Center (TACC) and Washington DC defense analysts, and has been ‘great for generating discussion and customer interaction’ (W. Armistead, email communication, 8 April 2011). Demonstrations of the tool are still being requested. By successfully demonstrating the comparative operational impacts and value associated with the C-5M aircraft, support for the modernization program continues to date.</p>
<p>Two key barriers to the acceptance and use of visual analytics are implementation and dissemination. By providing an introduction and summary of the attributes of visual analytics, coupled with a small, yet relevant example of a visual analytics decision-making environment, the authors intended to expose the military modeling community to a potentially valuable new capability for decision making and strategic analysis.</p>
