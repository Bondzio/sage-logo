<title>Background</title>
<p>Recently bereaved carers of patients who have died in the Leicestershire and Rutland Hospice (LOROS) are invited to be involved in the education of medical students from Leicester University in the care of the dying. The aim of this initiative is that the student’s education is grounded in real experience. The carers are contacted randomly approximately 9 months after their bereavement and offered the opportunity of being involved in the education programme. On average a third of the carers invited agree to be involved. They talk to a group of about 15 students with the support of a facilitator. Once they have told their ‘story’, the students have the opportunity to ask questions or discuss aspects of the story in more detail.</p>
<p>The sessions provided by the carers have been very highly evaluated by the medical students and often reported to have had the greatest perceived impact on their learning. Concern has been expressed by some in the hospice, however, about the appropriateness of involving recently bereaved carers in this programme at a vulnerable time in their lives. Could reliving their experiences with the students be detrimental to the carers? With this study we wanted to explore the carers’ perspective and the impact the teaching has on them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216311415453" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>All carers that had been involved in the education programme over the preceding year were contacted: 11 of the 14 carers contacted agreed to take part in an individual interview or focus group; there was no response from the remaining 3. Ethics approval was given by the Leicestershire Northamptonshire and Rutland local research ethics committee. The carers gave written consent to confirm that they were in agreement for the interview to be recorded and for any quotes to be used for publication. The topic guide for the interviews underwent iterative development in response to the themes that emerged in each interview.</p>
<p>The interviews were recorded and then transcribed verbatim. All of the transcripts were read and re-read by the two researchers and coded independently. The coding schemes were compared, the emerging themes discussed and a consensus derived.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216311415453" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Some carers expressed that their motivation for agreeing to take part was the desire to talk about their loved ones. All of the carers reported finding the experience of telling their stories as positive and many felt it provided a useful vehicle for expressing emotions. Most were clear that it did not have a negative impact on them. Only one reported that it had brought back some difficult memories but even so was pleased she had done it and would do it again.</p>
<p>Many spoke about the desire to make a difference to future patients and carers and wanting the students to learn from the positive and negative experiences of their own personal journeys. One carer reported that the elation she experienced by feeling she was helping others had encouraged her to take stock of her life and review the direction she wanted to take with her own career.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216311415453" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A literature review of using patients and carers as teachers has demonstrated that most studies explore the impact on the learner although some do suggest it is also a positive experience for the patient or carer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311415453">1</xref></sup> In the palliative care setting, Wee et al. reported that carers welcome the opportunity of recounting their real-life stories to students.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311415453">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>All of the carers participating in this study found being involved in the medical student education a valuable and even therapeutic experience. A study by Maccormack et al. identified that talking can be very beneficial in many ways,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311415453">3</xref></sup> so it can be argued that it is not the teaching that provides the benefits but purely giving the carers the opportunity to speak openly about their own painful experiences.</p>
<p>The authors acknowledge that this was a small study conducted with carers who were first proactive in responding to the invitation to take part in the education programme initially and, second, agreed to participate in the research. We do not know why three of the carers who had participated in the education programme chose not to take part in the research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216311415453">
<title>Summary</title>
<p>The experience for the carers in our study was very positive and there was no cause for concern about their wellbeing. The results support continued involvement of carers in the education programme and stimulates further consideration of how carers stories can be used in the future.</p>
