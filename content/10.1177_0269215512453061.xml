<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Children with cerebral palsy who are unable to walk independently are particularly prone to muscle weakness,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269215512453061">1</xref></sup> which contributes to pain, deformity and functional loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269215512453061">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>A number of previous studies have demonstrated that strength and exercise interventions for children with mild to moderate cerebral palsy can result in an increase in muscle volume,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269215512453061">3</xref></sup> muscle strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512453061">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269215512453061"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512453061">6</xref></sup> or can improve gross motor function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512453061">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512453061"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512453061"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512453061"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512453061">10</xref></sup> However, the effectiveness of such interventions remains unclear as, while meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have found increases in strength compared to control groups, the differences were not statistically significant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269215512453061">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512453061">12</xref></sup> The authors of both reviews suggested the need for interventions of longer duration and of sufficient intensity to result in significant strength gains.</p>
<p>Some studies have examined the effect of treadmill training, using partial body weight support, for children with mild to severe cerebral palsy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512453061">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512453061">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512453061"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512453061"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512453061">16</xref></sup> reporting improvements in gross motor function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512453061">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512453061">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512453061">15</xref></sup> and increases in walking speeds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269215512453061">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269215512453061"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512453061"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512453061">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are very few studies that have investigated the effect of exercise interventions in non-ambulant children with cerebral palsy as routine strength and exercise training protocols (such as weight training or circuit training) are not feasible for this group. Treadmill training and static bikes are not routinely used in rehabilitation for children who have limited motor ability, at Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512453061">17</xref></sup> levels IV and V. However, some children with severe motor functional disability may be able to pedal independently when given additional support on a static bike<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512453061">9</xref></sup> or may be able to walk on a treadmill with a support harness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269215512453061">15</xref></sup> Therefore, the rationale for this study was to identify effective interventions, where none currently exist, with a view to offering a choice of activity for this population.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to determine the effect of a six-week exercise intervention, using a static bicycle or treadmill, on gross motor function ability in non-ambulant children with cerebral palsy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269215512453061" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Participants were recruited from four special schools in the south of the UK. Participants aged 8–17 years, with cerebral palsy at GMFCS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269215512453061">17</xref></sup> levels IV and V, able to pedal on an adapted static bicycle and walk with partial body weight support on a treadmill were invited to participate in the study. They were excluded if they had undergone orthopaedic surgery to the spine or lower limbs within the last year, or if they had cognitive or behavioural impairment preventing understanding or compliance with instructions.</p>
<p>Participants were randomly allocated to the bike, treadmill or control group at each site. The study administrator provided nine sealed envelopes (three for each group) to each site, which were randomly placed by a third party in the participant files and were opened after the baseline assessment.</p>
<p>Ethical approval was granted by Brighton West Research Ethics Committee. An overview of the randomized controlled trial methodology is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269215512453061">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Static exercise bikes (Vision Fitness E3200 Upright Cycle), adapted to provide extra postural support, were used for the bike group. Trunk, feet and wrist supports were secured when required. Standard treadmills (Tunturi T90) with minimal operating speed of 0.5 km/h were used for the treadmill group.</p>
<p>Participants were hoisted on and off the static exercise bike using their designated sling, or onto the treadmill using a ‘standing sling’ (Liko Mastervest) that remained in place for the session providing partial body weight support using an overhead tracking hoist.</p>
<p>Participants in the bike and treadmill groups received exercise training three times a week for six weeks. This duration was chosen as the children have a natural break in their schooling every six weeks. Sessions lasted approximately 30 minutes, including transfers between wheelchair and bike or treadmill. Control group participants received their usual physiotherapy activities during this period, such as stretching and exercises on a mat, standing with a standing frame or swimming.</p>
<p>To evaluate the starting level of exercise necessary for each child, and to monitor the progress in their ability from baseline to six weeks, participants in the bike group performed a modified graded exercise test based on the McMaster All-Out Progressive Continuous Cycling Test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269215512453061">18</xref></sup> For the treadmill group assessments of the ‘fastest walking speed’ achieved on the treadmill were recorded for each participant. These assessments have been used previously for children with cerebral palsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512453061">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269215512453061">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269215512453061">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The training protocols used were adapted from the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines for healthy adults,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269215512453061">21</xref></sup> which were modified to bring them within the ability of the participants. Subsquently, in order to progressively increase the difficulty of walking on the treadmill, the speed of the treadmill was increased, as an alternative to the usual method of increasing the inclination, because fixed ankle foot orthoses were worn by some participants (which make walking on a slope difficult).</p>
<list id="list1-0269215512453061" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Static bike protocol (total time &lt;30 minutes): participants were asked to pedal for as long as they could with a load of 75% of the maximum achieved in the modified graded exercise test, and the time recorded. After a rest of a few minutes they were asked if they felt they had recovered and were ready to continue. They were then asked to pedal as fast as they could in short bursts against the maximum resistance determined in the initial graded exercise test. The number and highest speed of the short bursts were recorded. A warm-up and cool-down opportunity was provided by the assistant rotating the pedals for participants.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Treadmill protocol (total time &lt;30 minutes): the treadmill speed was increased by 0.1 km/h every 10 seconds, and the participant was asked to continue walking until he or she was unable to go faster and began to stumble. The ‘fastest walking speed’ was recorded as fastest 10-second walk before stumbling. After a rest of a few minutes they were asked if they felt they had recovered and were ready to continue. They were then asked to walk for as long as possible at 75% of the last ‘fastest walking speed’. A warm-up and cool-down was provided by walking for 30 seconds at the slowest speed.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The length of time on the bike or treadmill varied between children according to ability but aimed to be increased at each session. Verbal encouragement was given to participants to perform their best.</p>
<p>To evaluate motor function the Gross Motor Function Measures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512453061">22</xref></sup> GMFM-66 and dimensions D (Standing) and E (Walking, Running &amp; Jumping) of the GMFM-88 were measured. One researcher (HW) acted as assessor for all but three of the study assessments and was blinded as to which arm of the study each participant was allocated.</p>
<p>The outcome measures were assessed on four occasions for each participant, pre intervention (week 0), immediately post intervention (week 6) and two follow-up assessments (weeks 12 and 18). Secondary outcome measures (speed and duration of exercise) were evaluated for those in the bike and treadmill groups at week 0 and week 6.</p>
<p>A sample size calculation was performed in order to determine the sample size. A sample size of <italic>n</italic> = 30 (10 cases in each arm) was calculated to detect a difference in GMFM-88E score of 3 between control and experimental arms with power set at 90% and a significance level of 0.025. This expected difference between arms was based on previous research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512453061">9</xref></sup> The significance level was selected to reduce the chance of type 1 error, as the planned analysis comprises two independent <italic>t</italic>-tests, each comparing the difference in GMFM-E score between the control arm and experimental arm. Thirty-five participants were recruited to allow for attrition.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS, version 16 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Exploratory analyses assessed data normality and the effectiveness of randomization. Significance level was set at <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 for all analyses, the risk of type I error having been corrected for already by setting the <italic>P</italic>-value to 0.025 within the sample size calculation.</p>
<p>Changes in outcome measurements immediately after the intervention (between baseline at week 0 and week 6) were calculated, and the data analysed using unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test or Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> as appropriate. All analyses compared bike group and control group, and treadmill group with control group. The study was not powered to analyse differences between the bike and treadmill groups as that was not the aim of the study.</p>
<p>To investigate whether changes observed in outcome measurements immediately post intervention (week 6) were retained at weeks 12 and 18, data were analysed using mixed design analysis of variance (ANOVA). An overall group-by-time interaction tested whether the average time course differed between groups. Where data were not normally distributed the square root of the value was computed for the ANOVA test. For ease of interpretation, raw data are used in all tables.</p>

<p>After the intervention the participants and physiotherapists were asked of their views and experiences of the trial. The children enjoyed the opportunity to exercise on the static bike or the treadmill. Exercising at this intensity was a new experience for the majority of them, who had not been ‘out of breath’ before and had not felt tired from exercise previously. Some of the young people and physiotherapists reported that participating in the exercise programme had helped them with their standing and walking skills.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Research on exercise interventions for non-ambulant children with cerebral palsy is very limited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512453061">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512453061">10</xref></sup> The primary aim of this study was to identify exercise interventions effective in improving gross motor function ability in non-ambulant children with cerebral palsy. This study found that a six-week exercise programme either on a static bike or treadmill can lead to significant short-term improvements in motor function (GMFM-88D) compared to standard physiotherapy care. Significant improvements were also observed in exercise capability; being able to cycle or walk at a faster speed and for longer duration. The improvements observed in motor function declined during the 12-week follow-up period.</p>
<p>Participants in both the bike and treadmill groups demonstrated significant improvements in mobility with regards to their ‘standing ability’ (GMFM-88D) immediately post intervention, compared to the control group. Some children were able to stand holding on to a support for longer periods. These small changes may be of value to the children and carers in the realms of independence and personal care. Similar improvements in GMFM-88D scores were reported following a six-week intervention using a static bike<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512453061">9</xref></sup> and a three-month treadmill intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512453061">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>With regards to changes in walking ability there was a trend towards initial improvements in the GMFM-88E score for both treatment groups immediately post intervention, although the differences were not significantly different compared to the control group. Similar findings have been reported previously following strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269215512453061">6</xref></sup> or exercise training interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269215512453061">8</xref></sup> In contrast, Schindl et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512453061">10</xref></sup> found significant improvements in GMFM-88E scores (mean increase of 4.3) after 36 treadmill training sessions over 12 weeks. This would suggest a longer duration of treadmill training is required to elicit significant improvements in walking ability.</p>
<p>The pattern of small but statistically insignificant improvements in the GMFM-66 scores observed in the current study between the bike and control group, and the treadmill and control group, are similar to other studies with ambulant children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512453061">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269215512453061">7</xref></sup> The lack of effectiveness may also reflect a difference between the outcome measures as the GMFM-88 gives credit for each new ‘movement’, while the GMFM-66 attempts instead to credit each new ‘skill’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269215512453061">22</xref></sup> Furthermore the GMFM-66 has been shown to be less sensitive to changes in motor function for children aged 5 and over.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269215512453061">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The improvements observed in gross motor function scores immediately post intervention for participants in both treatment groups compared to the control group suggest that both modes of exercise have the potential to lead to improved mobility. While participants in the bike group appeared to show greater improvements than participants in the treadmill group for their standing (GMFM-88D) and walking ability (GMFM-88E), no statistical analysis was performed as the study was not powered to analyse differences between these groups.</p>
<p>The trends for improvements in motor function suggest there may have been increases in lower limb muscle strength which would help the children performing the functional activities such as standing and walking. Future studies would warrant investigating changes in muscle properties and muscle activity in order to identify the possible mechanisms for these improvements.</p>
<p>As would be expected from an exercise intervention, participants in both treatment groups significantly improved in their exercise capability; being able to cycle or walk at a faster speed and for longer duration at the end of the six-week intervention. Participants in the treadmill group increased the mean time spent walking by 5 minutes. Similar increases in walking time were also reported by Willoughby et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512453061">16</xref></sup> with a 7-minute increase following a nine-week intervention; and by Schindl et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269215512453061">10</xref></sup> with a 6-minute increase following a 12-week intervention. The improvement observed in mean walking speed of 0.52 kph in the current study was slightly lower than the improvement reported by Willoughby et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269215512453061">16</xref></sup> of 0.75 kph, which may be due to the difference in the length of the interventions. For the bike group, the mean increase in cycling time was 3.6 minutes and cycling speed was 2.5 kph.</p>
<p>The initial improvements in motor function immediately post intervention were not retained after cessation of the intervention at the six-week follow-up assessment, which is consistent with other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269215512453061">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512453061">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269215512453061">24</xref></sup> This detraining effect has also been observed in healthy children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269215512453061">25</xref></sup> This would suggest further research is needed to explore the sustainability of effects through either ongoing ‘maintenance’ exercise programmes, or exercise programmes of longer duration. Recent recommendations for resistance training protocols suggest at least 12 weeks duration to maximize the likelihood of a training effect in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512453061">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>At baseline a number of children were unable to initiate any of the tasks in the GMFM measures for standing (GMFM-88D) and walking, running, jumping (GMFM-88E) and subsequently had a score of zero. Both of these measures have limitations in detecting functional change in individuals with severe motor disabilities due to the potential ‘floor effect’ at the lower limits of the measure. Unfortunately, we are not aware of any alternative measure suitable for children with severe motor difficulties, which is sensitive enough to detect changes in gross motor function over time. Future research to develop a more appropriate outcome measure for this population would be welcomed.</p>
<p>At the start of the intervention some children in the bike group were unable to pedal continuously unsupervised so were assisted during the exercise sessions until they were able to pedal independently (which took several weeks for some participants). This would suggest the physiotherapists may have overestimated the ability of some children at the time of recruitment. In retrospect, lengthening the duration of the intervention to include a familiarization/training period would have been of benefit to these participants in order to optimize the potential benefits of the programme. Indeed Verschuren et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269215512453061">12</xref></sup> recently suggested incorporating a training period in order to practise the task (i.e. developing the force to initiate the pedal turning) followed by the introduction of more complex tasks for the intervention (i.e. pedalling as fast as possible).</p>
<p>On completion of the study the children reported enjoying the opportunity to exercise on the bike or treadmill, which was a new experience for the majority of them.</p>
<p>There were several potential limitations to this study. The major limitation being the small sample size as we were expecting a big effect size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269215512453061">9</xref></sup> Some of the non-significant findings may reflect a type 2 error in that the study may have been insufficiently powered to identify a smaller (but still clinically significant) effect size. This is indicated by the non-significant trends for improvement in the GMFM-88E data immediately post intervention.</p>
<p>The study was not powered to analyse whether there was greater benefit with one mode of exercise over the other. In retrospect perhaps this should have been addressed, however the aim of the study was to identify effective interventions where none currently exist, and to offer a choice. Treadmills and static bikes are not routinely used for children with severe motor functional disabilities. Therefore in order to compare the effectiveness of the two modes of exercise a larger scale parallel arm randomized controlled trial is required.</p>
<p>We did not measure the participants’ weight and height so therefore are unable to generalize the findings from this study. In addition, heart rate recordings were not undertaken while exercising so we do not know the workload intensity, although the children were actively encouraged to work harder at each session.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while no significant improvements were found in walking ability, this study shows the potential of two modes of exercise for improving standing ability (with regard to standing transfers) and exercise capability for this population. Both modes of exercise were acceptable and enjoyable for the children for whom there are few other exercise opportunities.</p>
