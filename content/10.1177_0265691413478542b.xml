<sec id="sec4-0265691413478542b"><title><bold>Reviewed by:</bold> Nicholas A Eckstein, <italic>University of Sydney, Australia</italic></title>
<p>At the beginning of this sparkling little volume Douglas Biow announces his primary interest in the ‘connections among character, conduct and creativity in sixteenth-century Italy’ (xiv). He explores this theme in a series of lively and original chapter-essays devoted to techniques of self-presentation employed by five of the century’s most successful artists and writers. Part one, ‘Diplomacy’, considers Baldassar Castiglione’s classic manual, <italic>Il cortegiano</italic>, and describes the professional accomplishment, manners and artful nonchalance to which early sixteenth-century courtiers were supposed to aspire. Biow reveals how, in a counter-intuitive masterstroke, the author deliberately absents himself from the action of his own treatise. Thus rendering himself ‘inconspicuously conspicuous’ (35), Castiglione wordlessly draws attention to his stellar diplomatic career. He fashions himself as the perfect courtier without stooping to exactly the kind of crass self-promotion that would undermine his cause.</p>
<p>This stimulating and valuable essay acts as a foil to the chapters that follow, because Biow is concerned less with discretion than with the impropriety, exaggeration and overreach he discovers amidst the cultural flux of the decades following Castiglione’s death in 1529. His other protagonists fashion themselves not through discretion but by getting in people’s faces, to use the terms of Biow’s own eye-catching title. The governing theme for Part Two (Chapters Two and Three) is ‘Food’. Chapter Two examines the literary production of scurrilous <italic>littérateur</italic> Pietro Aretino between 1527 and 1550, when courtly culture became dominant in Italy and writers as successful as Aretino simultaneously saw their chance to break free of its humiliating constraints. Aretino’s celebration of immoderate appetite (for food, drink and sex as well as for the written word) mockingly subverts the <italic>Cortegiano</italic>’s idealized restraint and elitist confidence. Aretino locates himself, physically and metaphorically, in the teeming world of his friends, enemies, neighbours – and his paying readers.</p>
<p>Chapter three cleverly inverts the terms of the second. Biow interprets several early works by Michelangelo Buonarroti to reveal how the artist dramatized himself as a God-like figure without need of food or sleep, who consumed his bodily self in bouts of titanic labour, and lost himself so completely in the act of creation that he became one with the object he fashioned. Part Three – ‘Objects’ – also comprises two chapters. Chapter four is on the sculptor/goldsmith, Benvenuto Cellini. Biow argues that whereas Aretino portrayed himself as an insatiable consumer of almost everything, Cellini cast himself as the tireless producer of consumable objects. Like Michelangelo, Cellini fuses himself with the things he makes. His tracts of goldsmithing and sculpture are practical ‘how-to’ books; in his hands, however, factual explanations of technical skill are enlivened by autobiographical narrative, as Cellini invents himself as an exemplary authority on his specialist subject. Such showing off has the serious purpose of establishing and reinforcing the cultural ‘ethos’ on which the artist relies for his professional survival (149). The final chapter analyses the literary career of Anton Francesco Doni. Having failed as an independent publisher, Doni cunningly exploited the culture and medium of print to promote himself as a highly successful professional writer (polygraph), frequently by denigrating, dismissing – equally often by plagiarizing – the writing of his peers.</p>
<p>In the epilogue Biow states the obvious fact that these case studies are ‘fundamentally about the elite’ (188). He acknowledges throughout that Castiglione, Aretino et al. are exceptions, and in the introduction he argues that because sixteenth-century Italian society made it all but impossible for women to behave in the manner of the characters here selected for study, this is a book about exceptional men (1). On this last point I cannot help wondering if the frame of reference has been set too narrowly, whether illustrious female courtesans, artists and aristocrats might not have qualified for analysis because they challenged masculine culture by their very existence. This reservation aside, Biow’s book succeeds because he so skilfully weaves the identities of these exceptional men into the larger tapestry of contemporary society. Aretino’s gourmandizing, omnivorous persona is a carnivalesque invention that demands consideration of the surrounding culture. One of Biow’s most important contributions in this respect is his subtly historicized identification of the nascent consumer-oriented print culture that both Aretino and his rival Doni exploit with such success. The potentially recondite (not to mention well-worn) discussion of Michelangelo’s creative persona is comparably embedded, for example where Biow relates it to communal rituals like Carnival and Lent (98). The author’s approach is never more successful than in the compelling account of how Cellini self-consciously fashioned himself and his works in relation to the aggressive masculinity of early-modern Italy. Shock and violence are recurrent themes in the personal/professional life that Cellini performed for a contemporary audience which clearly appreciated and admired such qualities.</p>
<p>The fascinating case studies of <italic>In Your Face</italic> (whose deceptively informal prose may well have pleased Castiglione) offer stimulus and insight not only to historians of creativity and artistic production, but to scholars interested in the inexhaustible question as to how individual identity was conditioned by, and influenced, contemporary society.</p>
