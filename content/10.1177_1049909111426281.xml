<abstract>
<p>Background: Clinicians meet people from different ethnic backgrounds, yet need to respond in culturally sensitive ways. This article focuses on Asian American families. Methods: Within a randomized controlled trial of family therapy commenced during palliative care and continued into bereavement, 3 families of Asian American background were examined qualitatively from a cultural perspective by listening to recordings of 26 therapy sessions and reviewing detailed supervision notes compiled by each therapist. Results: A synopsis of each family’s therapy narrative is presented. Prominent themes include family closeness, respect for hierarchy within the family, gender-determined roles, intergenerational tensions, preoccupation with shame and limited emotional expressiveness. Conclusions: Family therapists working with culturally diverse families need to pay thoughtful attention to ethnic issues as they strive to support them during palliative care and bereavement.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As immigration yields an increasingly diverse population in the United States, psychotherapeutic approaches including family therapy during palliative care must be flexible to accommodate various cultures. At over 14 million people, Asian Americans constitute 5% of the US population, with Chinese, Filipino, and Korean subgroups being dominant.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049909111426281">1</xref>
</sup> Although empirical research on family therapy and grief exists, there is little focus on its efficacy with minorities, especially Asian Americans.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049909111426281">2</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111426281">3</xref>
</sup> This is largely due to the portrayal of Asian Americans as adaptive and well adjusted; their depiction as a “model minority” is perpetuated by the general public and mental health professionals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111426281">3</xref>
</sup> Nevertheless, Asians are still vulnerable to mental health risks due to stressors associated with immigration and acculturation.</p>
<p>Given this, there is value in exploring the experience of Asian American families during palliative care using a cultural lens. We report on a case series of 3 Asian American families that took part in a larger trial of family therapy during palliative care and bereavement. Our goal in this article is to examine the challenges and opportunities that arise in family work and examine the cultural underpinnings that impact on outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1049909111426281">
<title>The Model of Family-Focused Grief Therapy</title>
<p>The overall model of family-focused grief therapy (FFGT) seeks to improve in families shown by screening to function less than optimally, 3 essential dimensions of family relational life: cohesiveness, communication, and conflict resolution. This is designed to help the family share its grief and cope optimally as a result of improved teamwork and mutual support. In essence, by having the family transition from a stressed to a better functioning group, they can progress through the grief process in a more adaptive fashion.</p>
<p>Because disturbances in family functioning can lead to maladaptive outcomes in bereavement, the larger FFGT study sought to examine the dose of family therapy needed to prevent morbid outcomes such as complicated grief disorder and depression in the bereaved. Families were randomly allocated into 3 study arms: 6 FFGT sessions, 10 FFGT sessions, or standard care, where no therapy was administered. Because this current project focused on the cultural aspects when family therapy was given to Asian families, no standard care families were examined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049909111426281" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Eligible families had to be “at risk” of maladaptive outcomes following the death of the cancer patient and so families were screened with the Family Relationships Index (FRI).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049909111426281">4</xref>
</sup> This 12-item, self-report questionnaire is derived from the well-validated Family Environment Scale (FES) and measures 3 subscales: cohesiveness, expressiveness, and absence of conflict. Each subscale consists of 4 items and when added, a maximum score of 12 could be achieved. For the FFGT study, if 1 or more respondents had a total score of 9 or less, or less than 4 on the cohesiveness subscale, the family was thought to be able to benefit from FFGT and hence eligible to participate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049909111426281">5</xref>
</sup>
<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049909111426281">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Within this Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved, randomized controlled trial, in which 170 families were recruited, 3 families were identified as Asian American. The therapists were social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists who had been trained to deliver FFGT and were regularly supervised to ensure faithful adherence to the model. The supervision sessions helped therapists to better understand each family’s dynamics, discuss any challenges, and clarify their therapeutic goals. Audio-recordings of 26 therapy sessions given to these 3 families and the therapist's notes prepared for supervision were studied in detail. Medical records were also accessed to understand each clinical predicament but only relevant data are presented here. A literature review of Asian American cultural beliefs surrounding end-of-life care informed this overall examination.</p>
<p>As required by the IRB, complete de-identification was used to protect each patient and family’s privacy by changing names, occupations, ages, some genders, residences, and other sensitive information. The constellations of family relationships and their nationality have been retained to demonstrate the effect of their ethnic values on the therapy.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We report here a synopsis of therapy with 3 families whom we have named the Mendoza’s, the Wang’s, and the Zhao’s to illustrate Filipino, Korean Chinese, and Chinese American families, respectively.</p>
<sec id="section5-1049909111426281">
<title>The Mendoza Family</title>
<p>Christian, a Filipino-born dermatologist, was diagnosed with a rare sarcoma within his liver after experiencing an extended period of severe abdominal pain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049909111426281">Figure 1</xref>). He opted to undergo chemotherapy, but as his disease progressed and it became apparent that he would die from this sarcoma, he and his family decided to enroll in FFGT.</p>

</fig>
<p>During therapy, Christian was extremely weak; he barely spoke and needed to lie down during the sessions. He expressed worry about how his family would cope. His wife, Myrna, also had concerns for their 2 sons. She wanted both of them, particularly Alejandro, to be able to share their feelings and improve their communication. However, after 3 initial sessions, Christian and his family opted to discontinue the meetings, feeling that “it was too much.” Shortly after Christian died, Alejandro had an angry “emotional outburst” causing his mother to reach out to the therapist and ask for continued therapy.</p>
<p>The therapist was a Caucasian female psychiatrist trained in using the FFGT model. In dealing with the Mendoza family, she had a difficult time initially fostering emotional communication. Even when asked circular questions, wherein members were asked to step into the shoes of the others and describe their feelings, the sons would answer the questions logistically instead of emotionally. For the Mendoza boys, intellectualization was their primary coping strategy used to deal with Christian’s illness and the grief associated with his death.</p>
<p>However, the children did comfort their mother in her times of need out of obligation. Myrna declared that her children’s embrace was important to her and she expressed distress when she did not receive such comfort. Myrna yearned for her children to share in her grief, a goal that was gradually accomplished in the later sessions. When asked about hugging his mother, Alejandro replied, “I hug her every day when I leave the house. At other times, I only hug her if she looks like she needs it, [if she is] on the verge of crying.” The therapist affirmed the normality and benefit arising from these expressions of affection, gradually normalizing the grief and helping the family to share as they comforted one another. The boys learnt some words through which to share feelings as they met together.</p>
<p>The family had a number of constructive outlets to reorient their lives. Education and advancing one’s career had always been a family priority. The boys saw their school activities as a way to live up to their father’s hopes and expectations. In a sense, they were commemorating their father through advancing their own education. For Myrna, both religion and extra-familial support were also helpful to her mourning. Being a Roman Catholic, she attended mass every day and frequently went with her sons. She was also able to relate to and confide in other women in her close circle of friends; they too had lost loved ones to cancer. Myrna also garnered support from her 4 sisters, who took vacations and spent time with her after Christian’s death.</p>
<p>By the end of 10 sessions, the family appeared to have come to terms with Christian’s death. The elder son, Esteban, felt more comfortable talking about his father, and Myrna believed that her relationship with her children had strengthened. She also stated that therapy had made her children’s needs more apparent. As the sessions terminated, Esteban voiced his desire to help Alejandro find his career path in college, while Myrna understood the need to engage in activities with friends independently of her sons. They all thanked the therapist for her support.</p>

<title>The Wang Family</title>
<p>When Mei, a 41-year-old Chinese mother of 2, had been consented to the study, very few months had passed since her initial diagnosis. She had begun chemotherapy and was experiencing several side effects: hair loss, temperature sensitivity, weakness, and fatigue. Her quality of life was in decline and she was less able to interact with her children. At the first session, she and her husband began to describe her battle with cancer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1049909111426281">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The therapist was a male, Caucasian social worker. He was challenged often as the males in family were very outspoken. Jun and Liu usually dictated the direction of discussion and primarily focused on finding a cure for Mei. When Mei wanted to address her fears, they would quickly dismiss these as “irrational” and instead concentrated on more “optimistic thinking.” The therapist tried to adequately support the only woman in therapy, noting in supervision that this was hard. He had some difficulty understanding Mei’s reliance on religion, which he described as “mystical,” and not fully comprehensible.</p>
<p>Throughout the sessions, Mei's family provided substantial support. Jun, her spouse, played a primary caretaking role, encouraging her to be positive. Liu, her brother, also encouraged her to “beat the cancer,” but sustained regular visits to Mei’s home and helped care for the children.</p>
<p>Mei’s mother, Zhu, was constant in running the household. However, her demands to pursue Eastern medicine became burdensome. Zhu blamed Mei for having developed the cancer, arguing that cancer was not prominent in the family, so that Mei must have done something wrong to bring it upon herself. Indeed, everyone involved in Mei’s care saw her mother as overbearing.</p>
<p>Mei struggled to please everyone in her support network, ever the dutiful Chinese woman, but her main concern was for her children. She worried about how she would be remembered, wanting her children to hold onto a lasting positive image of her. Mei died after the fifth session. For a time in the final session, there was disagreement among the men about Zhu's role in the lives of Jun’s children. Jun shifted the agenda to concentrate on his children’s future, eventually winning Liu’s commitment to help and support their needs.</p>

<sec id="section7-1049909111426281">
<title>The Zhao Family</title>
<p>Huang, a 57-year-old single school counselor, had metastatic gastric cancer at diagnosis and was treated with palliative chemotherapy. She began to sob in the opening session because she could not fulfill her brother Ping’s encouragement that she exercise (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1049909111426281">Figure 3</xref>). She was additionally sensitive to extreme temperatures, felt weak, and had started to lose her hair. Nevertheless, she appeared optimistic about her future, yet was irritable and emotionally explosive with her family, causing some to withdraw and others to criticize her harshly. In light of this, all of the family wanted to improve communication and harmony.</p>

</fig>
<p>The therapist was a female Caucasian psychologist who sought to diffuse conflict that arose from miscommunication. She encouraged the family to explore their ancestral and cultural bases for these conflicts, hoping to strengthen familial bonds.</p>
<p>A high degree of conflict, coupled with low levels of cohesiveness and communication, pervaded the sessions. These arguments revolved around the family’s tendency to speak but not listen to each other; this pattern was most evident in Huang’s relationship with her elder sister, Yan, for whom she carried long-lasting grudges. Huang’s nieces, Emily and Vicky, felt detached from these battles between their aunts, but curious to understand what caused them.</p>
<p>The sisters resented their father’s negative influence in fostering much distrust of men, on which they blamed never marrying. The father was abusive, both physically and emotionally, creating fear that a husband could be like him. Moreover, the sisters could not confront failure well. Huang believed that her main priority was to “be perfect for everyone,” a duty that had been drummed into her as a child. The connection between the family’s unhealthy communication and the father’s influence was a key focus for the therapist. She allowed Huang and her siblings to explore this and openly share the experiences they had with their father, fostering consideration that they could begin to trust more and relate better.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section9-1049909111426281">
<title>Cultural Themes</title>
<p>These 3 Asian American families displayed culturally influenced coping strategies that provided opportunities for effective therapy. Alternatively, culture may serve as an impediment that blocks understanding. Familial hierarchy, balance in gender-based power, intergenerational relationships, preoccupation with shame, and limiting emotional expression emerged as themes from their ethnic backgrounds. In order to facilitate communication, enhance cohesion, and decrease conflict, the therapist must be cognizant of these cultural values and know how to properly manage any resultant tensions.</p>
<p>A hierarchy of power was apparent within each family structure; in general, the line of authority extends from the father to the mother to the firstborn son to the last child.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049909111426281">7</xref>
</sup> This ladder of power highlights the importance of filial piety, which is especially revered in Chinese American families.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049909111426281">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the Mendoza family, the constructs of familial hierarchy and filial piety created conflict. Once Christian had died, Myrna became the authority over her children. During therapy, she asked for physical comfort from her children; whether their actions were authentic or done out of obligation created concern for Myrna. In a Filipino family, younger members are expected to obey their elders,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111426281">9</xref>
</sup> giving rise to a perception of obligatory sympathy that Myrna received from her children.</p>
<p>Similarly, a strong sense of duty created tension in the Wang family. Mei as a daughter to Zhu was expected to follow her instructions about Eastern medicine; on the other hand, as a wife to Jun, she was expected to fulfill his wishes. There were many demands for Mei’s loyalty, which collectively manifested as an obstacle to coping.</p>
<p>For the Zhao family, the father had exercised his superior power to create regret and resentment. He was abusive, demanding, and harsh toward his daughters, which stemmed from his cultural preference to favor his sons. His treatment of his children set them up to unhealthily compete with each other; they strived to gain his approval at the cost of personal fulfillment. Wang and Heppner<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049909111426281">10</xref>
</sup> showed that any discrepancy between perceived parental expectations and one’s performance generated distress, including depression and anxiety. Huang and Yan’s inability to please their father and their tendency to compete may have given rise to the dysfunctional communication evident during therapy.</p>
<p>The hierarchical family structure of the Wang family also exemplified the male dominance that can be culturally determined. As a result, Mei's desire to leave a legacy for her children seemed sidelined. It was striking how Jun and Liu took control of the pace and subject matter, focusing primarily on their goals and what they thought was good for Mei. Such patriarchal behavior is especially common in the Korean culture. The idea of women being subordinate to their husbands is found among older Asian couples.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049909111426281">11</xref>
</sup> Unfortunately, abusive partnerships and domestic violence may result from this.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049909111426281">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049909111426281">12</xref>
</sup> Such male dominance hindered communication about Mei's illness and subsequent sharing of grief.</p>
<p>Another cultural theme that decreased cohesion was difference in lifestyle and beliefs between immigrant parents and their children as they acculturate to life in the United States.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049909111426281">13</xref>
</sup> Immigrants tend to ally with the traditions of their home country, while subsequent generations take on the customs of the host country. When these clash, conflict readily appears. Thus, Filipinos expect a person to be perceptive of another’s needs, as seen with Myrna. Yet an American-born child such as Alejandro lacked an ability to do this, leading to intergenerational conflict.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049909111426281">11</xref>
</sup> Alejandro’s style of providing comfort to his mother out of superficial obligation rather than responsiveness to her distress created a disconnection between these family members.</p>
<p>Another illustration of intergenerational misunderstanding was seen between Mei and her mother, Zhu, who expected Mei to adhere to Eastern practices of taking daily herbs and mushrooms. This practice can be traced back to Zhu’s roots in Taoism, where the balance of “Yin” and “Yang” must be achieved through natural means.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049909111426281">14</xref>
</sup> In addition, Zhu's attribution of blame that Mei caused her illness arose from the Buddhist belief that one’s actions will lead to appropriate consequences. Cancer was brought on by something she had done wrong in her past.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049909111426281">15</xref>
</sup> Knowledge of cultural traditions is crucial to address such intergenerational issues.</p>
<p>Similar intergenerational strain was apparent in the Zhao family, where Emily and Vicky were second-generation descendants of immigrant grandparents. Their alliance with Western beliefs and lifestyles led to a gap in understanding their parents’ experience.</p>
<p>The concept of shame and its relationship with the lack of overt emotional expression is another noteworthy Asian American cultural feature. The Mendoza's may have pulled back from therapy because of the risk of losing face in front of strangers with too much emotionality. In the Filipino culture, the concept of <italic>hiya</italic>, or shame, signifies embarrassment and fear of perceived inferiority.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049909111426281">9</xref>
</sup> This can block seeking help from outside the family.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049909111426281">16</xref>
</sup> <italic>Hiya</italic> can impede sharing feelings. A related concept is machismo, wherein Filipino men are expected to be hyper masculine and prideful.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049909111426281">17</xref>
</sup> In therapy, both sons voiced their opinion that being silent about feelings was important to maintain a masculine composure, a stance perpetuated by both parents. The mother even exclaimed at one point, “They’re not girls! They don’t show emotions!” Therapy that is generally supportive–expressive in style needs to accommodate and respect this <italic>machismo</italic> concept with its proscription against crying. Esteban was always trying to “fight his tears” during therapy. Shame contributing to emotional suppression was also prevalent in the Wang and Zhao families, lest it be seen as weakness and a loss of face.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049909111426281">
<title>Clinical Implications</title>
<p>The FFGT therapist poses questions and remains curious about the many ways that culture can affect the processing of grief. Importantly, the therapist should not try to personally solve the problem, but rather empower the family to work together to draw culturally sensitive conclusions about their coping and mutual support. The therapist remains neutral, yet insightful and reflexive enough to help unpack any points of cultural struggle for the family. By providing behavior-oriented goals, addressing members in an order that respects cultural hierarchy, understanding any intergenerational tensions, creating a strong alliance with all family members to foster culturally sensitive expression of feelings, the therapist will optimally support the family.</p>
<p>Kim has recommended that family therapy be “problem-focused,” “goal-oriented,” and “symptom-relieving” when working with Asian American families, rather than focused on expression of emotion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049909111426281">7</xref>
</sup> Within the FFGT model, the therapist seeks to empower the family to set their own goals, which aims to be culturally sensitive in the process of doing this. For the Mendoza family, focusing on behavior let the family share their grief. The therapist initially used circular questioning to promote communication but was often met with answers that were purely short, factual, and avoidant. For example, when asked, “What do you think would happen if Esteban shared his feelings more?” Myrna would answer, “Well, he could express his feelings if he feels depressed, but there are many things to do aside from getting into depression.” Her action-oriented suggestions were culturally sensitive and did include the use of affection and provision of comfort. Eventually, such behaviors improved the closeness of their family.</p>
<p>Familial hierarchy and male-dominated family structure were other cultural impediments that could block the progress of FFGT. Therapists who do not understand these cultural themes may struggle to make sense of the family dynamics and could fall into the trap of aligning with the men, to the neglect of the women, or vice versa. Asking the family-as-a-whole who should respond first to any question will allow the family itself to determine the order of respondents. If it seems that the men are dominating a session, the therapist can empower the women by introducing questions about their culturally accepted roles and strengths. Chung et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049909111426281">12</xref>
</sup> argue that Asian women draw their power from their household roles; they are responsible for managing finances, caring for children, and performing household duties. By establishing their valuable contributions to the family, communication can be fostered alongside respect.</p>
<p>Addressing intergenerational conflict can be challenging, as seen in the Wang family. Lee, Su, and Yoshida<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049909111426281">18</xref>
</sup> propose using social support seeking and problem solving to deal with intergenerational differences. In Mei’s case, where acceptance and avoidance were her usual coping methods to deal with her mother, the therapist might have asked her to reflect on the value of her relationship with her mother, leading then to ways she could extend her support network or engage in problem solving.</p>
<p>Building a therapeutic alliance with members of a very dysfunctional and fractured family deserves consideration, as some are help rejecting. Pandya and Herlihy<sup>

</sup> suggest that safety is a key element here. A safe environment for the Zhao's was achieved by minimizing instances where they could lose face. The processes of losing face and feeling embarrassed are related to the prominent sense of shame found throughout Asian cultures. Normalizing these reactions is helpful and can further strengthen the therapeutic bond. These techniques helped the Zhao sisters to better understand their father’s contribution to their competitive style, paving the way for improved mutual support.</p>
<p>A final strategy is the use of an intermediary to link with uncommunicative individuals. This intermediary can transmit information across boundaries and create the opportunity to reconcile estranged or conflicted relatives. For the Zhaos, the intermediary was Ping. When he was present, his sisters were able to communicate about their differences more constructively.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There were only 3 Asian American families out of the 170 families enrolled in the larger trial. Because of this limited sample size, it is difficult to generalize the findings. More research would be needed to explore many of the other existing Asian subcultures.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Detailed examination of a cultural group such as Asian Americans deepens our understanding of their traditions and issues that potentially impact on the outcomes of family therapy. This, in turn, assists us to ensure that such therapy is culturally sensitive and responsive to each family’s needs.</p>
