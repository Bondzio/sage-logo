<abstract>
<p>Children with mild disabilities experience sufficient failure to produce negative future expectations (goals), which may compound early academic and social deficits. This research compared the teacher- and student-rated goals of 57 children at two age levels, who were average learners, had a reading problem/disability (RP), and were hyperactive or had ADHD (H). In line with predictions of academic impairment, the findings were that students with RP were teacher-rated more than the H group as less motivated to do their best (work avoidant), especially at older age levels, with fewer goals related to self-determination. Students with H also reported fewer preferences to work well with others and preferred to work independently (social avoidance goals), in line with their social impairment (more than the RP group). Educational implications are presented for identification, for timing of intervention, and for differentiating instruction.</p>

<p>The ability to read in the first grade is directly related to long-term outcomes in student achievement (reading comprehension, vocabulary, and general knowledge), as assessed in a 10-year follow-up study even when partialing out cognitive ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731948711429009">Cunningham &amp; Stanovich, 1997</xref>). This is understood by educators, who see that reading can contribute more generally to performance in academic areas that require reading, such as math, science, and social studies. The importance of reading is magnified by evidence that a reading disorder is one of the most common diagnoses in school-age children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711429009">Bental &amp; Tirosh, 2007</xref>). Students achieving below age or grade level, but who are undiagnosed, add even more students to the current prevalence rates of school-age children with reading disabilities (RD; achieving below IQ expectancy; 5–17% prevalence rates; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0731948711429009">Shaywitz &amp; Shaywitz, 2001</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that these diagnosed and undiagnosed students are comparable in skill deficits and in their response to intervention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0731948711429009">Shaywitz, Morris, &amp; Shaywitz, 2008</xref>). In addition to the identification of these two groups, the current diagnosis of reading disability has changed in response to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731948711429009">2004</xref> reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), retitled as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act. This law requires that levels of interventions must be employed in general education prior to a disability diagnosis (i.e., the eligibility determination procedure known as Response to Intervention, or RtI). The assumption underlying the law is that inadequate instruction cannot be a reason for diagnosis (20 U.S.C. § 1414).</p>
<p>Although each definition will draw different samples of children, what is common across these different definitions is <italic>early failure</italic> in reading. In the current definition, responsibility for failure is now placed more centrally within the instructional context, even though reading disorder is widely accepted to be a within-child skill deficit in phonemic awareness (a skill that underlies decoding abilities).</p>
<p>Another group of students represents the second most common diagnosis in school-age children—attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948711429009">Bental &amp; Tirosh, 2007</xref>). These students with ADHD have also been variously labeled hyperactive, attention problem, attention-deficit disorder (ADD), hyperactive/impulsive subtype, inattentive subtype, and at risk for ADHD. Regardless of the different labeling and levels of severity, all children within this general category are interrelated theoretically in their performance deficits documented under specific low stimulus conditions (i.e., long, repetitive, detailed/complex, or delay tasks; for theory and review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0731948711429009">Zentall, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0731948711429009">Zentall &amp; Zentall, 1983</xref>). Documented even more frequently than academic failure is the social failure of children with ADHD, who are disliked by peers in general education classes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948711429009">Madan-Swain &amp; Zentall, 1990</xref>), and those children who have been clinically labeled are rejected by peers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731948711429009">Mrug, Hoza, Pelham, Gnagy, &amp; Greiner, 2007</xref>). Even a brief encounter with an unfamiliar student with ADHD is sufficient to occasion rejection by typical peers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0731948711429009">Pelham &amp; Bender, 1982</xref>). This failure to establish and maintain positive peer relationships has been linked to long-term negative outcomes across multiple studies (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731948711429009">King et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, we propose that failure is common to both of these mild disability areas and is likely to have consequences in the types of goals that students subsequently endorse. Goals are “essentially what gives activity purpose or meaning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711429009">Maehr &amp; Zusho, 2009</xref>, p. 77). Goal selection has been examined within a number of theoretical frameworks. Traditional theory has examined achievement motivation within the confines of two major goals—mastery and performance. Performance goals are held by individuals who are interested in receiving positive evaluations about their performance in relation to normative comparisons. For example, individuals with performance goals may be motivated to present themselves in a positive light and as having superior skills and ability evaluated in comparison to others (extrinsic motivation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0731948711429009">Nicholls, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0731948711429009">Ohan &amp; Johnston, 2002</xref>). It is unfortunate that performance goals can be problematic when children are placed in difficult academic situations. Under these conditions, children focus on avoiding incompetence, rather than gaining competence. On the other hand, when students endorse mastery goals, it indicates intrinsic motivation to engage in an activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0731948711429009">Schunk, Pintrich, &amp; Meece, 2008</xref>). Individuals with these goals seek academic challenges and demonstrate persistence, which are significant predictors of adaptive academic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948711429009">Barron, Evans, Baranik, Serpell, &amp; Buvinger, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Goal theory has been further divided into classes of goals—achievement and social (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948711429009">Maehr &amp; Zusho, 2009</xref>)—which have been examined in relation to basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness (i.e., self-determination theory; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0731948711429009">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2009</xref>). Self-determination theory proposes that human beings are inherently proactive and begin life with a generally high level of intrinsic motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948711429009">Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985</xref>). However, when academic or social learning failures occur, there is more external (adult) pressure to do well, which can alter a child’s motivation from an intrinsic to an extrinsic orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0731948711429009">Vansteenkiste, Lens, &amp; Deci, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Research examining response to failure has typically assessed immediate response to academic failure. For example, students with ADHD respond to failure immediately with a helpless style (e.g., quitting earlier than their peers), with greater intensity of emotional responses and greater than normal sensitivity to positive and negative social feedback (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731948711429009">Dunn &amp; Shapiro, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0731948711429009">Zentall, 2005a</xref>). Those few studies that examine response to a longer history of failure document that students with ADHD more than typical students report fewer social participatory goals and more performance avoidance goals, and they endorse “performance” goals more than “learning” goals (7– to 12-year-olds, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731948711429009">Dunn &amp; Shapiro, 1999</xref>; 10– to 13-year-olds, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948711429009">Barron et al., 2006</xref>). The only other assessments across a span of time have involved a comparison of ADHD subtypes (Hyperactive/Impulsive vs. Inattentive ADHD, or high aggressive vs. low aggressive ADHD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711429009">Carlson, Booth, Shin, &amp; Canu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731948711429009">Melnick &amp; Hinshaw, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In the field of learning disabilities (LD), students with LD also gave up more easily and had a helpless learning style, more negative emotions (e.g., confusion, anxiety, frustration), and higher levels of work avoidance prior to and immediately following failure on an academic task compared to students without disabilities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0731948711429009">Nelson &amp; Manset-Williamson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0731948711429009">Sideridis, 2005</xref>). In response to a longer history of failure, disability comparisons have been made with typically developing comparisons at one age level. This literature has consistently documented that students with LD have an external locus of control but without finding a clear pattern of goal orientations that differs from typical comparisons (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0731948711429009">Sideridis, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, prior research has primarily examined immediate response to academic failure or contrasted students with and without disability. These disability versus nondisability comparisons fail to provide us with sufficient information about what characterizes one group as different from another mild disability group. As stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0731948711429009">Wong (1986)</xref> about the field of LD, “cumulative research of LD and non-LD children becomes almost redundant since the former children invariably give inferior performances, compared to non-LD children” (pp. 18–19).</p>
<p>Thus, advances in the field at this time may be better served by an assessment of whether a history of failure predicts goal outcomes that are specific to type of failure (disability group) and whether these goal outcomes change over time (e.g., generalize or accumulate). To this purpose in this study, we were interested in recruiting students from two different disability groups and assessing how they differed from one another and from typically developing classmates. This provided an advance over past research because (a) all participants were selected from the same schools (i.e., rather than recruiting clinical and nonclinical samples using different procedures and sources), (b) ratings were made by the students and by their teachers, and (c) two age levels were assessed. We assumed that the effects of failure would be specific at early age levels and generalize across areas over time (i.e., only appear at the older age levels). We predicted that students with reading failure would endorse fewer self-determination achievement goals (greater reliance on others and on external standards, with an avoidance of challenge and of work) relative to the other groups. In contrast, students with behavioral problems and associated social failure would endorse fewer social goals (less reliance on others, less cooperation, more social isolation or social avoidance) especially over time than average learners or students with academic failure.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Fifty-seven children (6 to 11 years in age) were recruited from a suburban Midwestern school of approximately 500 students, with a mean household income of approximately $50,000. The percentage of students eligible for free lunch was 31%, similar to the state’s average of 38%. To assess single-word receptive vocabulary, each child was individually administered Form A of the <italic>Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test</italic> (PPVT-III Form A [test–retest = .91–.94]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731948711429009">Dunn &amp; Dunn, 1997</xref>) and then recruited using a criterion cutoff score of 85 or higher (i.e., average single-word receptive language ability). In each child’s file were data from the most recent winter scores on a computerized reading test (<italic>STAR Reading Test</italic>, version 2.2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0731948711429009">Renaissance Learning Place, 2007</xref>). For this reading test, the reliability coefficients across an interval of 1 week ranged from .79 to .91, and alternate forms reliability ranged from .79 to .91 across grade levels. Construct validity between the <italic>STAR Reading Test</italic> and other standardized tests has yielded correlations between .60 and .90, generally around .80.</p>
<sec id="section3-0731948711429009">
<title>Group status</title>
<p>For our disability groups, we selected students in inclusion contexts with mild to severe problems in reading (i.e., reading difficulties and disabilities) and in social/behavioral characteristics (hyperactivity and ADHD). This procedure of selecting students from a large inclusion school had the advantage of reducing probable co-diagnoses and setting-specific differences in motivation to participate.</p>
<p>Eighteen children—2 of whom were Hispanic—met the criteria of reading problems (RP); 12 of these children were currently receiving services in special education for LD in reading (reading disabled) and the other 6 were at risk for RD. Children labeled by the school as reading disabled had a minimum 18-point score difference between the fifth edition of the <italic>Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0731948711429009">Roid, 2003</xref>) and reading subtests (Letter Word Identification, Word Attack, Passage Comprehension, Reading Vocabulary) on the <italic>Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement–III</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0731948711429009">Woodcock, McGrew, &amp; Mather, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>We combined students with school-defined RD and reading difficulties into one group called RP, at risk for RD, because there were no differences between the diagnosed and non-diagnosed groups in STAR reading, PPVT-III scores, or Conners ratings (see below) and because research has consistently demonstrated that readers achieving below-IQ expectancy and readers achieving below age or grade level are comparable and different from normal-achieving readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0731948711429009">Shaywitz et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>At risk for impairment is a necessary condition for disability diagnosis, and most of these students were receiving extra support (e.g., multi-tiered instructional support) in a Response to Intervention diagnostic system. That is, all of these students scored at least 6 months below grade level expectancy on the <italic>STAR Reading Test</italic> and had been placed in one of three tiered intervention categories. For example, at the third grade, Tier 1 “accommodations” were provided through differentiated instruction for students who fell below the 40th percentile or below a scaled score of 310. Tier 2 “interventions provided” was below the 30th percentile and a scaled score of 257. Tier 3 “urgent interventions needed” was below the 10th percentile and a scaled score of 180. For example, a student in third grade who scored at a grade equivalent of 2.5 would be at the 32nd percentile, with a standard score of 282, and typically would receive in-class accommodations within Tier 1.</p>
<p>Each child for whom we received parental permission had been initially rated by his or her teacher using the <italic>Conners Teacher Rating Scale</italic> (CTRS-28; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731948711429009">Conners, 1989</xref>). The CTRS-28 consists of 28 items constructed to reflect the characteristics of ADHD as stated in the fourth edition, text revision, of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (<italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731948711429009">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). The CTRS-28 demonstrates good internal and test–retest reliabilities (.88–.95 and .72–.92, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731948711429009">Conners, 1989</xref>). ADHD rating scales have been shown to have specificity greater than 94% in studies differentiating children with ADHD from typical age-matched community controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731948711429009">American Academy of Pediatrics, 2001</xref>). Recent evidence has indicated that these teacher ratings, which are not specific to any one day or situation, are moderately to strongly related to student behavior recorded by an independent observer over 3 to 4 days; this further supports the validity of the Conners scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731948711429009">Lauth, Heubeck, &amp; Mackowiak, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>All 17 of these children (2 were Hispanic) had scores in the clinical range of 70 or higher (two standard deviations above the mean of 50; <italic>SD</italic> = 10) on the hyperactive subscale (i.e., behavioral deficits); 6 of these also scored two standard deviations or higher on the Inattentive Passive subscale, and 3 of these 17 students had a pediatric diagnosis of ADHD. We labeled this school-based sample hyperactive (H) and at risk for ADHD, rather than ADHD, because we did not assess age of onset of ADHD symptoms, obtain parental ratings in addition to teacher ratings, assess degree of impairment, or conduct diagnostic interviews. All of these students performed at or above grade level on the STAR computerized reading test.</p>
<p>All 22 comparison (C) children, of whom 3 were Hispanic, scored in the range of 29 to 50 on all subscales of the Conners scale. Scores on the <italic>STAR Reading Test</italic> were at or above grade level.</p>
<p>Screening for children in the above three groups produced a sample with parental permission that overrepresented males. That is, of the students in the H group, 16 were male (1 female); in the RP group, 14 were male (4 female); and in the C group, 18 were male (4 female). This could be explained by the greater number of boys versus girls in that school system (58% males; 42% females), by the parental permissions received, and by the overidentification of boys with disabilities in reading (2–15 to 1) and with ADHD (3–6 to 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731948711429009">Lyon, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948711429009">Polanczyk &amp; Jensen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0731948711429009">Vogel, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0731948711429009">Willcutt, Pennington, Chhabildas, Olson, &amp; Hulslander, 2005</xref>). Such statistics are approximations for this sample because they typically represent clinically referred students with co-occurring disabilities. In this study, we recruited samples without co-occurring disabilities to assess our predictions of different goal outcomes of each group. Furthermore, when students have co-occurring ADHD and RD, the findings suggest a magnification of problems associated with each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731948711429009">Mayes, Calhoun, &amp; Crowell, 2000</xref>). That is, children with RD plus ADHD have more problems in attention and more difficulty with reading than either group singly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731948711429009">Lyon, 1996</xref>). Thus, a co-occurring group would not be considered representative of either group, even though there are some performance equivalencies between the pure and co-occurring groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0731948711429009">Willcutt et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731948711429009">Table 1</xref> presents demographic data that can be used to compare the three groups to assess whether our defining criteria produced significant differences among our groups (i.e., validity). Students in the RP group were significantly lower on <italic>STAR Reading Test</italic> performance than the comparisons and than the students in the H group. Furthermore, the C and H groups did not differ in reading performance. The H group was higher on the Conners subscales (hyperactivity, inattention, and conduct problems) than the other two groups, who did not differ. The RP group was also lower in individually assessed single-word language than the H or C groups, who did not differ. This difference in single-word verbal vocabulary would be expected for students with reading difficulties/disabilities, who have deficits storing and retrieving abstract verbal information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731948711429009">Ghelani, Sidhu, Jain, &amp; Tannock, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Motivational Measures and Procedures</title>
<p>After the researcher assigned students to groups, each teacher, naïve to student group assignment, filled out the scale entitled <italic>Teacher Rating of Academic Achievement Motivation</italic> (TRAAM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0731948711429009">Stinnett &amp; Oehler-Stinnett, 1992</xref>). The TRAAM has good internal consistency (α = .79–.98) and good convergent, discriminative, and predictive validities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0731948711429009">Stinnett &amp; Oehler-Stinnett, 1992</xref>). This questionnaire has 45 items, grouped into six factors, with most items assessing <italic>achievement motivation</italic> (the first factor). The factors are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0731948711429009" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>T1: Amotivation—does the minimum required;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>T2: Mastery—is concerned with learning new things well;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>T3: Academic-Cognitive Skills—lacks basic cognitive skills (assesses teachers’ perceptions of the child’s cognitive ability);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>T4: Academic Work, Completion—completes assignment without teacher intervention;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>T5: Competition—looks to be the best on a given academic task; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>T6: Cooperation—works well with other students (assesses social motivation).</p></list-item></list>
<p>Each student participated in two sessions, each approximately 15 min long. For each session, students were individually escorted to an empty classroom (7 m by 7 m) with 8 tables, each approximately 2 meters long, positioned around the outside perimeter, with three computers against one wall. The participant sat at the end of one table and the researcher sat at the adjacent end, where the tables formed a corner. The first session involved the individual administrations of the PPVT-III.</p>
<p>In the second session, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948711429009">Harter’s (1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731948711429009">1981)</xref> scale of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivational orientation was orally administered individually to each student. This questionnaire was selected as an age-appropriate measure of general academic motivation (i.e., not a specific academic area, such as reading or math). Other scales were considered but were rejected because there was no assessment by teachers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948711429009">Elliott &amp; Murayama, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0731948711429009">Vallerand et al., 1992</xref>), it was used for older students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948711429009">Guay, Vallerand, &amp; Blanchard, 2000</xref>), or it was specific to an academic area, such as reading or math (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731948711429009">Gottfried, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731948711429009">Karsenti &amp; Thiebert, 1996</xref>). The Harter scale has 30 items with five subscale variables:</p>
<list id="list2-0731948711429009" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>H1. Preference for Challenge—for hard versus easy work,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>H2. Curiosity/Interest—preference for learning for interest versus good grades/pleasing teacher,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>H3. Independent Mastery—wants to work independently versus dependence on the teacher,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>H4. Independent Judgment—using own judgments versus the teacher’s, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>H5. Internal Criteria for Success/Failure—one has internal rather than external criteria.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The Harter scale has internal consistency across factors (α = .68–.84), good test–retest (.48–.76), and good predictive validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731948711429009">Harter, 1981</xref>). For example, the Harter subscales have been used in recent research examining the relationships among teacher autonomy-support, parent attachment, scholastic competence, self-worth, and math and reading scores with sixth- and ninth-grade students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0731948711429009">Wong, Wiest, &amp; Cusick, 2002</xref>) and with gifted students versus comparison students examining intrinsic/extrinsic motivation and perceived competence (Vallerand, Gagne, Senecal, &amp; Pelletier, 1994). A modified form of this scale was also used in an assessment of third- through eighth-grade general education students and reported that intrinsic motivation decreased with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731948711429009">Lepper, Corpus, &amp; Iyengar, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>This study was a three-group (hyperactive, reading problems, and typical comparisons) by two age levels (6–8 vs. 9–11 years) cross-sectional design. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to control for the multiple tests run on two scales. The MANOVA yielded main effects of group, <italic>F</italic>(22, 82) = 12.50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001, and grade, <italic>F</italic>(11, 41) = 2.69, <italic>p</italic> = .006. Most important were findings related to the predicted group by grade interactions documented in the MANOVA, <italic>F</italic>(22, 82) = 1.83, <italic>p</italic> = .026. Because receptive single-word language assessed by the PPVT-III was not equivalent (i.e., the RP group scored lower), the univariates that followed from significant effects in the MANOVA were conducted with analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) using the PPVT-III as the covariate, even though an initial analysis indicated that the ANOVAs and ANCOVAs produced the same statistical findings. The ANCOVAs were conducted with least square means (LSMs) used in the SAS general linear model (GLM) procedure, which corrected for an unequal number of participants per group employing a Type III error term.</p>
<sec id="section6-0731948711429009">
<title>Group Differences</title>
<p>Where significant main effects of group were found in the ANCOVA (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731948711429009">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731948711429009">3</xref>), Tukey-Kramer post hoc multiple comparison tests were performed to assess differences among the three population groups. The tests were specified as (a) comparisons versus RP, (b) comparisons versus H, and (c) RP versus H. Effect sizes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0731948711429009">Table 5</xref>) were calculated for all significant <italic>p</italic> values ≤ .1, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731948711429009">Cohen (1992)</xref>. Effect sizes (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731948711429009">Cohen, 1988</xref>) were interpreted as follows: .2 or greater (small), .5 or greater (medium), and .8 or greater (large).</p>

<title>The Harter scale</title>
<p>On the raw scores from this scale that are used in the manual, the self-rated item H1, preference for challenge, documented group differences (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731948711429009">Table 2</xref>); follow-up post hoc comparisons yielded higher scores for typical comparisons than for each group with disabilities, and students with H had higher self-ratings than students with RP. This finding, however, must be interpreted within the context of the higher level group by age interaction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731948711429009">Figure 1</xref>), which is explained by the comparison students who were the only group self-reporting a need for more challenging learning materials (trend: nonsignificant) as they advanced in age level; the other two groups showed a decline (nonsignificant) in need for challenging materials.</p>

<p>Post hocs indicated that students with RP self-rated avoiding challenge more than comparisons at the 6- to 8-year age level (<italic>p</italic> = .017) and at the 9- to 11-year level (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Students with H, however, avoided challenge more than typical comparisons only at the 9- to 11-year level (<italic>p</italic> = .004). There were no significant differences between the at-risk disability groups of H and RP in the need for challenging materials at either age level.</p>
<p>On Item H5, criterion for success judged from internal standards, post hocs yielded higher scores for typical comparisons than students with RP, and students with H also scored higher than students in the RP group. This finding was qualified by a trend for a group by age interaction for internal criteria (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731948711429009">Figure 2</xref>) and is again explained by the comparison students. The C group members’ self-ratings indicated that they were somewhat more likely (<italic>p</italic> = .08) to use internal criteria for judging success in older than younger age levels; the other two groups (RP and H) showed a nonsignificant decline in the use of internal criteria. Follow-up contrasts yielded differences in using internal criteria for judging success only at the older 9- to 11-year level between RP (<italic>M</italic> = 1.9, <italic>SEM</italic> = .2) and comparison (<italic>M</italic> = 2.7, <italic>SEM</italic> = .2) groups.</p>

<p>On the other self-rated items, the only main effects were for group (i.e., no interactions with age). For example, on learning through curiosity and interest rather than pleasing others, the C group had higher scores than the RP group. There was only a trend (.067) for differences between the H and C groups. The H group, however, self-rated higher in curiosity-based learning than the RP group, <italic>F</italic>(2, 54) = 9.16, <italic>p</italic> = .004. Similar RP versus comparison group differences were found for independent mastery (H3). On related Item H4, the H group and the C group self-rated higher in preferences for independent judgment than students with RP.</p>

<p>Main effects of age were documented in the MANOVA on the teacher ratings (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0731948711429009">Table 3</xref>). Follow-up ANCOVAs yielded significant effects for the students’ self-rating of internal judgments/standards, with older students (<italic>M</italic> = 2.81, <italic>SD</italic> = .75) more likely to report using internal standards than younger students (<italic>M</italic> = 2.06, <italic>SD</italic> = .69). Teacher ratings yielded age effects for work completion, indicating that older students (<italic>M</italic> = 8.07, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.99) were more likely to complete work without teacher intervention than younger students (<italic>M</italic> = 7.33, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.06).</p>
<p>On this teacher-rated scale, ANCOVAs also yielded main effects of disability group, with higher scores for comparison students than for each group of students with or at risk for disabilities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0731948711429009">Table 4</xref>) on the teacher-rated items for amotivation (T1)—preferring to do more than minimum work, mastery (T2)—more motivation to learn new things well, academic-cognitive skills (T3), academic work completion (T4), and cooperation or working well with others (T6). Disability group contrasts were documented indicating that the H group was given higher ratings by teachers than the RP group (all <italic>p</italic> values &lt; .0001) on academic-cognitive skills (T3) and on competition—tries to be the best in an academic task (T5). In contrast, students with RP had higher teacher ratings on preferences for cooperation and working with others (T6) than did the students with H.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined the goals of elementary-age children with mild disabilities (or at risk for disabilities) and their peers without disabilities at two age levels (6–8 and 9–11 years). We predicted that the academic failures of students with reading difficulties/disabilities or RP would be associated with the secondary outcomes of lowered achievement-related goals and greater reliance on external criteria, relative to both the other student groups. The social/behavioral failures of students at risk for ADHD (H) were expected to be associated with lower social goals relative to both of the other student groups. To the degree that failure in reading generalizes to social areas of competence, social avoidant goals could be outcomes for the RP group, but only at later age levels. For students at risk for ADHD (H), we considered the possibility that lowered achievement-related goals would be outcomes only during later years, in line with evidence that general educators are less willing than special educators to provide individualized accommodations for these students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0731948711429009">Zentall &amp; Stormont-Spurgin, 1995</xref>). To address these predictions, both teachers and students served as data sources.</p>
<p>We initially report consistencies in perception between student and teacher ratings to document the validity of students’ self-perceptions. Of the six items on the teacher scale and the five on the child-rating scale, several items were parallel. For example, the teacher ratings of “learning new things well” and the student rating of preferences for learning based on interest (vs. good grades and pleasing the teacher) indicated that both rater sources independently agreed that the RP group scored lower when endorsing intrinsic learning goals than comparisons. In general, we interpret this finding to indicate that students with RP are aware that their goals are tied to pleasing adults rather than being internally motivated. Teachers also reported that the learning of students with H was not as internally directed as that of typically developing students; this was significant in the teacher ratings with a supportive trend (.067) in the self-ratings of students with H. Parallel assessments were also found in self-determination using T4 (work completion without teacher assistance) and H3 (working independently) plus H4 (uses own judgment). Teachers and students with RP both agreed on lower ratings than for comparisons on each item of not working independently and not using their own judgment. However, teachers saw students with H as equivalent to comparisons in using their own judgment, and the students with H similarly rated themselves higher than did the RP group on independence of judgment (H4). Finally, students with RP were rated by their teachers as having lower cognitive skills than comparisons and lower than students with H. These teacher ratings were further validated by the demographic comparisons that were made among these three groups in PPVT-III scores. Thus, where we could assess convergence of ratings, we found agreement between the ratings of educators and students with mild disabilities and between independent assessments and teacher ratings of cognitive ability. Overall, we interpret these parallel findings to suggest the validity of our sources—both teachers and students.</p>
<p>Given this background of interrater reliability, we now summarize the teachers’ data. Both groups of students identified as RP and H were rated by their teachers as being less willing than comparison students to (a) invest effort beyond minimum work (amotivation), (b) learn new things (mastery), (c) complete assignments without teacher intervention (academic work completion), and for only students with RP, (d) looking to be best at academic tasks (competition). These findings document how children with mild disabilities differ from their classmates and support prior research on individual disability versus nondisability findings that students with reading disabilities assume less responsibility for academic achievement than students without disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731948711429009">Meltzer, Katzir, Miller, Reddy, &amp; Roditi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0731948711429009">Wilson &amp; David, 1994</xref>) and clinically defined students with ADHD were rated higher on “does the minimum required” and lower on willingness to learn new things well, to use internal criteria for judging success or failure, and to work well with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711429009">Carlson et al., 2002</xref>) than comparisons. These disability versus nondisability differences support prior research findings and further suggest equivalence between outcomes for clinical (diagnosed) and nonclinical LD and ADHD populations.</p>
<p>More important, this study provides the basis for understanding contrasts between two disability groups. Because academic failure is a defining feature of RP and is experienced early (Grades 2–3), we predicted that they would be rated and endorse fewer academic goals related to achieving competence than students with H. In support, students with RP self-reported lower preferences than students with H for learning through curiosity and interest or making independent judgments, rather than pleasing others. In other words, students with RP endorsed learning experiences with a greater reliance on external criteria that were not based on their own curiosity or interests than students with H.</p>
<p>Students with RP also reported lower preferences for difficult work (Challenge) than students with H. However, a group by age interaction better explained this finding. Follow-up analyses of this interaction indicated that students with RP were less motivated to do difficult work than typical comparisons at both age levels, whereas students with H were less motivated to do difficult work than comparisons only at the older age level. Thus, students with H were initially equivalent to their peers in responsiveness to challenging assignments, with generalized avoidant responses to academics documented over time at the age level of 9 to 11 years.</p>
<p>In addition, students with RP were rated by their teachers as having less motivation for doing their best (Competition) than students with H. Differences between these groups could be explained by the parallel lower teacher ratings on cognitive skills for the RP than for the H group. However, we did partial out PPVT-III vocabulary scores from the analysis. Thus, verbal skills did not appear to be a sufficient explanation for differences between disability groups in teacher ratings of wanting to do one’s best. These observed differences are more likely to be attributed to the high scores of the H group more than to the low scores of the RP group. That is, teachers also rated students with H as being more competitive than comparisons but equivalent to this group in PPVT-III vocabulary skills. Also, prior work with clinical samples of students with ADHD more than typical comparisons preferred to “do better than others” than to learn something from an experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731948711429009">Dunn &amp; Shapiro, 1999</xref>) and the hyperactive/impulsive subtype of ADHD was rated higher in competitiveness by parents and teachers than typical children and more than the inattentive subtype (with differences in verbal aptitude covaried; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711429009">Carlson et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, students with H stand above both other groups in wanting to “do better than others.”</p>
<p>More specific, for the group of students with H, we predicted that they would endorse fewer affiliation goals than students with RP in response to their early social failure. This was based on their defining characteristic of behavioral/social deficits but also from evidence of changes in sociability for students with ADHD. That is, 15-month-old children later identified as ADHD demonstrated a greater need for social stimulation or more social glances, yet adolescents reported more time spent alone with fewer social interactions and less social confidence (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0731948711429009">Zentall, 2005a</xref>). In the current study, there was only one teacher-rated item that assessed this prediction. On this item and in support of this prediction, we found that students with H were teacher-rated as less motivated to work well with other students than both comparison and RP groups. We found that teachers can observe this social goal difference as early as 6 to 8 years of age (i.e., before the social isolation described for adolescents with ADHD).</p>
<p>Prior research has documented main effects of age, suggesting that older students more than younger students show (a) greater use of internal criteria, (b) greater work avoidance, and (c) fewer social participation goals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731948711429009">Eccles, Wigfield, &amp; Schiefele, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948711429009">Harter, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731948711429009">Lepper et al., 2005</xref>). In the current study employing a design with both group and age factors, older students were similarly rated as more likely to use internal standards and more likely to complete work without teacher intervention. However, this main effect of age was better explained by group by age interactions that were obtained on the teacher rating scale (use of internal criteria and amotivation). That is, only at the older age levels did the RP group less frequently endorse internal criteria (less self-reliance) than comparisons and were more work-avoidant than students with H. These findings provide more information than the main effects documented with typically developing students and suggest that cumulative failure could explain losses of intrinsic motivation, in support of the self-determination theory.</p>

<title>Educational Implications</title>
<sec id="section11-0731948711429009">
<title>Implications for identification</title>
<p>Related to the identification of children with mild disabilities, our teachers rated students with H equivalently to students with RP in their failure to complete academic tasks and in their investment of minimal effort. Although teachers can accurately assess assignment completion, it may be more difficult to judge how much effort is actually expended by students (i.e., effort should be evaluated only within the context of the difficulty or tedium of the task). In any case, what teachers observe is assignment completion and apparent effort, and these classroom types of behavior may be defining in identifying children on a trajectory of failure.</p>
<p>Our findings also support prior conclusions that clinically defined groups are similar to students without a clinical label (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0731948711429009">Shaywitz &amp; Shaywitz, 2001</xref>). In this study, students with mild disabilities (12 of the 18 with a clinical diagnosis of RD and 3 of 17 with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD) were equivalent to previous research using all clinically defined students, which also reported differences from normal comparisons in competitiveness, willingness to learn new things well, use of internal criteria, working well with others, and does the minimum required.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0731948711429009">
<title>Implications for early intervention</title>
<p>The group by age effects we documented have implications for early intervention (i.e., before goals and expectations about future performance compound early academic and social failure). That is, there were differences between disability groups that were dependent on an advanced age level. For example, we found equivalencies at 6 to 8 years, whereas for 9- to 11-year-olds, there were between-group differences. For example, during the early elementary years, teachers rated the two disability groups as equivalent and greater than typical comparisons in work avoidance, but at these early ages, students with H were just as responsive to challenging assignments as comparisons. Only at the older age levels did students with H self-report lower preferences for challenging work (more work avoidance goals) than typical comparison students.</p>
<p>Our conclusions also provide generality for findings with clinically defined students with ADHD, who were reported to show less desire than typically developing peers for challenging tasks in response to experimentally induced immediate failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731948711429009">Dunn &amp; Shapiro, 1999</xref>). That is, our findings extend findings of “learned helplessness,” but differently from Dunn and Shapiro’s conclusions with 7- to 12-year-olds, we observed that decreased preferences for challenging tasks do not become a “style” variable for the H group until the older 9- to 11- years age level. These findings will need to be supported by further research, using longitudinal rather than prospective assessments.</p>
<p>Also at the older elementary-age level, students with RP were teacher-rated as showing even more work avoidance than students with H (and more than comparisons) and as self-reporting lower preferences than comparisons for using internal criteria for judging success (lower self-determination). It should be noted that these changes in goals were documented even though two thirds of our sample of students with RP were receiving special education services at the time of the study, with the remaining students receiving in-class accommodations. These findings suggest the compounding of failure over time, which was manifested by decreased self-reliance and increased work avoidance goals. However, we did not find generalization from academic work avoidance to social avoidance for the RP group relative to their peers at the advanced age level.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0731948711429009">
<title>Implications for instruction</title>
<p>As general and special education teachers and consultants are increasingly responsible for educating students with disabilities within general education, it is clear that providing accommodations for differences among these groups of students can be particularly challenging. Evidence from this study provides useful information for differentiating the instruction of students with mild to severe reading problems differently from students at risk for and with ADHD. When generalizing these observed disability group differences, it is important to remember that we selected children with hyperactivity (H) who had average reading scores (i.e., without RD). With this in mind, we found that students with H were more likely than students with RP to want to learn through their own interests or curiosity (learning or mastery goals) and to independently evaluate their own performance or make independent judgments (self-determination goals). At advanced age levels, students with RP were more work avoidant than students with H (and relied less on their own internal standards than comparisons).</p>
<p>Perhaps the implications of these findings are to reinforce the efforts of students with RP (rather than their level of performance, which may always be lower) and to encourage independent standards and interests early in their curriculum before they have experienced significant academic failure. On the positive side, students with RP preferred working cooperatively (social approach goals) more than the H group. Thus, providing them with cooperative activities may allow them to compensate for skill deficiencies, learn from their peers, and develop an understanding of their own interests.</p>
<p>Stated from the vantage point of the H group, we assumed that significantly higher ratings on hyperactivity, inattention, and conduct problems (relative to both the RP and the comparison groups) would be associated with social problems (i.e., as consistently documented with clinical and nonclinical samples of students with H or ADHD). In line with our predictions of increased social avoidance goals, students with H across age levels more than students in the RP group preferred working independently and using their own judgments (self-determination).</p>
<p>They also endorsed goals of wanting to do their best on academic tasks (competitive performance goals) more than students with RP (and more than comparisons). Past research has similarly documented that students with the Hyperactive/Impulsive subtype have competitive needs (i.e., the social display of competence) more than typical students and more than students with the Inattentive subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948711429009">Carlson et al., 2002</xref>). The implications of these findings are twofold. First, it may be important to teach them how to actively participate in cooperative activities (e.g., to take turns, arrive at group consensus, and justify responses; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731948711429009">Kuester &amp; Zentall, in press</xref>). The second implication is to incorporate their competitive, independent style into their learning opportunities (e.g., by using self-competition with the computer, “besting” their own performance using graphs, game formats). Their need to display competence socially (competition) is somewhat difficult to understand given their avoidance of challenge, documented only at the older age levels for students with H (relative to comparisons). This apparent discrepancy could be attributed to the definition of difficulty for these students, who are more likely to have performance deficits than skill deficits. That is, students with ADHD learn over time that repetitive/rote, long, non-active, non-interesting tasks are more challenging for them (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0731948711429009">Zentall, 2005b</xref>). To address these performance deficits (i.e., the avoidance of boredom), increased choice (assignments, topics, reporting methods, etc.) and increased novelty and activity in assignments could offset their decreased response to challenge at the older age level. This conclusion is supported by evidence that the H group was more interested in learning through interest/curiosity than the RP group in this study.</p>
<p>Overall, these conclusions must be interpreted within the limitations of the study, which are the administration of scales in a prospective study with relatively small samples of 6- to 11-year-old students and their teachers, using items that were not all parallel. In contrast, the practicality and generality of this research is supported by previously documented disability versus nondisability research findings, a priori predictions specific to type of disability and age level, and the large effect sizes reported for the majority of between-group effects.</p>
<p>Within this overall context, our novel findings suggest that type of failure produces failure-specific goals, some of which appear to be altered by cumulative experiences over time. The social/behavioral failures and social avoidance documented for students at risk for ADHD were compounded with less motivation to do difficult work only for older students. Yet, these students maintained cross-age reliance on their own judgment (equivalent to typical comparisons) and retained their competitive goal orientation (more than either of the other groups). For students with achievement failure, there was less motivation to do difficult work at both age levels and less self-determination and independence (more pleasing of others) than for the C or H groups, but no evidence of spread to decreased social goals.</p>
