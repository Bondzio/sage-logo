<abstract>
<p>This article explores the concept of a rational sentencing structure for imposing internal police discipline that helps practitioners make more reasoned and consistent decisions when dispensing discipline. The data consists of 360 hr of participant observation of police trials involving sworn police officers and civilian employees in the Newark, New Jersey Police Department. Various agency records provide an understanding of the formal influences surrounding police discipline. The findings suggest a disciplinary sentencing matrix is more rational than the traditional discretionary method, which is largely informal and relies on best estimates. The matrix may increase consistency in disciplinary sentences, which is an important aspect of organizational justice that leaves police employees with a sense of fairness in management’s disciplinary decisions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>How police employees are treated by their organization during disciplinary proceedings is an understudied topic. Some research suggests there may be a direct correlation between the way employees are treated by their organization and the employee’s behavior, which may influence the employee’s commitment to organizational goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1098611111433026">Greenberg, 1990</xref>). Organizational justice describes a series of related processes and behaviors that take place in the work environment that influence employee behavior, such as treating employees fairly, reaching equitable decisions, and imposing proportionate penalties for wrongdoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1098611111433026">Folger &amp; Greenberg, 1985</xref>). Achieving greater employee commitment and organizational goals may be predicated on whether those employees hold favorable or unfavorable perceptions of trust, citizenship, and legitimacy in the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1098611111433026">Kwong &amp; Leung, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1098611111433026">Moorman, Neihoff, &amp; Organ, 1993</xref>). The general belief is that the more an employee feels affiliated and embraced by the organization, the more positive their performance. Conversely, when employees feel disconnected, alienated, or not part of the “in group,” there may be an increase in disaffection and a decrease in performance.</p>
<p>Although the management and organizational psychology literature are replete with studies showing the interaction between negative attitudes and behaviors in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098611111433026">Cropanzano &amp; Greenberg, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1098611111433026">Folger &amp; Greenberg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098611111433026">Greenberg, 1986</xref>), except for two technical reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1098611111433026">Providence External Review Authority, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1098611111433026">Walker, 2003a</xref>) and one article appearing in a trade publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1098611111433026">International Association of Chiefs of Police, 2006</xref>), there were no peer-reviewed articles located that discuss solutions for reducing disparity in police disciplinary sentences, which is an aspect of organizational justice.</p>
<p>This is a neglected area of police management research and is the focus of this article, which explores a single question: What is the prospect for increasing consistency in police discipline through a rational-technical framework? Designing the model then encouraging police executives to implement it could add value to the largely unknown dimension of internal police discipline, as well as extend the organizational justice literature. A rational sentencing framework is also an important and overlooked aspect of police employees’ procedural due process that may keep management’s disciplinary decisions from being reduced or overturned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1098611111433026">Bohlander, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1098611111433026">Dhanoa &amp; Kleiner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1098611111433026">Fairbanks &amp; Stewart, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1098611111433026">Florey, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The majority of historical and contemporary literature on police discipline is focused on accountability systems that address how complaints against the police are handled, public access to the complaint process, citizen oversight, and how citizens are treated by the police during the complaint process (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1098611111433026">American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1098611111433026">Chevigny, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098611111433026">De Angelis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1098611111433026">Finn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1098611111433026">Fogel, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1098611111433026">Human Rights Watch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1098611111433026">McCoy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1098611111433026">Noble &amp; Alpert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1098611111433026">Page &amp; Swanton, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1098611111433026">Smith, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1098611111433026">Stone, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1098611111433026">U.S. Department of Justice, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1098611111433026">U.S. Civil Rights Commission, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-1098611111433026">Walker, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-1098611111433026">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-1098611111433026">2003b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-1098611111433026">2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The focus has not been about administering internal discipline fairly and consistently, such as the limits of upper police management’s discretion to impose discipline; how officers are treated during the disciplinary process; what punishment is “just” given the infraction; and the consequences of disproportionate sentences, such as stress, cynicism, and lack of organizational commitment. In their book on police accountability systems, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1098611111433026">Noble and Alpert (2009</xref>, pp. 232-233) devote just two paragraphs to “penalty guidelines” and do not delve deeply into this emerging concept. Previous studies examining the causes for reducing or reversing management-imposed discipline reveal some consistencies over time, most notably the presence of mitigating circumstances, due process violations, excessive punishment, and lack of evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098611111433026">Bohlander &amp; Blancero, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1098611111433026">Karim &amp; Stone, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1098611111433026">Stone, 1969</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, police management is frequently spared the criticism and accountability for the failings of its members, notwithstanding the influence management has over the organizational atmosphere and socialization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1098611111433026">Armacost, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1098611111433026">Bayley, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1098611111433026">Chemerinsky, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1098611111433026">Ford, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1098611111433026">Goldsmith, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1098611111433026">Jermier &amp; Berkes, 1979</xref>, p. 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-1098611111433026">Walker, 1993</xref>). It is far easier to point to the moral failings of individual officers by labeling them <italic>disciplinary problems</italic> and branding them “rotten apples” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1098611111433026">Sherman, 1974</xref>) than it is to acknowledge that management may be systematically turning its officers into behavior problems by treating them unfairly.</p>
<p>Administering fair and consistent discipline is an important aspect of organizational justice and citizenship, which has implications for the employer–employee relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1098611111433026">Schalk &amp; Rousseau, 2001</xref>). Doing so may reduce perceived disparities in disciplinary sentences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1098611111433026">Hickman, Piquero, &amp; Greene, 2000</xref>), reduce real or perceived workplace inequity and discrimination, particularly among minority officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1098611111433026">Adarlo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1098611111433026">Anglen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1098611111433026">Bolton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1098611111433026">Bolton &amp; Feagin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1098611111433026">Dulaney, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1098611111433026">Fenton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1098611111433026">Jackson, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1098611111433026">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1098611111433026">Johnson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1098611111433026">Marzulli, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1098611111433026">Mollen Commission, 1994</xref>, pp. 99-101; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1098611111433026">Queally, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1098611111433026">Rampart Independent Review Panel, 2000</xref>, pp. 9-11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1098611111433026">Rojek &amp; Decker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-1098611111433026">Wilber, 2005</xref>), and may raise organizational commitment by raising police officers’ faith in the internal system of justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111433026">Eskew, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1098611111433026">Moorman et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>As the disciplinary and sentencing processes are laden with informalities and discretion, the decision to impose a specific sentence in the instant matter is not typically guided by a decision rubric and may result in disparate treatment among similarly situated officers. Police officers are likely to appeal sanctions they perceive as unfair in administrative court or file a union grievance that is subject to an arbitrator’s review. The officers are frequently victorious in their appeal; in some cases, arbitrators reduce management-imposed discipline by as much as 50% to 70% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1098611111433026">Iris, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1098611111433026">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1098611111433026">Pinkerton, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>While this raises the impression that overall arbitrators may be lenient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1098611111433026">Weisbord, 1995</xref>), or that arbitrators may reduce sentences to appear fair and impartial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1098611111433026">Elkouri &amp; Elkouri, 1985</xref>, pp. 125-126), or that police discipline may be lenient compared with other municipal employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1098611111433026">LaVan, 2007</xref>), it also raises another hypothesis: Arbitrators recognize inconsistent and disparate treatment among similarly situated officers and the sentences are reduced to restore equity and balance between labor and management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1098611111433026">Blancero &amp; Bohlander, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098611111433026">Bohlander &amp; Blancero, 1996</xref>). Self-imposing sentencing standards that limit police managers’ discretion, which might reduce disparity in punishment is an emerging practice, one that finds favor in a sentencing matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1098611111433026">Kraus, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Results of Disparate Sentencing Practices</title>
<p>With the growth of police officers’ rights and due process protections in labor and employment law (e.g., <italic>Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1098611111433026">1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1098611111433026">Florey, 1999</xref>; <italic>Gardner v.

Weingarten</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1098611111433026">1975</xref>), police officers are more willing to challenge the utility of the agency’s disciplinary practices through established means such as civil lawsuits and administrative processes (e.g., mediation; merit system protection board; arbitration; union grievance; unfair labor practice) instead of passively accepting the punishments rendered by management, whom they see as distant, illegitimate authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1098611111433026">Peak, 1990</xref>, p. 64; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1098611111433026">Thibault, Lynch, &amp; McBride, 1985</xref>, p. 4).</p>
<p>Police officers may realize that the agency for which they work does not necessarily support their plight, nor is it a source of comfort and fairness during disciplinary proceedings. In both “distributive” terms (the fairness of outcomes) and “procedural” terms (the fairness surrounding procedures in reaching those outcomes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1098611111433026">Folger &amp; Greenberg, 1985</xref>), extraneous factors such as length of service, rank, race, sex, kinship, and other favoritism play a role in meting out discipline; favoritism in particular has been cited as an organizational stressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1098611111433026">Klockars, Ivkovic, &amp; Haberfeld, 2006</xref>, chapter 10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1098611111433026">Kroes, Margolis, &amp; Hurrell, 1974</xref>) and as a corrosive management practice that leads to corruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1098611111433026">Khatri &amp; Tsang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1098611111433026">LaFraniere, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1098611111433026">Mollen Commission, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1098611111433026">Philadelphia Police Study Task Force, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Two prominent investigative commissions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1098611111433026">Mollen Commission, 1994</xref>, pp. 63-64; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1098611111433026">Rampart Independent Review Panel, 2000</xref>, p. 9) drew similar conclusions about unequal treatment during the disciplinary process. The Commissions’ findings are also consistent with one earlier study that revealed differential treatment during the disciplinary process may arise from “. . . special interests and politics . . .”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1098611111433026">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1098611111433026">Melnicoe &amp; Menning, 1978</xref>, p. 193) that are unrelated to the merits of the allegation.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles (Los Angeles Police Department [LAPD]), the Rampart investigation concluded the most contentious defect in the disciplinary system, from the employees’ perspective, was the department’s failure to confine and structure discretion within a matrix of sentencing/punishment options for personnel whose allegations of wrongdoing are sustained. Police personnel felt there was a “. . . widely perceived double standard: Staff and command officers were almost universally thought to receive more lenient sanctions than rank and file” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1098611111433026">Rampart Independent Review Panel, 2000</xref>, p. 97). Top executives of the LAPD confirmed that when dispensing sanctions the Department would “. . . ‘come down hard’ on an officer with little time in service, but officers who have been with the LAPD for many years would ‘catch a break’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1098611111433026">Rampart Independent Review Panel, 2000</xref>, p. 97). This sort of differential treatment implies the merits of the case mean less than who the officer’s “hook”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1098611111433026">2</xref></sup> might be.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1098611111433026">Mollen Commission (1994</xref>, pp. 63-64) investigating corruption in the New York City Police Department found that favoritism in the disciplinary process at the upper ranks of the agency contributed to officers’ cynicism, which helped corrupt officers neutralize their deviant behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1098611111433026">Sykes &amp; Matza, 1957</xref>) while keeping honest officers silent about other officers’ behavior. The officers’ appeal to each others’ loyalty instead of to the profession arose from negative personal or vicarious interactions with police administrators. Political affiliations and favoritism tend to influence the disciplinary process to such a degree that those without such affiliations (i.e., “hooks”) may be dealt with more harshly.</p>
<p>Disparate treatment also creates an air of unpredictability, which forces the recipient to absorb a great deal of uncertainty since fair warning of the consequences for behavior are not promulgated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1098611111433026">Karim &amp; Stone, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1098611111433026">Stone, 1969</xref>). If notice of the consequences of disciplinary action are withheld from the employee, or if the employee does not know what consequences to expect from their behavior, or if the sentences are shrouded in secrecy, then the employees’ perception is that the agency is their adversary and is out to harm them rather than embrace them as a valued member. This may raise due process violations that results in reversing discipline and may create apprehensive feelings and anxiety that lowers an employee’s support for the organization and commitment to its goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1098611111433026">Armeli, Eisenberger, Fasolo, &amp; Lynch, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1098611111433026">Eskew, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1098611111433026">Moorman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1098611111433026">Tansky, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Policies created by and decisions executed by supervisors and managers on behalf of the organization are seen as “indicators of the organization’s intent” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1098611111433026">Armeli et al., 1998</xref>, p. 288; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1098611111433026">Levinson, 1965</xref>). The intent conveyed by the organization when its disciplinary practices are perceived as unfair is that the employees are expendable and are not valued. Conversely, when the agency’s policies and decisions indicate concern for the employee, and strong employee–supervisor relationships exist, perceived organizational support and performance tend to increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1098611111433026">Tansky, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-1098611111433026">Wayne, Shore, &amp; Linden, 1997</xref>). How employers craft disciplinary sentencing policies is important because employers are responsible for promulgating reasonable and fair policies and procedures that ultimately bind employees. There is some evidence to suggest that police chiefs’ perceptions of agency policies may promote positive organizational change in police departments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1098611111433026">Time &amp; Payne, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Lower Standard of Proof in Police Disciplinary Cases</title>
<p>The lower standard of proof required to sustain a disciplinary charge and the strict liability nature of agency rules and policies facilitates the perception that the agency is, at best, the officer’s adversary. Regardless of an officer’s culpability, he or she is responsible for their acts or omissions and the resulting loss due to their conduct. This limits the officer’s ability to mount an adequate defense as his or her intent need not be proven by the agency or considered as a mitigating factor. The agency must show only by a “preponderance of the evidence” that the officer acted in a manner proscribed by a rule or policy, not “beyond a reasonable doubt,” which reduces the agency’s burden. This is partly why administrative investigations are often perceived as more intrusive than criminal investigations since they are not subject to the same Constitutional guarantees and rules of evidence as a criminal trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1098611111433026">Wechter, 2004</xref>). Therefore, finding an officer guilty during disciplinary proceedings is easier since the officer has fewer protections, and once a guilty finding is rendered the choice of sentence is left to the chief’s discretion.</p>

<sec id="section6-1098611111433026">
<title>The Influence of Police Unions on Discipline</title>
<p>Sentencing police officers in an informal manner has caused an internal hue and cry against unfair treatment and disproportionate discipline from individual officers and organized labor unions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1098611111433026">Jackson, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1098611111433026">2009</xref>). American police unions have grown in size and strength since the Boston police strike of 1919, with an upsurge following the tumultuous 1960s. Police unions now occupy a central role in collective bargaining and the policy-making process, including the right to negotiate disciplinary practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1098611111433026">Bouza, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1098611111433026">Finnane, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1098611111433026">Jacobs, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1098611111433026">LaVan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1098611111433026">Russell, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1098611111433026">Schachter, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-1098611111433026">Walker, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-1098611111433026">2008</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1098611111433026">Kliesmet, 1985</xref> for an opposing view).</p>
<p>Police unions also expend considerable political, managerial, and judicial capital to protect their members and to improve working conditions, including aggressive lobbying efforts. Those lobbying efforts are reflected in the “Law Enforcement Officer’s Procedural Bill of Rights Act of 2009,” introduced by the 111th U.S. Congress (2009-2010).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1098611111433026">3</xref></sup> If adopted, the law will afford police officers increased workplace protections, particularly against the internal affairs and administrative disciplinary processes. Congress found significant shortcomings in police officers’ due process rights including unfair treatment and a loss of trust and confidence among officers during internal affairs investigations and disciplinary proceedings, which is consistent with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1098611111433026">Bohlander &amp; Blancero, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1098611111433026">Karim &amp; Stone, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1098611111433026">Stone, 1969</xref>). These shortcomings figured prominently in a federal lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey against the Newark Police Department in September 2010. The lawsuit alleges, in part, that there is</p>

<p>. . . recurring conflict between officers and superiors, which has manifested in charges and countercharges of discrimination, retaliation, gross disparities and iniquities in the police disciplinary system, and other improper conduct, along with cases seeking substantial damages for the violation of federal labor and employment laws. (p. 2)<sup>4</sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The same Congress also introduced the Public Safety Employer–Employee Cooperation Act of 2009 and companion legislation (S-3194) which is intended to compel collective bargaining between police unions and their employer for cities and states that do not already have collective bargaining.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1098611111433026">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The broad language in the proposed legislation, as well as existing contractual language in some police labor agreements such as “maintenance of standards,” “working conditions,” “terms and conditions of employment,” and “prevailing benefits,” covers a wide variety of employment articles and ensures the union retains the right to negotiate the terms of employment, including disciplinary policies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1098611111433026">6</xref></sup> While some see this as labor’s encroachment on management’s rights, others see it as off-setting management’s natural authority over the workforce.</p>

<sec id="section7-1098611111433026">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>Resolving issues of fairness when imposing internal police discipline are rooted in equity theory, which describes the perceived fairness in processes and outcomes in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1098611111433026">Adams, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1098611111433026">Greenberg, 1988</xref>). The notion of organizational justice is embedded in equity theory, where two distinct constructs—distributive justice and procedural justice—have been identified. Distributive justice refers to the outcome of a particular decision (e.g., the type discipline imposed; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1098611111433026">Folger, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1098611111433026">Jones, 1998</xref>), and procedural justice refers to the manner in which the decision was reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1098611111433026">Cropanzano &amp; Greenberg, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1098611111433026">Folger &amp; Greenberg, 1985</xref>). The manner in which outcomes are decided is important because although officers may disagree with the outcome they are likely to accept it if they believe they have been treated fairly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1098611111433026">Greenberg, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1098611111433026">Tyler, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1098611111433026">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Building trust and legitimacy from a distributive and procedural perspective requires police managers to impose disciplinary sentences that are commensurate with the infraction and the culpability of the officer, a process grounded in the “just deserts” philosophy of punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1098611111433026">International Association of Chiefs of Police, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1098611111433026">Sandurski, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1098611111433026">von Hirsch, 1976</xref>). This model of sentencing is straightforward: The agency is justified in punishing the officer because the officer deserves it. Violating agency policy creates an organizational imbalance. Punishment is intended to restore equilibrium, where the penalties set matters right by either removing the gains or benefits derived from the infraction or by levying some disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1098611111433026">Walker, 1991</xref>, p. 25). Punishment is also intended to convey a message to the workforce and to the public that officers cannot unjustly infringe on the agency or the citizens with impunity.</p>
<p>Applying the desert model to a public bureaucracy, it is easy to envision the justification for punishing police employees who violate the rules and policies of the agency. Police management has the obligation to punish those who violate the rules from a technical and legal perspective. As people are moral agents bestowed with free will to act or refrain from acting, punishment is due when someone makes wrong choices, just as they deserve rewards and praise when they make right choices. As members of a police organization, officers willingly—either implicitly or explicitly—submit to the rules and policies that govern the agency and agree to uphold them as expressed in the law enforcement code of ethics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1098611111433026">International Association of Chiefs of Police, 1992</xref>) and their oath of office, something that has been upheld by U.S. courts (e.g., <italic>Tooele County v. Jones</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1098611111433026">1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the justification for punishment is clear, how much punishment is deserved is more ambiguous, yet still must be measured to ensure fairness. For a sentence to be fair, it must be proportionate in severity to the seriousness of the infraction; thus, proportionality must determine the quantity of punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1098611111433026">von Hirsch, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1098611111433026">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1098611111433026">von Hirsch &amp; Ashworth, 1992</xref>, p. 182; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-1098611111433026">Weisbord, 1995</xref>, p. 68). A sentence is proportionate, and consequently justified, when the punishment is commensurate with the officer’s culpability and the amount of resulting harm while considering aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Sentences that are disproportionate—too lenient or too severe given the harm and culpability—are not justified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1098611111433026">Hospers, 1977</xref>, p. 23; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1098611111433026">von Hirsch, 1976</xref>, p. 66).</p>
<p>Disproportionate sentences send a confusing and inconsistent message to the wider workforce that may ultimately bring scorn and disobedience for the agency’s rules, as well as repeat offending from the employees as they act out in defiance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1098611111433026">Sherman, 1993</xref>). Just deserts places proportionality at the forefront; it is proportionality that embodies the sense of fairness and justice that police officers seek in their disciplinary matters and which the agency seeks in commanding respect for its rules and policies. Punishments that are scaled to the gravity of the infraction compared with those that are not are perceived as fair, and it is the scale itself that provides uniformity. Proportionality implies rank-ordering the infractions and the levels of punishment to ensure the least serious infractions correspond to the least serious punishment; as the seriousness of the infraction increases, so does the punishment. Matching these elements relies on the principle of “commensurate-deserts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1098611111433026">von Hirsch, 1983</xref>, p. 212), which requires affixing cardinal and ordinal proportionality, as well as parity.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The data for this study were collected from two sources at the Newark (NJ) police department: (a) complete participant observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1098611111433026">Gold, 1969</xref>) with both sworn police officers and supervisors and civilian personnel and (b) official agency records. Three hundred sixty hours of participant observation were conducted between October 2000 and June 2004 while serving as a precinct commander and a rotating member of the Newark Police Department’s Trial Board, a triumvirate of command-rank officers who act as fact finders and impose discipline on police officers and civilian employees charged with administrative policy violations. The trial board is a formal organizational element intended to ensure employees’ due process rights are honored, while holding members accountable for their decisions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1098611111433026">Champion (2006)</xref> noted that participant-observation often leans on the expertise of the observer who typically has firsthand experience in the field. Such experience is crucial in this research to grasp significant events that tend to indicate the shortcomings and tension associated with existing police disciplinary systems. My position afforded me unique access to the internal disciplinary system of a major urban police department from the executive level, which provided a distinct perspective on the backstage setting, politics, and administration that occur when dispensing discipline. My familiarity with the field presented a unique opportunity to view police administration, internal affairs, and disciplinary matters firsthand as these functions are difficult to observe in most other ways and are often hidden from outsiders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1098611111433026">Shils, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>Observations were conducted during 41 department trial board hearings and 7 command-level disciplinary conferences involving 363 sworn officers (98%) and civilian employees (2%) and 1,080 individual charges and specifications. The employees represented nearly every operational and administrative element of the agency, except the patrol force was overrepresented (76.4%) and the penalties ranged from counseling to termination. The sample was not representative of the entire agency and the observations came from a convenience sample, not a random sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1098611111433026">Maxfield &amp; Babbie, 2001</xref>). Field notes were recorded while reviewing individual disciplinary cases; the case files were prepared by the police department’s Advocacy Section of the Internal Affairs Bureau. The notes contained thick descriptions of the context and incident that led to the charges, and the conversations among the officers, union officials, trial board members, and attorneys who were present at the hearings.</p>
<p>The official agency records consisted of the labor agreement, memoranda, internal investigations, disciplinary histories, psychological reports, driving record, and formal policies governing the internal affairs function and the disciplinary process. In addition to the agency records, the New Jersey Attorney General’s policy on internal affairs investigations was also a source document. These documents provided an historical overview and reflected incremental changes as the form of internal investigations and the disciplinary process changed. When this study began, the internal affairs and disciplinary processes had been well established for several years. Today, internal affairs and the disciplinary process exist as they did at the time of the observations.</p>
<sec id="section9-1098611111433026">
<title>Participants and Protection</title>
<p>Neither were any personal data, unique organizational identifiers, or personal attributes collected nor were any conversation tape-recorded; therefore, it was not possible to identify a given officer or connect individual disciplinary action or comments to a specific officer. As the observations were conducted in a natural setting and the officers were not approached for their reaction or perspective, informed consent was not obtained. In addition, the research did not extend beyond participant observation into informal conversations, interviews, or focus groups that would have required informed consent. Last, the research was not intended to report on individual disciplinary decisions; rather, in the aggregate, it was intended to form the basis for a model to guide disciplinary sentences and improve consistency.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section11-1098611111433026">
<title>Informal Nature of Police Disciplinary Policy</title>
<p>The Newark Police Department operates a bifurcated disciplinary process, where minor discipline (infractions that are subject to less than 5 days suspension) is disposed of at the division level and major discipline (infractions that are subject to more than 5 days suspension) is disposed of before the department’s trial board. The Newark police disciplinary policy states that “Disciplinary Conferences and Trials shall be informal and administrative,” and where the customary rules of evidence do not apply, repetitious evidence may be excluded and the disciplinary hearing officer may establish additional “reasonable rules” to expedite the matter at his or her discretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1098611111433026">Newark Police Department, 2010</xref>, pp. 7-8).</p>
<p>This leaves each individual trial to vary subject to the vagaries of each hearing officer or the trial board members, which may be influenced by any number of biases, personal sentiment, and ulterior motives. The disciplinary policy does not define “reasonable rules” and does not codify previously established rules that may have been set by hearing officers. Although this process may be efficient, it is explicitly informal, governed by unwritten rules, institutionally accepted past practices, and unfettered discretion that are consistent with previous studies about how disciplinary sentences are exacted in police agencies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1098611111433026">
<title>Lack of Direction for Imposing Sentences</title>
<p>In its current form, there is no systematic process to compare past sentences for similarly situated officers to ensure continuity, or to guide sentencing during the instant matter; 100% of the cases adjudicated relied on anecdotes and recollections from supervisors and trial board members about previous dispositions and the type and length of sentence that should be imposed. Also, 100% of the cases were compared with each other regardless of the contextual factors to arrive at a sentence instead of being compared with an independent and articulated standard. The process is further convoluted by (a) paper-based disciplinary files that are scattered throughout each organizational division and were not collated; (b) no centralized system for aggregating sentences among all similarly situated officers; and (c) frequent involvement of superior officers who are witnesses in the instant matter in determining the officers’ penalties. The result is, at best, an educated guess about what sentence is appropriate given the context and is not predicated on rational management.</p>
<p>The disciplinary policy only directs the type of adjudication that must commence if the infraction is likely to result in a sentence less than 5 days suspension (a disciplinary conference for minor discipline), or termination, demotion, or more than 5 days suspension (a department trial for major discipline). Major and minor discipline are defined by the length of a potential sentence. Individual rule and policy infractions are interchangeable as major and minor based on the disciplinary history of the individual officer, except that major discipline is defined by five infractions based on their seriousness: (a) aggravated insubordination; (b) criminal acts; (c) unauthorized discharge of firearms; (d) refusal to submit to drug screening; and (e) violations of radio discipline.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1098611111433026">7</xref></sup> If a given infraction may result in (a) suspension or fine of 5 working days or less where the aggregate number of days suspended or fined in any one calendar year is 15 working days or more or (b) the last suspension or fine where an employee receives more than three suspensions or fines of 5 working days or less in a calendar year, then the infraction is deemed major discipline; otherwise it is deemed minor discipline. This process identifies whether a trial board or disciplinary conference will convene but not what sentence is appropriate on a guilty finding; the sentence is discretionary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1098611111433026">
<title>Arriving at a Sentence</title>
<p>Arriving at a given sentence was an iterative process between trial board members, the city’s attorney, the hearing officer, and the union representative. There was no algorithm, weighting process, or predefined guide but informal banter. Each trial board member read through the investigation, then reviewed the officer’s disciplinary history, and came to consensus about a penalty instead of impartially listening to the evidence presented by both sides and rendering a verdict. Consensus was reached by discussing several factors including the quality of the investigation and whether the police department would have the sentence overturned on appeal because the investigation was weak; whether the officer was known to any trial board members and what they personally thought of the officer; the officer’s longevity; the length and severity of the officer’s disciplinary history; and the nature of the infraction.</p>
<p>Another factor determining sentence was whether the police department could afford to lose the officer to suspension due to staffing constraints. As a matter of economics, during periods of peak vacation and holidays, sentences were more likely to be nonsuspensory or suspensions held in abeyance so the department did not lose the officer, which would leave the individual divisions to resort to overtime to fill the vacancy. This practice may reduce the deterrent effect of discipline and may send the message that certain infractions mean less depending on when they occur. Furthermore, the policy was silent as to how multiple infractions should be handled (i.e., merged, dismissed). In 97% of the cases, multiple infractions were present and they were merged or dismissed with the same informal discussion as imposing a sentence.</p>
<p>My observations suggest there is widespread belief from police officers that the agency does not give them a fair chance to prevail against complaints lodged against them. This may be rooted in the structural differences between investigating criminal conduct and investigating an internal complaint, where the disciplinary process comports more like an inquisitorial system than an adversarial system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-1098611111433026">Wechter, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1098611111433026">
<title>No Ordinal Proportionality Among Infractions</title>
<p>The Newark Police Department’s disciplinary policy identifies the cardinal magnitude of penalties—oral reprimand, warning notice, written reprimand, suspension, fine, reduction in rank, and discharge/termination—but does not identify ordinal proportionality of the infractions. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1098611111433026">Newark Police Department (2006)</xref> rules and regulations system is 18 chapters with 1,028 rule infractions; the general order system contains 265 policies and neither of the systems orders infractions according to their relative severity. Only the five aforementioned infractions are identified as major discipline; the remaining 1,023 rules and regulations and the 265 policies are not accounted for in terms of seriousness and the actual or anticipated harm that may result from violating them. Except for the five aforementioned infractions, all other infractions are relatively equal; individual infractions are not weighted for the actual or potential harm they cause the agency or the community, which means, all things being equal, using excessive force and being tardy may receive the same sentence based on the extent of the officer’s disciplinary history.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1098611111433026">
<title>The Proposed Disciplinary Matrix</title>
<p>The purpose of a disciplinary matrix is to leave the police department with a predictable, progressive, and uniform guide for dispensing discipline that accounts for the seriousness of the infraction, the prior disciplinary history of the officer involved, and the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Standards such as those enunciated in a disciplinary matrix may reduce internal dissention and make sentencing decisions more fair and consistent (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1098611111433026">Jones, 1998</xref>).

The Minnesota model was selected for its rational design as a whole, which provides a clear standard for measuring how well internal discipline is dispensed. The penalty levels, infractions, sentencing presumptions, and prior record of sustained charges are hypothetical, except that the penalty levels and infractions were modified from those used in the Newark Police Department to provide some perspective on how such a model might look.</p>

<title>Cardinal Proportionality and the Principle of Endangerment</title>
<p>Cardinal proportionality concerns the upper and lower anchoring points for each penalty level on a seriousness scale. This sets limits on the severity or leniency of the sanctions appropriate for each infraction by examining the nonrelative proportionality, where the overall level of punishment is addressed from least to greatest on an exhaustive scale (Levels 1 through 6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1098611111433026">von Hirsch, 1992</xref>). Cardinal proportionality anchors the magnitude of the punishment scale and is typically determined by accepted past practices of the agency, legal mandates, collective bargaining agreements, or organizational consensus, as well as research findings, expert opinion, or an ethical basis. The accepted penal traditions of the agency are a worthy starting point since sanctions are a social convention, and like any other social conventions, they will be influenced by normative behaviors and customary practice.</p>
<p>Although it is easy to envision more, fewer, or different penalties, this model offers six levels that move from least serious (counseling and warning notice), to moderately serious (written reprimand and suspension), to most serious (reduction in rank and dismissal) in a graduated manner. In a reasoned system of internal discipline, the seriousness of infractions should be governed by the “principle of endangerment,” which determines where the infractions will be situated in a given punishment level. The principle of endangerment accounts for the actual harm that was committed, or for the anticipated harm that could have resulted (risk), as well as the culpability of the officer.</p>
<p>Factors of intent, motive, and circumstance should determine the extent to which officers are penalized for their actions. The intrinsic qualities of the anchoring points show that as the penalties move from least to greatest, there is a concurrent rise in actual or potential harm that may be visited on the agency or the community, which requires increased sanctions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1098611111433026">
<title>Ordinal Proportionality and Parity</title>
<p>Ordinal proportionality concerns how infractions are sanctioned relative to each other moving from the least serious to most serious, through each penalty level. This orders (i.e., ranks) the amount of punishment proportionate to culpability in terms of parity between police officers committing infractions of similar gravity, such that the relative severity of punishment reflects the seriousness of the infraction. The internal architecture of infractions is not universal among police agencies and will expectedly vary, including their arrangement in terms of seriousness, except that infractions must be mutually exclusive to a single penalty level to ensure there is no overlap. Affixing ordinal proportionality may be dictated by accepted past practice, labor agreement, or organizational consensus.</p>
<p>Ordinal proportionality also insists on a spacing requirement within and between punishment levels, so that each incremental increase in punishment reflects the progressive seriousness of the infractions and punishment for repeated offenses. The spacing and sanctions must be reasonable, although “reasonableness” is admittedly an imprecise notion that has not received much attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1098611111433026">von Hirsch, 1992</xref>, p. 94). The space between sentences may be fixed or proportional, but more importantly it must be reasonable and consistent. Arriving at a reasonable width for sentences is a value judgment that is best satisfied by consensus between labor and management and guided by the mean sentence length of past infractions.</p>
<p>The first step toward establishing ordinal proportionality is to inventory the rules and policies of the agency, then parse each rule and policy for its purported harm against the agency and the community. Ordering the infractions from least to greatest in terms of seriousness expresses the agency’s degree of disapproval for that conduct. To do otherwise is to introduce bias, where some infractions may receive more or less punishment since there is no comparison point, which is unfair.</p>
<p>Part and parcel of ordinal proportionality is parity among infractions. Parity insists that when police officers who are similarly situated have their charges sustained, they must incur punishment of equal severity. The only justification for departing from the parity requirement, either upward or downward, is the presence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances in the given context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-1098611111433026">von Hirsch, 1976</xref>, pp. 72-74; 1983, p. 74). Parity is a key feature of a desert-based model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1098611111433026">Kleinig, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1098611111433026">Singer, 1979</xref>) and is critical to designing a formal sentencing structure that provides relief from disparate sentences. To ensure parity, when the agency decides to depart from the guidelines, they must confine their decision to the predefined circumstances promulgated by the agency and not depart capriciously. This ensures that the agency departs only for good cause, which ultimately results in more uniform punishment and fewer successful appeals. When the agency encounters novel circumstances in the instant matter that necessitates departure, the agency must reevaluate the current matrix and issue clear policy statements to guide nonlinear considerations before imposing a sanction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1098611111433026">
<title>Ancillary Elements of the Matrix</title>
<p>The remaining elements of the disciplinary matrix that must be defined are (a) the employee’s prior disciplinary record, (b) aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and (c) time limitations. My observations suggest that the employee’s prior record is a contentious and overlooked element. Those sitting in judgment of the employee routinely had full access to the employee’s complete disciplinary history; indeed, determining whether an infraction merits major or minor discipline is predicted on reviewing the employee’s disciplinary history. Although only prior sustained charges should be considered when determining a sentence, ranking officers who impose sanctions reviewed the entire disciplinary record <italic>before</italic> rendering a finding, which included charges that were dismissed, not sustained, unfounded, and exonerated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1098611111433026">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Relying on prior dispositions other than sustained charges introduces bias; once the previous dispositions are reviewed, it is virtually impossible to ignore them as if they had never been seen. This unfairly influences the outcome of the hearing before it even begins by interfering with the fact finder’s ability to remain impartial and objective. By making the complete prior record available beforehand, there is great temptation to “see what kind of officer we are dealing with,” instead of rendering a finding on the merits of the case.</p>
<p>Mitigating circumstances are factors that tend to be ignored in disciplinary matters because the employee’s intent need not be proven and violations of rules and policies are strict liability offenses. The fact that many disciplinary actions arise naturally during the course of business is also not a defense. Yet the logic of mitigating circumstances implies that when an infraction occurs that is accompanied by, for example, mistake of fact, or direct orders from a superior, the severity of the punishment must decrease. A police officer who collides with another car while responding to a call surely cannot be offered the same punishment when he or she is intoxicated (aggravating) or when he or she mistakenly hits a deep pothole filled with water (mitigating). While the outcome may be the same (property damage and perhaps personal injury), the principle of endangerment suggests the former is more culpable and deserving of harsher punishment than the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1098611111433026">Noble &amp; Alpert, 2009</xref>, pp. 229-230).</p>
<p>Last, affixing time limitations allows the agency a reasonable amount of time to commence adjudication after an infraction has been discovered, recognizing that the amount of time is not limitless. Time limitations represent another display of self-imposed restraint against management’s discretion and convey a sense of procedural fairness to the workforce. The purpose is to ensure that the possibility of punishment for an infraction committed sufficiently in the past cannot activate the agency’s disciplinary apparatus. Time limitations should be sufficiently wide to allow management time to uncover, investigate, and sanction acts of misconduct, but not overly wide to leave officers at the whim and caprice of zealous managers. The Newark policy did impose time limitations, and 2.4% of the cases were dismissed for this technical violation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article presents a rational and systematic structure for imposing police discipline that can be evaluated empirically, which is a departure from most existing police disciplinary systems, which are arbitrary. Rational in this sense is aimed at creating a predictable and uniform framework that improves equity and reduces disparity in disciplinary sentences. Some police agencies may rely on informal sentencing practices that are laden with unfettered discretion. The result is disparity in punishment for similarly situated officers, which may result in antagonistic relationships between labor and management and lower performance and increased stress from officers. Moreover, as disparity in disciplinary sentences rises, police unions and arbitrators are likely to get involved to the point where management has their sentences reduced or overturned, which may perpetuate the antagonism.</p>
<p>From a self-interested perspective, police administrators may find as they promote organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) they concurrently promote better performance in their officers. OCB are those “job-related behaviors which are discretionary, not formally recognized by the organizational reward system, and in the aggregate, promote the effective functioning of the organization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1098611111433026">Moorman et al., 1993</xref>, p. 210). Essentially, these are the things employees do above and beyond their job description—<italic>going the extra yard</italic>—that make for a harmonious and efficient workplace, where attitudes of commitment, trust, and altruism predominate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1098611111433026">Brower, Lester, Korsgaard, &amp; Dineen, 2009</xref>). The organization cultivates a stronger work ethic in its employees because the employees perceive the organization’s decision-making systems as fair; therefore, they are more committed to organizational goals (e.g., strong community relationships). The outgrowth of this perceived fairness is workforce motivation; when employees feel affiliated and their efforts are appreciated, they strive to do their best, which is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1098611111433026">Herzberg’s (1968)</xref> theory of productivity. Speculating further, if the community perceives the police department to be more equitable and responsive, then they may reciprocate by being more willing to get involved in crime-prevention activities, increasing their reporting practices and voting in the affirmative for the police budget.</p>
<p>The hallmark of a well-developed and mature police management structure is the discipline to self-impose standards and limits on managers’ behavior. This ensures equity and fairness and keeps management from arbitrary behavior. A disciplinary matrix is one development in that direction, which may improve accountability by establishing transparency in the typically secret and discretionary world of police discipline. Promulgating a standardized structure gives the public, individual officers, and police managers a sense of what to expect when disciplinary sentences are handed down. Police management retains the ability to impose discipline as necessary, and individual officers are granted a safeguard against disproportionate sanctions.</p>
<p>Adopting formal sentencing structures has been slow; a few major U.S. and Canadian police departments have begun experimenting with a disciplinary matrix (e.g., Los Angeles County [California] Sheriff’s Office; Phoenix, Arizona; Providence, Rhode Island; Baltimore, Maryland; Denver, Colorado; Vancouver, British Columbia; Washington State Patrol), and recommendations to implement such a model are evident by police advocacy groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1098611111433026">International Association of Chiefs of Police, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1098611111433026">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1098611111433026">Police Executive Research Forum, 2010</xref>, p. 3), but adoption is far from universal and outcomes have not been evaluated. Aside from some large departments, the extent to which a disciplinary matrix is being used in smaller departments, which comprise the majority of U.S. police agencies, is not known. Top police administrators must embrace the matrix as a tool that strengthens their ability to impose discipline instead of looking on it as a constraint that impinges on their discretion. By seizing the initiative and breaking from the makeshift and haphazard sentencing practices that rely more on informalities than rationality, police administrators will build more trust and legitimacy between management and labor, which engenders a culture of self-discipline rather than relying on negative discipline for compliance.</p>
<sec id="section20-1098611111433026">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Despite its potential benefits, this research is theoretical and has some limitations. First, the competing interests surrounding consistency and fairness are difficult to reconcile. Although a disciplinary matrix strives for consistency and parity in sanctions, inconsistency may arise in outcomes. Although similarly situated officers may be <italic>subject</italic> to the same sanctions for a given infraction, aggravating and mitigating circumstances, as well as culpability may not result in similar sanctions. Every conceivable combination of sanction, multiple charges, culpability level, and aggravating and mitigating circumstance has not been explored, but thinking through the myriad permutations is dizzying and will ultimately necessitate some discretion.</p>
<p>Similarly, although the principle of consistency remains paramount, there may be some measure of inconsistency when dispensing individualized correction, after accounting for variations in training, education, and performance evaluations. There is also a moral/human dimension that should be considered, which is whether the agency should be permitted to depart downward when the officer is remorseful, apologetic, cooperative, and likely to benefit from retraining; when the officer pleads guilty; or when their prior record is qualitatively less serious than the current charge. If these dimensions will be considered, then they must be defined and promulgated beforehand. By way of comparison, the inherent tension between consistency and fairness has not been entirely resolved in criminal sentencing practices that have received quite robust academic attention. Also, the just deserts philosophy itself has been questioned for the psychology that flows from two-dimensional grids, like the one presented here, and for ethical differences between cases that present linear solutions to complex nonlinear issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1098611111433026">Tonry, 1996</xref>, pp. 13-24; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1098611111433026">Spohn, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, there is no U.S. or international data-collection standard for internal affairs and disciplinary sentences. Because of this limitation, it is not possible to establish baseline measures or sentencing trends and patterns from which to design a matrix. Therefore, neither is it possible to compare disciplinary sentences with and without a matrix across states and jurisdictions nor is it possible to determine parity and identify departures from “the norm.” Data from internal affairs investigations and disciplinary hearings are often not public record. Simply because an agency implements a disciplinary matrix as an accountability mechanism does not mean that dispositions will become public, even if the matrix itself is public. Various state laws and labor agreements keep individual personnel records sealed from public view and may only be accessed with a subpoena, a much higher standard than is established by most open public records acts, which inhibits timely research.</p>
<p>Third, although implementing a disciplinary matrix appears to be a sound management practice, it is merely a policy. The real test of police leadership comes not from implementing it but from adhering to it and abandoning any irresistible impulse to punish officers for “a pound of flesh” while hiding behind the right to decide on punishment based on discretion. Police officers today are less willing to immediately accept sanctions they believe are harsh and oppressive; they are more likely to fight administrators and may have their sentences reduced or overturned by a court or an arbitrator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1098611111433026">Pinkerton, 2011</xref>). It is overly optimistic to believe that all police administrators who adopt a sentencing matrix will follow it. It is more realistic to believe that at least some administrators will depart from the proportionality requirements—to a greater or lesser degree—with merely facile justification, thus invalidating its true principles. The silver lining in this cloud is that when (not if) this occurs, affected employees will be on firm ground to affirmatively appeal their sentence and reclaim a sense of justice.</p>
<p>Fourth, neither is the sentencing matrix intended to enhance, hasten, or increase the frequency of punishment or to increase sustained findings during internal affairs investigations nor is it intended to vindicate officers who are unjustly accused. Although it is intended to improve transparency and accountability, accountability is not synonymous with punishment. Accountability means to subordinate to a process, where the subject bears an obligation or willingness to accept responsibility and to proffer a statement or explanation of the reasons, causes, or motives for their actions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-1098611111433026">Walker &amp; Katz, 2005</xref>, p. 473). Accountability is not the type and amount of punishment imposed; whether a police officer has their disciplinary charges sustained or dismissed is independent of the matrix. From this perspective, the matrix should be used to manage the public’s expectations about the sentences officers receive after disciplinary charges are sustained. The public may expect that officers will have their charges sustained more frequently because the agency is using a “disciplinary matrix,” which is a misperception. In this sense, the matrix becomes more impression management than substantive management; public satisfaction with the police complaint process is not easily resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1098611111433026">De Angelis, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Fifth, this research relies on a nonprobability sample (i.e., convenience) of cases, not a random sample. As cases arising from department trials and disciplinary conferences were not randomly assigned, it is not possible to draw definitive inferences about the sentencing practices from the sample. This introduces systematic bias and the inferences based on this type of sampling must be accepted with caution; strictly speaking, inferences cannot be drawn from a nonprobability sample.</p>
<p>Last, quantitative data were not recorded and interrater reliability was not available. Although an observation protocol was used to focus field notes and document review, there was no opportunity to cross-reference the observations with empirical data on sentences from each disciplinary file or to conduct post hoc interviews of individual officers for their reaction. The observations were confined to a single urban police agency, so the findings may not be generalizable to smaller, or suburban and rural police agencies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1098611111433026">
<title>Directions for Future Research</title>
<p>A few unanswered questions about using a police sentencing matrix exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-1098611111433026">Walker, 2003a</xref>, pp. 14-15). To date, the extent of their use in law enforcement agencies is not known and the concept remains untested; currently there are no estimates on the prevalence of sentencing matrices, so it is not possible to establish baseline measures for comparison or to conduct an impact evaluation. Without the ability to compare disciplinary sentences with and without a matrix, it is not possible to say with any degree of confidence that the matrix is better than existing practices or suggested alternatives.</p>
<p>Another avenue for research is to determine the benefits and unintended consequences from the employees’ perspective. Perhaps the most important point in assessing different perspectives is to determine whether the matrix is achieving its goals: (a) increasing consistency in punishment; (b) reducing arbitrators’ reversal or reduction of punishment; and (c) improving perceptions of fairness. Equally important is the extent to which predefined aggravating and mitigating circumstances and the officer’s prior sustained charges will be considered, as well as the time limitations to initiate discipline. Failing to account for these elements may foreclose the prospect of equity and fairness the matrix seeks to resolve. Quantitative data on individual disciplinary cases must be collected and analyzed to determine variability; the hypothesis being that a disciplinary matrix will reduce the standard deviation for sentences involving similar circumstances.</p>
<p>From a practical perspective, a process evaluation is important to assess the course of development, the key decisions, and the obstacles to implementation that affect replication and adoption. The often intractable nature of management–labor relationships and the prevalence of police unions necessitates that in certain parts of the United States unions are key stakeholders that must be consulted. The strength of both accepted past practice (unionism and union semantics) and police leadership (managerialism and management rhetoric) will affect the decision to compromise in a given case; compromise is key to overcoming status quo and obstinacy, which may affect the future of police disciplinary matrices, including the extent of their implementation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1098611111433026">Polzin &amp; DeLord, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Determining reasonable punishment and the spacing width for infractions must be analyzed more closely. Reform efforts, innovation, and best practices necessarily involve analyzing data on the patterns and magnitude of the existing issue before changes can be made; however, that necessitates knowing how others who are similarly situated address the situation. It is quite likely that police departments will develop punishments and spacing width in relative isolation from their counterparts across the country by resorting to rather parochial analysis and internal comparison instead of having a larger sample from which to make estimates.</p>

<p>A <italic>hook</italic> is a derogatory term in police vernacular for someone who looks after a member of the police department and has the ability to advance the member’s career. A hook can equally get someone out of trouble or into a preferred assignment, or set along a particular career path by influencing decision makers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1098611111433026">Price, 1972</xref>, p. 166). Hooks are typically established through informal associations that are often cultivated by money, cronyism, nepotism, or “partisan balance” (i.e., “political patronage,” meaning they are usually intimately tied to political influence and motivated by partisan or self-serving objectives) and are looked upon with disdain because the influence they exert is rarely ever merit based. Hooks often connote that the member receiving preferential treatment is not necessarily experienced, qualified or deserving of the position; the member is absolved from responsibility for their share of the work while in the position; and the member is insulated from disciplinary action. Someone who has a hook is termed to be <italic>hooked up</italic>. Similar police vernacular includes being “connected,” as in he or she is politically connected (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1098611111433026">Berkley, 1969</xref>, p. 17); having a “Rabbi,” as in who is his or her Rabbi? and “political Godfather,” as in he or she has a political Godfather. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1098611111433026">Neiderhoffer (1967)</xref> discussed how officers in the New York City Police Department sought to “. . . arrange contracts with Rabbis” to get out of uniform and into a “. . . good detail to escape from foot patrol duty. The lower ranks tend to believe that special assignments depend on ‘whom you know,’ and not on merit” (p. 77). A “detail” in the police department is a preferred or special assignment, typically a desirable one that may also bring a promotion, and a “Rabbi” is someone with influence in the department that can make that happen, in other words a “hook.”</p></fn>
