<body>
<p>The Hearing Committee of the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery recognized the difficulty presented by noncomparability of reporting formats used for hearing outcomes, which inhibits interstudy comparison. This led to a 3-year-long deliberative process, incorporating the opinions of a wide spectrum of experts, which led to adoption of a minimal reporting standard published in the Academy’s journal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813491707">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>While we acknowledge that there is no such thing as an “ideal” standard, we do believe that the formula adopted will substantially improve the value of our literature. We are pleased to address the concerns expressed by Dr Carlson.</p>
<list id="list1-0194599813491707" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1. Need validation study before implementation:</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The committee chose to adopt a matrix display grid of key audiometric data rather than adopt an arbitrary classification scheme (hearing class A, B, C, etc) precisely because the latter would require a large and costly validation study that would take years to complete. Had we proposed a grading system that segmented hearing disability into purportedly similar buckets, then validation would have been essential to assure intragroup comparability and to establish relevance of each class to differences in life impact of the hearing loss. Raw data displays have no assumptions to validate.</p>
<list id="list2-0194599813491707" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>2. Not appropriate for some clinical trials populations:</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Dr Carlson questions whether the standard would be applicable to disorders such as ototoxicity. The standard merely defines a minimal data set for comparison purposes and is not expected to be sufficient, unto itself, for many research purposes. Authors are encouraged to include additional data as needed to fully describe their study population.</p>
<list id="list3-0194599813491707" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>3. Precludes publications of certain clinical trials:</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The standard is only applicable for those studies that produce data of relevance and not applicable for those that do not. For example, the minimal reporting standard has little relevance to cochlear implant studies.</p>
<list id="list4-0194599813491707" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>4. Word recognition score (WRS):</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The committee carefully considered the fact that WRS is often obtained by differing methods (eg, live vs recorded voice, 25 vs 50 word list, variable sound presentation levels, etc) that limit comparability among data. While 10% bins are arbitrary boundaries, less than 10% would be too granular given the test’s high variability. When not available (ie, young children, in countries where WRS is not routinely measured) only the pure tone average (PTA) need be included.</p>
<list id="list5-0194599813491707" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>5. Collaboration with the AAO-HNS on reporting standards:</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Audiologist Dr Gerald Popelka, Chair of the American Academy of Audiology (AAA) Standards Committee, attended all of the committee meetings in which the standard was debated and was one of its principal architects of the standard adopted. The Hearing Committee of the AAO-HNS would warmly welcome even closer collaboration with the AAA than we have enjoyed in the past around issues of standards.</p>
