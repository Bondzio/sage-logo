<p>This book by Cambridge theologian, A. N. Williams, is a prolonged reflection on the nature of Christian theology. Her expertise in, and indebtedness to, Augustine, Aquinas, the Cappadocians, and Gregory Palamas are evident in her conception of theology as a contemplation of the divine, a ‘delight in the things of God’ (p. 212). Systematic theology is not only about comprehensiveness but relationality, about tracing the connections between its various parts. In Thomistic parlance the subject of its discourse is ‘God and other things as they are related to God’ (p. 4). It is to view the world as an exposition of the divine <italic>ratio</italic>, that is, God’s wisdom and love. Theology is not just a wrestling with God in the sense of struggling to understand; ‘it represents a human desire for the divine’ (p. 19), can be considered ‘a prelude to contemplation,’ and serve as a ‘medium of sanctification’ (p. 225). This is to see contemplation not as anti-intellectual but as the culmination of theological enquiry. Theology has a sapiential as well as a scientific character.</p>
<p>The role of reason in this conception of theology is a somewhat chastened one. Reason is valued but not overvalued. ‘Epistemologically, we just have to learn to live with provisionality’ (p. 60). Like Paul, we see now as in a glass darkly (1 Cor. 13:12). Yet theology has always assumed that the underlying structure of Christian belief is rationally intelligible. In her first chapter, Williams discusses various theories of justification, including foundationalism (‘some propositions are basic or foundational and not deduced from others’) (p. 32) and coherentism (the validity of theological claims are grounded in their relation to, and compatibility with, each other), as well as theories of truth (correspondence, coherence, etc.). Although theology has a scientific quality to it in that it is <italic>logos</italic> or reasoning about <italic>theos</italic> (Tillich), it will eschew adamant forms of foundationalism and coherentism, while blending more modest versions of both. Theology must mediate between epistemological totalitarianism and epistemological laxity. But theology is also about the business of truth, identifying this with God, and purports to offer a comprehensive vision of reality. Thus Williams engages with a mediating position awkwardly entitled ‘foundherentism’ (Susan Haack). At issue is the link between knowledge and justification or how beliefs must conform to some standard of rationality while acknowledging that both philosophers and theologians all argue ‘from premises we know to be controvertible’ (p. 51) and which ‘fall short of demonstrable certitude’ (p. 56).</p>
<p>Chapter two examines some sources of theological claims or warrants—including scripture, tradition, reason, and experience. Appeals to scriptural texts as normative must take seriously their culturally conditioned character. The divine message is always conveyed in human language. Tradition is not separate from Scripture but ‘Scripture rightly understood’ (Florovsky) (p. 85). Scripture, tradition, and reason each play an important role in the development of doctrine. Thanks to hermeneutics we now acknowledge there are no ‘innocent’ texts or ‘innocent’ readers, no ‘interest-free’ interpretation. Still, the pattern of Scripture as a whole has a cogency and plausibility that ‘may lend credibility to individual propositions within it’ (p. 101), i.e. a coherentist epistemology. The Bible contains a variety of theologies; there is no single ‘plain sense’ (p. 97). Truthfulness is not always equated with historical accuracy and Williams has good sections on the role of allegory and the figurative language of Scripture.</p>
<p>Throughout the book Williams’s argument is that theology is a mimetic project: it speaks of God and humankind as it is related to God, because humankind is a reflection of the Trinity, endowed with a <italic>capax Dei</italic>, a longing to be like God and an ability to have some knowledge of God. Because of the Fall, however, it will always be an imperfect and incomplete mimesis. Moreover, propositional and figurative language mediate, but cannot capture the divine (p. 163). Since the <italic>telos</italic> of theological enquiry lies beyond our minds, we require supernatural assistance or grace. Williams pursues her discussion about the mimetic pattern of theology in dialogue with an eclectic mix of theologians and religious thinkers, including Nazianzen, Anselm, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Newman, Kierkegaard, Niebuhr, and Boff. The activity of theology mirrors the exchange of knowledge and love that is the Trinity (Anselm), while our minds cannot apprehend God without honouring Him (Calvin). Growth in knowledge of God goes hand in hand with sanctification. This conception of theology is strongly influenced by the Eastern tradition of deification and the epistemological implications for theology (p. 219). Christian theology is ultimately concerned with the <italic>ratio</italic> of divine self-disclosure, in short, with relationality and with rationality.</p>
<p>In the penultimate chapter Williams, in dialogue with Jonathan Edwards and Hans Urs von Balthasar (and Augustine, Aquinas, and Calvin before them), looks at the relation of beauty to truth. She shows how beauty is not only an attribute of God but ‘a means of divine self-communication and a means [by] which God attracts us to himself’ (p. 197). Beauty is a reflection of the divine <italic>ratio</italic> leading us to God, the Source of beauty.</p>
<p>This thoughtful and stimulating book not only highlights the importance of recent epistemological discussions for theology but develops a conception of theology steeped in the Christian tradition, where ‘faith and reason are like two wings on which the human spirit rises to the contemplation of truth’ (<italic>Fides et Ratio</italic>, Opening). It would be suitable for graduate courses on theological method but would need to be complemented by more explicitly contextual theologies including liberation and feminist perspectives. Granted such theologies are more practical than speculative, but they tend to be more engaged at the public and political level—a welcome development, given the rise of religious fundamentalism, on the one hand, and the relegation of religion to the private sphere on the other.</p>
