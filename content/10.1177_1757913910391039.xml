<abstract>
<p>Planning for health and creating healthy public policy has been one of the main priorities of the Healthy Cities Project since the early 1990s. The Healthy City Foundation of Pécs (Hungary) – as one of the founding cities of the Healthy Cities Project in Europe – has been involved in all phases of health profiling, health planning and health development planning throughout the years. The experiences of the Healthy Cities Project have strengthened the recognition that the decisions of elected local decision-making bodies are generally based on daily demands and not on long-term plans or concepts. The decision-making process has only one type of filtering system (operated by the city notary), which is for the preliminary legal control of the decisions to be made. Quality of life, health and equity are not considered in the system as a filtering issue. This article reports the experiences of the unique approach of health-orientated planning and decision making in the City of Pécs by using the method of health impact assessment (HIA) as a ‘health filter’. It describes the initiative, the success of training and the feasibility of creating a health filter to support the local decision-making process.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is a general characteristic of nearly every country in the world that rich people live years longer and have fewer illnesses than their poorer fellow citizens. These differences in health status express a rather significant social injustice and reflect quite well the basic health effects of the modern world. Although health services make the treatment of and survival through numerous serious diseases possible, to improve the health of society as a whole the social and economic conditions that determine whether people become ill or not are much more important.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913910391039">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1986 the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Healthy Cities Project at the Lisbon Conference, which has since become a global movement recognizing that the health of the population and the environment is not merely the responsibility of the health services but it is a wide multi-sectoral social issue. The aim of the Healthy Cities approach is to put health high on the agenda of urban policy and of society by creating a strong public health movement at the local level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913910391039">2</xref></sup> The principles of the concept are ‘Health for All’ and ‘Local Agenda 21’ strategies. The main priorities are activities aimed at equity, participation, solidarity, inter-sectoral collaboration and social determinants of health.</p>
<p>The experiences of the Healthy Cities Project have strengthened the recognition that the decisions of elected local decision-making bodies, which influence the health of the local population to a great extent, are generally based on daily demands and not on long-term plans or concepts, and even if they are, health priorities are rarely considered.</p>
<p>The decision-making process has only one type of filtering system (operated by the city notary), which is for the preliminary legal control of the decisions to be made. There is no role in the process for quality of life, health and equity as a filtering issue or as a way of raising awareness of the effects the decisions made have on these issues.</p>
<p>The aim of the present article is to demonstrate one possible practice of health-orientated planning and the possibility of employing the method of health impact assessment (HIA) as a ‘health filter’ – a supporting tool in the process of preparing and making decisions in local councils.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1757913910391039">
<title>Quality of Life, Health and Equity as a Filtering Issue: The Evidence</title>
<p>At the beginning of the 1990s, in the second five-year phase of the Healthy Cities Project, one of the most important improvements was that participating cities, with the collaboration of experts requested by WHO EURO, elaborated a professional approach for the preparation of urban health profiles. This was the concept of City Health Profiles which was focusing primarily on personal health issues, such as smoking, alcohol, nutrition, physical activity and so on. The concept of health profiles served a special aim: that the ‘health self-portrait’ prepared by the cities should create the basis of medium- and long-term health planning – i.e. the elaboration of an action plan for the health improvement activities of the given city.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913910391039">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>While health profiles were based on the mapping of personal health risks and was aimed at reducing these risks using local government decisions, it was apparent that this could not be effective because local government, while able to strongly influence health risks endangering the local community in many cases, has little effect on personal health issues. One very good illustration of this is that local government as a decision-making body can strongly influence where a ringroad will be built, thereby reducing health risks associated with air pollution, but it only has an indirect and limited effect in influencing how many people in the city will give up smoking.</p>
<p>In the second five-year phase of the Healthy Cities Project (1993–1997), a new health profile concept was elaborated that gave guidance as a frame to map the health status of the population replacing the varying methods and approaches used for urban health status assessment previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913910391039">4</xref></sup> Using this method the ‘snapshot’ prepared about the health status of the local population created the basis of the local health plan, which aimed at the reduction of health risk factors and the support of healthy lifestyles mainly through changing personal habits and certain urban conditions.</p>
<p>Since then it has been proved that differences in health status are primarily associated with the social determinants of health and that their improvement demands the cooperation of various sectors and disciplines. This has led in the Healthy Cities Project to the paradigm shift from the health plan method to the health development planning method, which puts the emphasis primarily on changing social determinants of health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913910391039">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The new approach starts from the fact that local government decisions are usually based on policy papers, development plans and action plans that define the medium- and-long term directions and future of the activities of certain professional areas. Based on this idea, if the conceptual aims of every professional sector are defined to support health status as a priority, then there is a much better chance that activities of certain policy areas – operative decisions based on the concepts – will function in a more health-supportive way. At the same time, the health-supportive functioning of professional policy papers will result in the health-supportive functioning of public policy.</p>
<p>Principles defining strategies in connection with health promotion put special emphasis on factors such as multi-sectorality, equity and wide- and multi-level partnership for accountability and responsibility as criteria of successful programmes. These factors should first be relevant during conceptual planning, in cases of strategy preparation, which meant that the practice of health planning had to be altered. This change was not only the correction of methods while maintaining the basic issues, but a real paradigm shift.</p>
<p>The strengthening of the role of communities, that is the demand for a much wider social base, appeared as an ever-increasing expectation towards local health policy practice. Innovations responding to these demands caused the paradigm shift to reach the planning that supports health policy decisions. In this way the methods applied before – the analysis of personal health risks – were replaced by a new approach: the social determinants of health would be analysed and the suggestions for changes in certain policy areas would be integrated by competent decision makers – after consultations with experts, interest groups and the community – into the medium- and long-term plans at the conceptual level. As a result of the analysis, such a health plan would show the starting point of local health policy planning from the viewpoint of decision making. This would be followed by development work to integrate the actual health promotion policy issues into certain concepts through the elaboration or reconsideration of these concepts. This would result in the realization of health promotion targets defined in the conceptual plans through the decision-making mechanisms of local government (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1757913910391039">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Health development planning could induce changes concerning the more efficient utilization of local resources because on the one hand the resources of ‘social capital’ based on multi-sectoral collaboration could become fully utilized and on the other hand the financial resources of the local government and other stakeholders allocated for development issues could cover the realization of various plans and concepts. In this way health development planning could be understood in the easiest way as a re-allocation of already existing – intellectual and financial – resources which could also serve as the basis of sustainability.</p>
<p>While decisions of elected local decision-making bodies are generally based on daily demands, the experiences and evidence provided by the WHO Healthy Cities Project demonstrates the importance of considering quality of life, health and equity in health-orientated planning and decision making.</p>

<title>HIA as a Health Policy Supporting Tool: The Pécs Experience</title>
<p>The City of Pécs has been using the method of health development planning since 2002.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757913910391039">8</xref></sup> The experts of the Healthy City Foundation of Pécs provide professional advice on how the previously mentioned principles could be built into the new or revised concepts. During this work, it was recognised that the realization of principles assisting the improvement of health status could be followed up after the conceptual work. It was also recognized that they could be used as a strong supporting element in the preparation of decisions. One possible solution was the integration of HIA into the preparation of decisions, creating a strong health-based tool, as ‘evidence seems to suggest that HIA effectively supports the decision-making process.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757913910391039">9</xref></sup> However, this task requires specialist knowledge, so a training programme was set up for the officials of the different departments of the city administration to introduce those parts of HIA that are connected to the preparation of decisions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1757913910391039">
<title>HIA as a Tool for Health-Orientated Planning</title>
<p>Both the EU (PHASE Project) and WHO EURO (utilizing the framework of the Healthy Cities movement) have made a strong effort to enhance the incorporation of HIA into local and national decision making. One of the reasons for this is that the Ottawa Charter and the Adelaide Recommendations have defined public policy supporting health as a frame for the improvement of health status which could more effectively assure (compared to earlier health promotion practices) that through the improvement of the social, built and natural environment, initiatives serving the improvement of health status could be realized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913910391039">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757913910391039">11</xref></sup> The basis of creating health-supporting public policy is that people working on certain policy concepts, development issues or on alternative solutions should pay special attention to the possible health effects of the proposals, just as it is suggested by Wismar et al.: ‘If it was a societal and political aim to avoid or minimize negative impacts on health, it would be necessary to feed information on the health impacts of a proposal and its alternatives into the decision-making process.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913910391039">12</xref></sup> One of the methods to do this could be the use of a decision-supporting tool such as HIA.</p>
<p>According to WHO, HIA is ‘a combination of methods, procedures, and tools which can assess the possible effects of projects, programmes, strategies on the health of the population and the distribution of these effect in the various groups of the population.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757913910391039">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Wismar et al. says: ‘It is intended to support decision making in choosing between options and it does this by predicting the future consequences of implementing the different options.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913910391039">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Curtis’s opinion is: ‘Although there is no single approach to HIA, it is typically prospective, aiming to anticipate in advance how a policy, intervention or development will influence health and health inequalities, and to influence the design of the planned activity in ways which will maximize potential health gains and minimize the disbenefits to health.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757913910391039">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to information from the HIA sub-network working group in the WHO European Healthy Cities Project, the realization of HIA is usually fulfilled by special advisors as contracted experts in the case of individual projects. Taking into consideration the interests of the City of Pécs, the final aim was to establish a solution for the integration of HIA into local decision-making processes that would be effective, sustainable, without the need of significant financial resources and with a repeatable evaluation–analysing system. After considering various possibilities, it was decided that some officials would be selected from the city administration employees who, according to the preliminary plans, after participating in a training programme would prepare HIAs to support the decision-making process concerning all the proposals of the local government – so, similarly to the legal control, a health control would be applied.</p>
<p>This decision was made because city administration employees already constituted an available human resource and they had professional competence based on their daily work in the preparation of policy concepts and decisions, so therefore had a thorough and wide knowledge of the operation of the city council. After the necessary discussions, the city notary delegated two officials from each of the departments in the city administration. A training programme held by the experts of the Healthy City Foundation of Pécs (trained by the Healthy Cities HIA Sub-network) taught them about the methods of HIA and its most relevant phases of work concerning the preparation of decisions. In total, 32 officials took part in the training over five weeks. Training was organized during working hours, as official professional training, in the City Hall. The training methods used were presentations, problem solving in small groups and individual exercises with a time frame of 90 minutes, according to the following themes:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1757913910391039">15</xref></sup></p>

<title>Implementation of HIA in City Administration</title>
<p>Any level of a decision-making system can operate successfully if the planned action is based on the widest available knowledge in connection with most of the consequences. This is especially important if we consider that most of the decisions made by local decision-making systems could have widespread and important effects on the health status of individuals, as it was expressed by Wismar, ‘changes induced by political decision making can result in changes to overall population health’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1757913910391039">16</xref></sup> However, decision makers do not always have the necessary information about these issues because such considerations are often not included in the series of issues to be considered during the decision-making process. Our training programme was organized with the aim of changing this situation – i.e. the officials delegated from the various departments of the city administration could gain the knowledge that would make the screening and scoping phases of HIA possible. According to the original plans, participants of the training programme were to form ‘screening groups’ of three persons who would become competent experts based on their professional knowledge and would form a common system to prepare one of the following three statements in connection with documents undergoing HIA:</p>
<list id="list6-1757913910391039" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The health effects during the realization of the actions, plans, concepts examined in the document are already known, in this way HIA is not applicable.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The health effects during the realization of the actions, plans, concepts examined in the document are so mild that HIA is not applicable.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The health effects during the realization of the actions, plans, concepts examined in the document are not identified yet so further HIA is necessary.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The intention was for every screening group to be formed of officials from various departments, and for documents selected according to a generally accepted system of criteria to be evaluated by every group. The work of the groups in their decisions and proposals in connection with certain documents would have been collected by a coordinator and passed on to the decision makers. In this way, based on screening and scoping phase of HIA, the screening groups could have made suggestions about the continuation of HIA and, based on the results, they could have proposed the finalization or the revision of the document.</p>
<p>These planned actions would have created a supportive atmosphere during the official preparation of decisions for the effective realization of multi-sectoral collaboration and for a better utilization of possibilities provided by HIA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1757913910391039">
<title>Lessons Learnt: Next Steps</title>
<p>Unfortunately the elaboration of the system has not been realized. One of the reasons is that the working method that was well organized and shaped in theory, proved to be rather complicated in practice. The introduction of the new system was further hindered by a reorganization of the city administration soon after the training programme – even the structure of departments was changed. During these changes the officials who were to fulfil the tasks of HIA did not get the necessary support and attention.</p>
<p>It turned out that the preparation phase for introducing HIA was not strong enough nor well enough targeted and the timeframe also proved to be short. The lack of competence in health issues and the introduction of a new professional task compared to their daily routine did not give the responsible officials enough self-confidence to believe that they could do the job. There also seemed to be a lack of motivation, as there is no legal background for the application of HIA as a decision-supporting tool in the work of city councils.</p>
<p>Another – even more decisive – factor of the failure to make the system of HIA operational was the lack of involvement of decision makers (e.g. chairmen of city committees, responsible vice-mayors) in the initiative. Without their involvement neither HIA nor any other operative work aiming at multi-sectoral collaboration could be fully successful. However, the lack of support from decision makers cannot be considered primarily the responsibility of the potential decision makers themselves. The organizers and implementers of the initiative did not consider gaining and strengthening political support to be a priority because they considered the task of HIA to be solely technical and professional. In light of this, it has to be stated that despite HIA being a professional issue it could have consequences in connection with the context of decision making and with local public life. Hence without the support and legitimacy of the decision makers it cannot be realized in an effective form. To achieve this, the actors of decision making should be informed and should have the opportunity to take part in the activities in connection with HIA in the preparation phase.</p>
<p>However, all the above experience was gained after the training programme. Therefore our activities are now to be re-shifted that a new structure is elaborated which will make it possible for the representatives of the decision-making system to play a more active role in the preparation phase. Preparations are under way to provide an opportunity for the involvement of chairmen of local government committees, heads of party groups and other stakeholders in the decision-making process. At the same time the number of screening groups will be reduced so that the whole process of work will be simplified.</p>
<p>Based on the experiences and the main lessons learnt, the next steps will be targeted to a much stronger and longer preparation phase with the emphasis on improving the competence in health issues and the motivation of participating officials by creating a stronger link between health and their daily routine work area. By this, we hope that all the members of the city administration taking part in HIA will have the self-confidence to do the job. The training package that was used before will play a larger part in building competence in health issues and increasing motivation. Concerning the changes in the techniques, the involvement of certain political actors will be necessary from the first stages.</p>
<p>Taking everything into consideration, the first experiences of integrating HIA as a decision-supporting tool into the local decision-making system has not been completely successful. At the same time, the fact that the attention of officials in the city administration could be drawn to the health effects of decisions in an organized, structured way definitely enhanced the creation of a basis of health-supportive decision making. The successful realization of the training programme could be regarded as an important result. In this way, we have a tool that could help to distribute HIA knowledge connected with the decision-making process to the experts working in city councils.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Based on the Healthy Cities Project strategy and the principles in the City of Pécs, the methods and the process of preparing a health profile, a city health plan and a health development plan were realized over a decade. The experiences of health planning work in the city administration ‘prepared the soil’ for a more concentrated and targeted approach of HIA which was supposed to be more efficient and applicable for the creation of a long-term healthy public policy in the city, with the active participation of the city administration and the decision makers. It was proved that HIA is relatively cheap and effective in forming the basis of a health-conscious planning and conceptual work like recent studies that ‘the benefits derived from sample HIAs outweigh the cost of undertaking them suggesting that HIA is not only effective but also cost-effective.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757913910391039">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The practical example of the application of an HIA method into health-orientated planning is how the Healthy City Foundation of Pécs has initiated the integration of HIA as a decision-supporting tool into the local government decision-making process. To achieve this, a training programme was organized for the officials of the city administration. However, the complexity of the planned system and the lack of support from the political actors resulted in the failure of the integration of HIA into the decision-making process so further activities will be organized on new foundations. Nevertheless, it could be evaluated as a success that a tool has been developed that can assist with the distribution of all the knowledge about HIA connected to the preparation and making of decisions to the officials and the politicians of the city council.</p>
