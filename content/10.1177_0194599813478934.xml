<body>
<p>Cervical lymphatic metastasis is an important consideration in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The survival rate decreases by nearly one-half in patients with nodal metastasis. However, there has been debate regarding the proper treatment methods for clinically node-negative (cN0) neck. Generally, elective neck dissection (END) is performed in patients in whom the primary lesion was treated surgically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813478934">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813478934">2</xref></sup> As most patients with cN0 stage disease do not have nodal metastasis, they may be undergoing an unnecessary operation. For patients in whom the primary lesion was transorally resected, a separate cervical incision is required to perform END, which leaves an apparent scar around the neck and may induce postoperative disfigurement.</p>
<p>Previously, Kang et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813478934">3</xref></sup> performed robot-assisted neck dissection (RAND) via a transaxillary approach for the management of thyroid carcinoma with lateral neck node metastasis and reported improved feasibility and excellent cosmetic results. However, it is difficult to visualize level IIa and Va in patients with prominent clavicles because the dissection proceeds in the inferior-to-superior direction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813478934">3</xref></sup> Then, Kim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813478934">4</xref></sup> modified the technique and performed RAND via the transaxillary and retroauricular (TARA) approach for the neck dissection in patients with HNSCC. After the initial report of RAND via TARA, our group tried to dissect the upper neck level I to III through RAND via a modified facelift approach, alleviating an axillary incision to reduce the extent of dissection. We reported on the feasibility and clear cosmetic benefits of robot-assisted supraomohyoid neck dissection via a modified facelift approach in a patient with oral cavity cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813478934">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813478934">6</xref></sup> Because it was performed through a modified facelift incision, the postoperative scar was hidden behind the hairline, and the patients were extremely satisfied with their cosmetic results. Recently, after having accumulated additional experience with RAND, we attempted to perform level IV and V as well as level I to III dissections via a modified facelift or retroauricular approach without an axillary incision.</p>
<p>Transoral robotic surgery (TORS), which has been actively investigated as a minimally invasive technique for the treatment of laryngopharyngeal carcinoma, can be used to remove lesions en bloc without external incisions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813478934">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813478934"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813478934"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813478934"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813478934"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813478934"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813478934">13</xref></sup> Accordingly, it leads to rapid functional recovery and may attain superior functional outcomes compared with conventional surgery. However, an additional cervical incision is required to perform END, which may leave visible scars on the neck. We performed robot-assisted selective neck dissection (SND) via a modified facelift or retroauricular approach to hide the apparent scar behind the hairline, to remove lateral or posterior neck compartments after TORS in patients with laryngopharyngeal carcinoma. We prospectively analyzed the patient data to verify the feasibility and efficacy of robot-assisted SND including levels II to IV or II to V in the treatment of cN0 laryngopharyngeal carcinoma.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Between March 2011 and March 2012, 7 patients diagnosed with laryngopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled in this prospective study. Before initiation, the Institutional Review Board of Yonsei University approved the study, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) at least 18 years old at the time of diagnosis, (2) the primary lesion could be removed by TORS without an external incision, and (3) the presence of laryngopharyngeal carcinoma (oropharyngeal, laryngeal, and hypopharyngeal carcinoma) of clinical N0 neck stage. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) contraindications for surgery or general anesthesia, (2) a cervical incision or mandibulotomy was required to remove the primary lesion, and (3) the presence of clinically pathologic nodal disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0194599813478934">
<title>Operative Procedure</title>
<p>All operations were conducted by the senior author (Y.W.K.) using a da Vinci robotic system (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale, California). RAND was performed first, followed by TORS to remove the primary lesion. Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the supine position on the surgical bed. A shoulder roll was inserted below the shoulder, and the head was slightly rotated toward the contralateral side of the lesion. We modified the RAND technique using TARA, as previously reported, to remove levels II to IV or II to V through a single incision (a modified facelift or retroauricular incision).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813478934">4</xref></sup> After designing the modified facelift or retroauricular incision, the skin flap was elevated along the subplatysmal plane to the midline anteriorly, to the inferior border of the mandible superiorly, and to the clavicle inferiorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813478934"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>). During the elevation of the skin flap, 2 assistants pulled the flap up using an Army-Navy retractor or right-angle retractor, and the surgeon pushed the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) down using Yankauer suction and Cushing forceps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813478934"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). This helped the operator elevate the skin flap to the clavicle inferiorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813478934"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813478934"><bold>D</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>Level IIb was dissected under direct visualization and standard surgical instruments. The operative view of level IIb was sufficient because a retroauricular approach was used to dissect the upper neck level in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813478934"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). First, the dissection was performed along the inferior border of the submandibular gland, and the posterior belly of the digastric muscle and the internal jugular vein were identified. The spinal accessory nerve was then identified near the internal jugular vein, with the transverse process of the atlas as a landmark. After level IIb dissection was completed, the specimen was passed medially under the spinal accessory nerve while holding it with a vein retractor. Next, the surgeon opened the fascia along the whole posterior border of the SCM, and the fibrofatty tissue was dissected from the medial side of the SCM by elevating it upward using an Army-Navy retractor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599813478934"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>). A self-retained retractor (Sejong Medical Corp, Korea) was then inserted through the working space and maintained during the operation.</p>

<p>One endoscope arm and 2 instrument arms were inserted through the working space. With superior and medial retraction of the specimen of level IIb, which was already dissected, the level IIa dissection was started, superior to inferior (Supplementary Video 1, available at otojournal .org). The hypoglossal nerve was identified and preserved near the carotid bifurcation area. During the level IIa dissection, the superior thyroid and lingual artery were identified and preserved. Next, level III was dissected using the robotic system, again superior to inferior. Lymphoadipose tissue was carefully dissected from the internal jugular vein using harmonic curved shears or a spatula cautery equipped with robotic arms. Because the skin flap and SCM were already elevated, it was not difficult to dissect level V (posterior to anterior) in cases in which level V dissection was necessary. The transverse cervical artery was identified and preserved on the floor of level V. The specimen was then retracted superiorly and medially, and level IV dissection was performed. During the dissection of level IV, the lymphatic or thoracic duct was ligated using harmonic curved shears or hemolock clips. The vagus nerve, carotid artery, and jugular vein were identified and preserved by carefully opening the carotid sheath. After neck dissection was complete, the neck specimens were removed through the modified facelift or retroauricular incision. One drainage tube was inserted behind the incision line, and the operation was completed. During the operation, one assistant was located near the incision port while the 3 robotic arms were inserted; the assistant actively provided suction and irrigation aspirated from the surgical field and attempted to ligate vessels or lymphatic ducts using a hemoclip or hemolock clips.</p>

<title>Outcome Assessment</title>
<p>Patients’ clinical information, tumor location and stage, admission records, surgical records, complications, actual time for neck dissection, estimated blood loss, and other data were collected and analyzed. The actual time for neck dissection was defined as the length of time from incision to removal of the surgical specimen. The postoperative drainage amount was measured every 24 hours, and the drain was removed when the amount was less than 20 mL. The patient was discharged the following day. Any signs of local perioperative complications, including numbness of the ear lobe, mouth corner deviation, nerve injury, or chyle leakage, or any postoperative complications, including seroma, hematoma, hemorrhage, infection, or skin flap necrosis, were examined and recorded when present. Patient satisfaction with the cosmetic results was measured on a graded scale of I (extremely satisfied), II (satisfied), III (average), IV (dissatisfied), and V (extremely dissatisfied). This subjective measure of cosmetic satisfaction was already described by our previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813478934">14</xref></sup>

<title>Treatment Outcomes</title>
<p>The primary tumor site was found within the tonsil for 3 patients, the pyriform sinus in 2 patients, the tongue base in 1 patient, and the suprahyoid epiglottis in 1 patient. According to the guidelines of the American Joint Committee on Cancer, the clinical TNM stage of patients (T1N0M0 in 2 patients, T2N0M0 in 3 patients, and T3N0M0 in 2 patients) was determined using a physical examination and imaging studies. The pathologic TNM stage was analyzed based on the specimen acquired after the operation (T1N0M0 in 2 patients, T2N0M0 in 2 patients, T2N1M0 in 1 patient, and T3N0M0 in 2 patients; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599813478934"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). The mean total operating time was 135.86 ± 61.0 minutes, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 10.86 ± 2.1 days (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813478934"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). The amount of postoperative drainage was 275.14 ± 189.4 mL, and the drainage duration was 5.71 ± 2.2 days (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813478934"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). To compare these results of RAND with traditional neck dissection, we retrospectively analyzed the treatment outcomes of 18 patients with laryngopharyngeal cancer of clinically N0 neck stage who received selective neck dissection including level II to IV or II to V via a transcervical incision during the same study period. The primary tumor sites were oropharynx (n = 4), hypopharynx (n = 8), and larynx (n = 11). Six patients received bilateral selective neck dissection. The pathologic TNM stages were T1N0M0 (n = 5), T1N1M0 (n = 4), T2N0M0 (n = 6), T2N1M0 (n = 2), and T3N0M0 (n = 1). Although there are limitations of retrospective chart reviews in this data, the RAND group showed a significant longer operation time than the open neck dissection group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0194599813478934"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>). An average of 25.1 lymph nodes were retrieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599813478934"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). Occult nodal metastasis was found in 1 (14%) neck specimen. Five patients underwent SND including levels II to IV, and 2 patients underwent SND including levels II to V. Four patients underwent surgery alone, without adjuvant radiation. Three patients received adjuvant radiotherapy as indicated for lymphovascular invasion (1 patient), positive resection margin (1 patient), and a pT3 lesion (1 patient). During the follow-up period (mean of 13.5 months), all patients were alive without locoregional recurrence. All patients were extremely satisfied with their cosmetic results after the operation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599813478934"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599813478934"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>During the operations, important cranial nerves such as the hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, spinal accessory nerve, and lingual nerve were all identified and preserved (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0194599813478934"><bold>Table 4</bold></xref>). Using spatula cautery or harmonic curved shears, lymphoadipose tissue was cautiously dissected from the internal jugular vein without damaging the great vessels in the neck. Although 3 patients experienced postoperative numbness of the ear lobe, this symptom resolved within several months. When level IV was dissected, the lymphatic or thoracic duct was ligated using harmonic curved shears or hemolock clips. A single patient developed a self-limited chyle leakage, which resolved with conservative management (a fat-free diet and external gauze compression around the lower neck) within a week. The average blood loss was 193 mL (range, 110-250 mL). Using harmonic curved shears or hemolock clips, the branch of the internal jugular vein and the named artery (facial artery) was cautiously ligated without significant bleeding. Surgeons should be especially careful not to inflict venous branches originating from the internal jugular vein in the lower neck. When the internal jugular vein was injured unpredictably, it could be controlled using Hemoclips after compressing the injured area with Maryland forctif or Harmonic scalpel blades. Therefore, significant vascular injury that required transfusion or conversion to open surgery could be prevented.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although there is controversy about the most appropriate neck management of cN0 laryngopharyngeal cancer, END is usually performed in patients who undergo surgery to remove the primary tumor. The rationale for END is as follows.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813478934">15</xref></sup> First, radiotherapy could be saved for situations in which locoregional recurrence or a second primary cancer occurred afterward. Second, adjuvant therapy can be performed selectively in patients with adverse pathology such as multiple occult nodal metastasis or extracapsular nodal spread. Nevertheless, because most cN0 patients have no metastatic neck disease, a shortcoming of END is that the surgery may be unnecessary. In addition, with the increased use of TORS for the treatment of laryngopharyngeal cancer, additional cervical incisions, which are required to perform neck dissection, may be another burden to patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813478934">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813478934"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813478934"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813478934"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813478934"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813478934"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813478934">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813478934">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599813478934"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599813478934"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813478934"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599813478934">20</xref></sup> For these reasons, we previously reported on the feasibility and efficacy of supraomohyoid neck dissection using a robotic surgical system through a modified facelift approach in oral tongue cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813478934">5</xref></sup> Robot-assisted supraomohyoid neck dissection showed a clear cosmetic benefit in the study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813478934">6</xref></sup> However, the lower neck levels (including levels IV and V) must be removed for END of oropharyngeal, supraglottic, and hypopharyngeal cancer. In the initial phase of the study, a combined TARA approach was used to perform RAND in patients who required level IV or V dissection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813478934">4</xref></sup> Subsequently, because lymph node metastasis of laryngopharyngeal cancer usually occurred in level II or III, we expected that a modified facelift or retroauricular approach would be more feasible than the TARA approach for neck dissection. As we gained more experience with RAND, we found that the subplatysmal flap could be elevated to the level of the clavicle through a modified facelift approach and that a sufficient view of levels IV and V and working space could be obtained by elevating the SCM upward after opening the fascia along the entire posterior border of the SCM and dissecting the fibrofatty tissue from the medial side. It is difficult to dissect the upper neck levels (IIa and Va) only via a transaxillary approach, as previously reported by Kang et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813478934">3</xref></sup> and level IV dissection is difficult in patients with prominent clavicles because the dissection proceeds in the inferior-to-superior direction. On the other hand, when a modified facelift or retroauricular approach is used, the dissection proceeds in a superior-to-inferior direction, making it easy to dissect the upper neck levels and remove levels IV and V, irrespective of clavicle prominence. Furthermore, when an axillary incision is abbreviated, the time required to elevate the skin flap and create a working space could be decreased and better results could be obtained in terms of cosmesis.</p>
<p>At the initial study period, we preferred the facelift approach because it provided a wider working space for the robotic instrument arms than the retroauricular approach. However, as we accumulated our experience with RAND, we noticed that the retroauricular approach could support sufficient working space for robotic arms without preauricular incision. Moreover, the retroauricular approach is less invasive compared with the modified facelift approach, since the neck dissection could be performed through a single port. Therefore, in a later phase of the study, we preferred RAND via the retroauricular approach.</p>
<p>In this study, the short-term operative outcomes were satisfactory, and no serious perioperative or postoperative complications related to robot-assisted SND occurred. The 3-dimensional magnified operative view supported by the endoscopic arm helped the surgeon identify and preserve significant nerves such as the hypoglossal, spinal accessory, vagus, and phrenic nerves. Harmonic curved shears or hemolock clips were used to ligate the lymphatic or thoracic duct in level IV dissection. Nevertheless, minor chyle leakage occurred in 1 patient but improved with conservative management. Careful dissection is required in level IV to prevent such a complication. Although robot-assisted SND was performed concurrently with transoral robotic lateral oropharyngectomy in 3 patients with tonsillar cancer, no pharyngocutaneous fistulas occurred in any patients. Because all patients underwent TORS to remove the primary lesion and robot-assisted SND via a modified facelift or retroauricular approach, there were no visible scars on the face or neck, leading to satisfactory cosmetic outcomes.</p>
<p>We do not believe that the advantage of RAND via these approaches is limited to only the cosmetic outcome. Because a trifurcation incision was not used in this procedure, there may be some benefit in the wound-healing process. With the increasing use of chemoradiation as a primary treatment for head and neck cancer, the use of salvage surgery after its failure has also increased. However, radiotherapy deteriorates the blood supply to the skin flap, which may cause problems related to the postoperative wound-healing process after a salvage operation. If the cervical great vessels were to be exposed because of necrosis of the skin flap, lethal complications such as massive bleeding from the carotid artery may occur. However, a modified facelift or retroauricular incision is far from the field receiving direct radiotherapy. Therefore, the putative risk for wound-healing problems is lower than with conventional cervical incisions. Even if necrosis of the skin flap were to occur, exposure of the great vessels could be avoided because they are far from the incision line. Although not discussed in this study, we also successfully performed robot-assisted neck dissection in a patient with nodal recurrence after chemoradiation and can affirm the possibility of performing robot-assisted neck dissection as a salvage operation. In the future, we plan to investigate the feasibility and safety of robot-assisted neck dissection in patients with nodal recurrence after chemoradiation failure. Moreover, we expect that there are benefits of RAND compared with conventional neck dissection in functional aspects such as subcutaneous induration/fibrosis, lymphedema, incision site sensory disturbance, and objective range of neck motion. Further investigation will be required to confirm these functional outcomes.</p>
<p>Owing to the small number of patients and short follow-up period, the oncologic safety of robot-assisted SND is difficult to establish from the present study. However, considering the number of retrieved lymph nodes, this procedure could serve as a suitable elective neck procedure in cN0 laryngopharyngeal carcinoma patients. In future work, we plan to investigate long-term outcomes related to oncologic safety and functional results and to study the feasibility of the procedure for therapeutic neck dissection in patients with pathologic nodal disease.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Robot-assisted SND is a feasible and safe technique in cN0 laryngopharyngeal carcinoma patients. It may be especially helpful in patients who underwent TORS to remove a primary lesion because it does not leave an apparent scar around the neck. Long-term results on oncologic safety and functional outcomes are required to establish the validity of robot-assisted SND.</p>
