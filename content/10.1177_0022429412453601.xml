<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this inquiry was to examine the current reflections of experienced teachers on their past perceptions of preservice music teacher preparation as documented in the author’s previous research. Research questions included the following: (a) How would participants describe their reactions to a present-day examination of 1999 or 2000 data (journals, individual and focus group interviews, and two questionnaires) and 2002 study findings? (b) How had their perceptions regarding preservice music teacher preparation changed since 1999-2000? and (c) On the basis of their recent work with preservice interns and student teachers, what could these experienced teachers say about preservice music teacher preparation today? Data collected in 2010 included participant journals and individual interviews. Findings categories include (a) general agreement with 2002 study findings regarding best and worst facets of preservice preparation, (b) experience is the best teacher, (c) teacher education is doing the best it can do, (d) preservice students will get out of teacher education what they put into it, and (e) specific suggestions for teacher education provided by participants.</p>

<p>When I published the 2002 article “Perceptions of Beginning Teachers, Mentors, and Administrators Regarding Preservice Music Teacher Preparation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022429412453601">Conway, 2002</xref>), there was very little information regarding beginning music teacher perceptions in the literature. Although the Society for Music Teacher Education (SMTE) had been formed in the late 1980s, it had yet to hold meetings apart from sessions at MENC: The National Association for Music Education (now NAfME) biennial conferences. The <italic>Journal of Music Teacher Education</italic> (<italic>JMTE</italic>) also existed but had been publishing primarily interest articles and position papers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022429412453601">Asmus, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022429412453601">Bidner, 2001</xref>), as few researchers were examining teacher education in an empirical way at that time. In the 2002 article, I framed the rationale for my inquiry within some of those <italic>JMTE</italic> editorials and position papers and stated,<disp-quote>
<p>In a recent discussion that connects program evaluation to music teacher preparation reform, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022429412453601">Bidner (2001)</xref> suggests that there is a “need to document the impact that our programs are having on the ability of our teacher candidates to teach” (p. 3). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022429412453601">Asmus (2000)</xref> supports this need: “Music teacher education has never before needed a base of substantive information about how to best prepare music teachers as it does now” (p. 5). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022429412453601">Conway, 2002</xref>, pp. 20–21)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<sec id="section1-0022429412453601">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Since the publication of the 2002 article, several additional studies have added to the knowledge base regarding in-service teacher views of teacher preparation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022429412453601">Brophy (2002)</xref> administered a survey designed to examine in-service teacher perceptions of preservice preparation. It was sent to the combined membership of the Orff, Kodály, Dalcroze, and Music Learning Theory organizations (more than 8,000 teachers) and had 237 survey returns. Although this was a low response rate, his work represents one of the few studies that directly addressed in-service teacher perceptions of teacher preparation. He provided many specific recommendations based on his findings (e.g., inclusion of solfège preparation in the curriculum) as well as more general ideas (e.g., need for more and longer fieldwork).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022429412453601">Ballantyne and Parker (2004)</xref> reported on early career music teachers in Queensland, Australia. Data collection included questionnaires completed by 76 classroom music teachers and in-depth follow-up interviews with 15 of the original participants. Although possibly specific to teacher preparation in Australia, Ballantyne reported that “teachers perceived a need for teacher education courses to be contextualized, integrated and allow for the continual development of knowledge and skills throughout their early years in school” (p. 3).</p>
<p>Nine 1st-year music teachers were interviewed by Rouston, Legette, and Trotman Womak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022429412453601">2005</xref>) regarding their transition from student teaching into the 1st year of teaching. Findings that are relevant to the study reported here include that the teachers “valued pre-service preparation that was ‘hands-on,’” and some participants “reported missing learning about crucial aspects relevant to their work” (p. 59).</p>
<p>In a study published in 2007, my coauthors and I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022429412453601">Conway, Eros, Hourigan, &amp; Stanley, 2007</xref>) reported a replication of my earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022429412453601">Conway, 2002</xref>) to some extent but examined only the teaching of secondary instruments portion of the preservice curriculum (the results of the 2002 study are described in detail in the concluding section of this article). Participants for the study included four beginning teachers, and data included observations and an individual interview with each teacher, a focus group interview, an e-mail survey response for each teacher, and self-study teacher-researcher logs from secondary instrument course instructors who were also the researchers. Findings suggested that the beginning teachers valued the notebooks and materials provided in the instrument techniques classes but remembered few of the actual class activities and assignments. Beginning teachers felt strongly that music education courses should be taught by faculty or assistants who had taught music in preK–12 schools. Participants also suggested that strategies for teaching specific instrument techniques are learned on the job, as little of that content can be learned outside of the context of a music classroom.</p>
<p>Overall, this small body of research on teacher perceptions of preservice education has provided the profession with some insight into needed reforms in teacher education. However, it seemed that asking experienced teachers (several of whom had now been cooperating teachers to preservice interns and student teachers) to reflect back on the data from their early career responses regarding teacher preparation might provide unique insights regarding in-service teacher perceptions of teacher preparation. Within general teacher education literature, there is a precedent of returning, years later, to 1st-year teacher experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022429412453601">Bullough &amp; Baughman, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022429412453601">Bullough and Baughman’s (1997)</xref> seminal study has been cited regularly in the beginning teacher literature. Although they did not discuss teacher preparation, because their goal was to describe Baughman’s teaching experiences and growth, their work did provide a framework for this study.</p>

<title>Purpose and Research Questions</title>
<p>The purpose of this inquiry was to examine the current reflections of experienced teachers on their past perceptions of preservice music teacher preparation as documented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022429412453601">Conway (2002)</xref>. Research questions included (a) How would participants describe their reactions to a present day examination of 1999 and/or 2000 data (journals, mentor interviews, teacher interviews, beginning teacher interviews, beginning teacher focus group interviews, and two questionnaires) and 2002 study findings? (b) How had their perceptions regarding preservice music teacher preparation changed since 1999-2000? and (c) Based on their recent experiences with preservice interns and student teachers, what could these experienced teachers tell us about preservice music teacher preparation today?</p>

<sec id="section3-0022429412453601" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>In the Method section of the 2002 article, I described the study as a “qualitative formative program evaluation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022429412453601">Conway, 2002</xref>, p. 23), having used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429412453601">Patton (1990)</xref> as a guide. I explained the following data sets collected in 1999–2000: individual interviews and classroom observations, focus group interviews, teacher journals, mentor and administrator interviews, researcher’s log, and year-end questionnaires. The current study can be described best as a qualitative reflection on the results of the 2002 study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429412453601">Patton, 2002</xref>). Patton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429412453601">2002</xref>) approached qualitative research from the perspective of “strategic themes” (pp. 40–41) and did not insist that a qualitative study adhere to a specific design (e.g., case study, ethnography, phenomenology, etc.).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022429412453601">Patton’s (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022429412453601">2002</xref>) strategic themes included naturalistic inquiry (data for this study were collected at the schools of the teachers); emergent design (research questions allowed for themes to emerge); purposeful sampling (participants were selected purposefully on the basis of their participation 10 years previously); observations, interviews, and documents as data (data for the 2010 study included interviews, documents, and e-mail journals); personal experience and engagement (my previous rapport with these teachers from 1999–2000 and my continued connection with them for 10 years is a strength); empathetic neutrality and mindfulness (as an experienced qualitative researcher, I worked to be “mindful” in both data collection and analysis); inductive analysis (my past experience with beginning teacher research and my expertise in teacher professional development provided an important framework for my interpretation of the data); holistic perspective (an effort was made not only to search for responses to the 10-year-old data but also to be “open” to new themes that emerged when the data were considered holistically); context sensitivity (I had a decade of continued connection with these teachers and a solid understanding of their teaching context); and voice of participants (all themes presented in the findings are supported with participant quotes).</p>
<sec id="section4-0022429412453601">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The 2002 article reported on 14 primary participants. All were graduates of the same institution (referred to in the 2002 article as Big Ten University [BTU]).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022429412453601">1</xref></sup> Seven participants had begun their 1st year of teaching in 1999, and the other 7 had begun in 2000. The participants who had begun teaching in 1999 were studied in 1999 and 2000. Twelve of those original 14 teachers participated in the current study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022429412453601">Table 1</xref> for current profiles). One of the 1999 participants was no longer teaching, and I was unable to reach one of the 2000 participants. Eleven of the 2010 participants had completed master’s degrees during the previous 10 years (one in conducting, three in education, and seven in music education). One already held a master’s degree in performance, completed before she obtained teacher certification.</p>

<title>Data Sources and Procedures</title>
<sec id="section6-0022429412453601">
<title>Participant 2010 written reflections</title>
<p>Each of the participants read my article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022429412453601">Conway, 2002</xref>) as well as transcripts from his or her own 1999 and/or 2000 interview (approximately 20 single-spaced pages) and an e-mail log (page range from 2 to 20 single-spaced pages depending on the participant). They then responded via e-mail to the following prompts: (a) “As you read the 2002 <italic>JRME</italic>, what were your reactions? (to the article in general as well as to the specific information reported on you) and (b) “As you read the document I sent you in March with our 10-year old e-mail communication and interview data, what were your reactions to that data regarding your perceptions of preservice preparation?” A combined written document with responses from all 12 participants resulted in 25 single-spaced pages of text.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022429412453601">
<title>Individual interview</title>
<p>Each of the participants participated in a 30-min individual interview in May or June 2010 that provided the opportunity to discuss his or her written reflections and overall responses as well as respond to additional prompts, including (a) What would you say are your current views regarding preservice music teacher preparation? (What is teacher education doing well? And what is still a problem?) (b) How do you think these views on teacher education have changed since your first year of teaching? and (c) With 10 years of teaching now behind you, what other information can you provide to the profession regarding the preparation of teachers? The eight teachers still working in Michigan were interviewed in person. The other four who were out of the state were interviewed via telephone. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed (50 single-spaced pages of text).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022429412453601">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The three research questions guided the analysis as I examined 2010 participant writings and interview transcripts. Two coders (the researcher and a trained research assistant from the University of Michigan’s Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program) conducted simultaneous analyses, and then coding schemes were compared.</p>
<p>As was the case for the 2002 report, the following techniques were employed to address the validity of this study: data collection triangulation, member checks, and attention to investigator expertise. Additional strategies for the 2010 study included data analysis triangulation.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022429412453601" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Findings and Discussion</title>
<p>The first section of findings reports on 2010 agreement with 2002 findings. Discussion and connection to past literature are provided with the presentation of findings where appropriate.</p>
<sec id="section10-0022429412453601">
<title>2010 Agreement With 2002 Findings</title>
<p>In the 2002 article, I reported that student teaching, preservice fieldwork, and musicianship development were perceived as the most valuable aspects of teacher preparation, whereas College of Education courses, classroom observations without context, and some instrument methods courses were perceived as the least valuable aspects of preservice preparation. Appendix A (see online supplemental material available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jrme.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://jrme.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>) includes a quote from the 2002 article that described the teacher education program that those participants were discussing. After 10 years of teaching and multiple interactions with current preservice teachers, participants in this study were in general agreement with the findings from the 2002 article.</p>
<sec id="section11-0022429412453601">
<title>Student teaching, preservice fieldwork, and musicianship still were perceived as the most valuable aspects of teacher preparation</title>
<p>Doug said, “Honestly, I would say that just about everything still rings true. Courses from the College of Ed were the least valuable part of my teacher education and student teaching was the most valuable.” He also added, “I think most universities do a good job of continuing and developing students’ individual instrumental/musical skills.” James said, “I still think that students need to be out in classrooms, for a course or volunteering, to get an idea of what music education really is.” When Adam was asked what teacher education was doing well, he replied,<disp-quote>
<p>Building musicianship. It is your skill in working with music that will always be demanded of you. It is also the knowledge of the process of how musical skill is built that you will be asked to recreate, reproduce, pass on and enact with your students in order to be considered someone who teaches music.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Also regarding musicianship, Mark suggested, “I gained a pretty solid understanding of the woodwind instruments through applied lessons with the faculty. The performance opportunities were great, and helped me develop my own musicianship further.”</p>
<p>Experienced teachers still viewed student teaching and preservice fieldwork as most valuable. However, I had thought musicianship might be perceived by experienced teachers as less important than they considered it 10 years ago. This clearly was not the case with these participants. This finding helps teacher educators decide what must be done on campus and what might be left to on-the-job training. Advancing the students’ skills in performance, aural skills, score study, conducting, orchestration, and ensemble playing (as is typical of the core curriculum in many music schools) are things that the university can and should do.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0022429412453601">
<title>College of Education courses and classroom observations without context still were perceived as the least valuable aspects of preservice preparation</title>
<p>It was surprising to me that in looking back, the participants still felt as if the College of Education classes were not useful: “Those College of Ed prep classes that we had to take . . . those weren’t very helpful” (Penny); “Teacher education classes are great for laying a philosophical foundation in the minds of young teachers, but we all learn by doing, and real life experience is the best way to learn” (Marie); and “I understand the need to cover the philosophical aspects of teaching, but to be honest, at the time, it didn’t really make sense and connect” (Mark) were some responses. Alison stated,<disp-quote>
<p>I remember clearly feeling like the master’s-level courses we took through the College of Education were a complete waste of time, and in retrospect I still think so. This feels very out of balance as one who has now completed a master’s degree in the general education field, and found it extremely valuable.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With regard to fieldwork and observation, Alison wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>I also continue to agree that the amount of time spent in the classroom with kids in preservice fieldwork needs to be more. But as one who has now had several of these placements I feel like the structure of these placements needs to be addressed. All of my instrumental placements in undergrad felt like I was the last person on that teacher’s agenda. Often I would arrive to learn that they did not have class that day, my assigned students were absent, or that it was not a worthwhile learning experience rather than just running a sectional or lesson. Not once did I arrive and feel like there was an actual thought process to what I should do or with whom I should be working. With the insanity of the school day, I often feel bad that I do not have a single minute to meet with the interns, let alone thoughtfully give them feedback and what preparation for what they should do next time. A college student’s schedule is often so different than mine that I do not know where my class is going to be at/what they’re going to need a week from now. That doesn’t even address the fact that if you come at the same time on the same day next week it won’t even be the same class!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The contents of the College or Department of Education classes still appear to be considered as out of context and not relevant. Alison’s comment above that she felt out of “balance” in suggesting that is interesting given that she now held a Master of Arts degree in curriculum and instruction. At the outset of this study, I would have predicted that the majority of the participants would reflect on the College of Education work and think now (as 10-year veterans) that these courses were useful. It is striking that this was not the case. The effectiveness of education courses in relation to music preservice teacher development needs attention from music teacher educators and researchers.</p>
<p>The need for continued focus on classroom observations and fieldwork is supported in past literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022429412453601">Ballantyne &amp; Parker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022429412453601">Brophy, 2002</xref>). Adam made an interesting comment regarding his reflection on early observations:<disp-quote>
<p>Yes the early observations without context were a little frustrating and bewildering, but that could also be seen as necessary step in the process. You begin by getting out there and peering into the real music teacher/band director world without having a clue of what it is you are looking at or looking for other than a comparison to what you experienced as a student in a successful or unsuccessful program.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the 2002 article, “some instrument methods” were mentioned as least valuable. In the 2010 data, this topic surfaced only in the experienced teacher discussions that were coded as “experience is the best teacher,” which is addressed in the next section of findings. I found it very interesting that even though the current study participants read the 2002 findings that some instrument methods courses were not perceived as valuable, this topic did not surface in their general comments about preservice preparation, but it did surface among the participants who teach band when they were thinking about how much there is to know to be successful. This marks one of the key changes in their perceptions.</p>

<sec id="section13-0022429412453601">
<title>Views on Teacher Education Today</title>
<p>In response to the third research question (What could these experienced teachers tell us about preservice music teacher preparation today?), in the next section of findings, I examine three themes from the data regarding experienced teachers’ current views of teaching preparation, including (a) experience is the best teacher, (b) teacher education is doing the best it can do, and (c) preservice students will get out of teacher education what they put into it.</p>
<sec id="section14-0022429412453601">
<title>Experience is the best teacher</title>
<p>Penny reflected on what she wrote in 1999 by saying,<disp-quote>
<p>It was honest. I mean, I really felt unprepared. I felt, how am I going to do this job? . . . But at the same time, now that I look back and I see all the skills that I’ve gained in 10 years, I think, how could you learn it except for on the job?</p>

<p>James said, “There are also many lessons that could not be learned without the context and perspective that comes with teaching experience in your own classroom.” All of the participants expressed similar thoughts.</p>
<p>The finding that experience is the best teacher mirrors previous research results—that much is learned on the job (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022429412453601">Conway et al., 2007</xref>) and through experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022429412453601">Schmidt, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022429412453601">Schmidt (2010)</xref> provided an extended analysis of experience using Dewey’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022429412453601">1938/1963</xref>) theory of experience as a framework. Her work outlines the complexity of the construct of “experience.” Although this finding is certainly not surprising, it is somewhat troubling for teacher educators. Preservice education is just the start of the lifelong learning of music teachers, and yet teacher educators often have little opportunity to interact with music teachers after they begin teaching. In addition, little is known about the professional development of in-service music teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022429412453601">Conway, 2011</xref>). It would appear that concern for the professional development of both beginning and more-experienced music teachers is an area needing our continued scholarly thought.</p>

<title>Teacher education is doing the best it can do</title>
<p>The general idea that teacher education is doing the best it can do was suggested by multiple participants. It is important to consider that among the 12 participants in this study, only 3 had never had a student teacher, and only 2 had never had preservice interns. Most of the participants had had multiple student teachers and interns, which gave them an informed perspective on teacher education. The student teachers and interns coming in to the classrooms of the 12 participants came from 15 different teacher education institutions across three states (Michigan, Wisconsin, Texas).</p>
<p>Responses regarding teacher education included the following: “I think there is only so much teacher education can do” (Mark); “I think teacher ed. (in general) is doing all it can given the limitations of the college classroom. Real life experiences are still the best way to learn” (Marie); “Overall, I think the universities I’m familiar with are preparing their teachers well. . . . I realize there is NO WAY the university could prepare a teacher in four years for every possible situation and every skill required of successful teachers” (Jane); and “I would say that BTU’s preparation was fantastic . . . at least at the time . . . and I just don’t think there’s any way to really know” (Penny).</p>
<p>This finding that “teacher education is doing all it can do” is certainly a finding that I would expect that teacher educators themselves have felt often. For experienced music teachers to recognize this phenomenon is a new insight. Every state conference I have ever attended has had session titles such as “What They Did Not Teach You in College” and “Real-World Music Education: You Are Not at the University Anymore.” The participants in this study had the unique opportunity to examine their “former selves” through 10-year-old journals and transcripts. It may be harder for teachers who have not had that level of reflection to remember what preservice and beginning teaching were like. Teacher educators might continue to work to help preK–12 educators understand the important issues of specific context in relation to teaching and teacher growth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0022429412453601">
<title>Preservice students will get out of teacher education what they put into it</title>
<p>There was a sense from all participants that an important facet of teacher education is how much preservice teachers are proactive in making a music education program work for them. In reflecting on some of his 1999–2000 concerns, James wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>This brought back many frustrations that I had in that first year of teaching, but as a “veteran” teacher, I now look at many of those complaints as me not being proactive. If I feel under prepared, there is really only one person to blame for that, right?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teri discussed various interns and student teachers she has had over the years and wrote, “How much of the preservice preparation is the responsibility of the university versus how much of it should really be on the student?” She also suggested,<disp-quote>
<p>I think part of the solution might be making especially sure that the students who complete the program are the kinds of students who can find the answers to their questions, will understand what their shortcomings are and will not be afraid to ask for help.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>That this finding was not a part of the 2002 article represents one of the key changes in participant views regarding preservice preparation. The challenge for teacher education in considering this finding is to try to figure out what it means for preservice preparation. These teachers recognized the need for being proactive in one’s own education when they saw the issue manifest itself in student teachers and interns. The questions for teacher education become, How can teacher educators instill this disposition of being proactive in one’s own education? How can we best focus on problem-solving skills needed for success?</p>

<title>Suggestions for Teacher Education</title>
<p>Participants provided several suggestions for teacher education. These are presented and discussed in relation to additional changes in perceptions in this final section of findings.</p>
<sec id="section18-0022429412453601">
<title>Fieldwork in various settings</title>
<p>Brian suggested that preservice fieldwork students “get out to different-size schools.” He went on to discuss the need for preservice teachers to have a broad understanding of urban, rural, and suburban programs. He expressed some concern that too often, preservice music students get experience in suburban schools only. The teachers working in urban schools made similar suggestions. This finding represents a change in perceptions, as the 1999–2000 data had no similar suggestions. Back in 1999–2000, the lack of understanding of teaching context that the beginning teachers had did not lead to a concern for various contexts in teacher preparation. The need for diverse fieldwork experiences expressed by these participants is well documented in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022429412453601">Emmanuel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022429412453601">Hourigan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022429412453601">Hunt, 2009</xref>) and continues to be a challenge for teacher education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0022429412453601">
<title>A focus on the practical</title>
<p>Several of the participants suggested that teacher education continue to try to maintain a more practical focus. Mark wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>Though there was a lot of information that we were taught in our undergraduate work, it was not exactly geared in the areas that we really needed when we were “in the trenches.” . . . I still think that if I were to ever teach other teachers, I would touch upon topics that would be lifesavers. Some examples would be: understanding how to balance a budget, staying organized with your calendar, instrument repair, clear and regular communication with your parents and students, classroom management skills, basic instrument repair.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Trish expressed her concern that there was a “lack of pedagogical knowledge. . . . I don’t like that [students] can study a score to death, but have no idea how to transfer that to sixty kids in front of them.”</p>
<p>This need for a focus on the practical represents the classic divide in teacher education between theory and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022429412453601">Leonhard, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022429412453601">Meske, 1985</xref>). It also highlights the potential for misunderstandings between teacher educators at the university level and those working in preK–12 schools. I have suggested elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022429412453601">Conway, 2010</xref>) that the profession expand our notion of “teacher educator” to include cooperating teachers working with preservice interns as well as student teachers. However, this larger group of teacher educators will need to come together to discuss what it is that preservice university-based teacher education can—and should—do in relation to what needs to be learned in the field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0022429412453601">
<title>Broad teacher education preparation</title>
<p>Multiple teachers suggested what we coded as “broad preparation.” This usually referred to taking music education courses outside of instrumental or choral music education (e.g., an instrumentalist taking an early childhood music class). Trish wrote,<disp-quote>
<p>Taking courses outside our track should be required. . . . It has been INVALUABLE to my teaching career. . . . I’ve needed those skills to make it through “dry periods.” . . . [I had] to teach [new] courses in order to not have my hours cut.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants in the 2002 study had not been teaching long enough to understand the changing needs of schools and the varied expectations on music teachers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0022429412453601">
<title>Suggestions for student teaching</title>
<p>Participants discussed the need for a more lengthy student teaching experience. It should be noted that the program at BTU that was examined 10 years ago was a 5-year program and included one semester of student teaching for music education students. However, all other content areas in the teacher education program required a yearlong student teaching experience. Thus, the concept of yearlong student teaching was familiar to these participants. Elle wrote, “I was, and still am, in support of a full year student teaching experience.” Jane wrote, “The semester-long student teaching is still a weakness of the programs.” She also said, “Spending 8 weeks in each setting is just not enough, especially for elementary teachers who see each class once a week.”</p>
<p>Regarding the value of student teaching for a full year, Trish wrote, “Beginning of the school year is missed for student teaching. . . . This is the MOST important part of the school year.” Doug stated, “Personally, I’m still in favor of a longer, less intense student teaching experience. Or maybe two student teaching experiences.” Alison summed up the continued controversy with the issue when she suggested,<disp-quote>
<p>I continue to think that it does not make sense student teaching in the fall or the spring. In terms of marching band versus festival season, it’s completely ridiculous. But this is true for general music as well. The weeks and weeks that I spend in the fall for developing routines and classroom atmosphere are very different than the spring when we’re practicing for our all-school performances. There’s so much value in both, but it’s a completely different style of teaching, pacing, and management.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Alison also shared comments from the perspective of the host teacher:<disp-quote>
<p>However, as one who has now had several student teachers, I do not think I could handle having a student teacher for an entire year. Maybe knowing I had a longer stretch of time to help them develop skills would eliminate some of the pressure of knowing that they need to be ready to have their own classroom. But there always comes a point where I just need a break from this person being in my classroom all day, every day. There comes a point where I know that I can’t change their issues in the short amount of time that I have them, and definitely a point where I just want my kids back so that I can undo the bad habits that they’ve gotten into. I doubt there would be as many people willing to accept student teachers if it were for a full year commitment.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although a key component of the Holmes Group’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022429412453601">1996</xref>) teacher education model, the concept of yearlong student teaching is not common in music education, and few music education scholars have studied it. Scholars who have made suggestions for student teaching have discussed how the experience varies for the student teacher in relation to the time period of the student teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022429412453601">Conway &amp; Hodgman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022429412453601">Conway, Smith, &amp; Hodgman, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0022429412453601">
<title>Certification requirements</title>
<p>One final area brought up by several participants was the need to assist beginning teachers with an understanding of certification requirements. Penny had had a mix-up with her certification, and she said,<disp-quote>
<p>I went to Central Office and said, “I don’t know what to do.” And [the secretary] said, “. . . You know, it’s really not our job to tell you these things.” I really don’t know whose job it is really. . . . She said, “Call this person and do this thing.” So she at least had the information but she said, “ . . . You need to take care of your certification yourself.” I guess I could have called the College of Ed at [BTU]?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As with the “broad preparation” finding, teachers participating in the 2002 research did not have enough experience to know that concerns about certification might become crucial in their experience. Thus, this finding represents another change in the teachers’ views regarding teacher education. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022429412453601">Erbes (1992)</xref> published several volumes reporting on certification practices back in the 1970s and 1980s. However, with the increasing use of the Internet, it has become difficult to document these practices because certification policies are no longer available in print, resulting in a loss of the permanency that had made it easier to track changes over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022429412453601">Conway &amp; Hodgman, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Final Thoughts</title>
<p>Music teacher educators need to focus on what they can do to better prepare preservice teachers and on what learning and experiences are best suited to preservice preparation. Findings from this study suggest that the development of musicianship was an important responsibility of preservice education for these teachers. Fieldwork and student teaching that were well planned and organized in diverse settings were perceived as valuable, as was adequate time for communication with cooperating teachers for interns and student teachers. Findings support the notion that information from courses without context does not seem to be transferred to other situations. Future researchers might continue to explore strategies for contextualizing coursework.</p>
<p>Findings from this study suggest that music teacher educators continue to work with colleagues in the College or Department of Education to provide context for courses in those departments. More research into promising practices in College and Department of Education courses that are perceived as useful for preservice music teachers is recommended.</p>
<p>For these teachers, many of the skills needed were learned in context from experience in the first years on the job. Music teacher educators must recognize this, they need to help preK–12 teachers recognize this, and they must also help preservice teachers become aware of this. A disposition toward lifelong learning and problem solving is a necessity for music teachers. Research is needed regarding how to recognize these attributes in incoming students as well as how to facilitate the development of these skills and dispositions within undergraduate courses.</p>
<p>Ten-year veteran teachers have provided some insights into teacher education in this investigation as well as verified some teacher education insights consistent with results of past research. It is my hope that future researchers will continue to examine the perceptions of preservice, novice, and experienced teachers regarding preservice music teacher preparation so that teacher educators can continue to improve the preparation of music educators.</p>
