<abstract>
<p>We describe a fatal case of mumps virus–associated acute encephalopathy. In terms of the clinical course and cytokine as well as chemokine profiles, the pathogenesis in our case was different from that of mumps meningoencephalitis but was similar to that of influenza virus–associated acute encephalopathy.</p>

<body>
<p>Acute encephalopathy, which is caused by infectious agents, such as influenza virus or human herpes virus type 6, is one of the most serious complications associated with pediatric viral infections, and it results in a high incidence of neurologic sequelae and death. Influenza virus is the major cause of virus-associated acute encephalopathy, but the mumps virus can also act as the pathogenic agent in rare cases. In this study, we report a fatal case of mumps virus–associated acute encephalopathy.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073812441060">
<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A previously healthy 6-year-old girl experienced fever with swelling of the bilateral parotid glands. The following day, she visited a general hospital with symptoms of headache, vomiting, and clonic convulsions. Because her consciousness was continuously disturbed, she was transferred to our university hospital for general intensive care. After arriving at our hospital, she experienced tonic convulsions twice, which were controlled by continuous administration of midazolam. She had no history of mumps infection and had not received mumps vaccination.</p>
<p>Physical examination on admission revealed that her blood pressure was 144/57 mmHg, and her pulse rate was 126 beats/min and regular. Her body temperature was elevated at 40.4°C. Her Glasgow Coma Scale score was 6/15 and parotid gland swelling was observed. Anisocoria was noted, with the right pupil being larger than the left. No meningeal signs were observed.</p>
<p>Relevant laboratory tests on admission disclosed the following findings: hemoglobin, 13.9 g/dL; white blood cell count, 12 900/μL (65% neutrophils, 26% lymphocytes); lactic dehydrogenase, 520 IU/L; creatine kinase, 763 IU/L; amylase, 2284 IU/L (95.8% from the salivary gland and 4.2% from the pancreas); C-reactive protein, 1.97 mg/dL; serum sodium, 129 mmol/L; and serum chloride, 92 mmol/L. Other blood chemistry findings including aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, ammonia, blood sugar, and coagulation test data were within normal limits.</p>
<p>A lumbar puncture was performed on admission. Analysis of her cerebrospinal fluid revealed it to be clear in appearance, with a pressure of 158 mmH<sub>2</sub>O, a cell count of 6/μL (82.4% lymphocytes), and normal glucose and protein levels (78 and 19 mg/dL, respectively).</p>
<p>Congenital metabolic disorders, including amino acid, organic acid, and lipid metabolism were discounted by tandem mass spectrometry.</p>
<p>Blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures were sterile. The patient was determined to be mumps-specific immunoglobulin M antibody positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.</p>
<p>Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed mumps virus in the serum and throat swab specimens but not in the cerebrospinal fluid. Herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2, human herpes virus type 6, influenza virus A or B, and enteroviruses were not detected in the serum or cerebrospinal fluid by polymerase chain reaction or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812441060">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Computed tomography of the head was performed 1 day after admission, and it revealed a diffuse low-density area in the cerebral white matter and brainstem, a poorly defined corticomedullary border, narrowing of the ventricles, and loss of the quadrigeminal plate and bilateral ambient cisterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812441060">Figure 1</xref>). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could not be performed because of her poor clinical condition. Electroencephalography (EEG) findings on admission revealed a diffuse low-voltage slow wave.</p>

</fig>
<p>Cytokine and chemokine profiles in the cerebrospinal fluid on admission exhibited significant elevation in the levels of interleukin-6 (2156.0 pg/mL; cutoff &lt;9.5 pg/mL), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (841.1 pg/mL; &lt;79.9 pg/mL), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (2156.0 pg/mL; 0.43-1.2 pg/mL), C-X-C motif ligand 8 (1301.0 pg/mL; &lt;7.3 pg/mL), and C-C motif ligand 2 (16147.3 pg/mL; &lt;37 pg/mL) and mild elevation in that of interleukin-1β (30.0 pg/mL; &lt;24.6 pg/mL), interferon-α (16.1 pg/mL; &lt;12.0 pg/mL), and C-X-C motif ligand 10 (94.5 pg/mL; &lt;4.2 pg/mL).</p>
<p>In contrast, interleukin-2 (cutoff &lt;8.8 pg/mL), interleukin-4 (&lt;10.4 pg/mL), interleukin-5 (&lt;33.2 pg/mL), interleukin-10 (&lt;18.9 pg/mL), interleukin-12 (&lt;14.4 pg/mL), interleukin-13 (&lt;19.9 pg/mL), interferon-γ (&lt;18.0 pg/mL), and interleukin-2 receptor (&lt;32.1 pg/mL) levels were all below their respective detection limits.</p>
<p>The patient was diagnosed with mumps virus–associated acute encephalopathy on the basis of the clinical course and laboratory findings. She received mannitol treatment to decrease intracranial pressure, and was administered steroid pulse therapy and immunoglobulin to suppress the cytokine storm. However, this treatment regimen did not result in a favorable response, and the patient was determined to be clinically brain dead by a neurologist.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Acute encephalitis is a well-known complication of mumps virus infection; however, few cases of acute encephalopathy have been reported to date.</p>
<p>Our patient was diagnosed with mumps virus–associated acute encephalopathy on the basis of her progressive coma and prolonged convulsions, normal cerebrospinal fluid findings with no pathogens, and the absence of any obvious cause excluding the mumps virus.</p>
<p>Nine patients with mumps virus–associated encephalopathy have been reported in Japan in the past 20 years. All patients experienced progressive coma and/or seizures, and their prognoses varied from having no sequelae to death (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812441060">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Virus-associated acute encephalopathy is believed to be related to the cytokine storm of varying degrees.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812441060">2</xref></sup> Influenza virus is a well-known cause of virus-associated acute encephalopathy, and there have been several previous reports of elevated interleukin-6 and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid in cases of influenza virus–associated acute encephalopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812441060">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812441060">4</xref></sup> Conversely, Ichiyama et al reported the elevation of interferon-γ, interleukin-2, interleukin-10, but not tumor necrosis factor-α, in the cerebrospinal fluid of individuals with mumps meningitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812441060">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our patient, the cytokine and chemokine profiles in her cerebrospinal fluid revealed that the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and interferon-α; interleukin-1 receptor antagonist; soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1; and chemokines, such as C-X-C motif ligand 8, C-X-C motif ligand 10, and C-C motif ligand 2, were elevated, whereas those of interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-5, interleukin-10, interleukin-12, interleukin-13, and interferon-γ were below their respective detection limits. These results differ from the cytokine pattern observed for mumps meningitis but are similar to those observed for severe influenza encephalopathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812441060">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In terms of the clinical course, mumps meningitis usually develops in patients with parotitis approximately 5 days after the onset of illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812441060">6</xref></sup> In contrast, Togashi et al reported that most patients with influenza virus–associated acute encephalopathy rapidly became comatose with a mean interval of 1.7 days from the onset of fever.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812441060">7</xref></sup> These reports suggest that the pathogenesis in our patient is similar to that of influenza virus–associated acute encephalopathy but is different from that of mumps meningitis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we reported a case of mumps virus–associated acute encephalopathy resulting in clinical brain death. It is possible that proinflammatory cytokines as well as some chemokines play an important role in its pathogenesis.</p>
