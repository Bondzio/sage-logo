<title>Background</title>
<p>Concern about the use of over-the-counter (OTC) medications for the treatment of coughs and colds in children first arose in 1977 with an Food and Drug Administration report.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812439461">1</xref></sup> Although education has been advocated since 1984,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812439461">2</xref></sup> parents continue to use these products at a rate of 61% even after multiple warnings about potential dangers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812439461">3</xref></sup> Even before the first cold, young infants with nasal congestion frequently present to their primary care provider accompanied by their distressed parents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812439461">4</xref></sup> Despite the frequency of parental concerns, there is a paucity of evidence-based practices that exist regarding effective treatments for nasal congestion. Although publications address treatment of true nasal obstruction (such as choanal atresia), very few articles address the management of “neonatal rhinitis.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812439461">5</xref></sup> Published recommendations focus on nasal saline drops and corticosteroids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812439461">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812439461">6</xref></sup> Parents often try physician-suggested methods such as saline drops, but will also use unproven OTC cough and cold medicines or herbal remedies to treat the congestion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812439461">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Given the risk of OTC medications and the lack of benefit, we sought to better understand how parents treated infant nasal congestion in our practice. The purpose of the current study was 3-fold: (<italic>a</italic>) to determine the prevalence of nasal congestion in our patient population, (<italic>b</italic>) to assess the most common nonpharmacological and pharmacological interventions that parents surveyed in this study use to treat nasal congestion, and (<italic>c</italic>) to evaluate which treatments were perceived by the parents to be most effective.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0009922812439461">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>The design of this study was a prospective, cross-sectional survey of the parents of pediatric patients in 2 practices at Franklin Square Hospital Center in Baltimore County, Maryland. The setting included a large family medicine residency continuity clinic and a faculty pediatric practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922812439461">
<title>Study Sample</title>
<p>The study group included the parents of children aged 1 year whose child was scheduled for a checkup between February 7, and July 7, 2007. The total potential sample size was 745 parents. A multimodal sampling strategy was used to reach this potential sample. An initial survey was mailed to all 745 parents, and a second mailing was done to the nonrespondents 4 weeks later. In addition, parents were asked to complete the survey if they had not previously done so at the time of their child’s well child visit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922812439461">
<title>Survey Instrument</title>
<p>The survey instrument was a self-designed pilot-tested questionnaire, which included demographic information along with questions about the prevalence of common conditions, including nasal congestion, fussiness, and spitting up. The question for prevalence used for this study was “Many children have nasal congestion, did your child have nasal congestion as an infant?” For patients who answered “yes,” 7 treatment options were given for parents to assess the effectiveness of each one. Parents ranked the effectiveness based on a 5-point Likert-type scale with 5 as <italic>very effective</italic> through 1 as <italic>made worse</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0009922812439461">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis included calculation of the frequencies for demographic variables and prevalence of nasal congestion. Each treatment was dichotomized at “effective” (response of 4 or 5) or “less effective” (responses 1-3). Chi-square analysis was performed between the demographic variables and the “effective” outcome and logistical regresmodels were used to obtain adjusted odds ratios.</p>

<title>Demographic Characteristics</title>
<p>A total of 285 parents (38%) completed the survey. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812439461">Table 1</xref> shows the demographic features of the responding sample. The majority of parents that completed the survey were white (57%), had private/health maintenance organization insurance (63%), and less than a college education (58%). Although we are unable to compare responders and nonresponders, the response sample reflects the demographic characteristics of our patients.</p>

<p>As expected, the majority of parents reported their infants having nasal congestion with a prevalence of 77%. Parents with private insurance were more likely than parents with Medicaid or self-pay to report congestion in their infants (82% vs 69%, <italic>P</italic> = .01). Additionally, white parents tended to report higher rates of congestion (82% vs 69%, <italic>P</italic> = .06).</p>
<p>The types of treatments that parents used to relieve their infant’s congestion are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812439461">Figure 1</xref>. A large majority of patients used recommended treatments such as nasal saline (89%), humidifier (92%), and bulb syringe (92%). Additionally, a majority of parents reported the use of Vicks (51%) and OTC medications, which are not recommended by our physicians. A minority of parents reported the use of steam.</p>

</fig>
<p>Respondents found all of the treatments for nasal congestion to be effective except for steam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812439461">Figure 1</xref>). More than 80% of parents believed both the recommended treatments of bulb syringe, saline drops and humidifiers were effective in addition to the nonrecommended treatments of OTC cough and cold medications and Vicks vapor rub.</p>
<p>Only one significant association was found between the demographic variables and believing a treatment was effective for nasal congestion. White parents were significantly more likely to believe OTC medications were effective (89%) whereas only 73% of minority parents believed that OTC medications were effective, <italic>P</italic> = .026.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nasal congestion afflicts a vast majority of infants in our community, and parents resort to a variety of recommended and nonrecommended treatments. Almost all treatments used by parents were perceived as effective in improving infant’s symptoms. Given the paucity of evidence on the topic, the results of this study are both reassuring and concerning. First, it is reassuring that simple, tried, and true measures such as humidifiers and saline drops are frequently used and perceived as effective. Physicians should continue to recommend these safe, low-risk interventions.</p>
<p>The most concerning finding is that parents use OTC cough and cold medications frequently and believe that they are effective. OTC cough and cold medications have never been shown to be effective in randomized controlled trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812439461">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812439461">8</xref></sup> and are associated with serious adverse events in infants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812439461">9</xref></sup> Recently, these products have been relabeled by the Food and Drug Administration and are no longer indicated for children younger than 2 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812439461">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812439461">11</xref></sup> Unfortunately, if parents perceive these medications as effective and still have access to them, it is likely they will continue to use them to treat nasal congestion in infants.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found that white parents with private insurance were more likely to report congestion and to believe OTC medications were effective treatments than minorities and patients with Medicaid insurance. It is not clear why these differences would exist especially with recent data showing minorities were more likely to use OTC medications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812439461">3</xref></sup> Possibly, increased income leads to a greater opportunity to buy medications that parents feel obligated to try, or direct consumer marketing has a greater effect on this demographic.</p>
<p>Our study suffers from a few limitations. First, the response rate of potential respondents was relatively low. Despite this fact, we achieved an adequate sample size to not be concerned about type II errors. Second, our patient sample represented only one geographical area, Eastern Baltimore County. Despite this limitation, our sample was ethnically diverse and representative of the surrounding community. Additionally, our questionnaire was self-designed, and although pilot tested, has not been validated. There is a possibility that parents may have misinterpreted the questions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a large percentage of infants suffer from nasal congestion requiring intervention in our study population. Most treatments, including safe measures such as nasal saline and humidifiers, are perceived as effective by parents. Unfortunately, 60% of parents used OTC cough and cold medications and the majority felt they were effective. Pediatricians need to provide substantial anticipatory guidance to help assure infants do not receive potentially unsafe OTC medications.</p>
