<title>“O L<sc>ord</sc>, look at my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed!” (Lam 1:9)</title>
<p>These words have captured the agony of countless broken people through the centuries. This verse from the Book of Lamentations is a tragic cry of grief, a claim of incomparable anguish, and a plea for understanding. Many Christians ascribe these words to the crucified Jesus. However, they are already found on the lips of the despairing city of Jerusalem, referred to in this biblical book as Daughter Zion. The descriptions of grief and humiliation found within the five poems that comprise the Book of Lamentations are graphic and the imagery employed is lurid. There is no attempt to hide the horror of the devastation experienced by the beleaguered city and her shattered inhabitants. The reader stands dumbfounded before the enormity of the collapse of this once glorious city and of the human tragedy left behind in its wake. The portrayal of this destruction calls to mind scenes of the recent past: the rumble that was once the proud city of Dresden, Germany (1945); the merciless slaughter of the people of Srebrenica, Bosnia (1995); and the unrelenting shelling of Homs, Syria (2012). Far too many cities have cried out: “O L<sc>ORD</sc>, look at my affliction, for the enemy has triumphed!”</p>
<p>Several grieving voices are raised in these poems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0020964312473253">1</xref></sup> The most frequently heard voice is that of the narrator who reports the disaster that befell the city. Perhaps the most striking voice is that of the city itself, personified as a weeping woman and referred to as Daughter Zion. With heart-wrenching words, she recounts her own destruction and she cries out in overpowering angst. A very different voice is heard in Chapter 3. The individual sketched in that poem is identified by the Hebrew word <italic>geber</italic>, which is often translated “strong man.” Each voice speaks from a slightly different perspective. However, all seem to be equally aghast at the horrors to which the city has been reduced.</p>

<sec id="section2-0020964312473253">
<title>“How lonely sits the city” (1:1)</title>
<p>There is no way of knowing from the text of Lamentations the identity of the narrator who is heard so often within the poems. Most commentators seem to imply that it is a man. This may be due to the fact that this narrator does not identify with the women when their plight is explicitly highlighted (see 4:10; 5:11). Then again, the narrator does not identify with any of the groups of men either (see 4:7, 13–16). It was usually the women in biblical societies who functioned as professional mourners (see Jer 9:17), and thus there is no reason to presume automatically that the figure behind this narrator was a man.</p>
<p>An appreciation of the literary form of the book will throw light on the portrayal of the characters depicted in the poems and on the forcefulness of their voices. Scholars do not agree on the genre of the book. Some maintain that it is a communal lament. Others hold that it is a funeral dirge. Still others argue that it is a form of city-lament.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>See, O LORD, how distressed I am;</p>
<p>  my stomach churns,</p>
<p>my heart is wrung within me,</p>
<p>  because I have been very rebellious.</p>
<p>In the street the sword bereaves;</p>
<p>  in the house it is like death.</p>
<p>They heard how I was groaning,</p>
<p>  with no one to comfort me.</p>
<p>All my enemies heard of my trouble;</p>
<p>  they are glad that you have done it. (1:20–21)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This passage contains several characteristics of the lament. It has an invocation addressed to God, an expression of need, and a recital of reasons why God should hear the one suffering. However, laments generally include a prayer for protection against impending misfortune or a prayer for deliverance from the adversity that has already come to pass. Some laments even include sentiments of confidence that God will respond. There is no such prayer for protection or deliverance in this specific poem. Furthermore, nowhere in this biblical book is there a vow to offer praise or sacrifice when the cry for help has been heard or an expression of grateful praise, both characteristics of the lament. The city depicted here is not preserved from devastation, nor is there any hope that its plight will be reversed. The loss it suffers is irreparable. A female narrator could easily utilize a lament when officially bewailing the destruction of the city.</p>
<p>Other scholars maintain that Lamentations is a <italic>qînâ</italic> or funeral dirge. <italic>qînâ</italic> is the name given to the metric pattern found throughout the book. In it, the poetic line falls into two distinct parts, with the first part longer than the second. With one beat accorded each Hebrew word or phrase, the line contains a 3 + 2 pattern. This irregularity suggests a kind of choke or a sob, a gasping for breath as one is often forced to do in extreme situations. Thus, the very structure of the poetry replicates the style of funeral dirge that official women mourners employed.</p>
<p>The Book of Lamentations opens with a poem that lays bare characteristics of the funeral dirge:
<disp-quote>
<p>How lonely sits the city</p>
<p>  that once was full of people!</p>
<p>How like a widow she has become,</p>
<p>  she that was great among the nations!</p>
<p>She that was a princess among the provinces</p>
<p>  has become a vassal. (1:1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The English translation of the opening word “How” cannot capture the astonishment, incredulity, and horror intended. The Hebrew word <italic>’êkāh</italic> is a kind of gasp that is characteristic of the funeral dirge. This opening cry of desolation is followed by other characteristics of the dirge: a declaration of death, a statement of reversal of fortune, and an expression of the mourner’s grief. The effect that the death referred to has on passersby is found elsewhere in the book:
<disp-quote>
<p>Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?</p>
<p>  Look and see</p>
<p>if there is any sorrow like my sorrow,</p>
<p>  which was brought upon me,</p>
<p>which the L<sc>ORD</sc> inflicted</p>
<p>  on the day of his fierce anger. (1:12)</p>
<p>All who pass along the way</p>
<p>  clap their hands at you;</p>
<p>they hiss and wag their heads</p>
<p>  at daughter Jerusalem;</p>
<p>“Is this the city that was called</p>
<p>  the perfection of beauty,</p>
<p>  the joy of all the earth?” (2:15)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the book’s similarity to the dirge that these features suggest, chapter 3 contains some expression of hope, a characteristic of a lament rather than of a funeral dirge:
<disp-quote>
<p>I called on your name, O LORD,</p>
<p>  from the depths of the pit;</p>
<p>you heard my plea, “Do not close your ear</p>
<p>  to my cry for help, but give me relief!</p>
<p>You came near when I called on you;</p>
<p>  you said, “Do not fear!” (3:55-57)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As this dirge-like passage indicates, Zion, the city of God, has been ravaged, and her children, the people of God, have been slain.</p>
<p>A third classification of the book, known as the city-lament, has recently gained acceptance among scholars. One of its most striking characteristics is its female personification of the devastated and agonizing city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0020964312473253">2</xref></sup> Since it was the city-goddess who did the lamenting, the one who publicly proclaimed the lament would be a representative woman. In the city-lament, tribulations endured by various groups of inhabitants are portrayed. The collapse of civil order and the cessation of religious celebration are described from the perspective of those who have been conquered rather than from the perspective of the conqueror. Finally, this genre clearly states that the suffering has been divinely directed. Several examples of such a city-lament have been found in Mesopotamian literature, leading scholars to conclude that this genre was probably the origin of this particular form.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0020964312473253">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite these similarities with the city-lament, striking differences can be found. In Mesopotamia, the destruction of one city resulted in the rise of another city, and this is often reflected in the city-lament. In Lamentations, there is no thought that another city might rise in Zion’s place. Furthermore, there is an expectation in the Mesopotamian city-lament that the gods will return and take up residence again in the newly-built temple, thus assuring the end of lamenting. There is no such closure in Lamentations. The biblical city is desolate; its inhabitants are either dead or in exile.</p>
<p>While the city-lament demonstrates the closest comparison with the poems on Lamentations, the differences show that ancient Israel felt free enough to reshape this particular genre in order to bring it into conformity with Israel’s experience. The narrator decries the destruction of the once-glorious city:
<disp-quote>
<p>The LORD determined to lay in ruins</p>
<p>  the wall of daughter Zion;</p>
<p>he stretched the line;</p>
<p>  he did not withhold his hand from destroying;</p>
<p>he caused rampart and wall to lament;</p>
<p>  they languish together. (2:8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>and the plight of its inhabitants,
<disp-quote>
<p>Judah has gone into exile with suffering</p>
<p>  and hard servitude;</p>
<p>she lives now among the nations,</p>
<p>  and finds no resting place; (1:3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>particularly its most vulnerable:
<disp-quote>
<p>The tongue of the infant sticks</p>
<p>  to the roof of its mouth for thirst;</p>
<p>the children beg for food,</p>
<p>  but no one gives them anything. (4:4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The social institutions that previously marked the city’s ordered life do not escape its devastation. The ruling body collapses:
<disp-quote>
<p>[the LORD] has brought down to the ground in dishonor</p>
<p>  the kingdom and its rulers. (2:2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>and its religious observances come to an end:
<disp-quote>
<p>The roads to Zion mourn,</p>
<p>  for no one comes to the festivals;</p>
<p>all her gates are desolate,</p>
<p>  her priests groan. . . . (1:4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As empathetic as the narrator appears to be, there is no covering the city’s culpability. It is clearly suffering because of its own rebelliousness:</p>
<p>. . . the LORD has made her suffer</p>
<p>   for the multitude of her transgressions;(1:5)</p>
<p>Jerusalem sinned grievously (1:8)</p>
<p>She has brought on her own misfortune by being unfaithful to the covenant commitment she had entered into with the LORD. The severity of her present ordeal reflects the seriousness of the initial commitment made. At Sinai the people had entered into a covenant with the LORD, and the LORD declared: “Now therefore, if you obey my voice and keep my covenant, you shall be my treasured possession out of all the peoples” (Exod 19:5). To this the people responded: “Everything that the LORD has spoken we will do” (Exod 19:8). However, this promise was broken again and again. Now the consequences of the city’s sinfulness have fallen upon it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0020964312473253">4</xref></sup> The terms of the covenant had been agreed upon when the covenant was first made and cut. As the narrator states, they are basically unfolding as they had been earlier decided:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The LORD has done what he purposed,</p>
<p>   he has carried out his threat;</p>
<p>as he ordained long ago,</p>
<p>   he has demolished without pity;</p>
<p>he has made the enemy rejoice over you,</p>
<p>   and exalted the might of your foes. (2:17)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As deserving of punishment as the city seems to have been, some commentators wonder whether this punishment might be excessive. While Zion should certainly be punished for betrayal, should she be totally destroyed, her children slaughtered or banished, with no hope of forgiveness or restoration? Is God not exercising harsh judgment, even on the innocent and the helpless? Is God disinterested, standing by while an enemy runs unrestrained over an entire city? Is God powerless to prevent the catastrophe or, once it has been inflicted, unable to offer a remedy or some form of solace? Have God’s covenant <italic>ḥesed</italic> (steadfast love) and <italic>raḥămîm</italic>) (compassion, mercy) been totally swept away by the fury of divine wrath? Steadfast love is not primarily an emotional sentiment. Rather, it implies fidelity to covenant obligations. It should be noted that it is the attitude of God, not the human covenant partner. The word for “compassion, mercy” is related to the Hebrew word for “womb.” It suggests womb-love, the kind of passionate attachment that a mother has for the child of her womb. Again, this is a divine, not a human characteristic.</p>
<p>Some commentators maintain that the poems in this book accuse God of disproportionate brutality:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>While the narrator depicts the assault on land and people,</p>
<p>he is simultaneously charging God with infidelity, lack of</p>
<p>integrity, and loss of control. God’s acts are vicious.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0020964312473253">5</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The divine warrior who promised to defend the city from its enemies (Ps 48:8) has now turned against it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0020964312473253">6</xref></sup> The verbs in the second poem of Lamentations act as continuously violent strokes that hammer out divine rage. There the narrator states that the Lord has “humiliated daughter Zion”; “destroyed without mercy”; “broken down the strongholds”; “brought down to the ground in dishonor”; “cut down in fierce anger”; “burned like a raging fire”; “killed, poured out his fury”; “destroyed”; “abolished”; “scorned”; and “ruined and broken her bars”(2:1–9). So, it is really not true that God is silent. Rather, God’s thunderous anger has shattered the city in violent reprisal.</p>
<p>Where is the divine compassion that characterized the covenant? Is there no hope? The depressing character of the book has been a source of concern for many commentators. Other biblical books that address human tragedy end on a positive note. For example, after enduring the loss of family, property, friends, and reputation and then being struck with physical affliction, Job is exonerated by God and restored to a life of good fortune (Job 42:10). Even Jeremiah’s description of the destruction of Jerusalem and the deportation of its inhabitants ends on a note of hope. Though still in exile, the king of Judah is shown favor by the king of Babylon (Jer 52:31). This sign of respect is seen as a veiled foreshadowing of future restoration. The Book of Lamentations, on the other hand, does not end on a note of hope.</p>
<p>This narration does not address the resolution of suffering. Rather, it is concerned with the depth and scope of the suffering itself. It gives voice to the horrors of acrimonious war (2:16) and crippling defeat (2:21), of unimaginable destruction (2:5) and demoralizing loss (1:17), and its lays bear the atrocities to which the human spirit can descend, atrocities as detestable as infanticide (2:11) and cannibalism (4:10). The narration does not rush prematurely to relief, rejuvenation, and restoration. Instead, it draws out the profound desolation experienced by those who survive tragedy, those who are often plunged into despair because of what they were forced to witness and must now live with or live without for the rest of their days. One might say that in sparing none of the details of Daughter Zion’s heartbreaking adversity, the narrator is showing the city respect, allowing her the freedom to give full expression to her grief, desperation, and even despair.</p>

<sec id="section3-0020964312473253">
<title>“Look and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow” (Lam 1:12)</title>
<p>The city itself, personified as a weeping woman, recounts her own destruction and cries out in grief. The female personification of cities is quite understandable. The first and most obvious reason for such a characterization is derived from the relationship between inhabitants and their city of origin. They are the ones who perceive the city as the mother from whom they come and upon whom they depend for survival. The history of cities is often told through the use of sexual metaphors. Cities are established and defended by men; their land is fertile and productive or barren and worthless; when their walls are penetrated, they are said to have been violated. Literature of the ancient Near East shows that female personification of cities was both common and quite effective in such characterization.</p>
<p>The female personification of the city of Jerusalem has yielded various explanations of the origin of this gendered depiction. Some commentators maintain that it is an Israelite reinterpretation of the figure of a grieving chief goddess of an ancient city as found in Mesopotamian city-laments. Others argue that the depiction represents the retaliatory state of affairs brought on by an Israelite woman’s unfaithfulness to her marriage commitment. Still others believe that it stems from the anguish of a widow who is forced to witness the savage murder of her children. The words spoken by the city would fit any one of these suggested forms.</p>
<p>The best-known Mesopotamian city-laments originate out of the destruction of the city of Ur.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0020964312473253">7</xref></sup> At least five different interpretations of this destruction have survived. They all depict the city’s chief goddess Ningal bewailing the destruction of the city along with its major sanctuary. In the song, the goddess intercedes for her city, but to no avail. She then takes up the lament, bewailing the devastation of the city itself and the brutality inflicted on “her children,” its inhabitants. The grieving woman in the Book of Lamentations resembles the city-goddess found in the Mesopotamian songs in several ways. She has lost the royal station she once enjoyed:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>She that was a princess among the provinces</p>
<p>   has become a vassal. (1:1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The city herself bewails the reversal of her social status:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My transgressions were bound into a yoke;</p>
<p>  by his hand they were fastened together;</p>
<p>they weigh on my neck,</p>
<p>  sapping my strength;</p>
<p>the LORD handed me over</p>
<p>  to those whom I cannot withstand.</p>
<p>The LORD has rejected</p>
<p>  all my warriors in the midst of me;</p>
<p>he proclaimed a time against me</p>
<p>  to crush my young men;</p>
<p>the LORD has trodden as in a wine press</p>
<p>  the virgin daughter Judah.</p>
<p>For these things I weep;</p>
<p>  my eyes flow with tears;</p>
<p>for a comforter is far from me,</p>
<p>  one to revive my courage;</p>
<p>my children are desolate,</p>
<p>  for the enemy has prevailed. (1:14–16)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite these similarities, the biblical characterization lacks many of the primary traits of a goddess. This is particularly seen in the fact that the biblical figure is unable to move beyond grieving into petitioning for redress or rejoicing in reconstruction.</p>
<p>A second explanation of this female personification claims that the woman simply depicts an Israelite wife who admits her infidelity:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I called to my lovers</p>
<p>   but they deceived me. (1:19)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Much has been written about the marriage metaphor used to characterize the relationship that existed between God and the people of Israel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0020964312473253">8</xref></sup> This metaphor is found principally in the writings of Hosea 1–3, Jeremiah 2–3; 13:20–27; and Ezekiel 16 and 23.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0020964312473253">9</xref></sup> It captures several aspects of the relationship suggested in Lamentations, namely, the commitment of God to the people and the corresponding commitment of the people to God. However, the marriage metaphor reflects the character of marriage as practiced in a patriarchal, androcentric society. In the biblical prophetic tradition, such marriage is not a mutual relationship, one between equal partners. Rather, the wife belongs to the husband in a way that the husband does not belong to the wife. Furthermore, exclusive commitment is expected of the woman, but not necessarily of the man. Such significant disparity throws light on the fierce reaction, in the prophetic literature, of the “husband” YHWH when Israel is perceived as an unfaithful wife.</p>
<p>A third possible explanation of the female figure is that of widow:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The young and the old are lying</p>
<p>  on the ground in the streets;</p>
<p>my young women and my young men</p>
<p>  have fallen by the sword;</p>
<p>in the day of your anger you have killed them,</p>
<p>  slaughtering without mercy. (2:21)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the ancient world, widowhood not only designated a woman’s marital status, it also marked her lack of standing in the kinship structure. In most patriarchal kinship systems, women benefitted from the legal standing of their fathers and, at the death of their fathers, that of their brothers. When they married, they benefitted from the standing of their husbands and then that of their sons. A widow was one whose status was ambiguous and, therefore, precarious. This was especially true of widows bereft of children, as is the case of the city portrayed in Lamentations. However, the portrayal of this city is perceived, her sorrow is unassailable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0020964312473253">
<title>“I am one who has seen affliction” (3:1)</title>
<p>A third identifiable voice is that of the individual found in chapter 3. Traditionally, this man has been identified as the prophet Jeremiah. This may be because the personal anguish that the man describes in this chapter corresponds to the suffering attributed to that well known prophet (see Jer 9:1; 15:10–18; 20:7–18). However, more recent scholarship is of the opinion that the strong man in Lamentations is a representative figure of the typical sufferer rather than the grieving prophet. Evidence of this is seen in the fact that in some verses this man speaks as an individual “I” (3:1–39); in other places he seems to speak as the collective “we” (3:40–47).</p>
<p>In contrast to the first poems that depict the suffering as that of a woman, this chapter presents the experience of a man who is not merely describing what happened to others, but who is reporting his own plight. Furthermore, this is not just any kind of a man. He is a “strong man”; some identify him as a soldier. The one whose responsibility it was to protect the vulnerable members of society is himself the victim of disaster. This man has experienced fierce wrath, the kind of wrath that burns, overflows, and sweeps away everything before it:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am one who has seen affliction</p>
<p>  under the rod of God’s wrath;</p>
<p>he has driven and brought me</p>
<p>  into darkness without any light;</p>
<p>against me alone he turns his hand,</p>
<p>  again and again, all day long.</p>
<p>He has made my flesh and my skin waste away,</p>
<p>  and broken my bones;</p>
<p>he has besieged and enveloped me</p>
<p>  with bitterness and tribulation;</p>
<p>he has made me sit in darkness</p>
<p>  like the dead of long ago. (3:1–6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Though this unit contains features of an individual lament, the strong man does not direct his words to God, as is customary in that particular literary genre. Rather, his accusation against his persecutor takes the form of a description directed to an anonymous audience. The image of God sketched by the words of this tortured man is one of divine brutality. However, it is then followed by expressions of hope:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>But this I call to mind,</p>
<p>  and therefore I have hope:</p>
<p>The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases,</p>
<p>  his mercies never come to an end;</p>
<p>they are new every morning;</p>
<p>  great is your faithfulness.</p>
<p>“The LORD is my portion,” says my soul,</p>
<p>  “therefore I will hope in him.” (3:21–24)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The word translated “hope” really means both “waiting” and “confidence.” The strong man is waiting for something. The reasons for his waiting now become clear (vv. 22–24). The tone of these verses is one of trust. Covenant language rules (v. 22). Steadfast love (<italic>ḥesed</italic>) and mercy (<italic>raḥămîm</italic>) characterize the L<sc>ord</sc>’s attitudes toward and commitment to covenant partners. If the strong man can claim such a covenant relationship with God, he certainly has grounds for hope. The strong man speaks directly to God when he states that such steadfastness is evidence of God’s faithfulness (<italic>’ēmûnâ</italic>), yet another covenant characteristic. Thus, this battered man does indeed have reason for hope. It is rooted in the steadfast love, mercy, and faithfulness of God.</p>
<p>This expression of hope ends with a declaration: “The LORD is my portion” (v. 24). This metaphor calls to mind the apportionment of land to the tribes of Israel. Each one received a parcel of land, with the exception of the tribe of Levi, from which came the priests of Israel. Aaron, the representative of the priests, was told by God: “You shall have no inheritance in the land; I am your portion” (Num 18:20). They would not find security and peace in land or in the prosperity that might accrue from it. Instead, they were to depend on God who would take responsibility for their well-being. Having been stripped of both land and possessions, the strong man uses this metaphor to proclaim that God is all that he needs for survival. Moreover, God will provide for him just as God promised to provide for Aaron and his descendants. This declaration is not made superficially; it comes from the man’s soul (<italic>nefeš</italic> ), his life force. The passage ends as it began: “Therefore will I hope [in him].”</p>
<p>The strong man’s prayer of confidence continues throughout the poem:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I called on your name, <sc>o lord</sc>,</p>
<p>  from the depths of the pit;</p>
<p>you heard my plea, “Do not close your ear</p>
<p>  to my cry for help, but give me relief!”</p>
<p>You came near when I called on you;</p>
<p>  you said, “Do not fear!” (3:55–57)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>His is the only voice that consistently sounds a note of hope. Despite this, the strong man experienced the terror and misery faced by the city. He was a participant in the agony, not a spectator, as was the narrator.</p>

<p>Unlike the individual voices of the sorrowing narrator, the stricken city, and the afflicted strong man, the voice in the final poem (5:1–22) is plural. It is the tormented community that cries out, describing the tribulations it has encountered and the hopelessness it experiences. The sentiments mirror those of the city and of the strong man and correspond to those described by the narrator. Having heard all of these suffering voices, one might ask: Which voice within the text represents the voice and perspective of the author or poet? Some commentators think that the narrator is really the veiled voice of the poet. However, there is no solid evidence on which to base this position. In fact, it is possible that the poet is really recounting the devastating experience of destruction from several points of view: the perspectives of the female mourner (the narrator); that of the personified city; and that of the strong yet afflicted man. This would explain both the apparent inconsistencies within the book as well as the repetitions found there. Perhaps it is better to leave this question unanswered, for all of the voices echo the same gasp of desperation with which the Book of Lamentation opens—<italic>’êkāh</italic>. A single word that bespeaks astonishment, incredulity, horror.</p>
