<abstract>
<p>Standardized systematic search strategies facilitate rigor in research. Current search tools focus on retrieval of quantitative research. In this article we address issues relating to using existing search strategy tools, most typically the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) formulation for defining key elements of a review question, when searching for qualitative and mixed methods research studies. An alternative search strategy tool for qualitative/mixed methods research is outlined: SPIDER (Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, Research type). We used both the SPIDER and PICO search strategy tools with a qualitative research question. We have used the SPIDER tool to advance thinking beyond PICO in its suitable application to qualitative and mixed methods research. However, we have highlighted once more the need for improved indexing of qualitative articles in databases. To constitute a viable alternative to PICO, SPIDER needs to be refined and tested on a wider range of topics.</p>

<p>Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are the “gold standard” of research reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312452938">Clarke &amp; Stewart, 1994</xref>, para. 1). Systematic review methods can be applied to almost any study type and aim to be systematic, explicit, and reproducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732312452938">Tricco, Tetzlaff, &amp; Moher, 2010</xref>). We use meta-analysis methods to examine the research findings (specifically strength of the relationship) for one typically focused research question. Applying this method allows researchers to combine and examine quantitative findings using individual effect sizes to arrive at an overall effect for the research question. However, in health care settings and relevant disciplines (e.g., psychology), qualitative research designs are becoming increasingly used, either to complement quantitative research designs or within mixed-method designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312452938">Holloway &amp; Wheeler, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Metasyntheses are “systematic reviews of qualitative research” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312452938">Booth, 2001</xref>, p. 1). Metasynthesis is comparable to meta-analysis in that it is also a systematic research technique. Researchers conduct metasynthesis to contribute to knowledge by bringing together the rich and detailed findings of qualitative research studies and thus to offer a new interpretation of a research question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312452938">Sandelowski, Docherty, &amp; Emden, 1997</xref>). The process of metasynthesis involves “peeling away the surface layers of studies to find their hearts and souls in a way that does the least damage to them” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312452938">Sandelowski et al., 1997</xref>, p. 370). This essentially interpretive function contrasts with the statistical amalgamation involved in a meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312452938">Sandelowski &amp; Barroso, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732312452938">Walsh &amp; Downe, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In recent years researchers have increasingly recognized that multiple potential methods exist for the synthesis of qualitative research. They need to select their chosen method judiciously according to the overall purpose of the synthesis and the desired outputs from the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312452938">Barnett-Page &amp; Thomas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312452938">Dixon-Woods, Bonas, et al., 2006</xref>). Factors that influence the choice of method of synthesis include the extent to which a synthesis is intended to be theory generating or theory validating, the extent to which the review is intended to be aggregative or interpretive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732312452938">Thorne, Jensen, Kearney, Noblit, &amp; Sandelowski, 2004</xref>), the “thick description” of data from included studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312452938">Noyes &amp; Popay, 2007</xref>, p. 230), the role of the reviewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312452938">Dixon-Woods, Cavers, et al., 2006</xref>), and whether the focus is on identifying commonalities (as with thematic synthesis) or on investigating differences (as for realist synthesis).</p>
<p>In practice each of the above represents not a binary decision but rather a continuum on which an individual review or type of synthesis can be located. So the once important distinction between theory-driven approaches (e.g., framework synthesis; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312452938">Lloyd-Jones, 2004</xref>) and theory-generating approaches (e.g., meta-ethnography or grounded theory; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312452938">Lloyd-Jones, 2007</xref>) has recently been eroded by advancement of “best fit” approaches that follow an imperfect model in the place of a contingent staging post on the road to theory development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312452938">Carroll, Booth, &amp; Cooper, 2011</xref>, para. 1). It has been suggested that this almost bewildering plethora of methods should be subsumed under a generic umbrella term <italic>qualitative evidence synthesis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312452938">Hannes &amp; Lockwood, 2011</xref>, p. 1632). This term has been chosen, and subsequently championed, by members of the Cochrane Collaboration Qualitative Methods Group to represent a neutral term that does not carry the preconceptions associated with the labels coined by particular individuals or research groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312452938">Noyes, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the richness of such methodological developments, a basic distinction, identified relatively early on in the evolution of the science of qualitative evidence synthesis, persists. This distinction broadly characterizes methods of synthesis into those that draw their credentials, and hence their underlying methods, from quantitative synthesis and those that aim to parallel methods of primary qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312452938">Booth, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732312452938">Dixon-Woods, Bonas, et al., 2006</xref>) using appropriated elements of grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312452938">Barbour, 2003</xref>). Such a wider methodological debate forms a backdrop to this particular article because of the impact on the fundamental principles of literature searching. That is, do methods prespecified for quantitative systematic reviews (e.g., the formulation of a PICO-type question) translate to qualitative evidence syntheses? Furthermore, does qualitative evidence synthesis share the requirement for comprehensive exhaustive searches, or does it merely aim to create an appropriate, but not necessarily comprehensive, sampling frame from which studies are selected until a point of data saturation is reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312452938">Booth, 2001</xref>)?</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312452938">
<title>Search Strategies: The Basis of All Reviews</title>
<p>Confidence in the literature search is vital to all research, especially meta-analysis and metasynthesis, which are founded on the sound retrieval of initial search results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312452938">Cooper, 1998</xref>). However, the quality of indexing of qualitative research in databases, for example, MEDLINE and Embase, might cause the researcher to lack confidence that every relevant qualitative article has been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312452938">Shaw et al., 2004</xref>). Effective retrieval terms rely on clarity in the title and abstract, although assignment of indexing terms depends on the indexer’s interpretation of the full article. In qualitative articles, any of these terms might be unclear because of authors and searchers defining concepts differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312452938">Evans, 2002</xref>). Some observers have concluded that searching for qualitative research using thesaurus terms in databases is of limited value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312452938">Barroso et al., 2003</xref>; Evans).</p>
<p>Complementary search methods (e.g., follow-up of references, citation searching, and citation pearl growing) are all considered particularly important to compensate for any deficiencies in retrieval terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312452938">Grayson &amp; Gomersall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312452938">Papaioannou, Sutton, Carroll, Wong, &amp; Booth, 2010</xref>). Longer-term solutions might include authors improving retrieval of their articles by making their methodology clear in the title or by using a structured abstract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312452938">Shaw et al., 2004</xref>). However, the retrospective review process nature of qualitative evidence synthesis means that such problems will persist for many years to come, especially where retrieving already-written articles is concerned. For the foreseeable future, researchers and clinicians might derive confidence that a metasynthesis is high-quality evidence to support change if the search process, together with subsequent stages of the review process, contributes to the improved reliability of the qualitative synthesis.</p>

<title>Limitations With Current Search Tools</title>
<p>The PICO (Population/problem, Intervention/exposure, Comparison, and Outcome) tool has spread from its early origins in epidemiology to become a fundamental tool in both evidence-based practice and systematic reviews. It enables researchers to define their quantitative research question and search terms, laying the pathway for a systematic search strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312452938">Booth, O’Rourke, &amp; Ford, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312452938">Schardt, Adams, Owens, Keitz, &amp; Fontelo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732312452938">Villanueva, Burrows, Fennessy, Rajendran, &amp; Anderson, 2001</xref>). Therefore, we have come to widely use the PICO search strategy in systematic reviews of quantitative research, being deemed the most reliable basis for a search strategy. Furthermore, it is the best method of question formulation to use when conducting a quantitative systematic literature review and has been adopted by the Cochrane Collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312452938">O’Connor, Green, &amp; Higgins, 2008</xref>). However, the PICO tool is not an optimal working strategy for qualitative evidence synthesis.</p>
<p>Current Cochrane guidance on qualitative systematic reviews appears unable to specify an appropriate alternative search tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312452938">Noyes, Popay, Pearson, Hannes, &amp; Booth, 2011</xref>). Acknowledged limitations of PICO for qualitative evidence synthesis include the fact that combining the two most commonly used components, namely, the P for “Population” and I for “Intervention,” will more typically retrieve references to quantitative research. The qualitative reviewer will therefore have correspondingly more irrelevant “hits” to sift through when searching for genuinely qualitative studies for potential inclusion in his or her review. In addition, the “Comparison” (C) is not typically part of a qualitative research question so becomes irrelevant, whereas both “Intervention” (I) and “Outcome” (O) might need to be manipulated to fit with the qualitative paradigm. Therefore, specification using PICO might become a subjective exercise when used for qualitative research questions, rather than the systematic search strategy tool intended when used for quantitative research questions.</p>
<p>Several alternative search strategy tools to PICO have been proposed for use with qualitative research. One such example is the SPICE (Setting, Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Evaluation) search strategy. SPICE was developed in the context of evidence-based librarianship and subsequently promoted by the Joanna Briggs Institute for qualitative systematic reviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312452938">Booth, 2006</xref>). Another example is the ECLIPSE (Expectation, Client group, Location, Impact, Professionals, ServicE) search strategy, which was introduced to handle health management topics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732312452938">Wildridge &amp; Bell, 2002</xref>). However, neither tool meets the full requirements of the qualitative research paradigm having been developed for specific user groups, nor might they be suitable for use with more general qualitative research questions. Such a limitation might also extend to a comparative newcomer, Context–Intervention–Mechanism–Outcome (CIMO), also developed for management questions, although this might hold potential specifically within realist synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312452938">Denyer, Tranfield, &amp; Van Aken, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>It is important to have a tool that, like PICO for quantitative search strategies, can prompt the qualitative researcher to brainstorm relevant search terms. Such a tool might then contribute a more systematic process to qualitative evidence synthesis, improving researcher confidence that all relevant articles have been sought in the search process. The aim of this article is to start to bridge this gap in efficient search strategy tools for qualitative research questions by trialing an alternative search strategy tool. Using PICO, an alternative search strategy tool was designed that assists researchers in pinpointing search terms for qualitative research to be included in evidence synthesis. This new tool (SPIDER) is compared to an established search tool (PICO) for a qualitative metasynthesis research question, and the findings of both search strategies are discussed.</p>

<title>Design of the New Search Strategy Tool</title>
<p>The frequently applied PICO tool provided a starting point for the design of an alternative tool for use with qualitative and mixed-methods research articles. The SPIDER search strategy was designed following reflections by the authors on the difficulties of using PICO when searching for qualitative and mixed-methods research for metasynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312452938">Cooke, Mills, &amp; Lavender, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732312452938">Smith &amp; Lavender, 2011</xref>). The SPIDER tool, described below, required adaptation of the PICO components to make them more suitable for qualitative research, together with the addition of one new component (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312452938">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Sample size is typically smaller in qualitative research with the data collated being richer and more detailed than quantitative data. In contrast to those from epidemiological research, findings from qualitative research are not always intended to be generalized beyond the study population; therefore, “Sample” was preferable to “Population/problem,” which is part of PICO (P → S). An “Intervention/exposure,” used in PICO, is not always evident in qualitative research, where the aim is frequently to understand more about the certain behaviors, decisions, and individual experiences. Therefore, “Phenomenon of Interest” was deemed more suitable for use with qualitative research encompassing behaviors, experiences, and interventions (I → PI). Because of the exploratory nature of qualitative research and the smaller sample sizes, “Comparison” groups are frequently excluded. Instead, “Design” was used in the SPIDER tool because the design of a study (including any supporting theoretical framework) influences the robustness of the study and analysis (C → D). The researchers believed that the introduction of “design” might increase the detection of qualitative studies in databases where titles and abstracts are unstructured by prompting retrieval of specific study types. Qualitative research outcomes might be unobservable and subjective constructs, so the term “Evaluation” was deemed more suitable than “Outcomes” used in PICO (O → E). Finally, the SPIDER tool has the added advantage that it might be suitable for mixed-methods and quantitative research search strategies, made possible by the addition of “Research type” (R).</p>

<title>The SPIDER Tool: An Alternative Search Strategy to PICO</title>
<p>To perform an initial trial testing the effectiveness of the SPIDER search tool, two systematic literature searches, one using the PICO tool and one using the SPIDER tool, were used to answer one qualitative research question. We examined the effectiveness of the SPIDER search strategy tool according to both the returned number of articles and their relevance to the research question. The chosen research question derives from an area familiar to two of the authors (Cooke and Smith). It is likely to require both qualitative and mixed-methods research articles and is relevant to several disciplines and to both the clinical and research domains: What are young parents’ experiences of attending antenatal education?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312452938">
<title>Procedure—Search Strategy</title>
<p>As stated above, two systematic searches were conducted to answer the research question; the first involved adaptation of the PICO framework (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732312452938">Table 1</xref> for the search strategy) and the second used the SPIDER tool (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049732312452938">Table 2</xref> for the search strategy). The three largest databases for biomedical, clinical, and nursing research were searched: CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Embase. Search terms were truncated in both searches where appropriate to guarantee all relevant articles were highlighted. Two authors (Cooke and Smith) conducted searches independently, with results reviewed by the third author (Booth).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The research team examined the findings of the searches and discussed them according to two metrics. First, we examined the number of generated hits (highlighted articles) from the two search strategies. Second, we examined the proportion of identified articles that were relevant to the research question. It was not possible to calculate the sensitivity of the search (“the number of relevant reports identified divided by the total number of relevant reports in existence”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312452938">Lefebvre, Manheimer, &amp; Glanville, 2008</xref>, para. 6.4.4) as there is no way, short of examining every record on a database, of establishing the total number of relevant articles in existence.</p>
<sec id="section8-1049732312452938">
<title>Number of Articles Generated</title>
<p>The PICO search strategy created a greater number of hits compared to the SPIDER search strategy; over the three databases, a total of 2,821 articles were generated when using the PICO search strategy and 346 were generated using the SPIDER search strategy (as the metric of primary interest was overall effectiveness of the search strategy, not the comparative effectiveness of individual databases, duplicate articles are included in the summary statistics reported above). The refined SPIDER search strategy reduced the number of hits substantially, with a mean reduction across the three searched databases of 88%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732312452938">
<title>Proportion of Relevant Articles</title>
<p>Inspection of the titles and abstracts of the generated articles led us to obtain full text for 29 articles (approximately 1% overall). Using PICO, this included 1% of hits for CINAHL, 2% for Embase, and 1% for MEDLINE. Using SPIDER, this included 5% of hits for CINAHL, 9% for Embase, and 10% for MEDLINE (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049732312452938">Table 3</xref>). Two authors (Cooke and Smith) reviewed these full-text articles independently for relevance to the research question (i.e., young parents, antenatal education, and qualitative research). Five articles were relevant to the research question. Using the SPIDER tool, we found 1% relevance overall (3 articles/346 articles) compared to PICO, which generated 0.1% relevance (4 articles/2,821 articles). Two of the articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312452938">Cox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732312452938">Smith &amp; Roberts, 2009</xref>) were identified when using both the PICO tool and the SPIDER tool, one was identified using the SPIDER tool only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312452938">Bailey, Brown, DiMarco, Letherby, &amp; Wilson, 2004</xref>), and two were identified using the PICO tool only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312452938">Breedlove, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312452938">Howie &amp; Carlisle, 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In conducting this exploratory study, we sought to address the difficulties when using existing search strategy tools for qualitative research and begin to design an alternative search strategy tool to the PICO tool for use with qualitative and mixed-methods research. On reflection, the SPIDER search strategy was the easier of the two tools to generate search terms, primarily because the terminology was more suited to qualitative research questions. The results when we used the SPIDER search strategy were easier to manage than those when we used the PICO tool across all three tested databases, given the smaller number of articles generated through the search. Using the SPIDER search strategy, we found a lower proportion of relevant articles (60%; 3/5) compared to when we used PICO, with 80% (4/5), because two of the relevant articles were generated only when the PICO search strategy tool was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312452938">Breedlove, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312452938">Howie &amp; Carlisle, 2005</xref>). The remainder of the discussion focuses on possible explanations for this and suggested improvements to the SPIDER search strategy tool.</p>
<sec id="section11-1049732312452938">
<title>Indexing of Qualitative Articles</title>
<p>On inspection of the two relevant articles generated uniquely by the PICO search strategy tool, we noted that the word “qualitative” was not mentioned in the title, abstract, or keywords. Omission of this word might have adversely affected indexing of the articles within the databases. We ran the SPIDER search strategy using “and R (qualitative and/or mixed methods).” Therefore, articles were not picked up that did not explicitly contain reference to the data being qualitative or mixed methods. We ran the search again in CINAHL, using “OR R” to examine whether the two articles were listed. Both articles were listed in the CINAHL search results when “OR R” was used instead of “AND R.” However, this was at the expense of the volume of hits, which increased from 176 (using “AND R”) to 1,093 (using “OR R”).</p>
<p>The problems of indexing of qualitative research within electronic databases are widely reported, with a variety of explanations advanced. It has been suggested that the indexing of articles for most databases does not take place according to research methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312452938">Barroso et al., 2003</xref>). This is an issue for researchers when their research question targets a specific methodology. This problem of indexing can be exacerbated by research articles using nonspecific titles, unstructured abstracts, and poor definition of qualitative methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312452938">Booth, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312452938">Evans, 2002</xref>). Therefore, many qualitative searchers have identified a need to expand the basic bibliographic search using alternative techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312452938">Grayson &amp; Gomersall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312452938">Papaioannou et al., 2010</xref>), including those techniques identified by the umbrella term “berrypicking” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312452938">Bates, 1989</xref>, p. 407).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732312452938">
<title>Sensitivity and Specificity</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312452938">Evans (2002)</xref> suggested that confidence in finding all articles related to a specific topic by searching relevant databases is difficult because the searcher cannot know the full quota of relevant articles. Retrieval of the entire population of relevant studies would be possible only if a hand search of all relevant journals were undertaken, something that ideally should be avoided! During the infancy of quantitative systematic reviews, it was suggested that, in MEDLINE, researchers captured only 30% to 80% of published randomized controlled trials when they ran literature searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312452938">Dickersin, Scherer, &amp; Lefebvre, 1994</xref>). As indexing and technologies have continued to improve, proportions of relevant articles now consistently appear toward the upper end of this range.</p>
<p>More recently, a team of health service researchers at McMaster University, Canada, explored the identification of optimal permutations of search terms (filters or hedges) for retrieval of specific study types, to varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity. Literature searchers add such filters or hedges to the end of topic-related search strategies to provide another limitation by study design or study type. Members of this self-styled Hedges team performed several related studies using popular databases for qualitative searches: MEDLINE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732312452938">Wong, Wilczynski, &amp; Haynes, 2004</xref>), CINAHL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732312452938">Wilczynski, Marks, &amp; Haynes, 2007</xref>), Embase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732312452938">Walters, Wilczynski, &amp; Haynes, 2005</xref>), and PsycINFO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312452938">McKibbon, Wilczynski, &amp; Haynes, 2006</xref>). They performed various strategies including a narrow, focused search for high sensitivity, a broad search for high specificity, and a compromise between the two. Search results were compared to the results of a thorough hand search of 64 relevant gold-standard journals to assess accuracy of the search. The Hedges team found that indexing terms for qualitative research were not useful in any database other than CINAHL; all strategies depend heavily on variations of the terms <italic>qualitative, interview, themes</italic>, and <italic>experience</italic>, with multiple-term strategies leading to improved results. This general finding was not borne out in our specific case, where the two articles exclusively picked up by our PICO search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312452938">Breedlove, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312452938">Howie &amp; Carlisle, 2005</xref>) were both derived from the CINAHL search, which should have held a higher likelihood of correct indexing for qualitative research.</p>
<p>Using the findings, we suggest that the SPIDER tool is a good basis for a search strategy tool that can be used more efficiently with qualitative and mixed-methods research questions in opposition to the PICO tool. We have demonstrated that the SPIDER search tool is a promising method of performing a literature search, with the higher rate of yield reducing the time the researcher spent reviewing the search results. However, two relevant articles were missed when we ran the SPIDER search strategy, although this probably identified specific problems associated with poor indexing. More work is needed to investigate the sensitivity of the SPIDER tool and to ensure that it does not eliminate articles because of poor indexing. In particular, we believe that adapting the logic that originally underpinned the SPIDER tool, so that S and PI are initially combined with “AND” and then, in turn, “AND-ed” with the three methodological terms (namely “D OR E OR R”), might prove a fruitful line of inquiry. This might particularly be the case if the searcher could aim to make the S and PI specific to the indexing language of the database, but, in contrast, to make the D, E, and R sensitive for qualitative research-related terms. Such an approach would be particularly justified, in line with the earlier methodological discussion, where the intention is to sample the most relevant qualitative research articles (as for an interpretive review) rather than to search exhaustively and comprehensively (as for an aggregative review).</p>
<p>If this method were supported by future testing on a wider range of qualitative topics, researchers could eventually consider the SPIDER tool as a development of PICO, in that it can also include qualitative and mixed-methods research and not just quantitative research. Future development of the “SPIDER spinning a web for retrieval” (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1049732312452938">Figure 2</xref>) might ultimately yield an antidote to suboptimal search strategies for qualitative and mixed-methods research.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article we demonstrate the potential value of the SPIDER search strategy tool, an ongoing extension of thinking around the PICO search strategy tool. Using the SPIDER tool enabled us to search the literature in this exploratory study in a more timely and sensitive manner because of the suitability of the refined components for qualitative and mixed-methods research. However, more work is required to refine this new search strategy tool—for example, by compiling a test set of documents so that a known estimate of sensitivity can be calculated. We consider the optimal combination of specificity for the subject (topical) content and sensitivity for the methodological content form a potentially fruitful line of inquiry, particularly given recent clarification regarding differences in the intent of qualitative evidence synthesis and its quantitative counterparts. In addition, more development and testing of the SPIDER tool with a wide range of qualitative research topics are needed before it can be considered a viable alternative to PICO for retrieving qualitative research. Currently, this timely method for spinning a web for retrieval of relevant articles might make the systematic literature search process more efficient for researchers, thereby saving them valuable time by eliminating irrelevant articles. Moreover, SPIDER, albeit unintentionally, has highlighted the need for good quality indexing of qualitative articles in databases.</p>
