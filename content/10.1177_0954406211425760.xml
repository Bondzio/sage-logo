<abstract>
<p>In this study, instrumented indentation testing, or so-called depth-sensing indentation testing, was used to characterize polypropylene (PP) materials. The influence of molecular weight and cooling rate on the hardness was investigated showing that low cooling rates and relatively low molecular weight lead to higher hardness values. In random copolymers of propene with butene and hexene, the correlation between hardness and degree of crystallinity is linear and the conversion to the amorphous state could be detected. Blends of PP with ethylene–propylene elastomer show a strong negative deviation of indentation modulus from linear rule of mixture. This behaviour can be described by Kerner’s model in the case of particulate arrangement and by Davies’ model in the phase inversion region. The addition of high-density polyethylene to PP results in a synergistic behaviour of modulus which can be attributed to nucleation effects.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the application of indentation testing to detect physical ageing of a surface of an injection-moulded specimen and heterogeneity of weld lines was shown. Orientations in a biaxially oriented film could be detected using Knoop indenter.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406211425760"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Originally introduced for applications in the area of testing thin metallic and other inorganic films, instrumented indentation testing (or depth-sensing indentation testing) becomes more and more widely used in the field of polymer research. The reasons for that are the special requirements of this material class (strong time-dependent deformation behaviour, often high recovery) and the general advantages of the method compared to conventional hardness testing methods. Especially during the first stages of material development, when only very small amounts of material are available, instrumented indentation testing can help to give an orientation on the material properties. Provided that suitable testing parameters lead to robust results, realistic values can be obtained also in the case of viscoelastic material behaviour. An other benefit of the method is the possibility to describe gradient materials.</p>
<p>The number of published works in the field of polymer science containing results determined by nanoindentation testing increases year by year. However, it should be noticed that the term ‘nanoindentation’ is often somewhat incorrectly used. Looking at the definition of nanohardness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211425760"><bold>1</bold></xref>], only indentations up to 200 nm depth belong to the nanoregion. In literature, often measurements with larger indentation depths, sometimes up to a few microns, are named ‘nanoindentation’ although they belong to the microhardness region. In most cases, the authors do that if the used device is a nanoindentation machine.</p>
<p>In this study, some examples of applications of instrumented indentation testing for the characterization of polypropylene (PP) based materials, widely used and documented class of materials, will be shown.</p>
<p>Microhardness measurements (mostly ‘conventional’, i.e. with measuring the remaining impression) of PP materials are described extensively in the literature. For example, one can find results on the correlation between microhardness and the degree of crystallinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211425760"><bold>2</bold></xref>], hardness and modulus of transcrystalline PP detected by Knoop microindentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211425760"><bold>3</bold></xref>], the detection of orientations due to processing conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211425760"><bold>4</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211425760"><bold>5</bold></xref>], and the detection of the glass transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211425760"><bold>6</bold></xref>]. Also, differences between the α- and β-phases of PP are shown by indentation testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211425760"><bold>7</bold></xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211425760"><bold>8</bold></xref>]. Several works in the literature describe the correlation between hardness and other (macroscopic) mechanical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406211425760"><bold>9</bold></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211425760"><bold>11</bold></xref>], which is very important if the possible available content of information obtained by indentation testing should be increased.</p>
<p>In this study, the focus of the investigations was on PP homopolymers, copolymers, and blends in the form of defined crystallized films as well as on several typical processed products.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954406211425760"><title>2 EXPERIMENTAL</title>
<p>PP homopolymers, copolymers, and blends were investigated. The isotactic PP (iPP) homopolymers, supplied by Borealis GmbH, Linz, had different molecular weights (209, 230, 330, 482, and 885 kg/mol) and a comparable <italic>M<sub>W</sub></italic>/<italic>M<sub>n</sub></italic> ratio ranging from 4.4 to 5.0. The random copolymers of propene with higher α-olefins were metallocene-catalyzed laboratory products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406211425760"><bold>12</bold></xref>], prepared by the group of M. Arnold, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg and contain 5 and 11.8 mol% butene and 3.4, 6.7, 11.2, and 22.9 mol% hexene, respectively. Three different blend systems, two containing ethylene–propylene rubber (EPR) as an elastomeric phase and one containing high-density polyethylene (PE-HD) were investigated. One of the elastomer blends had an iPP matrix, the other one a random copolymer matrix (ethene–propene copolymer containing 4 mol% ethene), the elastomer content ranges from 15 to 85 wt.%. In the PP/PE-HD blends, the full range of compositions from neat PP to neat PE with a step size of 10 wt.% was present.</p>
<p>In the case of the above-mentioned materials, film specimens (4 × 3 × 0.05 mm<sup>3</sup>) were prepared using a hot stage. After heating the sample between thin microscopic slides to 200°C and keeping the temperature constant for 7 min, the film specimens were cooled with a cooling rate of 10 K/min to room temperature. The homopolymer series was cooled with varying cooling rates to see the influence of different crystallization speeds. The low thickness of the samples guarantees that there is no temperature gradient in the samples. All samples were glued on an aluminium sample holder.</p>
<p>The other samples, namely the biaxial stretched film and the injection-moulded plate were measureddirectly on the surface as obtained, and the welded material was carefully polished to achieve a cross-section of the interesting region.</p>
<p>Instrumented microhardness tests were done using a Nanoindenter XP, MTS Systems Inc. If not, otherwise stated, the indentation depth was 1 µm and the indentation rate 0.05<italic>h</italic><sub>max</sub> s<sup>−1</sup>. After a holding time of 30 s at maximum load, the specimens were unloaded.

<sec id="sec4-0954406211425760"><title>3.1 Influence of loading speed and holding time</title>
<p>One important aspect of indentation testing of time-dependent materials like polymeric materials is the selection of a suitable test procedure. This is due to the relaxation and retardation effects superimposing the loading, holding, and unloading parts of the measurement. On the one hand, this leads to an increasing indentation depth, i.e. lower hardness at slow test speeds, and to the often observed ‘nose effect’, which is the description of an increasing indentation depth during the first part of unloading due to a dominating superposition of creep at this first stage of unloading (it could be called as ‘creep inertness’). The latter one leads to wrong values, because in that case the slope of the tangent on the unloading curve is steeper.</p>
<p>An example of the influence of test speed on the Martens hardness which includes elastic, viscoelastic, and viscoplastic parts of deformation is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211425760">Fig.1</xref>. Increasing test speed leads to an increase of the determined hardness values. That means, if one wants to compare the results of depth-sensing indentation tests of polymeric materials this can be done only by application of the same or very similar test conditions, which is a general requirement in polymer testing.

</fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211425760">Figure 2</xref> shows the influence of the test conditions on the indentation modulus of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) which was used as a reference material due its amorphous and very homogeneous character. An increase of the modulus with increasing indentation speed and reduced holding time can be seen. For example, an increase of the indentation speed from 10 to 30 nm/s, combined with a reducing of the holding time from 30 to 1 s, leads to a 28 per cent higher modulus. It can be observed that for an indentation depth of 200 nm, the usage of holding times between 20 and 50 s and test speeds between 2 and 20 nm/s gives reproducible results, because inthis region the influence of <italic>v</italic> and <italic>t<sub>h</sub></italic> is relative small as it is in evidence by the plateau in the three-dimensional (3D) plot. The cross symbol marks the conditions which were used in the predominant number of investigations, more generally specified <italic>v</italic> = 0.05<italic>h</italic><sub>max</sub> s<sup>−1</sup> and <italic>t<sub>h</sub></italic> = 30 s. This seems to be a good compromise. Furthermore, the testing time is not too long, which is needed to reduce influences of machine instabilities caused by thermal drift, etc. Only in the case of highly creeping materials, longer holding times in combination with fast unloading were needed to prevent the ‘nose effect’.

<sec id="sec5-0954406211425760"><title>3.2 Influence of processing conditions</title>
<p>It is commonly known that the processing conditions, especially cooling rate, shear forces, and annealing, have a big influence on the mechanical properties of thermoset polymers in particular on the properties of semicrystalline polymers.</p>
<p>For PP homopolymers with wide range of molecular weight the influence of cooling rate is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211425760">Fig. 3</xref>. For the investigated materials a decrease of crystallization temperature with increasing molecular weight and as expected with increasing cooling rate was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211425760">Fig. 3(a)</xref>). Hence, the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results demonstrate that the PPs with lower molecular weight show a higher tendency to crystallize because the shorter chains can arrange easier in 3D ordered structures due to their higher mobility in the melt. The mobility of the much longer chains is reduced by their higher degree of interpenetration and entanglement. This leads to a lower crystallinity and reduced lamella thickness of the long chain materials, which results in lower hardness values of these materials in the entire investigated cooling rate range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211425760">Fig. 3(b)</xref>). Furthermore, the hardness decreases with increasing cooling rate due to thinner lamellas and lower crystallinity. Note that the same tendency of hardness in the dependence on the molecular weight was found also in the quenched and annealed states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406211425760"><bold>14</bold></xref>].

<sec id="sec6-0954406211425760"><title>3.3 Influence of composition</title>
<sec id="sec7-0954406211425760"><title>3.3.1 Copolymers</title>
<p>With the help of copolymerization, the properties of PP can be varied to a large extent. Incorporation of a second monomer species will lead to more complex and/or heterogeneous chains, which reduce the tendency to crystallize. As a result, tailored materials with higher transparency, softness, and toughness were obtained, which are requested, for example by the packaging industry. The strong influence of two different comonomers, butene and hexene, on the melting behaviour, i.e. the crystallinity, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211425760">Fig. 4(a)</xref>. Besides the reduction of the melting enthalpy, also a decrease of peak temperature reflecting a reduction of the lamella thickness can be observed. As expected, the hardness decreases with increasing comonomer content, also the hardness decrease is stronger for the longer comonomer chains, i.e. the hexene. In reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211425760"><bold>15</bold></xref>], the influence of crystallinity and the thickness of lamellae on themicrohardness of semicrystalline polymers are reported. There is a linear correlation between the degree of crystallinity and the hardness in the region of 20–38 per cent crystallinity. Another noticeable aspect is the sharp kink in the dependence of hardness on the hexene content (and therefore on the crystallinity). After a first linear decrease in the lower content region, there is a very low-hardness plateau in the higher content region (14.2 and 22.9 mol%). This correlates with the transition from the semicrystalline morphology to fully amorphous state, as shown by DSC results. Note, that also this amorphous state could be measured by instrumented testing, which is not easily possible with conventional microhardness due to the elastomeric behaviour and the full recovery of the material.

</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0954406211425760"><title>3.3.2 Blends</title>
<p>Melt mixing of two or more polymers is a classical method to tailor polymer properties. For example, impact toughness can be improved by the addition of an elastomeric phase. Besides the toughness, all other mechanical properties were influenced by the soft phase. In general, a reduction in stiffness, strength, and hardness can be expected.</p>
<p>Two different PP/EPR blends were investigated, one with a homopolymer and the other with E/P copolymer as the semicrystalline PP component. The typical morphology of a PP/EPR blend system can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211425760">Fig. 5(a)</xref>, where the holes represent the elastomeric phase removed by etching with n-heptane. Blends up to 40 wt.% EPR show dispersely distributed elastomer particles, whereas between 40 and 60 wt.% a co-continuous morphology develops. This is the region of phase inversion; at higher EPR content, the elastomer is the continuous phase, i.e. the matrix. The mechanical values, hardness and modulus of the PP/EPR blends, do not follow a linear rule of mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211425760">Fig. 5(c)</xref>). In the entire composition range, the blend values are significantly below the linear rule of mixture. Note that the crystallinity of the PP component did not change with the addition of EPR as it was checked by DSC. Hence, the negative deviation from the linear mixing rule does not result from a change of the components properties. To verify that the obtained results are not dominated by systematic artefacts from the indentation measurements, the storage moduli at room temperature were determined by dynamic-mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). The trend was confirmed. Such a behaviour of modulus of elasticity can be described using the models of Kerner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211425760"><bold>16</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954406211425760"><bold>17</bold></xref>] and Davies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211425760"><bold>18</bold></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954406211425760"><bold>19</bold></xref>]. If one phase is dispersed in a matrix, which is the case in the region up to 40 wt.% EPR (EPR particles in PP matrix) and in the region with more than 60 wt.% EPR (PP particles in a EPR matrix), the material behaviour follows the assumptions by Kerner’s model. In the co-continuous region, the model proposed by Davis fits the measured values quite well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211425760">Fig. 5(d)</xref>).
<fig id="fig5-0954406211425760" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Blend morphology of PP/EPR blends with 20 wt.% (a) and 50 wt.% EPR (b); EPR was removed by n-heptane.

</fig></p>
<p>The modulus behaviour of a blend system derived from PP and PE–HD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211425760">Fig. 6(a)</xref>) is completely different to the PP/EPR blends. There, a synergistic deviation from linear mixing rule can be observed. This is somewhat surprising because the two components are immiscible, which was verified by DMTA. The glass transition temperatures of the components did not change in the blends. However, in principle, also in immiscible blends, there can occur an interdiffusion and therefore an interpenetration of chain segments resulting in the development of an interphase. According to reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954406211425760"><bold>20</bold></xref>], the thickness of this interphase can be calculated, which gives a value of 5.4 nm. The crystallization curves measured by DSC at a cooling rate of 10 K/min show a nucleation effect by the added PE-HD. There is only one crystallization peak observable for the blends, with a maximum at PE’s crystallization temperature which is higher than that of PP. Also, the initial temperature, i.e. the temperature of the first deviation from the base line, shows some shift to temperatures higher than the initial temperatures of the neat polymers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211425760">Fig. 6(b)</xref>). An increase of the initial crystallization temperatures of iPP/PE-HD blends was reported also in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211425760"><bold>21</bold></xref>], where a cooling rate of 80 K/min was applied by the authors. In different works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211425760"><bold>21</bold></xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954406211425760"><bold>24</bold></xref>], a synergistic behaviour of mechanical properties was found for PP/PE blends.
<fig id="fig6-0954406211425760" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Indentation modulus (a) and initial crystallization temperatures (b) of PP/PE-HD blends</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211425760-fig6.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Interestingly, this synergistic behaviour of the moduli was nearly absent if the hardness values of the 10 K/min cooled samples were considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954406211425760"><bold>25</bold></xref>]. The magnitude of the synergistic effect depends onthe cooling rate. In quenched samples, it is much more pronounced, for both, modulus and hardness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0954406211425760"><bold>25</bold></xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec9-0954406211425760"><title>3.4 Detection of orientations</title>
<p>For the detection of orientations, the use of a Knoop indenter can be recommended. The advantages of this four-sided strong anisotropic pyramide are described in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954406211425760"><bold>26</bold></xref>]. Beneath the asymmetric Knoop indenter, the stress and strain field is not symmetric. In the direction of the small axis, the strains are larger. If the long axis is oriented parallel to the main orientation of the molecular chains, the maximum strain will be normal to the preferred direction of the molecules. This results in a larger indent, i.e. lower hardness value. If the long axis is oriented normally to the main orientation of the molecules the maximum strain will be parallel to the molecular orientations. As a consequence, this leads to smaller indents and therefore higher hardness values. Due to this, the Knoop hardness is much more sensitive to orientations than measurements with more symmetric indenters. To reveal that, a biaxially stretched film of unknown orientation state which was supplied in the shape of a DIN A4 sheet, was investigated. The long axis of the Knoop diamond was oriented with angles of 0°, 30°, 45°, and 90° to the long side of the sheet.</p>
<p>Plotting the obtained Knoop hardness values in a polar diagram, an ellipsoidal shape can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211425760">Fig. 7</xref>), indicating that an anisotropic orientation state exists in the film. In this case, it can be concluded that the orientation is stronger in the 90° direction.

<p>Welding is a classical process for joining PP materials. Especially in the pipe industry, hot welding is widely used for connecting pipes. The mechanical behaviour of joined parts depends strongly on the homogeneity, i.e. the properties gradient, in the region of the weld line and the heat-affected zone. The quality of a butt-welding is influenced by temperature, heating period, contact pressure, and cooling rate. A strong local variation of temperature and strain conditions occurs, which leads to a modification of the material morphology, resulting in a mechanical inhomogeneity. The quantitative description of this inhomogeneity requires a position sensitive test method. In the following, the influence of a nucleating agent on the distribution of hardness and modulus across the welded region of welded plates will be shown. The compression-moulded plates with a thickness of 4 mm were joined in a plate-welding device at a temperature 190–200°C and a pressure 0.1 N/mm<sup>2</sup>. Samples were provided by Mr. Ralf Lach, PSM GmbH, Merseburg, Germany. Differences in the morphology can be observed on the respective micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211425760">Fig. 8</xref>). The non-nucleated material has a refined spherulitic morphology in the melted region, which suggests higher cooling rate compared to the cooling rate during plate fabrication. The transition from coarse to fine spherulites is sharp. In the nucleated material,the spherulite size appears homogeneous; addition of the nucleating agent leads to very fine morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211425760">Fig. 8(b)</xref>); and the influence of different cooling rates is reduced.

</fig></p>
<p>Looking at the indentation results, somewhat lower values of hardness and modulus in the melted region compared to the unaffected material can be observed in the case of the non-nucleated material, which should be due to the higher cooling rate in this region. In the directly closed-by zone, increased values (about 20 per cent) were detected due to annealing and partial melting/crystallization processes. For the nucleated PP, there is no difference in spherulite size between the melted region and the base material, which demonstrates the efficiency of the nucleation. In the transition region, the increase of the values is less pronounced. Generally, the level of the properties is somewhat higher than that in the non-nucleated material.</p>
<p>The microhardness results give information about the homogeneity of materials and components because they are correlated to the distribution of crystallinity. However, it should be strictly mentioned that from a homogeneous hardness distribution, the overall mechanical behaviour cannot be suggested. Especially the ductility and toughness are often not correlated to the indentation results. To point out that, it is referred to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211425760">Fig. 9</xref>, which illustrates the tensile behaviour of specimens prepared from the welded plates. Although the microhardness trend and the micrographs suggest a good homogeneity for the nucleated sample, the ductility is strongly reduced by the weld line. Furthermore, the ductility of the welded non-nucleated sample is somewhat higher than that of the nucleated sample, which is in contrast to the expectations from the indentation measurements.

<sec id="sec11-0954406211425760"><title>3.6 Detection of ageing</title>
<p>During the process of polymeric parts, the surfaces were often quenched very fast. This leads to the very well-known occurrence of so-called skin–core morphology. At cooling rates higher than 100 K/s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954406211425760"><bold>27</bold></xref>], which is easily exceeded during injection moulding, a mesomorphic or smectic layer develops in the surface region. It is clear that such quenched non-equilibrium material will undergo physical ageing. The question was whether nanoindentation measurement is sensitive enough to detect such ageing effects in the smectic layer. Typical quadratic test plates with a side length of 60 mm and a thickness of 2 mm were injection moulded at Borealis Polyolefine GmbH, Linz. After 5 h, the first measurement was done, which should represent the reference point. A very low indentation depth of 200 nm was used to ensure the testing of the real outer surface. Such small indents (the diameter is about 1.4 µm) in a highly recovering material cannot be correctly measured by conventional microhardness, even if a scanning electron microscope is used. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211425760">Fig. 10</xref>, it can be seen that the hardness increases with storing time at room temperature due to rearrangement and post-crystallization effects. A hardness increase of about 10 per cent was detected. The main part of this occurs during the first 100 h, after that there is only little effect, a plateau region was reached. It is obvious that the standard deviations are relatively large. Nevertheless, the increasing trend is clearly visible, especially if it is considered that the results are free of human evaluation errors.

<sec id="sec12-0954406211425760"><title>4 SUMMARY</title>
<p>Examples for the application of instrumented indentation testing on PP-based materials were shown. One big advantage of the most presented results isthat only a very small amount of material was needed because the preparation could be done with a simple hot stage commonly used in microscopy. Using this, a couple of defined, cooled and very homogeneous, samples can be prepared at the same time. Using suitable testing conditions, reproducible results for indentation hardness and modulus can be obtained.</p>
<p>For PP homopolymers crystallized with different cooling rates, it was shown that in the investigated molecular weight range (209–885 kg/mol), the low-molecular weight samples show higher hardness values for all applied cooling rates which is due to their better ability to arrange in crystalline structures. A strong dependence on the comonomer content was detected for random copolymers of propene with butene and hexene, whereas the hardness decrease is much more pronounced in the case of propene/hexene copolymers, because the crystallinity is strongly reduced by the longer comonomer chains. In the investigated concentration range, there is a linear correlation between hardness and degree of crystallinity. In blends of PP with EPR, the indentation modulus does not follow a linear mixing rule, and it shows a negative deviation from it. A synergistic behaviour on the modulus was detected when PE-HD was added to PP which should be due to a nucleating effect of the PE on the PP.</p>
<p>Other applications on processed parts show that the orientation state in biaxially stretched films, the ageing behaviour in the skin layer of injection-moulded plates, and the influence of a nucleating agent on the homogeneity of the weld line region in welded plates can be described by instrumented indentation testing.</p>
<p>Note that, in general, classic microhardness testing can also be used to show the effects, but if really small indentation depths are needed (for example at the surface of injection-moulded specimens) or if the visco-elastic or rubber–elastic recovery is very high (in this study, this was the case for the fully amorphous propene–hexene copolymers and the blends with high elastomer content), the microscopically measuring of the size of the indent reaches its limits. Furthermore, if an approximately knowledge of the modulus of elasticity is needed the instrumented indentation provides the suitable method. Also, what should keep clearly in mind is that in the case of only small differences between materials or materials conditions the obtained results are free of errors made by the testing person.</p>
