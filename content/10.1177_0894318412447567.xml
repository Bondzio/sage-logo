      <p>Living with chronic disease is a fact of life for many people around the world. While many health professionals tend to focus attention on the disease itself, taking a person-centered human response to living with chronic illness, such as hepatitis C, can illuminate what health means for persons facing the disease.</p>
      <sec id="section1-0894318412447567">
         <title>Background</title>
         <p>Hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is a significant global health issue, with over 170 million individuals infected worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318412447567">Shepard, Finelli &amp; Alter, 2005</xref>). About 25% of these individuals will spontaneously clear HCV infection, while the remainder, if left untreated or treated unsuccessfully, will progress to chronic liver disease and its debilitating effects. As many as 20% of people living with HCV will develop cirrhosis over a period of 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447567">Sypsa et al., 2005</xref> ). Currently there is no vaccine to prevent HCV infection and no post-exposure prophylaxis (Shepard, Finelli, &amp; Alter). The treatment for HCV infection is a combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318412447567">Ward &amp; Kugelmas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894318412447567">Zic, 2005</xref>). Combination therapy is associated with many unpleasant side effects, several of which are psychological in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318412447567">Dolan, 1997</xref>).</p>
         <p>People with HCV undergo genotyping before commencing treatment because the genotype serves as a guide to optimal treatment and is predictive of patient response to treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318412447567">Strader, Wright, Thomas, &amp; Seeff, 2004</xref>). Genotype 1 is more resistant to treatment hence patients require a 48-week course of therapy. Genotypes 2 and 3 have a high probability of a favorable response, hence patients require only 24 weeks of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894318412447567">Zic, 2005</xref>).</p>
         <p>There has, however, been little nursing research conducted on what the experience of living with HCV infection is like or what it means for individuals undergoing treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894318412447567">Sgorbini, O’Brien, &amp; Jackson, 2009</xref>). Therefore the purpose of this study was to explore the complexity of living with chronic illness for persons who have HCV, underpinned by Newman’s theory of health as expanding consciousness.</p>

         <title>Theoretical Framework</title>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447567">Newman’s (1994)</xref> theory of health as expanding consciousness embraces a unitary transformative paradigm in which the unitary process of health and illness represent the pattern of the whole. To see health as the pattern of the whole, one needs to view disease not as a separate entity that invades a person’s body, but as a manifestation of the evolving pattern of person-environment interaction. Nursing praxis is directed toward recognizing the pattern of the person in interaction with the environment and accepting it as a process of evolving consciousness. <italic>Life pattern</italic> can be seen within the personal story as manifestations of expanding consciousness unfolding in space-time. <italic>Underlying pattern</italic> represented what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318412447567">Bohm (1980)</xref> called the implicate order, or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447567">Newman (2002)</xref> called the ground of consciousness, and may also be seen in life stories. Underlying patterns evolve from contemplation of the meaning of individual and multiple life stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447567">Neill, 2002</xref>), although they do not depict the entire implicate order. Both life and underlying patterns help nurses to appreciate people as unique, whole human beings.</p>
         <p>Expanding consciousness is an evolving process. Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894318412447567">Young’s (1976)</xref> theory of evolution, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447567">Newman (1994)</xref> explicated the stages of consciousness. At the early stages, consciousness is bound. Persons begin to develop a sense of self-consciousness at the centering or third stage. The fourth stage, choice, is the turning point. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894318412447567">Young (1976)</xref> described choice as a reflective turn in consciousness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447567">Newman (1994)</xref> described this stage as a kind of inward, self-generated reformation (p. 45). A <italic>turning point</italic> can represent a crisis. For example, a diagnosis of HCV can be viewed as a personal turning point. A <italic>turning point</italic> is identified by change, either sudden or gradual, which establishes a new order as people make intentional choices about new and more complex ways of living. At the turning point, an individual is able to reclaim power, participating knowingly in the change. Recognizing pattern with insight and subsequent change can result in greater complexity of the whole and a transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447567">Newman, 1994</xref>). At the next stage, de-centering, there is movement toward growth and higher levels of freedom. The person has an awareness of consciousness as extending beyond physical boundaries, conceptualized as transcendence. In the next stage of unbinding, the sense of unity with one’s world is paramount and consciousness again broadens leading toward real freedom. During the process of transformation, old ways of thinking and being that limit one’s ability to integrate new life experiences are transcended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318412447567">Reed, 1996</xref>).</p>

         <title>Related Literature</title>
         <p>Newman’s theory has been used in many studies of people living with chronic illness. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894318412447567">Yamashita (1999)</xref> studied Canadian family caregivers for people living with schizophrenia. In this study in accordance with Newman’s theory of health as praxis, participants recognized their patterns of the whole to understand and accept their relative’s mental illness. Several studies have focused on patterns of persons with rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447567">Brauer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447567">Neill, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318412447567">Schmidt, Brauer, &amp; Peden-McAlpine, 2003</xref>) and multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447567">Neill, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447567">Neill (2002)</xref> described the life patterns of three women with rheumatoid arthritis as a process of expanding consciousness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447567">Neill (2005)</xref> built on this work by examining the life patterns of four additional women living with multiple sclerosis, noting that recognizing the pattern of the whole person is a form of caring and is a way to know others. Studies have also included life patterns of persons with coronary heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447567">Newman &amp; Moch, 1991</xref>). This study emphasized the meaning that the disruption of coronary heart disease had for each person and helped individuals get in touch with their patterns and express themselves more fully. Confrontation with the limitations of the disease and their own mortality became a turning point for some (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447567">Newman &amp; Moch, 1991</xref>).</p>
         <p>Such research using Newman’s theory to explore health as expanding consciousness through recognition of patterns that are meaningful for people living with chronic illness provides justification for use in asking what is meaningful for people living with HCV. A study of 98 newly diagnosed individuals in Islamabad by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447567">Gill, Atiq, Sattar, and Khokhar (2005)</xref> found that HCV diagnosis was significantly more stressful than divorce and loss of source of income. For many, living with HCV infection means having to live with uncertainty and hopelessness, as <italic>cure</italic> may not be realistic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447567">Netuveli, Wiggins, Hildon, Montgomery, and Blane (2005)</xref> provided evidence from a national survey in England of 9,298 people, that quality of life is the most desired and possibly the only achievable outcome in patients suffering from chronic illness with no possible cure. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894318412447567">Sgorbini and colleagues (2009)</xref> conducted a phenomenological study of people living with hepatitis C who were undergoing treatment. While this study involved only 5 participants, they all experienced illness with treatment, felt isolated, and encountered stigma about HCV infection. The authors suggested that an understanding of the experiences of people with HVC infection and treatment could lead to the development of and the delivery of more effective nursing care.</p>

         <title>Research as Praxis</title>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447567">Newman’s (1994)</xref> praxis research methodology, a hermeneutic dialectic method, was used in this study to be consistent with the theory of health as expanding consciousness within a unitary-transformative paradigm. Theory, research, and practice are conceived as indivisible. There is an interactive unity between the researcher and the participant as both are integrally involved in the research process. The researcher and the participant are interpenetrating aspects of the whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447567">Newman, 1994</xref>). Pattern evolves through mutual process by interpenetration of new information or perceptions in a dialectic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447567">Newman, 1994</xref>). The whole of a person’s pattern is manifested in the dialogue between the nurse researcher and the participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447567">Newman, 1994</xref>).</p>
         <p>The methodology of pattern identification consisted of the following elements: (a) Establishing the mutuality of the process of inquiry; (b) focusing on the most meaningful persons and events in the participant’s life; (c) organizing the data in narrative form and displaying it as sequential patterns over time; and (d) sharing the nurse researcher’s perception of the pattern with the participant to confirm, clarify, or revise the pattern being portrayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447567">Newman, 1994</xref>). This process permits participants to gain insight into their pattern and creates an opportunity for participants to recognize their potential for action.</p>

         <title>Participants</title>
         <p>A convenience sampling technique along with snowballing was used. The criteria for inclusion were that participants be over 18 years of age and had been diagnosed with HCV. Participants who were undergoing or had undergone treatment were not excluded. They were recruited through a provincial hepatitis C support group that met once a month. The researcher arranged to initially meet with the support group to explain the study, after which anyone willing to participate gave the nurse researcher their telephone number for follow-up contact. Five participants were recruited from the support group, one by snowballing, and three were recruited from a hepatitis C clinic.</p>
         <p>The 9 participants ranged in age from 29 years to 62 years of age and consisted of 4 men and 5 women. Two had not received treatment, 2 had received treatment and cleared the virus, 2 had received treatment but not cleared the virus, 2 were on treatment, and 1 had had a liver transplant and afterwards received treatment which cleared the virus. Eight participants were infected with genotype 1 and 1 participant on treatment was infected with genotype 3. Both participants who had received treatment but not cleared the virus had received treatment for over 42 weeks.</p>
         <p>Three participants revealed that they had probably contracted HCV from using injecting drugs, 2 had contracted HCV from a blood transfusion before 1990, and 1 participant contracted HCV at birth from a mother who had had a blood transfusion two years before and who died of liver failure when this participant was 16 years old.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="section6-0894318412447567">
         <title>Data Collection and Application to Theory</title>
         <p>Before data collection began, this study was approved by the ethics board of the nurse researcher’s university. Data collection consisted of administering a voluntary consent form that the participant read, asked any questions, and if in agreement, signed and gave back to the researcher. A copy of the consent form was also left with the participant.</p>
         <p>Each participant was interviewed at least twice for 60 to 90 minutes. During the interviews, the researcher tried to understand the perceptions, feelings, and experiences that the participants described. In accordance with the tenets of research as praxis, the nurse researcher invited the participants to engage in dialogue about the persons or events that were most meaningful to them in order to create an opportunity for reflection, awareness, and potential insight. The initial interview was a natural conversation about the participant’s life using open ended questions that began with “Tell me about the most meaningful persons and events in your life.” The initial interview eventually moved on to exploring how the participant had learned of the HCV diagnosis, and what that experience had been like. If the participant was on, or had received treatment, this was also explored in terms of allowing the participants to describe that experience and its meaning.</p>
         <p>The second interview was an opportunity for sharing the recognition of patterns and was accompanied by the nurse researcher sharing her analysis of the story from the first interview in terms of life patterns using words and diagrams. It began with “Let’s continue your reflection of your life.” It provided an opportunity for the participant to confirm, clarify, or revise the pattern or theme that the researcher shared. For all the participants, it was an opportunity to recognize their potential for action within themselves. Only two third interviews were conducted during which an additional reflection on the participant’s life occurred, the researcher reflected on the relationship between the participant and the nurse researcher, and allowed for closure. These two third interviews were conducted at the request of the participants.</p>
         <p>All the interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim by the nurse researcher, and checked against the tape by the author. The audiotapes were repeatedly played and the transcriptions were read several times to gain a sense of the whole. Accuracy was enhanced through re-reading the transcripts while listening to the audiotapes. The fact that the interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim provided an assurance of verbal accuracy.</p>
         <p>Patterns that emerged from the first interview were shared with the participants verbally and using diagrams during the second interview. A second phase consisted of identifying themes in the evolving patterns of relationships. This phase involved identifying what appeared to be the most important feelings described by the participants, characterizing these as themes of the individual pattern, identifying themes common across several participants’ patterns, and accounting for differences in the individual patterns.</p>

         <sec id="section8-0894318412447567">
            <title>Struggling to Overcome</title>
            <p>The main theme that emerged from the interview data was the experience of struggling to overcome. These struggles were to overcome the shock of the diagnosis, the struggle to overcome the implications of living with HCV, the struggle to overcome the diminished physical abilities, to overcome the effects of treatment and the inability to work, and for three of the participants, the constant daily struggle to overcome their craving to use injecting drugs.</p>
            <p>Participants had to struggle to understand what a diagnosis of hepatitis C meant and struggle to accept it. Several of the participants who had had blood transfusions only found out many years later and unexpectedly, that they had hepatitis C. One participant, infected at birth, found out over 30 years later when pregnant that she had hepatitis C. This participant shared that 2 weeks after she was diagnosed, she received a letter from her physician saying that her medical needs did not fit the direction that this physician’s practice was going, and that she could no longer see her. She related this as “to think that the person who is supposed to be supporting you, and asking you questions, and helping you through that difficult time is the one person who turned her back.”</p>
            <p>One participant who had received a blood transfusion in the 1970s was scheduled for surgery in 2004 and was then tested positive. This participant described her reaction as “a huge shock” and “like being raped.” This participant had asked her doctor three times earlier to be tested but the doctor had refused. This participant then had to have her daughter and ex-husband tested and said, “I think the hardest part, was waiting to have my daughter and my ex tested. It took 3 weeks for the tests to come back and that was the longest 3 weeks.”</p>
            <p>Another participant found out that he was infected one day when he did not feel well and developed ascites. He then was tested and told he was in liver failure and dying. This participant was put on the liver transplant list and during the 10 months of waiting for a transplant was in a coma five times. He could not work and when the transplant became available, he was within hours of dying. This participant shared, “It’s sort of a catch 22 thing with the liver transplant, because first you have to be the sickest person in the country to get that liver. Secondly, you can’t be so sick that you won’t survive the transplant.”</p>
            <p>One participant who had had blood transfusions in the late 1960s for a bleeding ulcer, almost 40 years later did not feel well and went to the doctor. Tests were conducted and confirmed that this participant had HCV. This participant had been worried as she was tired and had to wait 2 weeks for the test results. The reaction to being positive was described as “I went into quite a shock.” When describing the reaction, this participant said, “I am someone who always overcomes adversities and moves on. You have to. You are either born with it or not. But you have to have it.”</p>
            <p>For those participants who had undergone or were undergoing treatment, the struggle to get through the treatment and overcome the side effects was arduous. The side effects varied from individual to individual and included both physiological and psychological effects. One participant shared, “It was the hardest, truly the hardest thing I have ever experienced in my life. There were times I couldn’t walk. I did the whole year. There were times when my heart raced. My white blood cells were almost nil. I could hardly eat and I dropped so much weight. I had severe nightmares. I couldn’t sleep. Totally exhausted. One girl told me she ended up in a mental institution because of the treatment. It changes the way you think.”</p>
            <p>One participant who underwent treatment but did not clear the virus, talked about trying to overcome the mental issues afterwards. She shared, “I was having trouble concentrating and taking on tasks. I was suicidal at the end of my treatment. One of the counselors suggested that I get tested to see if there were any cognitive problems, and there were. My cognition has severely dropped.” Another participant who had endured 44 weeks of treatment, related that she thought the medication was going to kill her and that she ended up in hospital where the treatment was stopped. She knew she had not cleared the virus but wanted to continue as long as possible to try to bring her viral load down.</p>
            <p>Three of the participants were on methadone and part of their struggle was to maintain equilibrium and overcome their desire to use injecting drugs. One participant described staying off drugs. “I got clean before but it was different. I always had this reservation. I thought if I got my life in order, back together again, I could treat myself by getting high. Right now it’s different.” For another participant, the struggle to overcome drug addiction was foremost. This participant said, “I’ve been clean, off the heroin for 2 years now. It’s to kick the cocaine. I’m having a hard time. Now, I slip now and then. I’m trying hard but I’m using pot to stay away from that.”</p>
            <p>One participant, who had not undergone treatment, and who had struggled with the diagnosis alone for 2 years, noted that for the first couple of years with hepatitis C, I didn’t have any support. The only knowledge I had of it, was that it killed my mom. And the fact that I found that most of society has heard of hep C but they have no idea what it is. And when people think of it, they think it is only associated with drug users, but it’s not.</p>
            <p>For this participant, the struggle was to overcome the stigma associated with HCV infection. Also for this participant, part of the struggle to overcome the diagnosis, was the struggle to overcome obstacles to receiving treatment. The participant shared, “So, when I found out I had hepatitis C, my first question was when can I get treatment? I had watched my mom slowly die and I didn’t want my children to have that experience with me. I was told after some tests that my liver was too healthy to qualify for treatment. You cannot qualify for treatment until your liver starts to deteriorate. I am healthy, somewhat, and living with hepatitis C.”</p>
            <p>What was different for this participant, was that she felt she was struggling alone. She had written letters to government representatives and gone to the media with no success. This pattern of her struggling alone was unique to her as was the fact that she was a young mother.</p>

The second theme that emerged was transcending the illness, either through treatment or by not letting HCV be the sole focus of life. When discussing their patterns, participants started to gain new awarenesses of self-growth. In spite of the difficulty of receiving the diagnosis of HCV, coming to terms with the illness, and for some, undergoing an arduous course of treatment, all the participants began to move onto other phases of their lives. These movements could be considered <italic>choice points</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447567">Newman, 1994</xref>). One participant, not yet eligible for treatment, had moved onto another phase by returning to school, exercising regularly, ensuring adequate rest, and enjoying his family or as he said “Yes, I am feeling good, eating well, sleeping well, and exercising. Life is moving on better than before.”</p>
            <p>Another participant who had gone through treatment once but not cleared the virus, had been concerned about his ability to concentrate and previous depression, but stated that while he wanted to get rid of the virus, he did not know if he could be back on treatment so he had decided to manage his health in a more positive way. Another participant, who had also received treatment but not cleared the virus stated, “Life is good. I am happy. I am taking it a little easier than I have in the past. If I try to do too much, I get horribly confused. I can’t concentrate. So what is the point?”</p>
            <p>A participant, at the end of his treatment noted that “Things are a lot different this time. Before, I was pushed into doing things by other people. This time, I did everything on my own.” He had managed to stay off drugs for a year and to successfully complete the arduous treatment, and was focusing on reclaiming his health.</p>

            <title>Wanting to Give Back</title>
            <p>All of the participants demonstrated this theme in their changed lives. The participant who had had a liver transplant and a few months later had undergone the treatment noted that “every day is a bonus day.” He explained his work with the support group as important because after his experience he learned that “they put you on these drugs that are going to give you all these side effects, but if you get these side effects, too bad. You are on your own.” He became an advocate in support of people living with HCV.</p>
            <p>Another participant who had undergone treatment and cleared the infection said “I made a promise to somebody that if I cleared, that I would help other people. When I see people newly diagnosed, I know what they are going through. It is painful. It never leaves you, no matter what. Like I know people who have done treatment three times and still not cleared and they know what’s ahead for them.”</p>
            <p>One other participant, who in the course of the study became more active with the support group, noted that “it gives some perspective, it works, and helps establish relationships. So not only do we have HCV, but we can talk to family members which helps.”</p>
            <p>Several of the participants commented at the end of the study that one of the reasons they had wanted to participate, was to share with others to increase people’s understanding of what it meant to live with HCV. All of the participants were either supporting newly diagnosed people with HCV, or volunteering in their communities to demonstrate their commitment to changed patterns in their lives.</p>
            <p>For 2 of the 3 recovering injecting drug users, their volunteer service was part of their recovery and was also part of the legal community service recommended by the courts. While they valued their changed lives, one commented that “I’m trying hard. I’m trying to turn my life around but it’s hard. Very hard. But now I have this volunteer position, I have to keep myself straight.” The other participant commented that when he had finished treatment, he would like to become a child care worker. He said, “I remember what it was like as a child. I came from a broken home. I had a drug addict (alcoholic) father. I was an outcast at school, but I started to change my life. Yeah, it takes a lot of effort. I had to change so many things.” These patterns reflect resiliency, but also vulnerability and strengths, patterns that were reflected back to them.</p>

         <title>Discussion</title>
         <p>This study revealed the pain and complexity of living with HCV infection. One participant who had managed to receive federal government compensation for having become infected from contaminated blood noted that even though the money helped, it was not worth what she went through. These findings also supported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894318412447567">Sgorbini and colleagues’ (2009)</xref> research findings that showed that understanding the experience of living with HCV from the person’s perspective could lead to more effective nursing care. While the findings of this study are not transferable, they do provide nurses with an opportunity to reflect on the pain and complexity of living with HCV, and to engage in a mutual process of inquiry with similar clients to move toward health as expanding consciousness.</p>
         <p>Several of the participants in this study recalled their initial difficulty in finding healthcare professionals who really understood HCV infection and its meaning, and were willing to work with them. This is supported by other study findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447567">Hopwood, Treloar, &amp; Bryant, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447567">Richmond, Dunning, &amp; Desmond, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894318412447567">Sgorbini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894318412447567">Zickmund, Ho, Masuda, Ippolito, &amp; LaBrecque, 2003</xref>) that suggested a need for educating and sensitizing healthcare professionals about HCV infection. Further research exploring the experiences of different population groups living with chronic HCV infection could potentially lead to the delivery of more effective nursing care.</p>
         <p>As a result of pattern recognition, the expanding consciousness associated with understanding HCV infection was revealed by all the participants. They all moved on to a higher level of consciousness through transformative changes in their lives. The specific patterns of a person can serve as contributing to the general pattern. This is the generality in the specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447567">Newman, 1994</xref>). This seemingly paradoxical nature of pattern recognition once again reflects the unitary characteristics of Newman’s theory of health as praxis, which is integration of theory into practice. The experience of living with HCV infection did help the participants move beyond their difficulties to a greater appreciation for their lives, supporting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894318412447567">Young’s (1976)</xref> assumption that life is proceeding in the direction of higher consciousness.</p>
         <p>In the unitary transformative paradigm, the interaction between the researcher and the participant is dynamic, with both participants moving toward a higher level of consciousness in what Newman called an interpenetrating energy field. Both waves move in synchrony, encompassing the whole environment. The researcher’s experience in this research supported this holographic model, especially after the second interviews. The nurse researcher felt closely linked with each participant in a uniquely caring way.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Linking theory with practice using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447567">Newman’s (1994)</xref> perspective influenced the author’s perspective on living with HCV infection, and the synchrony, allowed her to understand what it was truly like to have and live with this complex illness, and yet to move beyond it. All the participants valued the chance to talk about those persons and patterns in their lives that had meaning for them, and 4 explicitly stated that they wanted their participation to inform others of what living with the chronic illness, hepatitis C, meant for them. Conducting this study was a truly humbling human experience. It was the moving beyond that represents humanness and resilience, and for that, each participant is thanked.</p>
