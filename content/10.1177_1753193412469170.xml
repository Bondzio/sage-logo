<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I read this short report with interest. The report highlights a potential complication of acupuncture needles. However, I would like to bring readers attention to two issues.</p>
<p>The authors describe the patient having loss of wrist and finger extension, with electromyography (EMG) confirming denervation of brachioradialis and extensor indicis. The sensory action potential in the superficial radial nerve was preserved. They propose that damage from an acupuncture point on the lateral aspect of the elbow correlates with a clinical picture of posterior interosseous nerve involvement. However, the motor loss described is more extensive than the posterior interosseous nerve alone, since there was complete loss of wrist extension and denervation of brachioradialis. The radial nerve branch to brachioradialis is given off about 6 cm proximal to the elbow before the division of the nerve into posterior interosseous and superficial radial branches. I would suggest that the patient may have had a partial radial nerve lesion, affecting the motor fascicles at the more proximal site (mid humerus) indicated in the illustration.</p>
<p>When discussing the mechanism of the nerve injury, the authors state, ‘This, together with the subsequent spontaneous recovery of the nerve, is suggestive of a progressive compressive neurapraxia, possibly by haematoma’. The use of the term ‘neurapraxia’ is incorrect. The EMG had shown denervation of the extensor muscles of the forearm indicating axonal degeneration. Therefore the nerve lesion was an axonotmesis and, indeed, the time of one year for recovery would be more consistent with that type of injury.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p><bold>Re: Sreedharan S., Lim A. Y. T., Puhaindran M. E. Posterior interosseous nerve palsy after needle acupuncture. J Hand Surg Eur. 2012, 37: 467–9</bold></p>
<p>We thank Mr Tim Hems for his interest and feedback on our letter.</p>
<p>Our patient’s complaint of burning sensation that began over the lateral aspect of the elbow joint, as well as clinical finding of intact sensation over the superficial radial nerve distribution, led us into suspecting posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) palsy. However, the sparing of brachioradialis and wrist extensors by the injury, as pointed out by Hems, suggests a lesion proximal to the PIN. Barring the possibility of any rare anatomic variations, we agree with Hems’ observation that the injury caused by the acupuncture needle is more likely to be a partial injury to the radial nerve, proximal to the PIN, sparing the sensory fascicles.</p>
<p>We also agree that the term ‘progressive compressive neurapraxia’ is incorrect in this clinical scenario; ‘progressive compressive neuropathy’ would be more appropriate.</p>
