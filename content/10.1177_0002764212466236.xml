<abstract>
<p>This article discusses labor outsourcing as the main form of precarious work in Indonesia. It is argued that demands for labor flexibility and the expansion of precarious work show that the state’s role in protecting workers is being cast aside as Indonesia’s peripheral position in global capitalism sees the state sponsoring a “labor flexibility regime.” Labor outsourcing was legalized in 2003 with the enactment of Labor Law No. 13/2003. That law came from an agreement between the government and the International Monetary Fund. Labor outsourcing is now widespread and has detrimental effects for workers and unions. Labor outsourcing practices have created a new actor in industrial relations: the labor agency. It has also created a highly complicated and difficult labor relations situation, fragmenting workers by work status and bringing harsh confrontations between labor unions and community members. Labor outsourcing practices have also presented tough challenges for the Indonesian labor movement in developing alternative strategies for organizing.</p>

<body>
<p>The 1997 Asian financial crisis brought economic and political chaos for Indonesia. The economy collapsed mainly due to a huge depreciation of the Indonesian rupiah and skyrocketing interest rates that caused many manufacturing companies to collapse. In the political sphere, the New Order regime under President Suharto, which lasted for three decades, ended and Indonesia quickly shifted from authoritarianism to a democratic regime. The crisis also set off a shift in the labor market and in employment relations as legal practices were changed to enhance labor market flexibility that liberal economists deemed a panacea for economic turbulence. Neoliberal economic ideology became entrenched and required: free market competition, limiting the state’s role in welfare, public service and social benefit, and facilitating the growth of private business with increased labor market flexibility.</p>
<p>For business and liberal economists, labor market flexibility—a strategy adopted by capital to minimize the negative impact of economic shocks basically by hiring and firing workers—is a necessary step to allow business to adapt more easily to economic shocks as the economy liberalizes and internationalizes. With enhanced labor market flexibility, it is argued that more investment will be forthcoming and create more employment opportunities. At the practical level, labor market flexibility disadvantages workers because it reduces job security and benefits, decreases wages and welfare, removes workers’ protection, and weakens unions and diminishes their influence. Labor market flexibility also triggers informalization processes in employment relations within the formal sector and thus degrades the defining characteristic of the formal sector in protection and regulation. Labor flexibility in the formal sector is significant because the sector is regarded as a sign of a “developed” economy and has been targeted by the Indonesian government for expansion. For workers, the formal sector has been seen as protected by government regulations on welfare and job security and thus was considered to provide workers with stable and decent work, especially when compared with unregulated informal employment. Flexible labor policy meant the following: erosion of benefits of formal sector jobs, a decrease in the quality of employment, and decreased employment opportunities.</p>
<p>Despite these major changes, the impact of labor flexibility on workers in the formal sector in Indonesia is still largely underresearched. The discussion on labor market flexibility has mostly related to its supposed importance in boosting investment and its role in employment creation. This article aims to present the experience of Indonesian workers in large-scale, factory-based export production under the labor market flexibility regime. It seeks to show how this regime leads to increasingly precarious employment and how it has affected workers’ conditions and trade union power. It will also analyze the role of the state in liberalizing the economy and supporting a flexibility regime that creates precarious work within the formal sector. The main argument of the article is that the state, as one of the actors constituting the labor flexibility regime, is sponsoring precarious work through its role in liberalizing industrial relations and through its weak performance in labor law enforcement.</p>
<p>The article is divided into four parts. The first part outlines Indonesia’s political economic profile and the nature of the labor policy before and after the Asian economic crisis. The second part describes the trends in labor outsourcing in the manufacturing industry and is based on a case study in the metals industry. The third part discusses government policies and performance regarding the labor flexibility regime, and the last part discusses the implications of flexible and precarious labor for the Indonesian labor movement.</p>

<title>Definitions</title>
<p>Labor outsourcing is a process of recruiting and controlling workers by using a labor agency. A company seeks a labor agency to recruit a number of workers to work for and at the premises of the company and shifts the responsibility for managing workers and providing their salary, benefits, and rights to the labor agency. Therefore an outsourced worker essentially has two employers: the management of the company for which she or he performs work and the labor agency that recruits and contracts her or him. Labor outsourcing is a term that has similar meanings to “dispatched worker” or “agency worker” in other countries. In business circles, labor outsourcing is known as “manpower outsourcing” to distinguish it from business process outsourcing, where a company subcontracts elements of production to another company. The 2003 Indonesian Manpower Law stipulates that only non-core-production functions can be outsourced and that subcontracted and outsourced workers can be hired only to carry out non-core-production activities. However, there is no clear distinction between core and non-core activities in the law (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0002764212466236">Manning &amp; Roesad, 2007</xref>). Outsourced workers always have a short-term contract ranging from 6 to 12 months and are only paid a basic wage and receive no additional benefits.</p>

<title>The Indonesian Setting</title>
<p>The Indonesian economy and labor market is characterized by the dual segmentation of the formal and informal sectors noted above. At the same time, there are dualities that are rural and urban and agriculture and nonagriculture. The informal economy is characterized by the so-called “nonstandard” jobs that are seen by the Western definition as part-time, temporary, seasonal, casual, own-account, self-employment, and multiple job-holding employment; unregulated, unprotected, insecure, low-wage, and low-productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764212466236">Arnold &amp; Bongiovi, 2013</xref> [this issue]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0002764212466236">Vosko, Zukewich, &amp; Cranford, 2003</xref>). Especially for the unskilled and the poor, these kinds of work are precarious work.</p>
<p>In Indonesia this kind of work officially includes casual agricultural and nonagricultural employment of persons who do not work permanently for other people, employers, or institutions, and have worked with more than one employer during the past month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764212466236">Matsumoto &amp; Verick, 2011</xref>). It also includes those who are self-employed or engaged in micro- and small-scale manufacturing, trade, and service sectors that are evident both in rural and urban areas. The Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) disaggregates the formal and informal sectors by a combination of employment status and employment type. Employment status is divided into categories of self-employed, the self-employed who are assisted by temporary/unpaid workers, employers, employees, casual employees in agriculture, casual employees not in agriculture, and unpaid workers. Employment type covers professionals, employees, agriculture workers, unskilled production and transport, and others. All employees, permanent workers and professionals, are defined as being in the formal sector. Formal and informal workers are also categorized by the job contract: Formal workers have a permanent or fixed-term contract or no contract at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764212466236">World Bank, 2010</xref>), whereas a written contract is not applied to informal workers. The majority of informal workers is in rural areas and does agricultural work and also includes those who are nonagricultural, or in petty trade and cottage industries (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764212466236">Manning, 1998</xref>). Urban informal workers tend to deal with sales, transportation, domestic service and construction works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0002764212466236">World Bank, 2010</xref>). Thus, the characteristics of precarious work are similar to those of the informal sector and are inherent in the work life and livelihood of most Indonesians. Precarious work not only characterizes informal employment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0002764212466236">Figure 1</xref>, it is also a characteristic of formal employment. This article emphasizes the growing precariousness of the formal sector through the implementation of a flexible labor market.</p>

<p>Since the 1970s, the proportion of workers in the informal sector has been increasing. Data show that in 1971 the proportion of the working population in the informal sector was 25%. In 1980 and 1990 the proportion rose to 36% and 42%, respectively. In 2000, it reached 65% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0002764212466236">Firnandy, 2003</xref>). Data from 2010 show that the proportion of informal workers is 65.76% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764212466236">BPS, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Informal workers are often poor with little education, and their employment is characterized by low productivity often due to the use of low technology, low income, and unstable jobs. Formal workers are those who attain higher levels of education and have more stable incomes and jobs.</p>
<p>Indonesia’s economically active population in 2011 was 117.4 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0002764212466236">BPS, 2011</xref>), which is comprised of 72.25 million males and 45.12 million females. The country’s Gini index since the 1970s until 2005 fluctuated between 0.3 and 0.35. In 2009 the Gini coefficient was 0.37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0002764212466236">CIA, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although it is experiencing rapid industrialization, Indonesia still relies on agriculture and the service sector for employment opportunities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0002764212466236">Table 1</xref>). Despite this, the manufacturing industry contributes 24.3% of GDP, whereas agriculture and the service sector contribute 14.7% and 13.8%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0002764212466236">BPS, 2012</xref>).</p>

<p>Prior to the economic crisis in 1997, Indonesia was considered a newly industrializing country in Asia and was praised by the World Bank as a rising economic star (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764212466236">Matsumoto &amp; Verick, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764212466236">Soekarni &amp; Syarifuddin, 2011</xref>). In addition to its strategic geographical location and an abundance of natural resources, Indonesia has a huge labor force. At that time Indonesia had high economic growth as the result of an extensive industrialization process under the repressive Suharto regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764212466236">Hadiz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0002764212466236">Manning, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002764212466236">Tjandraningsih, 2011</xref>). Indonesia came to be integrated into international production chains and became a world production base for footloose, labor-intensive manufacturing industry for internationally branded goods such as textile and clothing, sport shoes and apparel, electronics, food, and automobiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0002764212466236">White, 1993</xref>). The industrialization process saw substantial structural change as agriculture’s contribution to GDP declined and that of the industrial sector increased. Large numbers of rural agricultural workers were moving to the urban industrial sector to work in large-scale modern factories. They became a cheap and docile labor force often working in exploitative conditions (Masduki, 1986; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0002764212466236">Mather, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0002764212466236">Tjandraningsih et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0002764212466236">Yusuf, 1991</xref>). Under the repressive New Order regime, although wages were better than in the agricultural sector, factory workers had no freedom of association or expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0002764212466236">Hadiz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0002764212466236">Manning, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0002764212466236">Saptari, 2004</xref>). Within the span of the first 25-year long-term development plan (1969–1994), the economy grew at 6.8% annually, due largely to the contribution of the industrial sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0002764212466236">Soekarni &amp; Syarifuddin, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The discussion of precarious work in Indonesia in this article is focused within the formal sector where processes of “informalization” change work relations and working conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764212466236">Chang, 2009</xref>). This situation is consistent with a global shift in employment relations as observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0002764212466236">Chang (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0002764212466236">Standing (2011)</xref>. Chang demonstrates that, in many Asian countries, the informalization of the formal sector has been extensive, making employment relations unstable and often indirect. Standing has identified three forms of informalization: a movement into petty production activities with low productivity and income, firms informalizing employment by the use of subcontractors and outsourced workers, and the use of illegal forms of labor. The three forms have become institutionalized as the result of state policy and the relative absence of explicit state involvement (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0002764212466236">Arnold &amp; Bongiovi, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>While the informalization of employment relations in the formal sector is not a new phenomenon, its contemporary expansion is reinforced by globalized production and competition. For example, the use of subcontracting arrangements means that enterprises considered “formal” are now hiring workers as part-time or temporary workers and using outsourced workers and even accessing new “putting-out” networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0002764212466236">International Labour Organization [ILO], 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Precarious work in the formal sector in Indonesia has seen rapid expansion, becoming widespread in the labor-intensive industrial sector right after the enactment of the Manpower Law No. 13/2003 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764212466236">Juliawan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764212466236">Nugroho, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764212466236">Tjandraningsih, Herawati, &amp; Suhadmadi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764212466236">Tjandraningsih, Nugroho, &amp; Tjandra, 2008</xref>). The impact is that there are substantial challenges associated with the generation of sufficient regular and formal jobs.</p>

<title>The Flexibility Regime, Regional Autonomy, and Precarious Work</title>
<p>Basically the flexible labor market policy was meant to adjust the labor market to global competition and to liberalize the economy by removing labor market regulations that were perceived by businesses and economists as creating hindrances to investment as well as economic growth. A flexible labor market policy was one of the requirements set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, who stepped in to provide aid to the country’s economic recovery program following the economic crisis (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764212466236">Habibi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764212466236">Tjandraningsih &amp; Nugroho, 2008</xref>). The restructuring of the labor market was detailed in point 42 of the 21st Letter of Intent (LoI) between Indonesia and the IMF. It states,
<disp-quote>
<p>Establishing a sound framework for labor relations is central to generating employment, improving the welfare and skills of workers, and providing a stable environment for business. Following the major reform of the rights of association and union activity in 2000, modernization of complementary labor legislation relating to industrial relations has become a priority. A bill relating to labor protection has now been passed, and we are working closely with Parliament to ensure that the other bill in this area, on industrial dispute resolution, is enacted during the first half of 2003. We are working with labor and business to ensure that the laws strike an appropriate balance between protecting the rights of workers, including freedom of association, and preserving a flexible labor market. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0002764212466236">IMF, 2003</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The policy was contextualized as a key part of policies on improving investment climate. The LoI became a reference for policy formulation including regulations on improving investment climate which was then stated and emphasized in Law No. 13/2003 on Employment and also in the National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) 2004–2009, Chapter 23 on improving employment. This policy aimed to create more formal employment opportunities and to improve labor productivity. These objectives are to be achieved by improved employment regulations covering the recruitment process, outsourcing, wages, severance and “excessive” workers’ protection covered in the Presidential Instruction (<italic>Inpres</italic>) No. 3/2006 on the improvement of the investment climate and Presidential Instruction (<italic>Inpres</italic>) No. 1/2010 on the acceleration of national development priorities, including synchronization of employment policy with investment climate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764212466236">Tjandraningsih et al., 2010</xref>). The economic crisis meant that a business friendly investment climate became key to economic recovery. This came to be defined in terms of the ability to hire and fire workers more easily.</p>
<p>Labor flexibility is understood as a powerful regime, created through the collaboration by a range of actors, policies and institutions, which systematically work to “flexibilize” all aspects of production and employment relations in order to maximize capital’s profit making opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764212466236">Tjandraningsih &amp; Nugroho, 2008</xref>). A flexible production regime demands a workforce that is easily placed in different kinds of work, and where the number of workers can be varied according to the demands of the production cycle and requires workers to be multiskilled and able to multitask. The increasing use of casual and contract workers and of outsourcing ensures a labor force that is easily mobilized and demobilized. Within the workplace, capital and labor supply institutions and sometimes even unions form strategic alliances to promote flexibility; whereas at the national level, alliances involve the state, business interests, and other market-focused sections of society. The alliance between capital and the state is strategically significant as labor flexibility is negotiated between them and then supported by labor regulations formulated and implemented by instruments of the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764212466236">Tjandraningsih &amp; Nugroho, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The adoption of labor flexibility in Indonesia occurred in conjunction with the implementation of policies enhancing regional autonomy, meaning that industrial relations have become liberal, flexible <italic>and</italic> decentralized. Decentralization and regional autonomy was also a reform formulated with the IMF, and was implemented in 2004. Decentralization involved the transfer of responsibility for planning, management, revenue raising and allocation from the central government and its agencies to subordinate units of government and regional or functional authorities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764212466236">Colongon &amp; Arellano, 2003</xref>). With the enactment of Law No. 32/2004, local government had to bear responsibility for 11 areas of governance, including public works, education and culture, health, agriculture, transportation, the environment, land affairs, cooperatives, investment, trade and industry, and labor, all of which had previously been under the responsibility of the central government. One result of decentralization was the emergence of local state elites with considerable power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0002764212466236">Hadiz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0002764212466236">Hidayat, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0002764212466236">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In connection with the system of industrial relations, these decentralized policies brought with them jurisdiction over planning, managing, and controlling labor and human resources issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0002764212466236">Tjandraningsih, 2011</xref>) that had to be conducted by government officials who often had only limited skills, knowledge, and support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0002764212466236">Colongon &amp; Arellano, 2003</xref>). All of these factors led to ineffective delivery of policy and government service.</p>
<p>The principles of labor market flexibility and local autonomy have combined to reduce the state’s role in providing workers’ protection. There has been a shift from the protective, state-sponsored mechanisms of the tripartism of the authoritarian Suharto regime towards structures of negotiation that left labor out, the institutionalization of a dualistic labor market at the workplace level based on differential employment status (permanent employees versus others) promotes individualism at the expense of labor collectivism and curbs collective action. The result is increasing worker vulnerability, job insecurity, and economic uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764212466236">Tjandraningsih &amp; Nugroho, 2008</xref>). The situation is worsened by decentralization and regional autonomy where local government personnel lack the capacity and competence to effectively manage labor issues and problems or deal with powerful business interests.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0002764212466236">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>The labor flexibility regime has been implemented in Indonesia with little regard for the characteristics of the labor market and most especially the nonexistence of sufficient social safety nets to balance the negative consequences of the implementation of market flexibilities. It is often assumed within the discourse of the flexibility regime that workers have the capacity to shift between occupations and sectors. However, workers often do not have control over their labor, with the less skilled having the least control. As the experiences of Japan, Europe, and North America show, flexibility in work is available mostly to skilled labor and offers only a dead end for unskilled labor. Once involved, unskilled workers have little opportunity to move out of contract work into better employment, particularly in contexts where there is an oversupply of low-skilled labor. This problem is manifestly obvious in the labor markets of countries like Indonesia, which are characterized by a serious imbalance between skilled and unskilled labor, where still up to 60% of the workforce has attained only lower levels of education and only 5% has a university degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764212466236">Tjandraningsih &amp; Nugroho, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As will be shown in the following case study, the state’s performance, including poor law enforcement, is responsible for the spread of flexible and precarious employment.</p>

<title>Labor Outsourcing: A Metals Industry Case Study</title>
<p>Labor outsourcing has become widespread where formal sector companies from manufacturing to services have begun reducing their permanent workforces and replacing them with outsourced workers who are hired on short-term contracts from labor agencies. The practice of labor outsourcing meant that labor agencies became new actors in the industrial relations landscape. The practice of outsourcing made employment far more precarious; jobs were less secure, working conditions declined, welfare benefits were reduced, and trade unions were weakened.</p>
<p>There are few available statistics on the labor outsourcing in the formal sector. Despite apparent rapid expansion, the national labor force survey has not adjusted for this new employment status. There is only one available national-level study on casualization in the labor market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764212466236">Matsumoto &amp; Verick, 2011</xref>). The study shows that between 2001 and 2009, the share of casual employment in total employment more than doubled in manufacturing, utilities, and construction for men and in manufacturing and construction sectors for women. Overall, the proportion of casual workers in total employment increased from 6.7% in 2001 to 11.0% in 2009, before falling to 10.1% in 2010. The proportion of men employed on casual contracts increased the most over this period: from 7.3% in 2001 to 13.0% in 2009. Besides experiencing higher job insecurity, casual workers earn, on average, less than half the wages received by regular workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0002764212466236">Matsumoto &amp;Verick, 2011</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section5-0002764212466236">
<title>Contract and Outsourced Workers: Fragmented, Discriminated Against, and Exploited</title>
<p>In 2010, the author and colleagues completed a study under the auspices of AKATIGA—Center for Social Analysis, the Indonesia Metal Workers Federation (FSPMI), and Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, a German foundation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0002764212466236">Tjandraningsih et al., 2010</xref>). The study focused on the extent and practice of the flexible labor market in the manufacturing industry, and showed that since labor outsourcing was legalized in 2003, there are two main features in labor relations. First, there has been a trend of changing workers’ status from permanent to nonpermanent workers (who are contract and outsourced workers). Second, there is a new mode of recruitment and labor control using labor agencies. The study confirmed that labor outsourcing has brought detrimental effects to workers and has created complicated grounds for unions to be active and survive. Not only were unions losing members, but labor outsourcing has given rise to groups opposing unions. They are the group of <italic>preman</italic> or unemployed local men, local youth organizations, and informal leaders who act as labor agents to supply outsourced workers to companies that will be explained in more detail below. Furthermore, the study concluded that the new mode of labor relations is weakening the role of the state in managing industrial relations and in protecting workers.</p>
<p>This research was conducted at three of the most important industrial areas in three different provinces where Indonesia’s large- and medium-scale metals industry was located, surveying 600 workers from 249 companies. These industrial locations are the home of major foreign investments, mainly from Japan and South Korea.</p>
<p>Eighty-five percent of workers in the metals industry are younger than 35 years old; and approximately 30% are younger than 25 years old, with a senior high school education. They consist of single as well as married workers.They work at the lowest rank of production in their companies, and although they do the same tasks, they have three different kinds of employment: permanent workers (40%), contract workers (37%), and outsourced workers (23%).</p>
<p>Labor agencies are a new kind of business and have turned out to be a lucrative one. The result is that there has been a boom in the establishment of labor agency companies. In the research locations, labor agencies operated as legally registered businesses, and there were also some operated by formal and informal community leaders, groups of local ruffians and thugs, and training institutions. There are also agencies owned or run by union activists, retired or active officers of the local state’s Office of Manpower, members of parliament, and so on. Some labor agencies work professionally, but many treated the business as a gold mine and aimed only to supply as many workers as possible and disregarded workers’ rights. The fees received by agencies are detailed in the following section.</p>
<p>Although there is no reliable data on the number of labor agencies, the use of a labor agency by medium and large companies, both foreign and domestic, to recruit workers has expanded in the last 5 to 6 years to serve the demand from traditional clients in the mining and construction industry, but also to serve new clients from the manufacturing and service sector. Various estimates suggest that there are now thousands of labor agencies operating nationwide, particularly in industrial areas. In our research locations alone, there are no less than 300 registered labor agencies.</p>
<p>The role of labor agencies has changed recruitment in most companies. There is no longer a direct application to a company, as workers have to send applications to or seek a job through a labor agency. The labor agency will usually enter a contract to supply workers to a particular company and then recruit workers with the qualifications required by the company. The company pays a management fee to the labor agency on a person per month basis, and at the same time the agency’s outsourced workers will have to pay a certain amount to get the job contract from the agency in the first place and then to get any extension of the contract or perhaps even to keep the job. The workers sign an employment contract with the labor agency that includes the duration of the contract and the wage to be received. Once the necessary paper work is done, the workers are then sent to the company to work.</p>
<p>At the factory level, the differing practices of permanent working relations and contract working relations lead workers to become fragmented from each other based on their respective work statuses. Within a factory, permanent, contract, and outsourced workers are usually able to be identified by their uniforms’ colors. Outsourced workers from different recruiting agencies also wear different colored uniforms. This differentiation leads to stratification and social distance within the factory’s workforce, and it also affects their solidarity and common awareness as a group of workers.</p>
<p>The main differences among these different groups lie in the duration of work, workers’ rights, and job security. As the holder of the highest status among workers, permanent workers enjoy a full wage, benefits, and other workers’ rights. Contract workers get fewer benefits, and outsourced workers have the least rights and benefits.</p>
<p>The employment of contract and outsourced workers brings at least three types of discrimination among workers: age and marital status, wages, and the right to organize. Discrimination based on age and marital status occurs as companies prefer to employ outsourced workers aged between 18 and 24 years old and who are single. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0002764212466236">Table 2</xref>, the same hierarchy exists when it comes to wages. On average, contract workers’ and outsourced workers’ wages are substantially lower than those of permanent workers. Discrimination on the right to organize occurs when contract and outsourced workers are directly or indirectly forbidden from joining any trade union. Those who violate this policy bear the risk that their working contract will be terminated or not extended.</p>

 <p>Discrimination of outsourced workers is exacerbated by exploitation, by the agency and the company where they work. In addition to paying certain amounts of money to get a job, many workers are also asked to pay the agency some percentage of their monthly wage. When a contract is terminated, workers will have to pay the agency in order to obtain another contract to work at the same factory or at any other factory. As mentioned above, a labor agency will be paid a management fee by the contracting company derived from a per worker price ranging from US$10 to $35 per month. That means that when an agency supplies 300 workers with a 1-year-long contract, it will gain, at the minimum, around US$36,000 a year. On top of the management fee, some labor agencies also take other fees from the workers. To get a job, a worker will have to pay an amount between US$58 up to $700 to an agency for a 1-year contract with a monthly wage of US$127.</p>
<p>Companies change workers’ status from permanent to nonpermanent purposely and with the aim of reducing labor costs and to remove the responsibility of providing employment benefits to workers. Almost all of the costs of managing workers are shifted to the agency. This innovation has significantly changed the composition of workers from permanent to nonpermanent. In fact, the study shows that permanent workers are no longer characteristic of the working class in the metals sector. It is also estimated that only around 40% to 50% of workers in many manufacturing and service companies in Indonesia hold permanent employment. The majority of workers are now precarious, nonpermanent workers, and it seems that permanent workers are the minority in the formal sector. With no national statistics, anecdotal information suggests that the percentage of short-term contract and outsourced workers reach up to 70% in individual companies, and in one case of an export garment factory, all of its 2,300 young workers—most of them recently graduated high school girls—are engaged in short-term contracts of 1 or 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0002764212466236">Tjandraningsih &amp; Herawati, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The decreasing number of permanent workers is clearly related to the decline of union membership because permanent workers have traditionally formed the base of union membership. As these workers are shifted to contracts or to employment agencies or replaced by workers with contracts and who are agency-employed, unions lose members. This is further exacerbated by the fact that contract and outsourced workers are necessarily moving between firms and even industrial sectors, reducing their capacity for any form of collective action.</p>

<title>The Role of the State in Precarious Work</title>
<p>The implementation of labor flexibility in the metals sector that has become the norm of employment relations and its subsequent negative impact on workers owes much to the government’s attitude towards its regulations. The study found many violations of existing state laws and regulations on labor agencies and contract and outsourced workers; in fact, there was essentially no law enforcement. The violations noted in the study included the employment of contract and outsourced workers in core production processes, which is forbidden by the law; and the operation of labor agencies that are informal and nonincorporated companies, when the law requires that they be incorporated. Also, the companies that employ outsourced workers did not provide the flow of production process as required by the law, and the multiple extensions of work contracts are restricted by the law. These violations are significant and widespread and turn out to be the norm rather than exceptions. Unfortunately, there have been no firm measures by Office of Manpower and Transmigration (OMT) authorities to ensure that the law is followed. The authorities generally tolerate such violations. They argue that the violations are so massive and widespread that being too strict on the companies will risk capital flight by foreign companies. Moreover, officials worry about the legal basis of strict enforcement and the resulting sanctions.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is clear that the laws and regulations are poorly formulated and that this has caused differing interpretations and disputes between unions, companies, labor agencies, and OMT personnel in defining proper implementation of the regulations. At the same time, the poor performance of local government personnel has worsened these disputes. Workers and unions have long been complaining of the poor performance of the OMT and its failures on law enforcement. As noted above, the decentralization policy has handed labor and industrial relations issues to local government. This change means that local OMT offices are no longer directly responsible to the Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration but to the district’s head. One important consequence of this was in the placement of labor inspectors, who are now recruited from other sections of local government offices such as those previously working as public order officers (<italic>Satpol PP</italic>), supervisors at traditional markets, staff at district animal husbandry and gardening offices, general affairs district inspectors, and so on. Clearly, they have minimum competence on industrial relations issues. Additionally, there are relatively few labor inspectors for the number of companies that need supervision. Hence, the performance of the OMT offices has been poor and law enforcement has been weak.</p>
<p>These circumstances and the inactivity of the OMTs on violations is a reflection of the national government’s approach to creating a “friendly business environment” to attract foreign investment. Its view is that increased foreign investment will create more employment opportunities and alleviate poverty. The government considers that attracting foreign investment requires the implementation of labor market flexibility. This position demonstrates the state’s commitment to neoliberal economic policy as a way to serve the needs of capital and to step away from its role of protecting workers as a requirement of the policy. This situation is further complicated as Indonesia has insufficient social security measures in place to mitigate the implementation of flexible labor market policies.</p>

<sec id="section7-0002764212466236">
<title>The Predicament Faced by Unions</title>
<p>Flexible employment has been opposed by unions. In part, this is because of the negative impacts the flexible employment regime has on unions. Most notably, it is believed that fewer workers are interested in joining unions when they are contract or outsourced workers. The study found that not a single outsourced worker became a union member and that only a small proportion of contract workers were members. Union members remain predominantly permanent workers. The study revealed the reasons behind the reluctance of contract and outsourced workers to become union members, finding that this was mostly related to their fear of losing a job. They fear that if it is known that they are union members, their jobs will be terminated or their contract will not be extended. The study confirms earlier findings that the labor flexibility regime reduces the role of unions by the additional control employers maintain over contract and outsourced workers by the very precariousness of this kind of employment. Rather, workers are forced to choose between being a union member or being employed (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0002764212466236">Tjandraningsih et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Besides losing members, unions also have to deal with other community members when they try to prevent the expansion of the use of outsourced workers. Various efforts of plant-level unions to prevent companies from recruiting outsourced workers have had damaging consequences, such as pitting unions against communities when work is terminated. Desperate job seekers face fierce competition to find jobs. In recent years, an attitude that “any job is better than being jobless” has become embedded. This attitude is shared by the parents of jobseekers and when unions work to prevent employers from expanding the use of outsourced workers, even pointing to unjust treatment, results in the unions being considered as an enemy. In addition, unions have to deal with other community groups that have emerged since the decentralization process began, including formal and informal local leaders, activists, and thugs who have taken the role as labor agencies. Such groups will normally be unhappy with any union’s position to limit or end labor outsourcing because it may ruin their own business as labor agencies. To add to this difficult situation, some union activists also take part in the labor agency business, recruiting and supplying outsourced workers to their companies.</p>
<p>This is indeed a complicated situation for unions because it reduces the popularity of unions and the union movement among the working class. Fewer workers are interested in joining unions, and therefore the unions have less power and influence. Local and plant-level unions are thus struggling to find ways to overcome the problems and injustices posed by the flexible employment regime.</p>
<p>A common union’s stance is to mobilize pressure to have the government take serious action on the damaging impacts of flexible employment for workers and to demand clear and effective regulations on this matter. Since 2006 there has been tension and debate around the government’s efforts to revise the Employment Law that would also include the regulation of labor outsourcing. In this case, at least initially, trade union activity has been effective, and the government has had to delay the revision of the law until 2013. In January 2012, the Constitutional Court decided that the articles on labor outsourcing in the 2003 Employment Law were unconstitutional and has demanded the limitation of outsourced work and the protection of outsourced workers. In response, the Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration is preparing to issue a revised regulation. Unions are keeping a close eye on the process.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The employment of contract and outsourced workers, usually with poor working conditions and job and income insecurity, is seeing increasing numbers of workers trapped in precarious circumstances. The few available studies confirm that flexible work brings significant disadvantages to workers and unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0002764212466236">AKATIGA-TURC-LabSosio UI, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0002764212466236">Habibi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0002764212466236">Juliawan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0002764212466236">Nugroho, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0002764212466236">Tjandraningsih &amp; Nugroho, 2008</xref>) and that the expansion of flexible employment in Indonesia has brought negative impacts not only for labor relations but also more broadly. The flexible labor regime limits employment opportunities for older yet productive members of the labor force, triggers social conflict among community members, reduces worker’s rights and protection, injects the process of informalization into the formal sector, reduces the quality of life, encourages corruption and exploitation, and leads to labor market distortion.</p>
<p>Much rethinking is needed in dealing with the changes in the world of work and working conditions that have occurred due to the implementation of labor flexibility. It is obvious that flexibilization and precarious work are challenging various ILO slogans of decent work and antidiscrimination as well as its conventions to protect workers. Trades unions are now at a critical juncture, just a few years after receiving the freedom to operate in 1998. They need to develop new strategies for recruiting members and responding to the flexible labor market.</p>
