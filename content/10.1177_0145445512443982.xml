<abstract>
<p>Among young adults and clinical populations, perceived inability to control internal and external events is associated with anxiety. At present, it is unclear what role perceived anxiety control plays in anxiety among older adults. The Anxiety Control Questionnaire (ACQ) was developed to assess one’s perceived ability to cope with anxiety-related symptoms, reactions, and external threats but has limited psychometric support for use with older adults. Psychometric evaluations of other measures often reveal that factor structures differ among older adults compared with other age groups. The present study examined the factor structure of the ACQ in a sample of community-dwelling older adults in an attempt to understand the construct of perceived anxiety control in this population. A total of 135 adults aged 60 to 94 completed the ACQ and a demographics questionnaire. An exploratory factor analysis was accomplished using maximum likelihood extraction with equamax rotation. Parallel analysis indicated that a four-factor structure be retained. The four-factor solution explained 40.80% of variance and provided a good fit to the data. The four factors were Internal Control, External Lack of Control, Internal Lack of Control, and Effective Coping. Each factor contained an adequate number of items and had good internal consistency. The four-factor solution suggests that a previous recommendation to shorten the ACQ, based on factor analysis with young adults, may be imprudent for older adults. The authors also discuss implications for the understanding of perceived anxiety control among older adults and assessment of anxiety in older adults.</p>

<body>
<p>Anxiety disorders are more than twice as prevalent as mood disorders among adults aged 65 and older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445512443982">Gum, King-Kalimanis, &amp; Kohn, 2009</xref>). Late life anxiety is associated with greater medical care costs compared with young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145445512443982">Marciniak et al., 2005</xref>), more disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145445512443982">Brenes et al., 2008</xref>), and lower well-being for older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145445512443982">De Beurs et al., 1999</xref>). Although it is evident that anxiety disorders are prevalent and impairing mental disorders for older adults, few studies have examined individual factors that maintain anxiety symptoms among older adults. The prevalence of anxiety disorders appears to decline with increased age (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145445512443982">Gum et al., 2009</xref>); however, it is not clear what factors may perpetuate anxiety among older adults who continue to experience clinically significant anxiety.</p>
<p>Anxiety is hypothesized to be maintained via a cognitive-affective process in which one perceives that potentially negative or harmful events and emotions are unpredictable and uncontrollable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145445512443982">Barlow, 2002</xref>). One’s perceived sense of control over the predictability of one’s emotions and/or harmful events may affect the extent to which one experiences anxiety (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145445512443982">Stapinski, Abbott, &amp; Rapee, 2010</xref>). There are several measures of perceived control such as Rotter’s Locus of Control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145445512443982">Rotter, 1966</xref>), but few measures are specific to anxiety. For example, Rotter’s Locus of Control is limited due to its measurement of an individual’s general perception of whether reinforcement is under one’s own control (internal) or under the control of the environment (external; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145445512443982">Rotter, 1975</xref>). Thus, a more specific measure was developed to examine perceived control over anxiety-related thoughts and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee, Craske, Brown, &amp; Barlow, 1996</xref>). This particular subconstruct of perceived control, an individual’s perceived control over emotional reactions and external threats related to anxiety, was examined and termed perceived anxiety control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess perceived anxiety control, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee and colleagues (1996)</xref> developed the Anxiety Control Questionnaire (ACQ), a 30-item self-report measure with face valid items that assess perceived control over internal and external events related to anxiety. Psychometric properties of the ACQ have been examined in several different samples. Internal consistency was adequate for the ACQ total scale with α = .81 for psychiatric inpatients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445512443982">Lang &amp; McNiel, 2006</xref>), .87 for anxiety clinic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee et al., 1996</xref>), .87 to .92 for young, mostly university student samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445512443982">Gould &amp; Edelstein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512443982">Zebb &amp; Moore, 1999</xref>), and .88 for community-dwelling older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445512443982">Gould &amp; Edelstein, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, test-retest reliability was good in a sample of undergraduate students, ranging from <italic>r</italic> = .88 for a 1-week period to .82 for a 1-month period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee et al., 1996</xref>). Convergent validity was demonstrated in a mixed sample of anxiety clinic patients, undergraduate students, and males with erectile disorders from a specialty clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee et al., 1996</xref>) as the strongest relation was observed between the ACQ and the Locus of Control of Behavior Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145445512443982">Craig, Franklin, &amp; Andrews, 1984</xref>). Discriminant validity was demonstrated as perceived anxiety control was moderately related with measures of anxiety, depression, and stress in a mixed sample of anxiety clinic patients, undergraduate students, and patients with erectile disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee et al., 1996</xref>) and in a sample of psychiatric inpatients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445512443982">Lang &amp; McNiel, 2006</xref>). Weaker relations were found among the ACQ and measures of quality of life in the inpatient sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145445512443982">Lang &amp; McNiel, 2006</xref>). In addition, the ACQ was weakly associated with age among undergraduate students but not associated with age among anxiety clinic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee et al., 1996</xref>). Thus, good reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity has been demonstrated for the ACQ in a variety of samples.</p>
<p>In contrast, examinations of the ACQ’s factor structure have yielded conflicting findings. In the initial psychometric examination of the ACQ, a principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted with data from two samples: a sample of anxiety clinic patients and a combined sample of clinic patients and university students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee et al., 1996</xref>). Using an oblique rotation, two- to four-factor solutions were attempted, and the two-factor solution was selected. The authors indicated that the two-factor solution had two meaningful factors based on the included items: “perceived control over internal emotional reactions and perceived control over external events” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee et al., 1996</xref>, p. 289). The two factors, control over external events and control over internal events, accounted for 31.6% of the variance. Items that did not load onto either factor were excluded, which yielded the authors’ 30-item ACQ. Although the two-factor solution was deemed more interpretable than other factor solutions (i.e., three- or four-factor solutions) due to the items included on the two factors, the authors cautioned against using the factors as two separate subscales without further research on the ACQ.</p>
<p>Following the initial examination of the ACQ, several independent researchers examined the psychometric properties of the ACQ. In a sample of university students, the psychometric properties and factor structure of the ACQ were examined using variamax and oblique rotations in PCA to account for the correlation among the two factors (<italic>r</italic> = .60) found by Rapee and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512443982">Zebb &amp; Moore, 1999</xref>). A three-factor solution accounting for 36.6% of the variance was found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512443982">Zebb &amp; Moore, 1999</xref>). The authors concluded that the factor structure reflected the wording of the ACQ items because two factors that pertained to the absence of perceived control included reverse-scored items and the third factor represented the presence of perceived control. These findings may also have been due to the use of a nonclinical sample that had a larger range of perceived anxiety control compared with clinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512443982">Zebb &amp; Moore, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>In the third examination of the ACQ factor structure, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) followed by a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted in a large sample of patients from an anxiety disorders clinic and a sample of undergraduate students who served as a nonclinical comparison group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512443982">Brown, White, Forsyth, &amp; Barlow, 2004</xref>). Initially, a three-factor solution was found in the clinical sample. Prior to the second EFA, seven items that did not load on any one factor were removed. Following the second EFA, five items not loading on any factors and three items measuring the management of social impressions were removed. In the third EFA, a three-factor solution was found that explained 49% of the variance. The three factors were termed Emotion Control, Threat Control, and Stress Control. The three-factor structure using EFA and CFA models was replicated in both clinical and student samples. Brown and colleagues recommended that future studies use the shortened, 15-item revised ACQ (ACQ-R). Although the study was psychometrically sound and had a large sample (&gt;1,000 anxiety patients), it may be premature to recommend the ACQ-R for use in all samples. The clinical sample appeared to have a large age range (18 to 75), but the average age was only 33 years. More research with older adults is needed before recommending the ACQ-R for use with all samples.</p>
<p>The experience of anxiety differs with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145445512443982">Bryant, 2010</xref>), but little is known about whether strategies used to control anxiety vary across the life span. An examination of perceived anxiety control among older adults would provide information about potential differences in how older adults control their anxiety compared with young adults. One important step in examining control over anxiety in late life is to have psychometrically sound measures, but at this time, the ACQ has limited psychometric support for use with older adults. In the present study, we examined the factor structure of the 30-item ACQ in a sample of community-dwelling older adults to provide additional psychometric support for use of the ACQ with older adults. Psychometric evaluations of other measures have revealed that factor structures differ among older adults compared with other age groups. For example, a measure of problematic worry, the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145445512443982">Meyer, Miller, Metzger, &amp; Borkovec, 1990</xref>), was found to have a different factor structure in older adult samples due to the inclusion of many reverse-scored items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445512443982">Hopko et al., 2003</xref>). Before eliminating ACQ items as recommended by Brown and colleagues, it is important to examine the 30-item construct of perceived anxiety control in the older adult population, as conceptual equivalence across age groups has not been established.</p>

<title>Anxiety Control Questionnaire</title>
<p>The ACQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee et al., 1996</xref>) is a 30-item self-report measure assessing one’s perceived ability to control anxiety-provoking situations and emotional reactions to these situations. Each item is rated on a Likert-type scale from 0 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>). In addition to a total score, the ACQ yields two subscale scores: control over internal reactions and control over external events; these subscales are based on the factor analysis by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee and colleagues (1996)</xref>.

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The present study was part of two larger studies examining anxiety among older adults. We recruited participants from local senior centers, independent living facilities, and doctor’s offices, as well as through television ads and university intranet announcements. Interested participants were either mailed a survey packet or handed a survey packet in person. The survey packet contained the consent form and questionnaires. The consent form was presented first, which delineated the purposes, risks, benefits, and procedures for the study. Then, participants completed the ACQ and a demographics questionnaire. Participants mailed the completed questionnaires and consent form to the researchers in a preaddressed, prestamped return envelope. Compensation for participation was either US$5 given at the time the surveys were mailed or entry into a raffle for a US$75 cash prize.</p>

<title>Handling of Missing Data</title>
<p>For the 135 participants who completed at least 70% of the surveys, missing scale items were imputed by determining each participant’s mean for the items on the scale. Because less than 5% of the data was missing, mean imputation is considered an appropriate data replacement strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445512443982">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0145445512443982">
<title>Preliminary Analyses</title>
<p>The mean ACQ total score was 98.04 (<italic>SD</italic> = 20.71), with scores ranging from 36 to 142. Mean scores for older adults were comparable to mean scores for undergraduate college students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512443982">Zebb and Moore (1999)</xref> reported a mean of 95.42 (<italic>SD</italic> = 18.99), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee and colleagues (1996)</xref> reported a mean of 96.1 (<italic>SD</italic> = 18.9) for college students. The mean ACQ scores for older adults in this study was higher than anxiety-disordered samples (e.g., <italic>M</italic> = 73.8, <italic>SD</italic> = 21.2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee et al., 1996</xref>), suggesting that older adults have greater perceived anxiety control than individuals with anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>Bartlett’s test of sphericity was good, χ<sup>2</sup>(435, <italic>N</italic> = 135) = 1672.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. Kaiser’s measure of sampling adequacy was .80, of which values greater than .60 are required for a good factor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445512443982">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>). Corrected item-total correlations ranged from .17 to .63 (<italic>M</italic> = .43). Although six items had corrected item-total correlation coefficients less than .30, a sufficient number of corrected item-total correlations exceeded .30, which indicates that these items are factorable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145445512443982">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0145445512443982">
<title>Exploratory Factor Analysis</title>
<p>We used maximum likelihood extraction with equamax rotation to explore the factor structure of the ACQ. An equamax rotation was used because it is regarded as a compromise between variamax rotation (which attempts to make as many values in each factor column to be as close to zero as possible) and quartimax rotation (which attempts to make as many values in each row to be as close to zero as possible; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145445512443982">Abdi, 2003</xref>). To determine the number of factors to retain, we used parallel analysis. Parallel analysis is a statistical procedure that determines the break in the scree plot. Several random samples based on the actual data are generated, and for each random sample, the parallel analysis procedure calculates eigenvalues. In the present study, we generated 1,000 random data sets. As recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445512443982">Hayton, Allen, &amp; Scarpello, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145445512443982">O’Connor, 2000</xref>), parallel analyses were conducted twice, first generating mean eigenvalues and then 95th percentile eigenvalues. The number of actual eigenvalues (i.e., those generated from the actual data set) larger than the mean and 95th percentile eigenvalues indicates the number of factors to retain.</p>
<p>Parallel analyses indicted that four factors should be retained, and Chi-square goodness-of-fit analysis revealed that the four-factor solution fit the data, χ<sup>2</sup>(321, <italic>N</italic> = 135) = 466.58, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The first four eigenvalues were 7.39, 3.56, 1.84, and 1.73, and these factors accounted for a substantial amount of variance (40.80%).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The primary objective of the present study was to examine the factor structure of the ACQ with an older adult sample in light of previous research demonstrating age-related differences in the factor structure of assessment instruments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445512443982">Hopko et al., 2003</xref>). The present results revealed a four-factor solution for the ACQ that was a good fit to the data. The four-factor structure obtained in the present study differed from the two-factor structure obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee et al. (1996)</xref>, the three-factor structure obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512443982">Zebb and Moore (1999)</xref>, and the three-factor structure obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512443982">Brown et al. (2004)</xref>.</p>
<p>The present results differed from those of previous studies in terms of the number of factors obtained and also in terms of the factor loadings and nature of the items comprising each of the factors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee et al. (1996)</xref> obtained two factors, which the authors labeled External Control Over Events and Internal Control Over Emotional Reactions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512443982">Zebb and Moore (1999)</xref> found three factors, which appear conceptually similar to those identified by Rapee: Helplessness Over External Events, Helpless Over Internal and External Events, and Internal Locus of Anxiety Control. The comparison with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512443982">Brown et al. (2004)</xref> is difficult because the authors generated three-, four-, and five-factor solutions with “acceptable model fit” but did not describe these initial solutions. By dropping items with nonsalient loadings based on a series of analyses, their final model included three factors: Emotion Control, Threat Control, and Stress Control. Although each of these studies extracted a different number of factors, some of the factors are conceptually similar across studies. The item content of the Threat Control factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512443982">Brown et al., 2004</xref>) was similar to External Lack of Control in the present study, External Control Over Events in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee et al. (1996)</xref> study, and Helplessness Over External Events in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512443982">Zebb and Moore (1999)</xref> study. There was similar overlap on what appears to be internal control in each of the four studies (i.e., Internal Control and Internal Lack of Control, present study; Internal Control Over Emotional Reactions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee et al., 1996</xref>; Internal Locus of Anxiety Control, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512443982">Zebb &amp; Moore, 1999</xref>; and Emotion Control, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512443982">Brown et al., 2004</xref>). Although each study yielded different numbers of factors with different items loadings, some factors appear to be conceptually similar across studies (e.g., internal control, external control).</p>
<p>The present study revealed one additional factor, namely, Effective Coping. This factor comprised five items that addressed the ability to cope with anxiety and difficult situations. Four of the five items included a qualitative element not identified in the previous studies, that is, these four items conveyed a degree of certainty over the extent to which the individual can cope with stressful situations (e.g., “Know how I will react in situations,” “Confident in ability to cope,” “Not sure how I will react under stress,” “Can make sure people like me”). Three of these items loaded on the Internal Control over Emotional Reactions factor in the Rapee et al. study, two items loaded on the Internal Locus of Anxiety Control factor of the Zebb and Moore study, and one item (“Not sure how I will react under stress”) loaded on the Stress Control factor in the Brown et al. study. Consequently, the Effective Coping factor may be a unique component of anxiety control among older adults.</p>
<p>The most important comparison is between the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512443982">Brown et al. (2004)</xref>, and the present study, as Brown et al., provided a compelling methodological critique of the previous studies and incorporated a more sophisticated and arguably better series of analyses that resulted in their 15-item scale with three factors. Several items that were retained with the older adult sample of the present study were dropped in the 15-item Brown et al. version of the ACQ. This finding and other differences between the present findings and those of Brown et al. raise concerns about the adequacy of the 15-item ACQ in capturing the construct of anxiety control in older adults. For example, in the present study, eight items loaded onto the Internal Control factor, but only four of these items were retained by Brown et al. These included items that measured one’s ability to put worrisome thoughts out of mind, influence threatening situations, control level of anxiety, and relax when desired. Consequently, the 15-item scale of Brown et al. does not appear to capture four aspects (i.e., factors) of older adult anxiety control, which could suggest diminished content validity of the 15-item ACQ (i.e., ACQ-R) for older adults. Items retained by Brown et al., and which did not load adequately in the present study, measure how well one copes with difficult situations depending on whether one has outside help, certainty regarding how one will react under stress, and the extent to which events outside one’s control make one anxious.</p>
<p>Our principal concern is that items that characterize anxiety control for older adults based on our analyses were dropped, whereas others that failed to load adequately with older adults in the present study were retained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512443982">Brown et al. (2004)</xref>. The retention of these items suggests that the 15-item ACQ proposed by Brown et al. assesses features of anxiety control that are not relevant to older adults, though this issue is arguably less important than the failure to retain important items for older adults. In light of the foregoing, the construct of anxiety control may not be best captured by the 15 items from the original 30-item ACQ that were retained by Brown et al.</p>
<p>The difference in factor structure was not entirely unexpected in light of previous research revealing age-related differences in the factor structure of measures of various constructs (e.g., intelligence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145445512443982">Berger, Bernstein, Klein, Cohen, &amp; Lucas, 1996</xref>; worry, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145445512443982">Hopko et al., 2003</xref>). The present results suggest that the construct of anxiety control is not invariant across the life span. The four-factor structure revealed in the present study may better capture the meaning of anxiety control for older adults than the factor structures obtained with younger populations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512443982">Brown et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512443982">Zebb &amp; Moore, 1999</xref>). It is noteworthy that older adults’ average scores on the ACQ in the present study were similar to young adults’ scores from previous studies, yet the factor structures differed. This finding provides additional evidence that, though different age groups may score similarly on the measure, the conceptualization of anxiety control differs for older and young adults. Similarly, four items of the ACQ had nonsalient loadings on any of the four factors in the present study, suggesting that these items do not adequately capture anxiety control among older adults. In addition, these results, coupled with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512443982">Brown et al. (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512443982">Zebb and Moore (1999)</xref>, suggest that the construct of anxiety control is likely not unidimensional for adults and older adults, as originally conceived by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee et al. (1996)</xref>.</p>
<p>Several reasons may account for the differential findings across studies. These differences may, in part, be explained by previous research demonstrating differences in how emotions are experienced (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145445512443982">Gross, 2007</xref>) or controlled (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445512443982">Blanchard-Fields, Stein, &amp; Watson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145445512443982">Carstensen, Fung, &amp; Charles, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145445512443982">Gould &amp; Edelstein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145445512443982">John &amp; Gross, 2004</xref>) by young and older adults. For example, older adults experience less brain activation and less physiological arousal in response to emotion stimuli when compared with younger individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145445512443982">Charles &amp; Carstensen, 2007</xref>). In addition, older adults are more likely to avoid anger-provoking situations through the use of passive emotion-regulation strategies than young and middle-aged adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145445512443982">Blanchard-Fields et al., 2004</xref>), and older adults tend to use a wider range of emotion-regulation strategies than younger age groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145445512443982">Charles &amp; Carstensen, 2007</xref>). Therefore, anxiety control among older adults may reflect age-related changes in how emotions (e.g., anxiety) are experienced and consequently, which emotion-regulation or control strategies are needed.</p>
<p>Inconsistencies in findings across studies of ACQ factor structure could also be attributed to differences in participant characteristics among the studies. The other studies used participants of different ages (all younger than participants in the present study) and with characteristics different from the present study (e.g., young students, anxiety-disordered adults). Thus, the factor structure found in the present study may be attributed to the use of an older adult sample.</p>
<p>Another possible reason for the differences in factor structures across studies is the nature of the analyses used. Exploratory factor analyses were performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee and colleagues (1996)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512443982">Zebb and Moore (1999)</xref>, and in the present study, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512443982">Brown et al. (2004)</xref> used CFA. EFA was used in the present study because the goal of the study was to determine the factor structure without consideration of the conceptualization of anxiety control by Rapee et al. or the number of factors obtained with their young adult samples. To the extent possible, we were starting over with the examination of these items. EFA was deemed appropriate as an initial evaluation of the scale without making assumptions about the nature of the anxiety control construct with older adults and without formulating hypotheses about the number of factors that would be extracted (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145445512443982">Floyd &amp; Widaman, 1995</xref>). A CFA would have required a conceptual, theoretical, or empirical basis for a factor structure, which has not yet been established with older adults. Use of CFA would have required us to test a factor structure that likely was driven by data obtained with younger adults, which may be inaccurate for older adults.</p>
<p>A final methodological difference among the studies noted above that could have contributed to the differences in factor structures is the method used to determine the number of factors prior to rotation (e.g., eigenvalue &gt; 1.00, maximum likelihood estimation, parallel analysis). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145445512443982">Rapee et al. (1996)</xref> used an eigenvalue &gt;1 and scree plot criteria for retaining factors prior to rotation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145445512443982">Zebb and Moore (1999)</xref> selected the number of factors to be rotated using the eigenvalue &gt;1 criterion. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512443982">Brown et al. (2004)</xref> used the maximum likelihood estimation method for initial factor selection. These methods tend to oversample or undersample the number of factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145445512443982">O’Connor, 2000</xref>). In contrast, parallel analysis, which some authors have argued is the most accurate approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145445512443982">Eaton, Velicer, &amp; Fava, 1999</xref>, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145445512443982">Hayton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145445512443982">Zwick &amp; Velicer, 1986</xref>), was used in the present study.</p>
<p>It is also possible that the differences in factor structures across studies were not due to the construct of anxiety control being represented differently across age groups. Each of the studies found a different factor structure, even those with participants of similar age groups. Thus, there could be factors, other than those described here, that may account for the differences in factor structure.</p>
<p>This study has numerous implications for the assessment of anxiety and our understanding of anxiety control among older adults. The need for the development of older adult assessment instruments using older adult participants is suggested by the present findings, a point that has previously been made with regard to a variety of clinical constructs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145445512443982">Edelstein, Martin, &amp; Gerolimatos, in press</xref>; Gould, Edelstein, &amp; Gerolimatos, in press). Our ultimate goal is to have a psychometrically and conceptually sound measure of anxiety control that is useful for anxiety research and practice with older adults. Should the factor structure revealed in the present study hold up in future studies, a reconceptualization of anxiety control in older adults may be warranted. The continued use of the 30-item ACQ seems to be the most prudent approach when conducting research with older adults until additional psychometric research can be conducted with the instrument. A significant limitation of our study was the use of a predominantly Caucasian sample. Thus, a logical next step in the refinement of the ACQ for older adults would include further psychometric evaluation, including a CFA with a much larger and ethnically and racially diverse sample to further establish the factor structure and enhance generalizability across population samples.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study with older adults revealed a factor structure that differed in several ways from those obtained by previous researchers using young adult participants. The contrast with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145445512443982">Brown et al. (2004)</xref> is particularly important in light of the methodological sophistication of the Brown et al. study and the authors’ recommendation of a 15-item scale. We believe that there is substantial evidence of an age-related difference in factor structure for the ACQ, and consequently, an age-related difference in how anxiety control might be conceptualized for older adults.</p>
