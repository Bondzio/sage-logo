<abstract>
<p>One of the few instruments to evaluate coping skills among patients with chronic illnesses is the Cuestionario de Afrontamiento al Estrés para Pacientes Oncológicos (CAEPO), created initially for cancer patients. We evaluate how well CAEPO applies to patients with non-cancer chronic illnesses. A total of 344 patients (115 with chronic hepatitis C, 120 with inflammatory bowel disease and 109 with recurrent vertigo) completed the CAEPO. Exploratory factor analysis and Cronbach’s alpha provide only partial support for the seven factors suggested by the original CAEPO. A streamlined version with fewer dimensions and items may be a better solution for identifying coping strategies among these patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Living with a chronic illness is a stressful experience that may unbalance an individual’s life, possibly leading to negative psychological consequences such as depression or anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105312464673">Greydanus et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105312464673">Lopez-Lopez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105312464673">Wasteson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1359105312464673">Winters et al., 2010</xref>). In primary care settings, the prevalence of major depression (20%) exceeds the prevalence in the general population (5%–10%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105312464673">Gilbody et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105312464673">Hilton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105312464673">Kilbourne et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Patients adapt to living with a chronic illness by employing various coping strategies. Coping has been defined as an individual’s ‘cognitive and behavioural efforts to manage (reduce, minimize, master or tolerate) the internal and external demands of the person–environment transaction that is appraised as taxing or exceeding the person’s resources’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312464673">Folkman et al., 1986</xref>). Positive coping strategies can minimize or even nullify the adverse psychosocial effects of chronic illness, while negative coping strategies may contribute to depression and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105312464673">Dempster et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105312464673">Goretti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312464673">Oxlad et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1359105312464673">Wasteson et al., 2006</xref>), employing influence on the health-related quality of life of such patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105312464673">Kapsou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312464673">Larsson et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, coping is of critical importance not only to psychological health but also to physical well-being, having a negative effect on morbidity and mortality rate in some chronic illnesses, such as heart failure or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105312464673">Donovan-Kicken and Caughlin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105312464673">Kapsou et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Identifying the coping mechanisms that chronically ill patients use could help to develop strategies to improve their quality of life and to improve the illness outcome. However, few psychometrically sound measures have been developed to assess coping in such patients, existing many with psychometric limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1359105312464673">Sveinbjornsdottir and Thorsteinsson, 2008</xref>). On the other hand, currently, there are many general coping questionnaires that are being used for specific chronic conditions but these are not designed nor validated for these pathologies. It is important to note that a number of researchers have questioned the validity of the use of general coping measures to study the coping behaviours of people with particular types of health problems, specifically of individuals with long-term or chronic health problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105312464673">Endler et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>General coping questionnaires assess several distinct strategies employed by people when facing general stressing situations, being applicable to the general population. However, coping measures specific for chronic illness patients assess coping strategies employed by chronically ill patients, considering the diseases as a specific stressing situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1359105312464673">Wei et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the advantage of general measures is that they are useful to compare the coping mechanisms in different cultures, illnesses, and so on. Nevertheless, their handicap lies in the fact that people with specific issues may not feel identified with such a general perspective on coping, and that is when a specific measure created to tackle the problems of that specific group of the population is more appropriate. Moreover, specific measures may be more sensitive for the detection of small changes that are important to patients, showing a better discrimination than general measures among subjects with varying severity of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105312464673">Bombardier et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1359105312464673">Patrick and Deyo, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Two reliable and valid coping inventories specifically developed to measure coping behaviours of a variety of health problems are the Coping with Health Injuries and Problems Scale (CHIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105312464673">Endler et al., 1998</xref>) and the Cuestionario de Afrontamiento al Estrés para Pacientes Oncológicos (CAEPO), in English translated as Coping with Stress Questionnaire for Cancer Patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312464673">González, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312464673">2008</xref>). The advantages of the CAEPO questionnaire are that it assesses different coping constructs from the CHIP questionnaire, is created in Spanish and has good psychometric properties. CAEPO was initially created to measure coping strategies in cancer patients. Nevertheless, its authors hypothesized that it could also be applied in other chronic diseases. Therefore, the aim of the study was to complete the validation of the CAEPO, testing its potential in a sample of patients with diverse types of chronic diseases.</p>

<title>Study population</title>
<p>Between April and November 2008, we recruited consecutive outpatients diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), IBD or recurrent vertigo (RV) from the digestive and otolaryngology departments of Hospital Galdakao-Usansolo in Bizkaia, Spain. Hospital Galdakao-Usansolo is a 400-bed teaching hospital in the Basque Country (northern Spain) that serves a population of 300,000 inhabitants. It belongs to the network of public hospitals of the Basque Health Care Service, which provides free unrestricted care to nearly 100 per cent of the population.</p>
<p>Patients were excluded if they chose not to participate in the study, were unable to answer the questionnaires, had cognitive dysfunction and/or a life-threatening disease that disqualified them from completing the questionnaire, or had been diagnosed with more than one of the diseases that were the focus of this study.</p>
<p>The study followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital Galdakao-Usansolo. Patients who agreed to participate provided informed consent before beginning the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1359105312464673">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>A cross-sectional research design was used. Participants were recruited by their physicians. Participants recruited from the digestive service received the three study questionnaires directly from one of the authors (M.O.). Participants recruited from the otolaryngology service were sent the study questionnaires by mail. In all cases, patients completed the questionnaires on their own.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1359105312464673">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>Patients completed three different instruments: a set of sociodemographic questions, the CAEPO and the Depression in the Medically Ill-18 (DMI-18) questionnaire. The sociodemographic questionnaire collected information on age, gender, marital status, level of education and employment.</p>
<p>The CAEPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312464673">González, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312464673">2008</xref>) is a 40-item questionnaire that assesses possible behavioural and cognitive coping strategies. Its theoretical framework has been mainly based on the model of stress and coping developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312464673">Folkman and Lazarus (1986)</xref> and on the adjuvant psychological theory for patients with cancer developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312464673">Greer et al. (1989)</xref>. Thus, the CAEPO evaluates the strategies of facing the situation – besides those who intended to fight and solve the problems that the situation raise (centred on the problem) and those who improve or eliminate the emotional disorder (centred on emotional disorder) – also evaluate those who try to prevent or solve the problem in a wrong or failing way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312464673">González, 2008</xref>). Scores for each item range from 0 (does not apply or strategy is not used) to 3 (strategy is used a great deal). As presented by the original author, the exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) for CAEPO differentiated seven coping scales: Fighting Spirit, Self-Control and Emotional Control, Seeking Social Support, Anxiety and Anxious Preoccupation, Inactivity-Stoic Acceptance, Distancing-Escape and Denial. CAEPO provides one score per scale. The range of each scale varies because of the different numbers of items that each one contains. Cronbach’s alpha values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105312464673">Cronbach, 1951</xref>) for the seven coping scales ranged from 0.78 to 0.92. From the direct score of each subscale, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312464673">González (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312464673">2008</xref>) calculated two summary scores – one summing the scores of the three positive scales (Fighting Spirit, Self-Control and Emotional Control, and Seeking Social Support) and the other summing the scores of the four negative scales (Anxiety and Anxious Preoccupation, Inactivity-Stoic Acceptance, Distancing-Escape and Denial). To provide an overall summary coping score, the original author divided both subscales in 10 groups numbered from 1 to 10, usually called standard-ten (sten core) (mean = 5.5; standard deviation (SD) = 2). The numeric difference between those positive and negative sten scores was the overall summary coping score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312464673">González, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312464673">2008</xref>). A positive overall summary score indicates a tendency to employ positive coping strategies while a negative overall summary score indicates a tendency to adopt negative coping strategies. Although the CAEPO was developed in a cancer population, the author has suggested that it could also be a valid questionnaire for evaluating coping strategies for patients suffering from other diseases with diverse effects on survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312464673">González, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The DMI-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1359105312464673">Parker et al., 2002</xref>) is an 18-item questionnaire specifically designed to detect depression in patients with medical disorders. The options for answers to each question range from ‘none’ (scored as 0) to ‘always’ (scored as 3). The DMI-18 has been translated into Spanish and validated with satisfactory reliability and construct validity (Orive et al., 2011). An overall depression score was calculated by summing across all the items. Scores equal to or greater than 15 have been shown to indicate depression with a sensitivity of 93 per cent and a specificity of 73 per cent. The Cronbach alpha reliability estimate was 0.95. Confirmatory factor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105312464673">Kapsou et al., 2010</xref>) results supported the one-factor model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1359105312464673">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>If fewer than half of the items of each factor had a missing value, the mean value of the rest of the items was imputed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105312464673">Fayers and Machin, 2007</xref>). Continuous variables are presented as means and SDs; categorical variables are presented as frequencies and percentages. The criterion used to assess reliability was a level of <italic>internal consistency</italic> corresponding to a Cronbach alpha of at least 0.70 for each CAEPO dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105312464673">Cronbach, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105312464673">Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>factor structure</italic> of the original CAEPO has not been evaluated in a non-cancer chronic illness population. Thus, we performed an EFA in an effort to replicate the original findings that were derived from a cancer population. We submitted all 40 items from the CAEPO to an EFA, considering the seven-factor solution as suggested by the CAEPO author (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105312464673">González, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312464673">2008</xref>). We used an unweighted least squares estimation method with an oblique rotation. This technique gives robust estimates when used with non-normally distributed data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105312464673">Brown, 2006</xref>). An item was considered to be in the factor if the factor loading was .40 or greater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1359105312464673">Staquet et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>We assessed <italic>convergent validity</italic> by analyzing the relationship between two positive coping strategies (Fighting Spirit, Self-Control and Emotional Control) and three negative coping strategies (Anxiety and Anxious Preoccupation, Distancing-Escape and Denial) with the DMI-18 score. The DMI-18 measure was not considered adequate for comparison with the Seeking Social Support and Inactive-Stoic Acceptance strategies because the DMI-18 questionnaire does not have any items that measure either social support or inactivity. A Pearson’s correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic>) of ±.80 was defined as a strong correlation, ±.50 as a moderate correlation and ±.20 as a weak correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105312464673">Hatcher, 1994</xref>). Individuals who tend to use negative coping strategies in dealing with chronic illness may be more likely to feel depressed and vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312464673">Larsson et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, we expected negative coping strategies to have a moderate positive association with depression and positive coping strategies to have a moderate negative association with depression.</p>
<p><italic>Known groups validity</italic> was examined by comparing the scores from the seven CAEPO scales according to DMI-18 score (&lt;15 vs ≥15) and gender. We used the gender variable to measure the known groups validity of Seeking Social Support and Inactivity-Stoic Acceptance factors. We expected that patients scoring below the cut-point of 15 on the DMI-18 score would present with higher mean values in the positive coping strategies scales and vice versa. On the other hand, given that women are more likely than men to employ emotion-focused and avoidance coping strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105312464673">Karekla and Panayiotou, 2011</xref>), we expected that women would score higher than men in both the Seeking Social Support and Inactivity-Stoic Acceptance dimensions. The scores of the seven CAEPO scales were also compared across the three chronic illness evaluated in this study. In our sample, patients with IBD exhibited the least depression. Thus, we expected that IBD patients would score lower in negative coping strategies and higher in positive coping strategies than the other patients. Mean differences between the gender and DMI-18 were evaluated using the independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test, whereas analysis of variance (ANOVA) was implemented for comparing pathologies.</p>
<p>Finally, <italic>factors associated with coping dimensions</italic> were assessed by multivariate linear models in which the score of each of the seven CAEPO scales was considered as the dependent variable. Depression (DMI-18 score &lt; 15 and DMI-18 score ≥ 15; with DMI-18 score ≥ 15 as the reference group), age (&lt;40, 40–60 and ≥60 years; with age ≥60 years as the reference group), gender (male and female; with female as the reference group) and pathology (IBD, CHC and RV; with RV as the reference group) were considered as independent covariates. Additionally, to study the interaction between gender and depression, we performed multivariate analysis where we created dummy variables between both variables taking as reference the group of women depressed (DMI ≥ 15). As dependent variable, we took the CAEPO positive and negative summary scales. All statistical analyses were performed with SAS for Windows statistical software, version 9.2.</p>

<title>Internal consistency</title>
<p>In our sample, five of seven scales from the original CAEPO achieved medium-to-high Cronbach’s alpha scores (Fighting Spirit: 0.78; Self-Control and Emotional Control: 0.71; Seeking Social Support: 0.61; Anxiety and Anxious Preoccupation: 0.71 and Inactivity-Stoic Acceptance: 0.77). Distancing-Escape (0.41) and Denial (0.23) did not show acceptable internal consistency.</p>

<p>The factor loadings are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1359105312464673">Table 2</xref>. The seven-factor model derived from our data provides only partial support for the factorial validity of the CAEPO scales in patients with non-cancer chronic illnesses. Our data suggest a four-factor model. The first extracted factor was represented by the CAEPO dimensions, Fighting Spirit and Self-Control and Emotional Control; the second was represented by Anxiety and Anxious Preoccupation; the third reflects the Inactivity-Stoic Acceptance dimension and the fourth reflects the Seeking Social Support dimension. The Distancing-Escape and Denial dimensions did not load with a specific factor. Only one item loaded adequately on the seventh factor. Four items (1, 4, 8 and 30) did not load on any of the seven scales.</p>

<p>To confirm the factor results, we performed a multivariate linear regression model. Age was not statistically associated with any of the coping dimensions (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05).

Non-depressed patients scored significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher than depressed patients in Fighting Spirit (Beta estimate: 2.55 (standard error (SE) = 0.51)) and Self-Control and Emotional Control (1.90 (0.42)) CAEPO positive dimensions, whereas scored lower in Anxiety and Anxious Preoccupation (−3.49 (0.31)), Inactivity-Stoic Acceptance (−0.97 (0.41)) and Distancing-Escape (−1.24 (0.33)) negative dimensions. Surprisingly, non-depressed patients also scored a little, but significantly higher in Denial negative dimension (0.50 (0.17); <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Regarding gender differences, men scored lower in Seeking Social Support (−0.74 (0.32); <italic>p</italic> = 0.024) and Self-Control and Emotional Control (−1.02 (0.44); <italic>p</italic> = 0.023) than women and tended to score higher in Anxiety and Anxious Preoccupation (0.79 (0.32); <italic>p</italic> = 0.013). Patients with IBD (−1.54 (0.40), <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001) and CHC (−1.04 (0.39), <italic>p</italic> = 0.009) were less likely to use Anxiety and Anxious Preoccupation coping strategies than patients with RV.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Assessing a patient’s coping strategies is necessary to fully evaluate and understand his or her response to chronic illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312464673">Larsson et al., 2008</xref>). Doing this requires instruments with good psychometric properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105312464673">Lundquvist and Ahlstöm, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312464673">Oxlad et al., 2004</xref>). To date, few instruments with these properties are available. We evaluated one such instrument, the Coping with Stress Questionnaire for Cancer Patients (CAEPO). The CAEPO was validated in cancer patients but their authors hypothesized that potentially, it could be an adequate measure of coping in a broader set of chronic diseases. In this study, we evaluated the validity of CAEPO in other pathologies such as IBD, CHC and RV. The seven-factor model proposed by the CAEPO showed good psychometric properties for those patients, but some little changes would benefit the functioning of some of its factors. The CAEPO’s Distancing-Escape and Denial dimensions failed to adequately explain the data from our patient sample. In addition, our analysis could not reproduce the suggested structure, with some factors consisting of single-item scales and others containing clusters of scales. Our data suggest that the Self-Control and Emotional Control and the Fighting Spirit dimensions in the original CAEPO may be better described as a single factor. This seems to represent behavioural or cognitive strategies in which a patient takes an active, collaborative and positive role to cope with his or her illness and to decrease the negative emotions it produces, similar to the active and positive Fighting Spirit responses that other investigators have described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312464673">Burgess et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312464673">Carver et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105312464673">Greer et al., 1989</xref>). The other the three factors were quite consistent with three of the CAEPO’s seven factors – Anxiety and Anxious Preoccupation, Seeking Social Support and Inactivity-Stoic Acceptance – all of which demonstrated acceptable alpha reliability. These findings may indicate that a solution with fewer dimensions and fewer items (some items were not particularly well specified according to the EFA) would be a better solution for coping strategies in non-cancer patient populations.</p>
<p>It should not be surprising that our results were different from those of the original CAEPO study, given that studies on coping have consistently found different coping mechanisms, sometimes even when the same or similar questionnaires were applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105312464673">Lundquvist and Ahlstöm, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1359105312464673">Oxlad et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Our analysis of convergent and known groups validity revealed significant low-to-moderate correlations and differences between groups in the predicted directions, except when examining differences between pathologies. Consistent with the previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105312464673">Kapsou et al., 2010</xref>), we observed that patients with IBD, whose DMI-18 scores indicated the least depression, were less likely to employ negative coping strategies such as Anxiety and Anxious Preoccupation and Distancing-Escape. No significant differences were observed when comparing positive coping strategies such as Fighting Spirit or Self-Control and Emotional Control. Surprisingly, RV patients, who were significantly more depressed than patients with IBD, scored higher in Seeking Social Support, usually considered to be a positive coping strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105312464673">Kapsou et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In the regression analysis, depression and gender made significant independent contributions to coping dimensions. This is in line with other studies that stress the influence of negative coping methods on depression and the different ways men and women cope with illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105312464673">Larsson et al., 2008</xref>). Our results confirm the association between depression and negative coping strategies. When studying the ways of coping and differences in gender, although some of our multivariate analysis showed some minor discrepancies with the current literature in the results between men and women, when we introduced the interaction between depression and gender, those discrepancies disappeared. In any case, we think that these multivariate analyses are to be taken with caution since some other variables that could be relevant have not been included such as social support or financial status, and that might explain the discrepancies found. The fact that the Distancing-Escape and Denial domains did not perform as expected could be because these dimensions do not work well with some chronic illnesses. It could also be due to the differences between our patient sample (those with long-standing non-cancer chronic illnesses) and the original sample used for validating the CAEPO (patients with recently diagnosed head and neck cancer). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105312464673">Kraus et al. (2000)</xref> have found, the time elapsed since the diagnosis of an illness is a pertinent variable that may influence how a patient is coping with that illness.</p>
<p>Labelling a coping strategy as positive or negative depends on the result that such strategy has on the health of the subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105312464673">Nahlén and Saboonchi, 2010</xref>). However, nowadays, there is no general consensus regarding which coping strategies may be most effective in enhancing psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1359105312464673">Vaan der Zaag-Loonen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1359105312464673">Voth and Sirois, 2009</xref>). One coping strategy it is not positive or negative in all situations, but its benefits depend on the person, the moment and the circumstances in which the stressor happens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105312464673">Folkman and Lazarus, 1986</xref>). With this in mind, in our study, we have classified one strategy as positive or negative, as the author of the CAEPO did. This classification also has been confirmed by other authors. There is substantial evidence that coping approaches such as Fighting Spirit and Seeking Social Support are related to positive health outcomes and increased well-being while Anxious Preoccupation, Distancing and Denial coping are considered less adaptive (Greer et al., 1988; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105312464673">Kapsou et al., 2010</xref>). Regarding the Emotional Control scale, it represents behavioural or cognitive strategies in which a patient takes an active, collaborative and positive role to decrease the negative emotions produced due to the illness, being similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105312464673">Carver et al.’s (1989)</xref> Active Coping and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105312464673">Burgess et al.’s (1988)</xref> Confronting Responses scales. On the other hand, the CAEPO’s Inactivity-Stoic Acceptance scale is defined as a coping strategy that it is present in patients with few hopes of getting better from their illness, having a pessimistic and fatalistic attitude about the future. This scale is in accordance with Greer et al.’s (1988) Fatalism (Stoic Acceptance) scale.</p>
<p>Before the CAEPO was developed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105312464673">Endler et al. (1998)</xref> created the CHIP questionnaire to assess coping in patients with different types of health problems. The CHIP questionnaire has good psychometric characteristics and complete cross-validation with a confirmatory factor analysis. One advantage of using it compared to CAEPO is the CHIP’s test–retest analysis, which shows the instrument’s temporal stability, something that has not yet been published for the CAEPO. However, a significant limitation of the CHIP questionnaire is that it was developed using a sample of patients with a heterogeneous set of both chronic illnesses (diabetes, cancer, arthritis and hypertension) and acute illnesses (respiratory infections, fractures, headaches and skin rashes). It is likely that living with an acute illness elicits different coping strategies than does living with a chronic illness. CAEPO assesses some coping constructs different from that of CHIP and some that are common between CHIP and CAEPO, such as the Seeking Social Support or Inactivity-Stoic Acceptance, as in the literature. Therefore, the domains included in the CAEPO but not included in the CHIP questionnaire were tested adequately in our test.</p>
<p>Strengths of our study include the use of a sample of 344 patients diagnosed with three different chronic illnesses. This sample compares favourably to the sample of 160 patients with cancer in the original CAEPO study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105312464673">González (2008)</xref>. On one hand, sample size is an important consideration given that solutions provided by factor analytic methods obtained with larger samples are typically more stable across repeated samples and provide more precise estimates of population loadings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105312464673">MacCallum et al., 1999</xref>). On the other hand, the variety of chronic illnesses with different characteristics and levels of threat to life and the recruitment of patients in different stages of the disease improve the generalizability of the original CAEPO, which has been validated only in patients recently diagnosed with cancer.</p>
<p>Limitations of our study must also be noted. First, outcomes of any EFA depend partly on the characteristics of the sample. Our study focused exclusively on patients who presented for care in outpatient settings. Thus, the results will not necessarily generalize to other settings, such as inpatients or patients treated at home. Second, given the study’s cross-sectional design, we cannot provide data about the responsiveness of the CAEPO. Third, although chronic illness can lead not only to depression but also to anxiety, we selected only depression as indicator to convergent validity in order not to tire patients with more questions. For future studies, it would be interesting to take anxiety also into account. Finally, the low internal consistencies of two of the seven original CAEPO domains, the inconsistencies between the factor structures we obtained and factor analytic outcomes from the previous findings are also important concerns that could compromise the methodology suggested for the original author to obtain the global CAEPO score. Therefore, for further studies, we suggest to conduct a confirmatory factor analysis to examine a structural model for CAEPO with fewer or different dimensions and items.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although the CAEPO is a promising instrument for assessing coping strategies among chronically ill patients, it requires further development and evaluation. Our findings suggest that a solution with fewer dimensions and fewer items may work better for assessing coping strategies in non-cancer patient populations.</p>
