<p>I have to confess that in many ways I find that Gospel reading quite bizarre. For a start, it follows on directly from last week’s Gospel reading – and the end of last week’s Gospel reading sounded for all the world like the end of the whole of John’s Gospel, for it read, ‘These things are written that you may come to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through believing you may have life in his name.’</p>
<p>Those words don’t lead me to expect anything more, but rather than finding the start of the Acts of the Apostles when I turn the page in the Bible, I get the story of the Risen Christ appearing to seven of the disciples on and beside the Sea of Galilee in another chapter of John instead.</p>
<p>And, then, the fact that Peter and his companions are back in Galilee, back at their old occupation of fishing, doesn’t square up one bit with what Luke’s Gospel and then Acts tell us about those disciples, namely that they stayed ‘down South’ in Jerusalem, received the Holy Spirit (either for the first time or again, depending on how we understand John 20:19-23) on the Day of Pentecost, and then became bold preachers of the Good News of Jesus Christ and leaders of a new and rapidly-growing Church, again in Jerusalem. It doesn’t even fit too well with the Easter narratives in Matthew and Mark for, while they do point towards a return to Galilee by the disciples, it most certainly isn’t in order to go back to being fishermen in the conventional sense.</p>
<p>So, a big part of me wants to dismiss today’s Gospel reading from John 21 as being an unhistorical add-on to John’s Gospel that we shouldn’t bother paying any attention to.</p>
<p>But there is, in fact, not a single ancient manuscript of the New Testament or of just John’s Gospel that does not include what we now call chapter 21. That, in itself, should caution us against rejecting the whole chapter out of hand. And, in any case, I’ve found that, if I do do that, I lose something key and vital – something far more important that historical accuracy!</p>
<p>For the passage describes how Peter, Thomas, Nathanial, James, John and two other – anonymous – disciples go back to their ordinary life and work as fishermen on the Sea Galilee, but then find themselves meeting with the Risen Jesus while they’re going about that ordinary, daily life and work, even if they don’t actually at first recognise as their Lord and God the ‘Stranger on the Shore’, who talks with them and tells them where to cast their nets in order to make a good catch.</p>
<p>And the way in which Jesus, crucified and risen, comes and meets the disciples in their ordinary, workaday life on the Sea of Galilee makes me ponder, makes me think that maybe, just maybe, he still does that to his followers, his worshippers, his disciples today. That his love for us is so great that he doesn’t always wait for us to come to him, by coming to worship, by praying, by studying the Bible, but that he actually seeks you and me out as we go about our daily tasks, at home, at school, at work, wherever. That he comes near to us among the kids and their parents who want to cross the road to get to primary school, among those who work at or visit the Community Garden, among the adults who are our students, in those with mental health problems with whom we work, in the school lab, in the customers in the café, and so on.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0014524612470784">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>But it’s in the nature of Jesus that he doesn’t make himself very obvious when he does come to us. Perhaps even that is part of his love for us. If he were too obvious, his presence might be too much for us. And, similarly, perhaps he doesn’t come too close to us, just as when he came to the disciples as they were fishing, he appeared on the shore, not in the boat itself, and appeared as an unknown, ordinary man, and not as the glorious Lord. For, again, if he came too close it might be too much for us.</p>
<p>But that does mean that we have to have the eyes of faith to be able to recognize him, and to be able, in our turn, to say, ‘It is the Lord!’</p>
<p>Or, it might mean that we need to be better able to hear the voice, perhaps of another, saying to us, ‘It is the Lord!’ – just as Peter, in the boat on the Lake, had to hear the voice of the disciple Jesus loved (John?) before he recognized for himself that the stranger on the shore was Jesus.</p>
<p>If we ponder on Peter in the story of the appearance of the Risen Jesus in John 21, there are some searching questions that we could put to ourselves: why can’t I recognize the Lord? What are the obstacles in the way? Who is the ‘Beloved Disciple’ or John in my life, the one who hears and sees what I don’t and can’t? What’s it like for me when he or she has to tell me? What’s it like to hear that familiar voice from the shore? What does that voice say to me? What, for me, in my circumstances, is the equivalent of that invitation, ‘Come and have breakfast’?</p>
<p>I know all too well that I, certainly, generally fall at the first fence, and don’t even have my eye of faith on the lookout for the Risen Lord as I go through each day. I am attracted to the originally monastic custom of saying what is often called the <italic>Nunc Dimittis</italic> at the end of each day, as a way of trying to think back over the day, trying to spot where and when I ‘saw’ the Lord and his salvation that day.</p>
<p>What we call the <italic>Nunc Dimittis</italic> is the song sung by Simeon when the forty-day old Jesus was presented in the Temple by Mary and Joseph, as recounted in Luke 2.22-40. It goes:
<disp-quote>
<p>Lord, now you let your servant go in peace;</p>
<p>your word has been fulfilled.</p>
<p>My own eyes have seen the salvation;</p>
<p>which you have prepared in the sight of all people.</p>
<p>To be a light to lighten the Gentiles;</p>
<p>and the glory of your people Israel.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thinking of ‘seeing the salvation which you have prepared’ at the end of each day encourages us to look back over the day, asking, ‘when did I see that salvation today? When in my ordinary life today did my Lord come to me?’ - perhaps it was in something that happened, usual or unusual, perhaps it was in something I saw, usual or unusual, perhaps it was in something somebody happened to say.</p>
<p>Perhaps we’ll find as we start doing something like this at the end of each day we’ll get better at spotting the Lord coming to us day by day – not just afterwards, but even <italic>as it happens</italic> …. perhaps, just perhaps, we’ll find ourselves saying to ourselves, quite often, and ‘in awe and wonder and with bated breath’: ‘It is the Lord! It is the Lord!! It is the Lord!!!’</p>
