<p><italic>Poor nutrition in older people is a growing public health concern. Menu engineering provides a way of improving the nutritional well-being of older people, however there is little published qualitative data examining how effective menu engineering actually is. Dr Meena Mahadevan from Montclair State University introduces new research which aims to close this scientific knowledge gap</italic></p>
<sec id="section1-1757913912457313">
<title>Background</title>
<p>With a current annual increase rate of 2.8%, experts predict that the growth rates for the elderly population in the U.S. will continue to exceed the growth rates for the rest of the population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913912457313">1</xref></sup> More than one million elderly in the nation currently reside in assisted- or independent-living facilities. While these individuals require a minimum level of assistance with activities of daily living, they exhibit greater cognitive capacity and functional independence compared to their nursing home counterparts. The high cost of nursing home care coupled with their desire to age at home have made this group one of the fast-growing segments of the elderly population in the past decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913912457313">2</xref></sup> With the continual rise in the number of older adults at such facilities, it is imperative that their health status is met and maintained in order to improve their quality of life. Nutritional well-being has been shown to play a vital role in the overall health, independence, and quality of life of all older adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913912457313">3</xref></sup> Tragically, studies show that most assisted-living elderly residents aren’t eating well. Deficiencies of several key macro- and micronutrients have been documented while excessive intakes of fat, cholesterol, saturated fat, and sodium are also common in some, leading to an increase in chronic disease risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913912457313">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Research suggests that there are many physiological, social, and environmental barriers that may deter this population from meeting and maintaining a good nutritional status. Medical conditions, medication side effects, and physiological changes that are an inevitable part of ageing can result in a reduced capacity to digest, absorb, and utilise nutrients. Physical incapacity and disabilities may serve as structural barriers that further diminish their ability to purchase, prepare, and consume balanced meals. Studies show that the elderly at assisted-living facilities are also unable to adopt healthy behaviours largely because of systemic barriers which include limited choice and poorly trained staff who ignore their residents’ nutritional needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913912457313">5</xref></sup> Nutritional risk among the elderly was found to be reduced when meal times are accompanied in the presence of others; but many assisted- as well as independent-living elderly report feeling socially isolated and depressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913912457313">6</xref></sup> Inadequate nutrition knowledge, negative attitudes, self-defeating beliefs that they are too old to benefit from eating healthily, rejection of food that does not elicit familiarity or comfort, and frustration over loss of control over daily food choices have all been identified as factors possibly contributing to a lack of motivation to eat appropriately among this group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757913912457313">7</xref></sup></p>

<title>Meal times</title>
<p>Although significant progress has been made, the afore-mentioned barriers continue to complicate intervention effectiveness and stymie public health efforts to address the crises of poor nutrition in our senior citizens. It has been suggested that by simply adjusting menus and food preparation techniques to conform more closely to an individual’s food preferences and needs, facilities can help improve their residents’ food and nutrient intakes. Menu engineering research involving manipulations in the design, language, and layout of menus have shown promise in this regard. For example, boxing and placing an item in a prominent location, using descriptive language to provide more information on the ingredients and method of preparation used, and ‘advertising’ an item’s health benefit by providing nutritional information have all been used as tools to influence the selection of certain items. While the goal of such research has mainly been to maximise a restaurant’s profitability, findings have revealed a slight increase in more appropriate food selections, particularly with the use of symbols (e.g., a heart symbol next to a food item low in fat and sodium for those residents who need a low salt diet).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757913912457313">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757913912457313">9</xref></sup> These data suggest that rather than dictating nutritional norms, menus that utilise signage and other visual techniques to highlight the nutritional value of various food items, can gently nudge older adults towards making healthier food choices thereby enhancing locus of control, improving self-efficacy, increasing functional independence, and ultimately leading to an improved nutritional status.</p>
<p>Emerging evidence from intervention science suggests that if programs are to succeed in improving the nutritional status of the elderly, then we must also learn more, from the perspectives of the participants themselves, about the various factors that serve as facilitators or barriers to healthy food choices among them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913912457313">10</xref></sup> Unfortunately, while several studies have quantified the daily food and nutrient intakes of elderly populations across the nation, there is little published data examining the value and impact of menu engineering in helping older adults, particularly those with greater cognitive and functional abilities, to make informed food selections. Researchers at Montclair State University, USA, and Bournemouth University, UK are attempting to close this science knowledge gap. Using a qualitative approach, and the Social Cognitive Theory as the guiding framework, a study involving a group of elderly assisted- and independent-living residents of New Jersey is currently underway to examine the implicit and multiplistic nature of the participants’ conceptualisation of healthy eating to them, their perceived facilitators and barriers to this process, and their views on using menus to better guide their food choices. Given the unprecedented increase in the elderly assisted-living population, poor nutrition and associated complications can ultimately result in inflated national health care costs due to increasing care-giving demands. The ultimate public health goal of this research is to generate preliminary data that is grounded in the views of its participants, and to help facilitate the development of effectively targeted interventions and community services that can lead to the improvement of nutritional practices of this vulnerable population.</p>
