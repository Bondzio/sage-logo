<p>Disasters, natural or man-made, bring numerous health care challenges. In any crisis, mental health programs are a requirement during both the acute and postemergency phases. In the Asian tsunami on December 26, 2004, some of the northwestern coastal areas of Malaysia, particularly the island of Penang, were affected with devastating effects on the residents. Such disasters can predispose to mental health problems among the affected people. An early mental health intervention program was carried out in Balik Pulau, Penang, an area badly affected by the tsunami. The objective of the intervention program was to identify the victims, counsel them, make referrals if necessary, and provide help and resources to prevent the development of mental health problems. Penang residents identified as tsunami victims by the local health authorities were recruited. A group of health care workers, school teachers, village authorities, and volunteers were trained to carry out the crisis intervention program by health care workers experienced in crisis interventions. A total of 299 adults participated in the crisis intervention program, with follow-up assessments being made 4 to 6 weeks later. At the follow-up assessment, 1% of the victims had a problem and they were then referred for further medical assessment. This indicates that the intervention program in the first 2 weeks after the tsunami disaster with referrals to medical services may have helped stabilize the victims.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Asian Tsunami occurred on December 26, 2004, following by an earthquake with an intensity of 9.0 on the Richter scale in the Indian Ocean, north of Simeulue Island, off the western coast of Sumatra Indonesia. The tsunami killed more than 230 000 people from 13 countries, including Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Malaysia, India (including Andaman and Nicobar Islands), Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Kenya, Somalia, and Seychelles Island. The tsunami and the earthquake also displaced more than a million people and affected the lives of a further 5 million.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539512453261">1</xref></sup> Indonesia was the hardest hit, especially the island of Sumatra, followed by Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand. The World Health Organization (WHO) anticipated considerable mental health consequences after the Asian tsunami and estimated that 50% of the survivors would have mental health problems and 5% to 10% might have serious problems requiring treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539512453261">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Malaysia, Penang Island and shores of the northern state of Kedah were the most affected. Coastal areas in Peninsula Malaysia, for example, 13 villages in Kuala Muda, Kedah, and Kuala Triang on Langkawi Island were also affected. Houses in fishing villages along the western and northern coastal areas were damaged in Batu Maung and Bagan Lepas and also at Telok Bahang and Pulau Betong on Penang Island. The rapid responses of the Malaysian government, the Penang state government, humanitarian societies, and nongovernmental organizations helped minimize morbidity and mortality. There was also considerable intrinsic community support within each of the communities. There were 68 recorded deaths in Malaysia, with 52 deaths, 4 missing, 206 injured, and 615 houses and 1332 boats damaged in Penang.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539512453261">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In any disaster, man-made or natural, the victims or survivors experience suffering from many causes including bereavement from the loss of family members and friends, fear of dying, community destruction, social unrest, physical injuries, mental health problems such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), loss of livelihood, famine, migration, and even armed conflict. The consequences of disasters may include a wide range of psychopathology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539512453261">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512453261">4</xref></sup> Previous systematic reviews have documented that PTSD is the most commonly studied psychopathology in the aftermath of disasters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539512453261">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539512453261">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539512453261">6</xref></sup> It has been estimated that about 9% of trauma victims will develop chronic PTSD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539512453261">7</xref></sup> The reported prevalence of PTSD in the aftermath of natural disasters includes the Hunan Province flood, China, where the prevalence rate was 8.6% within 2.5 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539512453261">8</xref></sup> After the 1999 floods and mudslides in Mexico, there was a prevalence of 24% (6 months) in the 2 affected communities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539512453261">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>As noted by the WHO, in the acute emergency phase, psychosocial support to disaster victims is important. Health professionals who deliver these psychosocial support services and mental health assistance need to be well versed in the local culture of the affected victims.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539512453261">10</xref></sup> Furthermore, social and basic psychological interventions, such as providing psychological first aid, counseling, debriefing, schooling for children, funeral services, prayers and religious activities, family reunifications, and restarting economic activities should be implemented. In terms of early intervention, there has been consensus on the minimum standard of mental and social aspects of health care, as reflected in the recent Sphere handbook on “Minimum standards in disaster response.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539512453261">11</xref></sup> There is a general consensus that early psychosocial intervention is needed to address the mental health needs of the victims. This article describes the interventions that were used for the management of psychosocial interventions in the survivors of the tsunami in Penang.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="section3-1010539512453261">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>Penang, known as the “Pearl of the Orient,” is situated on the northwest coast of Peninsular Malaysia and is 1 of the 13 states in Malaysia. Penang Island is the most populous island in Malaysia, and this beautiful, sunny island with its sandy beaches attracts many tourists from around the world. Geographically, Penang is divided into 2 sections: (<italic>a</italic>) Penang island, an island of 293 square kilometers located in the Straits of Malacca, and (<italic>b</italic>) Seberang Perai (formerly known as Province Wellesley), a narrow hinterland of 753 square kilometers on the peninsula, bordered by Kedah in the east and north and by Perak in the south. Penang has a total area of 1048 square kilometers, population (year 2010) of 1 577 300 (Penang Island 704 376), and a population density of 1505 person per square kilometer and a population growth rate of 2%. By ethnicity, 43% of the population is Malays, 41% Chinese, 10% Indians, and 6% other. Penang itself is highly developed (human development index 0.773), urbanized (80.9%), and industrialized. The northwestern part of the Penang Island, particularly the Barat Daya district, was struck by the Asian tsunami (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1010539512453261">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>Victims of the tsunami were defined as those who had escaped the disaster, but whose family members were dead or missing during the disaster. All victims were living in the Barat Daya District of Penang Island, the site of massive destruction during the disaster, who were identified and listed by the local authorities. The victims were from Kuala Sungai Pinang, Kuala Jalan Baru, Jalan Bukit Penara, Kampung Sungai Burung, Kampung Paya, Jalan Kampung Genting, and Pulau Betong (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1010539512453261">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The government and nongovernmental agencies acted swiftly to provide basic aid, shelter, and safety within the first week. Subsequently, a team composed of group of doctors, psychiatrists, and psychologists experienced in psychosocial interventions during crises collectively developed over 2 days a training module for volunteers to facilitate early intervention for those affected by the disaster. Due to the urgency of the situation, the group prepared materials based on the WHO handbooks and produced a 1-day education module for adults and children. The adult interventions included psychoeducation and demystifying myths, stress management, identification of depression, normal and abnormal grief, and identification of symptoms of PTSD. The intervention for children consisted of identification of symptoms of depression, management of stress in children, and conducting play therapy including “drawing” therapy. Simple behavioral techniques were also included, especially for phobias to water, rain, and bathing using gradual desensitization and relaxation techniques. The module also included tips on avoidance of caregiver “burn out.” Schoolteachers, representatives from nongovernmental organizations, health care staff, village headmen, and religious leaders participated in the training workshop. At the end of the workshop, the trainees were given feedback as they conducted mock interviews. The training workshops continued with about 30 volunteers each day, and the more capable volunteers were then asked to become trainers. The authors and trained nurses went into the community interviewing victims and their family and bringing back materials from the village to be incorporated as examples into the teaching and counseling sessions.</p>
<p>The trained volunteers went to the houses of all the victims and sat with those affected, including children, in a group and allowed ventilation of anguish and grief for as long as the family felt it necessary. Overvalued ideas and myths such as “it was a punishment for sinners” were gradually explored and simple cognitive restructuring was taught explaining the evidence behind natural disasters. The volunteers used the techniques that had been taught to them and were encouraged to use and participate in religious and cultural beliefs that were supportive of the healing process. Deliberate debriefing was avoided,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539512453261">12</xref></sup> except for the members of the team and the volunteers who were allowed group sessions in the evenings to ventilate their feelings. The children were observed in their families and were encouraged to ventilate their feelings using drawings. Families were repeatedly visited and those with significant problems were referred to health nurses, psychiatrists, or psychologists, who saw them in nearby health clinics or in their residence. Apart from the household-based intervention, many schoolteachers were trained as volunteers and followed-up affected pupils and extended their counseling services to others who were affected in the schools. Health care staff continued to extend their services to those who lived in the nearby villages. This way the entire affected community was reached and early interventions were provided within 2 weeks, between December 27, 2004, and February 9, 2005.</p>
<p>A month after the early intervention, all victims were contacted again and assessed for presence of common mental disorders (CMD) using the Clinical Interview Schedule–Revised (CIS-R) instrument<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539512453261">13</xref></sup> by a group of trained interviewers who had earlier been trained to use the CIS-R in an earlier validation study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539512453261">14</xref></sup> All subjects identified as having significant psychological problems were then referred to the adult psychiatric clinic in the district hospital while children were seen at separate clinics. Six months later the cases that were being followed-up were interviewed by the authors.</p>

<title>Ethical Issues</title>
<p>Due to the urgency of the situation, no ethical approval could be obtained. However, verbal consent was taken from the affected and the authorities for the interviews. This study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1010539512453261">15</xref></sup></p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Due to the urgency of the situation, no data were collected in the first month of contact with victims although qualitative reports from the health workers indicated that the techniques that were taught to them in the modules were effective and victims were returning to work and school. Reports from health workers reported mainly anxiety and avoidance symptoms with sleep problems. Drawings from affected children also showed a gradual return from simple lines and blobs in dark neutral colors to fully formed drawings of family members that were lost, grief, and eventually colors of rescue, which were shades of yellow and orange, as they recovered.</p>
<p>A total of 299 victims were traced a month after they had been involved in the intervention programs. The subjects were mostly Malays and aged between 30 and 49 years (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1010539512453261">Table I</xref>). Three victims scored more than 12 in the CIS-R assessment and had ICD-10 diagnoses for common mental disorders, 2 had generalized anxiety disorder, and 1 had mixed anxiety disorder. One victim who scored less than 12 was diagnosed with specific isolated phobia. Assessment for presence of prominent CIS-R symptoms, indicated by a score of 2 and more for an individual symptom, showed that the most frequently occurring symptom was “sleep problem,” with a prevalence of 3.7% among the subjects.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Disasters are traumatic events that affect the whole community of individuals and cause widespread destruction and distress, such as loss of life, property, and source of livelihood. The prevalence rate of PTSD related to natural disasters is between 8.6% and 57.3% depending on the severity of the disaster, assessment methodologies and instruments used, and timing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539512453261">16</xref></sup> A statistical review of studies that quantified psychopathology in the aftermath of disasters found a 17% increase in the mean prevalence of psychopathology among victims as compared to predisaster or control groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539512453261">17</xref></sup> In the general population, the prevalence of PTSD is the lowest and is expected to be between 5% and 10%, whereas among direct victims of disasters, the prevalence ranges between 30% and 40%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539512453261">4</xref></sup> In Thailand, the prevalence of tsunami-related PTSD and posttraumatic symptoms varied from 6.3% to 13% among Thai survivors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539512453261">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539512453261"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1010539512453261"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539512453261">21</xref></sup> In our study, the CIS-R assessment after the initial intervention showed a 1% prevalence rate for common mental disorders among the victims. This is a little lower as compared to the findings of Math et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539512453261">22</xref></sup> in Andaman and Nicobar Islands where initial assessments revealed 5% to 8% prevalence of significant mental health problems among the victims.</p>
<p>Some of the reasons for the different rates could be the early interventions in terms of aid and psychosocial support and frequent psychological and behavioral interventions, especially in the first month. The interventions were also aimed to complement ongoing religious and cultural practices in the community. The communities also differed in their level of economic development and social coherence, which would enable recovery from their own internal resources. Thus far, reliable evidence based on culture-specific models of the efficacy of interventions in postdisaster situations is scarce.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539512453261">23</xref></sup> Interventions after disaster should be grounded in ethnocultural beliefs and practices and should be aimed at strengthening prevailing community coping strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539512453261">24</xref></sup> Perhaps there is a need for more culturally grounded interventions that help in victims’ recovery. Furthermore, cognitive behavioral therapy has been found to be effective with Asian survivors but needs to be adapted for cultural and local sensitivities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1010539512453261">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among all the various individual psychological symptoms experienced by the tsunami victims, sleeping disorder was found to be the most common as measured by the CIS-R. In their study on mental health after the tsunami in Sumatra, Indonesia, it was found that in 2004, prior to the tsunami, there were no reported differences in sleeping difficulties across damaged zones (undamaged, moderately damaged, and heavily damaged zones).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539512453261">25</xref></sup> In 2005, the differences across zones were statistically significant. The increase in sleeping difficulties was highest in the most heavily damaged areas, indicating a poorer mental health among the tsunami victims. Furthermore, symptoms of PTSD are known to be strongly linked to the degree of exposure to trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539512453261">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539512453261">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539512453261">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Psychological symptoms also decreased over time as found in our study. This is consistent with other findings of a reported decreased over time in the prevalence of PTSD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539512453261">18</xref></sup> Similarly, in Thailand, the prevalence of tsunami-related PTSD and PTSD symptoms decreased over time. The rate of PTSD was 57.3% at 6 weeks but decreased to 46.1%, 31.6%, 10.4%, and 7.6% at 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years, and 2 years, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1010539512453261">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Public health issues in disasters abound and important areas in public health can contribute in making disaster management more effective and ensure that health and emergency rescue are well managed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1010539512453261">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539512453261">30</xref></sup> Furthermore, a multidisciplinary team with different expertise is required to deal with all issues affecting the victims and to minimize their suffering, grief, and loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1010539512453261">31</xref></sup> The response to mental health issues following a disaster is important in reducing mortality and morbidity. Public health interventions dealing with needs of the victims are needed to be implemented in a timely and coordinated manner to help victims cope with the disaster. Disaster preparedness is most important in enabling rapid intervention to assist in managing the impact of the disaster.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1010539512453261">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Further research is needed in the areas of epidemiology of mental health issues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1010539512453261">33</xref></sup> and suitable psychosocial interventions for disaster victims in Asia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539512453261">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This is a case study report and there are no control groups. This was not a planned study, but a description of an effort to help victims of a sudden natural disaster in a country with no previous exposure to any sudden natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or tsunami. Victims were subjected to the intervention without any pretesting for the presence of common mental disorders. There is insufficient evidence to explain the low rates of common mental disorders among the victims in the follow-ups. In addition to the possible reasons discussed above, a further reason for the low rate could be timing of interviews as the victims did not have a second phase interview using the CIS-R. There is evidence on “debriefing” being traumatic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539512453261">12</xref></sup> and so in the 6 months the victims were not subjected to interviews but reports on them were obtained from the health staff and their case notes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this article suggests that early psychosocial interventions within the first 2 weeks with frequent follow-ups in the first 1 month using simple behavioral techniques may help victims of disasters and that these interventions can be taught to laymen who then through “snowballing” can spread out into the affected community.</p>
