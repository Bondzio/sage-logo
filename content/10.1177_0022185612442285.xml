<abstract>
<p>During 2011, employer associations have been very active in lobbying for legislative change in industrial relations. The changes they are seeking are in line with past policies to diminish collective bargaining and increase managerial control in the workplace. The political and economic contexts have provided opportunities and, with the impending review of the Fair Work Act, encouraged such lobbying for change. While the major employer bodies are adopting similar stances on the need for change, there is diversity in the industrial relations strategies being engaged by employers in individual workplaces.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0022185612442285" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Industrial relations has continued to be a prominent issue for most employers and employer associations during 2011 as they continue to work within the comparatively new legislative framework of the Fair Work Act (FW Act) and, for some, but by no means all, within difficult economic conditions. Among employers there is a variety of approaches being adopted to managing their workforces, as there has been historically: some are continuing to engage with unions and collective bargaining; some are responding to the changed legislative context and engaging with unions where they had not previously; and others are having no interaction with unions but, rather, are determining wages and conditions through a variety of instruments/mechanisms: modern awards, common law contracts, non-union enterprise agreements under the previous regulatory regime.</p>
<p>The leading employer associations together with a small number of individual employers have been conducting a public campaign calling for substantial changes to be made to the FW Act; many of these desired changes are aimed at removing the collective bargaining philosophy that is one of the main thrusts of the Act and curbing the opportunities for unions to enter workplaces and engage in bargaining. Given the industrial relations (IR) regulatory regime that preceded the FW Act, we should not be surprised. The employer groups are rejecting any suggestion that their benchmark for evaluating the current legislation should include a longer history than Work Choices.</p>
<p>The economic and political contexts of 2011 also influenced the actions of employers and employer associations. The decline in product markets for some areas of manufacturing and services concentrated their focus on minimizing costs and optimizing the allocation of labour in terms of hours of work, while the expanding mining and resources sector focused on ensuring an adequate labour supply. Politically, the vulnerability of the minority Labor government and the conflict within the opposition Liberal Party over their stance on IR have encouraged employer association leaders to lobby that much more vociferously for change. And, of course, the focus of their calls is the upcoming review of the Act and modern awards.</p>
<p>Data for this article was gathered primarily from employer association documents (media releases, research and policy papers, submissions to government bodies), media articles and interviews. The author conducted interviews with executives from six national employer bodies in late October as well as a series of interviews in Western Australia (WA) with employer associations in August and September.</p>
<p>The focus of the analysis is primarily on employer associations rather than individual employers, in an attempt to reflect employer views and experiences more broadly. I acknowledge the limitations of relying on the more politically driven representatives of the associations as opposed to those experiencing the workplace directly.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0022185612442285"><title>Economic Context and Labour Supply</title>
    <p>The moderate growth that has been occurring in the Australian economy together with predictions of reasonably steady growth in the immediate future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022185612442285">Reserve Bank, 2011</xref>) disguise the significant variation in outcomes across industries. While mining-related industries are performing strongly, some areas of the manufacturing, construction and services sectors are contracting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185612442285">Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) and Westpac, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022185612442285">Jones, 2011</xref>). Global concerns combined with domestic political and economic uncertainty are creating a lack of confidence, particularly among small businesses in the non-mining sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022185612442285">ACCI, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022185612442285">Reserve Bank, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The mining and resources sector will continue to underpin future economic growth in Australia. Simultaneously, there are grave concerns within manufacturing and some service industries about the high exchange rate that has already resulted in some firms restructuring or shutting down operations, with the consequent termination of employees. Nowhere are these contradictory trends better illustrated than in the highly buoyant WA economy, where full-time employment in mining has grown from 70,600 in August 2008 to 88,700 in August 2011, while manufacturing has decreased from 90,700 to 67,900 over the same period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185612442285">Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), 2011a</xref>: Table 05).</p>
<p>These contrasting economic trends are creating differing labour market and IR challenges. Employers in the mining sector are concerned about labour shortages and upward pressure on wages; employers in other sectors are seeking to reduce labour costs and increase labour efficiencies and productivity. These varying contexts are also influencing which aspects of the FW Act are of concern to each industry.</p>
<p>While much of the recent economic discussion and consequent pressures on government have emanated from the mining and manufacturing sectors, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s (ACCI’s) Service Industries Blueprint released during the year reminds us of the dominance of the services sector in the Australian economy. ACCI estimate that 86% of Australian employees are located in services, with output and employment continuing to grow. For some employers within the services area, certain IR issues are of far greater concern than they might be to employers in other sectors, such as regulation of non-standard employment, payment of penalty rates and low levels of remuneration in the care sector.</p>
<p>Within the labour market, there continue to be reports of pockets of skill shortages primarily in the resources sector and in technical and trades occupations. In general, however, most employers report that labour supply is adequate (interviews with employer associations; Reserve Bank, 2011). The general softening of the labour market has been reflected in the unemployment statistics, which crept up from 4.9% in March 2011 to 5.3% by October. Hours worked have grown from 1600.4 million in October 2010 to 1626.0 million in October 2011, suggesting that employers are making greater use of existing employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185612442285">ABS, 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there has been much less public discussion by employer bodies about labour shortages, there continues to be recognition of the likelihood of skill shortages re-emerging given the demographic profile of the existing workforce. The federal government continues to respond to employer pressures to improve the quantity and quality of labour supply with initiatives targeting skill development and changes in the migration programme aimed at better matching supply to demand. The number of 457 visas issued during 2010/2011 increased by more than 30% on the previous year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185612442285">Department of Immigration and Citizenship, 2011</xref>: 70). Finally, labour cost growth has remained moderate and there is no sign of a looming wages ‘break out’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022185612442285">Reserve Bank, 2011</xref>: 58; see also ABS, 2011c).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0022185612442285"><title>Minimum Wage Fixation: Annual Wage Review</title>
<p>When rereading what I wrote on minimum wage fixation and the employers’ concerns last year, it struck me that I could almost insert the identical commentary for this subsection in 2011. The proposals presented by the various parties to the Minimum Wage Panel of Fair Work Australia reflect the tensions in the wage determination system. The FW Act is premised primarily on enterprise bargaining with the minimum wage serving as a safety net, yet for many Australian employees, the minimum wage increase is likely to be the only source of wage increase beyond potential modern award transitional increases. This group of award-dependent employees is generally low paid and therefore in need of an increase, which will at least maintain the real value of their wages. They also tend to be concentrated in industries that are struggling in the current economic climate (e.g. hospitality and retail) and have been most impacted upon by cost increases associated with the implementation of modern awards.</p>
<p>The Panel determined that the national minimum wage was to increase by 3.4%, effective 1 July 2011, which constituted an increase of AUD$19.40 per week for a full-time employee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022185612442285">Fair Work Australia (FWA), 2011</xref>). The same percentage increase was also applied to modern award minimum wages. The increases proposed in the employer associations’ submissions varied substantially. The Australian Industry (Ai) Group’s recommendation of AUD$14 per week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185612442285">Ai Group, 2011a</xref>) was, as usual, higher than that of other employer associations. ACCI recommended an increase of ‘not more than $9.50 per week’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185612442285">ACCI, 2011c</xref>), while others advocated ‘no increase’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185612442285">Australian Retailers Association (ARA), 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022185612442285">Master Grocers Australia (MGA), 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022185612442285">Restaurant and Catering Australia (RCA), 2011</xref>). The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), on the other hand, recommended an increase of AUD$28 per week for workers up to C10 level and 4.2% above C10. Both the Ai Group and the ACCI emphasized the safety net aspect of the minimum wage and argued the need for keeping the increase modest so as to encourage enterprise agreement-making.</p>
<p>The submissions from the employer associations highlighted the inter- and intra-industry differences in terms of capacity to pay. The three retail groups documented the difficulties being experienced in their sector, and the Australian Hotels Association (AHA) described the hospitality industry as having ‘a three speed economy’, with the bulk of the industry’s workers being in that part of the sector that was suffering from a decline in business (AHA, 2011: 7; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022185612442285">Australian National Retailers Association (ANRA), 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185612442285">ARA, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022185612442285">National Retail Association (NRA), 2011</xref>). The National Farmers' Federation (NFF) reported a vast improvement in agriculture, with the average farm income projected to increase by almost 41% in 2010/2011, while acknowledging that this masked a grimmer picture for some individual farmers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022185612442285">NFF, 2011</xref>). Some then extrapolated from these differing economic circumstances that there should be differentiated outcomes in the minimum wage determination depending on capacity to pay (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185612442285">ACCI, 2011c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185612442285">ARA, 2011</xref>) or, in the case of those employers affected by recent natural disasters, to have any increase deferred.</p>
<p>The Panel rejected the claims for special treatment and, in particular, pointed out the practical difficulty of identifying those employers who would be entitled to a delay in the operative date of the minimum wage increase due to natural disasters, the consequent risk of unfairness if groups were not targeted correctly, and that such a deferral would place a substantial burden on some of the low paid who would also be suffering from the effects of the floods and cyclone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022185612442285">Fair Work Australia, 2011</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0022185612442285"><title>Political Context</title>
<p>The major employer associations have been lobbying very publicly throughout 2011 for changes to the FW Act. Much of this has been couched in terms of the need to improve productivity and flexibility. Facing a government and opposition who both seemed reluctant to commit to any change in IR legislation, the employer associations initially sought recognition of the need for changes. In addition, the leaders of a number of the employer associations detailed the types of changes that they were seeking (see later in this article). Some sections of the media (notably <italic>The Australian</italic>) have supported the employer associations’ campaign for regulatory change by not only giving coverage to their calls, but also publishing their own opinion pieces highlighting similar issues with the FW Act as perceived by the employer bodies.</p>
<p>While the Australian Mines and Metals Association (AMMA) leadership has been highly critical of the Act from its inception, the level of criticism emanating from the ACCI and particularly the Ai Group in 2011 was noteworthy compared to the Labor government’s first term. ACCI’s criticism was perhaps not surprising given their past stances on industrial relations reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022185612442285">Sheldon and Thornthwaite, 2003</xref>: 241–243). The timing of the increase in public criticism from the employer associations is unsurprising given the impending reviews of the FW Act and modern awards, but it was also undoubtedly fed by the political turmoil occurring at the federal level. The Labor Party governing as a minority government dependent on the support of Independent members of parliament in the House of Representatives and the Greens in the Senate was constantly under attack from the opposition, aiming to prevent the government from serving a full term. Consequently, both of the major parties could be described as being in ongoing election mode, constantly aware of polls.</p>
<p>While the government has maintained that they have no intention of making major changes to the FW Act, the calls for change from the employer bodies have been more problematic for the opposition, particularly the Liberal Party. The leader of the opposition’s stated position that ‘statutory individual agreements were once our policy but no longer are’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185612442285">Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC), 2011</xref>), combined with his reluctance to identify any changes that they would advocate for the FW Act, has been attacked publicly by employer association leaders (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185612442285">Anderson, 2011a</xref>) as well as others within his party. Peter Reith, a former IR minister in the Howard government, published opinion pieces in <italic>The Sydney Morning Herald</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022185612442285">Reith, 2011a</xref>) and <italic>The Australian Financial Review</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022185612442285">Reith, 2011b</xref>), as well as speaking on radio and television denigrating Abbott’s ‘do nothing’ IR policy and itemizing aspects of the Act that needed changing from his point of view.</p>
<p>In the past, employer association leaders might have appealed to the Democrats when they held the balance of power in the Senate. The Greens, however, are advocating changes to the legislation quite contrary to the employers’ espoused reform agenda and, hence, are cause for further concern to the employer association lobbyists. As a consequence, the Ai Group is encouraging the government and opposition to find common ground, an unlikely scenario in the current political climate.</p>
<p>Finally, in considering the political context, it is worth reflecting on the relations between the employer associations and the federal government as well as the relations between the associations themselves. On the latter point, there continues to be ongoing rivalry between a number of the associations who are competing for members, which adds to their drive to maximize press coverage. This competition around policy activism between organizations is of course not new (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022185612442285">Sheldon and Thornthwaite, 2004</xref>). In terms of relations with the federal government, the Ai Group’s Chief Executive’s close relationship with both Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard has been much commented upon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022185612442285">Jackman, 2011</xref>). In the early period of the Labor Government, the Ai Group benefitted from Heather Ridout’s closeness to government, while the ACCI found itself out of favour. The government’s appointment in September of Peter Anderson, Chief Executive of ACCI, to the board of Skills Australia indicated improving relations.</p>
<p>During 2011, Ridout was a more strident critic of the FW Act. Given the Ai Group’s significant involvement in drafting the Act, this was perceived by some as a change of position. While the Ai Group explain their more recent barrage of criticism as the consequence of monitoring the outcomes for their members, others view it in terms of Ridout’s belated acknowledgement of the need to distance herself from the government in order to best represent her members. There is an interesting parallel here with the debate that occurred around the ACTU’s close relationship with the federal Labor government, particularly during the years of the Accord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022185612442285">Ewer et al., 1991</xref>); does an employer association or union best represent its members’ interests by gaining entry to the inner circle of the government’s leaders or does such closeness inevitably result in perceived acquiescence to government policy? As the year drew to an end, Heather Ridout was appointed to the Reserve Bank board and announced her decision to leave her position with the Ai Group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022185612442285">Skulley, 2011</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0022185612442285"><title>Productivity</title>
<p>During 2011, employers expressed major concern about Australia’s declining productivity. Low rates of productivity growth have been a problem for the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185612442285">Eslake, 2011</xref>); perhaps following the Global Financial Crisis, management are finding that they need to focus more carefully on this issue as revenue generation is now more difficult. Some might also comment that it is not coincidental that the discussion on productivity and deregulation of the labour market is occurring in the context of an imminent review of the FW Act; after all, it is much more palatable to propose changes in terms of ‘productivity’ than ‘cutting costs’.</p>
<p>Employers are acknowledging correctly that productivity growth is dependent upon much more than IR legislation; however, they are linking problems in workplace productivity directly to the FW Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612442285">Argus, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022185612442285">Bradley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022185612442285">Ridout, 2011a</xref>). So what is it within the FW Act that is detracting from productivity? The Ai Group has articulated a list of provisions that they perceive as barriers to productivity: restrictions on the use of contractors and on-hire workers; ‘lack of a workable form of agreement which provides flexibility’; increased union power; transfer of business provisions; and the General Protections provisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022185612442285">Ridout, 2011a</xref>). The retail sector has identified the increase in penalty rates; John Lloyd, former head of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and now director of the Work Reform and Productivity Unit at the free market lobbying think-tank the Institute of Public Affairs, called for individual agreements and performance-based rewards in preference to collective bargaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022185612442285">Kerr, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>There is a lack of explanation accompanying these calls for change linking the outcome to increased productivity; many of these items appear to be more related to employers gaining greater control over their workplaces and reducing labour costs. Such employer goals are unsurprising and are in line with a long-standing pattern of employer association policy and campaigning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022185612442285">Sheldon and Thornthwaite, 1999</xref>; see also earlier annual reviews of employer matters in the <italic>Journal of Industrial Relations</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022185612442285">Sheldon and Thornthwaite (1999–2003)</xref> and, later, by Hearn MacKinnon (2004–2009)). Employers enjoyed freedom from many of these constraints during the Work Choices era, yet there was a slump in productivity growth during that time. Indeed, when the FWA President, Justice Giudice, mapped the productivity growth rate to the major changes in industrial regulation in Australia over the past 15 years, he concluded that it was difficult ‘to establish any direct link between the type of industrial regulation and productivity growth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022185612442285">Giudice, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>There is evidence that many managers have little knowledge of the productivity performance of their own organizations. The results from the CEO PULSE survey of 147 organizations and the Telstra Productivity Indicator survey of 350 organizations indicate that productivity is a high priority within these organizations, but most are not measuring it or able to state whether they have achieved significant productivity improvement during the past year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022185612442285">Gottliebsen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022185612442285">Telstra, 2011</xref>). Similarly, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022185612442285">Productivity Commission (2011: xxix)</xref> commented in relation to the retail sector ‘that many retail employers and their employees have not used past and current workplace regulations to examine how their workplace practices can be improved’.</p>
<p>National statistics indicate a nationwide problem in the lack of productivity growth, but analysis of this problem indicates great variance across industries. Analysts have identified the mining industry as the worst-performing industry in terms of productivity decline during the past decade, followed by gas, water and electricity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022185612442285">Richardson and Dennis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022185612442285">Sloan, 2011</xref>). Industrial relations and labour flexibility are not identified as the contributing factors in these sectors; indeed, the mining industry was one of the greatest users of Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs).</p>
<p>In sum, there is a clear need for much more careful thinking by many employers to identify strategies to improve workplace productivity based on analysis linking changes with outcomes, rather than the current unsubstantiated general claims being made about productivity and the FW Act. It is essential that the pursuit of productivity improvements be balanced with considerations of fair outcomes for employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022185612442285">Green, 1996</xref>). Some changes may involve short-term cost reductions, but these do not lead to long-term efficiency gains and can be counterproductive in engaging employees and unions in the pursuit of productivity. The process by which improved productivity outcomes are achieved is critical to its sustainability; the ‘high-performance workplace’ literature confirms the need for collaboration between management and the workforce (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022185612442285">Osterman, 1994</xref>). This leads us into a more detailed consideration of the employers’ view of the FW Act.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0022185612442285"><title>The Fair Work Act</title>
<p>As indicated earlier, many employers and employer associations have been calling for changes to the FW Act. Employers claim that some of the outcomes of the Act are impacting detrimentally on productivity, flexibility, costs and international reputation. At the same time, a number of employer association interviewees expressed the hope that there would not be major change to the legislation as members were suffering ‘change fatigue’ and still struggling to implement the previous set of changes. And, not surprisingly, while there are some aspects of the Act that a number of employer groups identify as wanting to be modified, each industry is also prioritizing different components.</p>
<p>For many employers in the services sector, the modern awards are their primary focus. Grumbles still abound about the complexity of the transitional wages calculations, but most criticism focuses on the regulation of work hours: the stipulation of ordinary hours and the consequent payment of penalty rates; provisions relating to the scheduling and payment of extra hours of work for part-time and/or casual employees; and minimum hours of engagement requirements. Clearly, the awards regulate such employers’ use of labour and curb the flexibility that some had prior to the FW Act. While the resultant increase in costs, particularly for small- and medium-sized organizations in sectors such as retail, hospitality, cleaning and care, may have serious financial implications for employers, the removal or reduction in regulation would impact on the quality of life of their employees, many of whom are low paid. Therefore, any proposed solutions need to be considered carefully. At a broader level, the Western Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s (CCIWA’s) proposal to reduce regulation by rationalizing the number and content of awards with the potential goal of transferring the resultant core conditions into the National Employment Standards (NES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612442285">CCIWA, 2011</xref>) contrasts with those employers and employer groups who espouse industry-based regulation. For some employers, awards provide the possibility for regulatory differentiation between industries; others deem them to be the ‘level playing field’ within the industry.</p>
<p>Much employer discussion about the FW Act has centred on bargaining. Reports continue of employers who previously relied on individual contracts (statutory or common law) now engaging in collective bargaining with their employees; for example, Virgin Australia’s agreement with long-haul pilots and flight attendants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022185612442285"><italic>Workplace Express</italic>, 2011a</xref>). Many employers continue to bargain collectively with unions as they had done historically and, in addition, some employers are making agreements without union involvement to override aspects of the award not suited to their workplaces. On the other hand, all employer representative bodies and many employers have criticized the form, process and outcomes of bargaining under the FW Act. At the heart of many of the complaints has been the Act’s emphasis on collective bargaining and the enhanced rights for unions in the bargaining process; many do not want to negotiate a collective agreement and simply do not want to bargain with unions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022185612442285">ACCI (2011b: 57)</xref> questioned the appropriateness of the emphasis on collective bargaining for the private sector with low union density: ‘The assumed or dominant paradigm of collectivism in the new system does not reflect the contemporary reality of the majority of Australian service industry workplaces.’</p>
<p>The major employer bodies have called for a broader range of agreement-making options, in particular, the reintroduction of statutory individual agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185612442285">AMMA, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185612442285">CCIWA, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022185612442285">Ridout, 2011a</xref>). AMMA has also advocated strongly for the reinstatement of non-union greenfield agreements in response to unions forcing concessions in enterprise agreements in research projects. Even though only a small percentage of employees were covered by AWAs historically, the clamour for statutory individual agreements is not surprising given the significance of the statutory individual agreement as a weapon in the employers’ bargaining armoury when negotiating with unions.</p>
<p>Clearly, many employers are choosing not to negotiate enterprise agreements and this is generally for one of the following reasons: lack of interest or resources to do so; or wanting to avoid the possibility of union involvement in their workplace. For small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are unlikely to have the expertise in house, to negotiate an enterprise agreement can be costly or, as one employer described it, ‘scary’. While the major employer associations continue to recommend enterprise-level bargaining as the means by which individual employers may bring about desired changes and maximize productivity, some employers are simply seeking a mechanism to set wages and conditions, an outcome that can be achieved through the modern awards or common law contracts. And, as discussed elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022185612442285">Cooper and Ellem, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022185612442285">Todd, 2011</xref>), some employers would prefer an industry-wide agreement so as to take wages and conditions out of competition.</p>
<p>Employers and employer associations have expressed dissatisfaction with a number of aspects of the bargaining process. For SMEs, the complexity of the bargaining framework can be an issue but, in the main, employer association concerns focus around enhanced union capacity in the bargaining process. The implementation of the FW Act has resulted in a number of process-related complaints by employers, including: being forced to bargain when they had no desire to negotiate an enterprise agreement; union involvement in the bargaining process when they represented only a small minority of employees in the workplace; aspects of the majority support determination provisions; and the scope of agreements being extended beyond the intention of the employer. Employer groups have also indicated a number of concerns in relation to the outcomes: the lack of productivity trade-offs; clauses restricting the engagement of contractors and labour hire employees; the lack of ‘meaningful’ flexibility clauses; and the inclusion of a wider array of union-related clauses in agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185612442285">Ai Group, 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185612442285">AMMA, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022185612442285"><italic>Workplace Express</italic>, 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of bargaining-related cases emerged during the year of particular significance to employers. In the ADJ contracting case, the FWA Full Bench decided that it was lawful to include a clause in the pattern agreement for the Victorian electrical contracting industry that required contracting out to be at agreement rates and conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022185612442285"><italic>Workplace Express</italic>, 2011c</xref>). This decision is being challenged by the Ai Group in the Federal Court. The JJ Richards case was also viewed with alarm by employers. The FWA Full Bench upheld the right of a union when facing an employer who refuses to bargain to commence protected industrial action without having obtained a majority support determination (<italic>JJ Richards &amp; Sons Pty Ltd and another v Transport Workers' Union of Australia</italic> [<italic>2011</italic>] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185612442285"><italic>FWAFB 3377</italic> 1 June 2011</xref>). Employers would have been more satisfied with the outcome in the ‘Will Tracey’ case relating to union officials acting as bargaining representatives in workplaces beyond their union’s representational rights. The FWA Full Bench upheld an appeal by Technip and CCIWA to quash an earlier ruling that Technip recognize Will Tracey, an official with the Maritime Union of Australia, as a bargaining representative on the grounds that Tracey was an official with a union not able to represent the workers concerned (<italic>Technip Oceania Pty Ltd v W. Tracey</italic> [<italic>2011</italic>] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185612442285"><italic>FWAFB 6551</italic> 7 November 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, an interesting decision emerged in relation to Pilbara iron in which the Federal Court Full Bench deemed that a five-year non-union agreement made by Rio Tinto subsidiary Pilbara Iron with 10 employees engaged in July 2008 never came into operation. This meant that current employees who were thought to be covered by the agreement could negotiate a new agreement, and raised doubts about the validity of pre-FW Act agreements on other mine sites (<italic>Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Pilbara Iron Company (Services</italic>) <italic>Pty Ltd</italic> [<italic>2011</italic>] <italic>FCAFC 91</italic> 25 July 2011). The major employer associations are investing large amounts into challenging such cases, as was evidenced by AMMA’s call to its members to establish a AUD$500,000 fund for such purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022185612442285">Hannan, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, employers and employer associations particularly object to the increased union power granted under the FW Act. National employer bodies have been vociferous in their complaints about union actions, suggesting that the unions have become more ‘emboldened’ or confrontational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185612442285">Kates, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022185612442285">Ridout, 2011b</xref>; interviews). Evidence of increased adversarial action by unions was cited in terms of the findings in surveys of employers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185612442285">Kates, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022185612442285">Ridout, 2011a</xref>) as well as in the increase in working days lost due to industrial action for the September 2011 quarter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185612442285">ABS, 2011d</xref>). Some interviewees suggested that there is an increasing incidence of unlawful industrial behaviour by unions. In addition, one interviewee observed that disputes now tend to be not so much about wages, but rather about management’s prerogative to employ casuals, contractors or labour hire personnel and to outsource work.</p>
<p>There is of course a contrasting picture of employers reporting collaborative working relations with unions – for example, the National Australia Bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022185612442285">O’Brien, 2011</xref>) – and some negotiating agreements with unions where previously they had had non-union agreements – for example, Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines Pty Ltd’s enterprise agreement negotiated with the Australian Workers’ Union. The interviews with the cross-section of employer associations in WA produced a variety of views of the unions in their sectors: in a number of industries, there was minimal evidence of union activity and they were not considered to be a major issue; in other sectors, unions were described as being much more aggressive and therefore a major problem.</p>
<p>Much of the employer concern about union action relates to their perception of the change in the balance of power between the IR actors due to the introduction and implementation of the FW Act. In considering the power of the IR actors, it is worth digressing at this point to reflect briefly on the Qantas dispute, which arose during 2011. During protracted enterprise bargaining negotiations, Qantas pilots, engineers and baggage handlers, via their unions, focused on job security and improved conditions in response to Qantas’s business strategy of increasingly relocating work offshore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022185612442285">Thompson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022185612442285"><italic>Workplace Express</italic>, 2011d</xref>). The unions engaged in overtime bans and ongoing brief work stoppages, which disrupted Qantas flights regularly and impacted reportedly on the airline commercially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022185612442285"><italic>Workplace Express</italic>, 2011e</xref>). Qantas management eventually responded by grounding the airline without notice and forewarning of a lockout of employees. Qantas’s strategy was successful in terminating the unions’ industrial campaign, with the dispute being referred to FWA for a 21-day period of negotiation to be followed by arbitration. The Qantas strategy of replacing protracted enterprise bargaining with the intervention of FWA has once again raised the role of arbitration in settling disputes. Qantas, and subsequently the Victorian Government in their dispute with the nurses, sought the intervention of an industrial tribunal contrary to the general thrust of employer bodies for the past several decades to minimize or extinguish the role of such third parties. Subsequently, unions have called for an increased role for arbitration in workplace disputes, which national employer associations are eschewing vigorously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022185612442285">Tingle, 2011</xref>). In the context of a discussion on union power, the Qantas dispute certainly illustrated the ability of the unions in this instance to use other forms of industrial action than strikes to inflict serious damage on an employer, but it also reminded employees and unions of an employer’s ultimate industrial weapon, that is, to shut down their business.</p>
<p>In concluding this discussion on the employers’ and employer associations’ concerns with the implementation of the FW Act, other areas in which there has been substantial employer angst have been provisions relating to the transfer of business, unfair dismissal and General Protections. Employers are reporting growing unfair dismissal and General Protections claims, with many of these claims perceived as speculative and often pressuring employers to make a financial settlement rather than risk proceeding in FWA. Hence, employers are seeking legislative change particularly to the transfer of business and General Protections components of the Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185612442285">AMMA, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185612442285">Anderson, 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022185612442285">Ridout, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022185612442285"><italic>Workplace Express</italic> 2011b</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0022185612442285"><title>Other Matters: The Construction Industry and Care Sector Remuneration</title>
<p>The employers in both the construction and social and community care (SACS) industries are awaiting decisions that will have significant workplace relations implications for their sectors.</p>
<p>Employers in the SACS sector are awaiting finalization of the equal remuneration case following the determination by the Full Bench of FWA on 16 May 2011 that SACS employees are paid at a lower level than their counterparts in the public sector partly due to their gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185612442285">FWAFB, 2011</xref>). Parties are continuing to negotiate the remedy to be awarded in this first case brought under the FW Act’s equal remuneration order provisions. The federal government committed AUD$2b to fund its component of the increases so as to allay employers’ concerns about affording the increases. Employers can expect to benefit from the decision in terms of attraction and retention of labour, although given that the implementation of the pay rise is to be staggered over six years, this benefit will not be apparent for some time. In the meantime, employers in other areas of care – childcare and aged care – may expect substantial claims to increase the remuneration of employees in their sectors, with the question of capacity to pay rising to the fore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022185612442285">Bita, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Turning to the construction industry, the federal government’s proposal to replace the Australian Building and Construction Commission with the Fair Work Building Industry inspectorate continues to hang over the sector. The government introduced the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Amendment (Transition to Fair Work) Bill 2011 to the federal parliament in early November and it was subsequently referred to a senate committee for further consideration. The Greens have indicated that they will move amendments to the Bill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022185612442285"><italic>Workplace Express</italic>, 2011f)</xref>, so negotiations on the passage of the legislation will continue when parliament resumes in 2012. Despite the lobbying of the Master Builders Association (MBA) and other major employer associations, the new Bill retains much of the 2009 Bill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0022185612442285">Todd, 2010</xref>), although at this point it reduces the sunset clause, whereby the coercive powers will be removed automatically, from five to three years. The MBA continues to oppose the changes citing ‘the increasing incidence of unlawful industrial behavior and industrial practices’ and the recent union prosecutions for illegal behaviour in the construction sector as evidence of the continuing need for the existing legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185612442285">Harnisch, 2011</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0022185612442285" sec-type="discussion|conclusion"><title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>Workplace relations has been a major issue for employers and employer associations in 2011 due to continuing encounters with the comparatively new FW Act combined with the contrasting economic trends being experienced. The dominant issues vary by industry, reflecting differing patterns of how wages and conditions are determined, relations with the relevant union(s) and varying product market situations. For instance, many employers in the services sector are focused primarily on clauses in the modern awards, whereas the primary IR concern of their counterparts in the construction and resources sectors is the role of unions at their worksites.</p>
<p>While there is diversity in the IR strategies being engaged by employers in individual workplaces, the major national employer associations are very homogeneous in their lobbying for regulatory change. With the impending reviews of the FW Act and the modern awards, the growth in public criticism from the associations’ leaders and the flurry of noise linking low workplace productivity with the need for changes to the Act is not surprising. The employers, and indeed the unions, would prefer to shift the frontier of control in the workplace in their favour; the employer bodies’ lobbying is also aimed undoubtedly at countering the pressure emanating from the unions to make changes to the FW Act that would better suit their interests.</p>
<p>The FW Act does not stray far from the IR vision espoused by the leading Australian employer associations for the past several decades – decentralized setting of wages and conditions; a reduced role for unions and tribunals; and constraints on industrial action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022185612442285">Thornthwaite and Sheldon, 2011</xref>). The employer groups, however, are clearly adopting the former Work Choices regime as their benchmark for assessing the FW Act, a regime that ensured greater restraints on union activity and minimal curbs on managerial prerogative.</p>
<p>The employers’ analysis of contemporary IR is focusing almost solely on economic outcomes and, in particular, an employer’s capacity to pay; engagement with broader social policy is largely missing. For example, most employer group submissions to the minimum wage annual review presented grim pictures of each industry’s capacity to pay an increase; similarly, discussions about clauses in the Act, or decisions from FWA relating to job security or flexibility, focus on the needs of the firm with little or no acknowledgement of the often conflicting interests of employees.</p>
<p>The employer associations stress the importance of increasing productivity, developing a future for manufacturing and a sustainable services sector. It is difficult to see how these will be resolved by increasing managerial prerogative. Proposals that recognize the plurality of interests – sometimes conflicting – are more likely to lead to a collaborative workplace relations model, the precursor for outcomes that might eventually be accepted by both parties as being fair.</p></sec>
