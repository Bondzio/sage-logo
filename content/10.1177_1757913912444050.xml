<p>This is a valuable book from an African laboratory technician who specialises in the issue of antibiotic resistance. She presents the perspective of ordinary people with infectious disease in resource-poor settings, and the challenges facing their carers; both rare viewpoints in the current policy debate around African healthcare. European-style medicine as practiced in rural Africa rarely involves trained clinicians applying their knowledge to diagnose the cause of illness and recommend an effective treatment; nowadays over-worked and under-trained clinicians guess at aetiology and immediately dispense low-cost medicines which may not fit the disease. Professor Okeke links this situation to the geopolitical causes of the chronic underfunding of African health facilities which not only affects the life expectancy of children who catch common treatable infections but also, in these globalised times, impacts the risks of local establishment and international spread of some of the most dangerous diseases known to science such as Ebola and Marburg. As Okeke says:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>“Viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks are promoted by the prevalent mode of medical practice in which etiology is only of interest when a cure fails, and not always even then. Because of the challenges associated with infection control and patient diagnosis, in typical African haemorrhagic fever epidemics the death toll is high and the spread throughout the hospital has already begun before the cause of the outbreak is known or even suspected.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Okeke advocates that laboratory services are not a luxury in resource-poor settings, but should contribute an affordable and practicable component of higher quality medical practice, by reducing the blind prescribing of unsuitable medicaments which results in drug-resistant infections and avoidable mortality due to misdiagnosis.</p>
<p>This is an unusual text on some neglected issues which are becoming so grave that ignoring them may soon be impossible.</p>
