<abstract>
<p>The premise of the cultural congruence hypothesis is that the level of congruence between democratic values among the public and in political institutions of a country is an important indication of political stability: the greater the congruence, the greater the stability. Though this hypothesis was proposed almost fifty years ago, it has never been fully examined. A crucial weakness of the hypothesis is that it is blind to the direction of incongruence: instability increases if the public has either more or less freedom relative to their expectations. But based on what we learn from Prospect Theory, one may expect to find different behaviors in these two situations. The empirical analyses that follow confirm this expectation. The article also evaluates the congruence hypothesis in light of the institutional hypothesis. Rather than seeing these hypotheses as competing, the authors claim that it is more productive to focus on the interaction between them, thus improving their understanding of political stability.</p>

<p>The promotion of democracy is one of the most important policy issues in national and international political arenas. When the question of whether countries or political organizations should try to promote democracy in other countries—whether in the Middle East or in the states of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics—the question always arises of how democratization will affect the stability of the state. In recent decades, this question has been of interest to both scholars and politicians. The studies conducted in this field present a rather confusing picture for policy makers: while democracy, in the long run, is strongly correlated with political stability, processes of democratization in some circumstances can destabilize political systems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022002712446127">Gurr 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022002712446127">Muller and Seligson 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022002712446127">Muller and Weede 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022002712446127">Hegre et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022002712446127">King and Zeng 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022002712446127">Fearon and Laitin 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022002712446127">Gates et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022002712446127">Cederman, Hug, and Krebs 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The literature offers two different approaches for the relationship between democratization and political stability. The first is the institutional hypothesis. According to scholars taking this approach, it is the political regime that affects stability most (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022002712446127">Goldstone et al. 2010</xref>). Changes in institutions lead to changes in individual values; at the end of the process, political stability increases, since democracies are more stable than nondemocracies. The second is the cultural congruence hypothesis (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022002712446127">Almond and Verba 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022002712446127">Eckstein 1969</xref>). It sees not the institution alone, but rather the congruence or incongruence between the values of the people and political institutions as the important indicator of stability.</p>
<p>The study confronts these two perspectives, theoretically and empirically. While much scholarly attention has been paid over the years to the institutional hypothesis, much less work has been done on the cultural congruence hypothesis. This article offers such an empirical examination of the cultural congruence hypothesis. From theoretical and empirical points of view, we believe that a major revision should be made to it, since the relationship between cultural congruence and political stability is more complex than that originally suggested. Specifically, according to the original hypothesis, the greater the incongruence between the democratic values of the people and the level of freedom provided by political institutions, the more unstable the country will be, regardless of whether people receive less freedom than they desire, or more. Based on what we learn about human behavior from Prospect Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022002712446127">Kahneman and Tversky 1979</xref>), one may expect to find different behaviors in these two groups. The empirical analyses that follow support this expectation: in countries where citizens receive less freedom than they would like, a greater incongruence between the values of the public and of political institutions correlates with greater instability. This finding is in accordance with the original congruence hypothesis. But in countries, where citizens receive more freedom than they ask for, the correlation between incongruence and stability is reversed: an increase in the level of incongruence increases stability. Further analysis shows that this pattern occurs mostly among nondemocracies. This latter finding reveals an interesting interaction between the main elements of the institutional and the cultural congruence hypotheses, and it suggests that the two do not necessarily compete, but might supplement each other.</p>

<title>Cultural Congruence and Political Stability</title>
<p>One way or another, almost all great political philosophers, from the political realist Machiavelli through Hobbes and Burke, to Marx and his observations on capitalism, were highly interested in the causes and effects of political stability, defined as a state’s ability to respond to internal conflicts and crises and to maintain its authority patterns (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022002712446127">Gurr 1974</xref>; Hurwitz 1973; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022002712446127">Kaufman, Kraay, and Mastruzzi 2009</xref>). The current literature offers two main hypotheses to explain political stability. One is focused on institutional coherence. The institutional hypothesis attempts to provide a parsimonious yet comprehensive explanation for a unique structure of political stability as identified by scholars. Focusing on the level of democracy of political regimes, as well as regimes’ coherence (i.e., both fully democratic and fully autocratic regimes are coherent, all others are incoherent; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022002712446127">Jaggers and Gurr 1995</xref>, 478; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022002712446127">Goldstone et al. 2010</xref>), these studies identify a U-shape structure in which countries at the democratic and at the autocratic ends of the regime-type continuum are more stable, while hybrid semidemocracies in between are less so. Instability is defined in these studies either as the rate of domestic conflict and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022002712446127">Gurr 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022002712446127">Muller and Weede 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022002712446127">King and Zeng 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022002712446127">Fearon and Laitin 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022002712446127">Goldstone et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022002712446127">Cederman, Hug, and Krebs 2010</xref>) or as regime change and duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022002712446127">Gates et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022002712446127">Goldstone et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The institutional hypothesis derives from the argument that “political stability is anchored in institutional consistency” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022002712446127">Gates et al. 2006</xref>, 907; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022002712446127">Huntington 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022002712446127">Eckstein 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022002712446127">Gurr 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022002712446127">Jaggers and Gurr 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022002712446127">Hegre et al. 2001</xref>). As explained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022002712446127">King and Zeng (2001</xref>), scholars assume that stability is maintained in both autocracies and democracies because in the former, political institutions efficiently repress differences between the government and the people, while in the latter, democratic institutions are capable of adjusting to government policies quickly enough to prevent dissent. In contrast, in semidemocracies (known also as anocracies) such differences are expressed by the public to some extent because repression is only partial; yet, the institutions are not capable of adjusting government policies to peoples’ demands quickly enough, and hence the risk of instability increases. These, according to the institutional hypothesis, are the causes of the U-shape structure of stability, which is higher in autocracies and democracies at the ends of the political spectrum, but lower in anocracies at the middle. Interestingly, some scholars, while focusing their attention on political repression rather than on political stability, also recognize nonlinear relationships between political institutions and their dependent variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022002712446127">Davenport 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022002712446127">2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022002712446127">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The institutional hypothesis can therefore be stated in two similar ways:

</list>
An alternative explanation offered in the literature for political stability is the cultural congruence hypothesis. This dates back to Almond and Verba’s <italic>The Civic Culture </italic>(1963). Its main argument is that “political institutions must be consistent with the citizens’ value orientations or they will not be seen as legitimate, and their stability will be low” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022002712446127">Inglehart and Welzel 2005</xref>, 186; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0022002712446127">Verba 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022002712446127">Eckstein 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022002712446127">Reisinger 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022002712446127">Almond et al. (2000</xref>) explain that “it is difficult to sustain democracy in a nation lacking participatory democrats, just as it is difficult to sustain an authoritarian country if the citizens become politically sophisticated and want to participate” (p. 54). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022002712446127">Eckstein (1969</xref>) maintains that a regime’s stability “might be held to depend on the degree of resemblance between social and governmental authority patterns, in which case the crucial <italic>x</italic> variable would be one involving both government and society simultaneously” (p. 277).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022002712446127">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The central difference between the two hypotheses is that the cultural congruence approach prioritizes personal values and the congruence between these values and institutions as the main source of stability, whereas the institutional hypothesis prioritizes the activity, performance, and coherence of institutions. These hypotheses should be seen as complementary rather than competing, however. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022002712446127">Rohrschneider (1999</xref>), both the congruence postulate and the perceived performance of institutions, jointly influence an individual’s support of institutions and this, in turn has an impact on the institutions’ stability and durability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022002712446127">Almond et al. (2000</xref>, 277) similarly argue that “[p]olitical structures and political culture are mutually reinforcing in stable political systems.”</p>
<p>As we have said, although proposed in the 1960s, the cultural congruence hypothesis was not empirically tested at all until recently. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022002712446127">Reisinger (1995</xref>) explains that due to theoretical and empirical difficulties (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0022002712446127">Warwick 1990</xref>), political culture analysis has focused on the impact of indicators drawn from this literature on political stability, rather than on the effect of congruence between political culture and political institutions. Inglehart’s analysis of democratic stability (1990; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022002712446127">Granato, Inglehat, and Leblang 1996</xref>) represents this body of research best.</p>
<p>What seems to be the only empirical examination of the cultural congruence-stability hypothesis was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022002712446127">Inglehart and Welzel (2005</xref>, 186-91). They approached the problem of defining cultural congruence empirically, in an elegant and innovative way. They looked at the level of incongruence as the difference between the supply of freedom (the country’s level of democracy) and the demand for freedom (the level of democratic values held by the people). They found that the level of incongruence between supply and demand predicts moves toward more or less democracy in the expected way (where instability is defined as regime change and duration, as discussed above). Specifically, a surplus in the demand for democracy leads toward transition to democracy, while a deficit in the demand for democracy leads toward a transition away from it. Their findings seem to support the main premises of the cultural congruence hypothesis: any cultural incongruence, be it a surplus or a deficit, leads to an institutional change. Yet, they also found, as they expected, different behaviors of countries depending on their surplus-deficit condition (the effect of incongruence on institutional change is stronger in the demand-surplus area). Notably, the cultural congruence hypothesis is blind to such distinctions of direction, since the only thing it analyzes is the absolute value of incongruence between institutions and the values of the public, regardless of whether the values of the public are more democratic than the institutions, or vice versa. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022002712446127">Inglehart and Welzel’s (2005)</xref> pioneering study therefore emphasizes the need for further explorations in similar directions.</p>

<sec id="section2-0022002712446127">
<title>Revisiting the Cultural Congruence Hypothesis: The Effects of Gains and Losses</title>
<p>The original cultural congruence (Hypothesis 3) hypothesis can be stated as follows: the greater the congruence between the democratic values of individuals and the level of democracy of political institutions in a country, the greater the political stability of that country, and vice versa.</p>
<p>As noted, the hypothesis is blind to the direction of incongruence; political stability is likely to be low whether the institutions offer much more democracy than the people wish to have (demand deficit) or much less (demand surplus). This expectation is open to question, however. Will publics that receive more public good (i.e., freedom) than they asked for, be likely to risk political stability in an attempt to change political institutions as much as publics that receive less public good than they asked for?</p>
<p>A decade after the presentation of the cultural congruence hypothesis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022002712446127">Kahneman and Tversky (1979</xref>) proposed their prospect theory, which provides a good theoretical base from which to answer this question, as well as an important link between the cultural congruence hypothesis and the institutional hypothesis. In brief, the elements of the theory which are relevant for us are threefold: first, people derive utility from gains and losses relative to a reference point, and not from objective conditions. Second, individuals tend to be risk averse in the gain domain but risk seeking in the loss domain. Hence, people will be liable to undertake risky behaviors when they perceive themselves as suffering losses, while the perception of gains induces risk aversion and prudence. It follows that, third, the effect of loss on utility is larger than that of a gain of the same size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022002712446127">Kahneman and Tversky 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022002712446127">Levy 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022002712446127">McDermott 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022002712446127">Mercer 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>To apply prospect theory as an explanation of the effects of cultural incongruence on political stability, one must make one assumption: a public that receives more freedom than they asked for (demand deficit) are in a state of gain, while others that receive less freedom than they asked for (demand surplus) are in a state of loss. That is, this assumption sees freedom—the extent to which formal civil and political liberties are institutionalized and exercised—as a public good.</p>
<p>Based on prospect theory, one would expect that a public in a state of loss (demand surplus) are more prone to engage in activities that would risk their country’s political stability compared with a public in a state of gain (demand deficit). The latter group would be expected, according to prospect theory, to be risk averters, and therefore may avoid destabilizing behavior altogether.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022002712446127">4</xref></sup> In other words (and as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022002712446127">Figure 1</xref>), Hypothesis 4 (revised cultural congruence) says that the negative effect of any additional unit of cultural incongruence on political stability is stronger among countries that are in a loss condition (demand surplus) than among countries that are in a gain condition (demand deficit).</p>

<title>Implementing the Reference Point and Political Culture Incongruence</title>
<p>As noted, according to prospect theory, people perceive themselves as in a state of gain or loss, not according to their current state (e.g., the level of freedom in their country) but according to their perceived state relative to some reference point (e.g., are they receiving more, less, or equal amounts of freedom compared with their expectations). Identifying the reference point is one of the major unsolved problems of the theory. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022002712446127">Kahneman and Tversky (1979</xref>) define the reference point as either the actors’ status quo or their expectations or aspiration levels. When actors are satisfied with the status quo or feel that their aspirations are fulfilled, they tend to regard their state as gain, and vice versa. It is interesting to see, and relevant to our study of political stability that the importance of a reference point looms large in theories of institutional stability and violence. The argument in these theories is that violence/protest will not occur under conditions of the greatest suffering but rather when the level of material benefits/social benefits/democracy/justice falls below expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022002712446127">Davies 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022002712446127">Gurr 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022002712446127">Levy 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, the problem of how to identify the reference point empirically remains. Although not referring to prospect theory and to the reference point, we believe that the empirical approach taken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022002712446127">Inglehart and Welzel (2005</xref>, 186-91) and presented earlier, is an acceptable solution. As discussed earlier, they measured the difference between the supply of freedom (the country’s level of democracy) and the demand for freedom (the level of democratic values held by the people). Applying this empirical solution, the reference point is where demand and supply are equal.</p>
<p>It follows that political culture incongruence is the difference between democratic values of the people and the level of democracy provided by the state. The aggregation of individual democratic values is based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022002712446127">Inglehart and Welzel’s (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022002712446127">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022002712446127">2010</xref>) analyses. Based on comprehensive international surveys conducted under the World Values Survey project<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022002712446127">5</xref></sup>, they found two main factors of values held by people in many countries. Of the two, the one of interest to us involves survival on one hand and self-expression on the other. They argued that self-expression is the most crucial of all for an effective democracy (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022002712446127">Welzel 2007</xref>). We use this factor as an operationalization of the democratic values held by the public in a country.</p>
<p>The level of democracy in a country is subtracted from the democratic values held by the public to create the cultural incongruence variable. The two most widespread indices of democracy used by scholars are the Polity index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022002712446127">Marshall and Jaggers 2009</xref>) and the Freedom House index of Political Rights and Civil Liberties.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022002712446127">6</xref></sup> Serious questions regarding endogeneity and difficulties in measurement have recently been raised with regard to both these indices however. Specifically, scholars (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022002712446127">Gates et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022002712446127">Treier and Jackman 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022002712446127">Vreeland 2008</xref>) argue that indicators of instability are part of both indices of democracy, and therefore one cannot use them to explain political stability. To account for this problem as much as possible, we adopt the correction to the Polity index suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022002712446127">Vreeland (2008</xref>), by taking into consideration only three out of the five measures that constitute the index (Constraints on Chief Executive, Competitiveness of Executive Recruitment, and Openness of Executive Recruitment). A similar solution is adopted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022002712446127">Goldstone et al. (2010</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022002712446127">Cederman, Hug, and Krebs (2010</xref>). For the Freedom House index, we use an improved measurement of effective democracy as developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022002712446127">Welzel and Inglehart (2008</xref>). The index of effective democracy is produced by multiplying the Freedom House index (inverted and standardized to a 0–100 range) by the World Bank’s anticorruption scores.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022002712446127">7</xref></sup> Welzel and Inglehart explain that this variable reflects not only the extent to which formal civil and political liberties are institutionalized but also measures the extent to which these liberties are actually exercised. The indicator of anticorruption is used since it is seen as representing the extent to which state power actually follows legal norms.</p>
<p>The revised Polity index, the index of effective democracy and the indicator of the democratic values of the people (the survival–self-expression factor) were rescaled to a common range (0–1) before subtracting the level of democracy provided by the country from the democratic values held by the public. Negative values (i.e., the freedom provided by the country is greater than the amount of democracy requested by the public) indicate a gain area, and positive values (i.e., the freedom provided by the country is less than the level of democracy requested by the public) indicate a loss area.</p>
<p>As an alternative procedure to gauge the reference point, and as a test of robustness, we “residualize” the measure of democratic values (i.e., the survival vs. self-expression dimension) on our measure of democratic institutions (i.e., the corrected Polity index and the index of effective democracy). That is, we regress the measure of democratic values on the measures of democratic institutions and save the residuals. Negative residuals indicate that democratic values are higher than democratic institutions; positive residuals indicate the opposite; and small residuals indicate equilibrium or the reference point.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022002712446127">8</xref></sup> As further reported in the following, we found very high correlations between the alternative measures of cultural incongruence, thus strengthening our confidence in our findings.</p>
<p>Can one assume, however, that a citizen knows that she or he lives in a country with more or less freedoms than it should provide given the public’s democratic values? Is a public aware of its reference point? There is evidence to show that the answer to these questions is positive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022002712446127">Anderson and Tverdova (2003</xref>), for example, found that citizens in less democratic countries reported lower levels of satisfaction with the performance of their political system compared to people in more democratic countries. Further evidence can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022002712446127">Inglehart and Welzel’s (2005)</xref> analysis described earlier. They found that a surplus in the demand for democracy leads toward transition to democracy, while a deficit in the demand for democracy leads toward a transition away from democracy. We also used two questions in the World Values Survey, one asking respondents to consider how important “giving people more say in important government decisions” is for their country and the other asking how important “protecting freedom of speech” is for their country. We expect that a public in a loss condition (i.e., receiving less freedom than they ask for) would consider these values more important compared with a public in a gain condition. As further reported next, this expectation was partially supported.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022002712446127">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Interaction of Democratic Institutions and Cultural Incongruence</title>
<p>We cannot hypothesize at this point whether the effect of cultural incongruence in a gain or loss condition would have an identical impact on the political stability of effective and noneffective democracies (and of coherent and noncoherent regimes). The rationale for this division is based on the institutional hypothesis, namely, that when it comes to political stability one should expect established and coherent democracies to behave differently than democracies in transition. We therefore pose this as a research question.</p>

<title>Dependent Variables: Political Stability and Country Fragility</title>
<p>Earlier studies operationalized political stability in two main ways: one approach focuses on the durability of political regimes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022002712446127">Przeworski et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022002712446127">Marshall and Jaggers 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022002712446127">Goldstone et al. 2010</xref>) or on changes in political regime (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022002712446127">Gates et al. 2006</xref>; for a review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022002712446127">Hegre and Sambanis 2006</xref>). A second approach integrates regime durability with other key indicators of a state’s failure, such as civil wars and societal conflicts involving demonstrations, strikes, and street violence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022002712446127">Fearon and Laitin 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022002712446127">Goldstone et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022002712446127">King and Zeng 2001</xref>). As noted previously, studies using both operationalizations of stability identify a U-shape structure in which countries at the democratic and at the autocratic ends of the regime-type continuum are more stable, while hybrid semidemocracies in between are less so. Our focus is on the second definition and operationalization, which integrates regime durability with indicators of a state’s failure. Two alternative indicators of political stability are used, political stability and state fragility.</p>
<p><italic>Political stability</italic> is an indicator compiled by the World Bank that measures “the likelihood that the government will be destabilized or overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means, including politically-motivated violence and terrorism” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022002712446127">Kaufman, Kraay, and Mastruzzi 2009</xref>, 6).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022002712446127">12</xref></sup> This indicator reflects a statistical compilation of responses on the quality of governance given by a large number of enterprises, think tanks, nongovernmental organizations, and international organizations. Among the instability categories are negative influences of regional political forces; social conditions, such as high inequality in the distribution of wealth; factionalization of the political spectrum, and the power of these factions; coercive measures required to retain power; organization and strength of forces of a radical government; societal conflict involving demonstrations, strikes, and street violence; and instability as perceived by nonconstitutional changes, assassinations, and guerilla wars. This indicator is measured in units ranging from about −2.5 to 2.5, with higher values corresponding to higher political stability (<italic>M </italic>= .128, <italic>SD </italic>= .854). These data represent a state’s stability in 2008.</p>
<p>Since this variable is based on perceptions by experts regarding a large array of factors we correlated it with measured variables that we considered to represent elements of political stability. First, the correlation between political stability and our second dependent variable, country fragility, which is not based on forecasting perceptions, is negative (as expected) and strong (<italic>r </italic>= −.767, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001). Second, its correlation with regime durability (as reported in Polity IV) is positive (<italic>r </italic>= .383, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and its correlation with the occurrence and intensity of internal conflicts is negative (<italic>r </italic>= −.505, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022002712446127">13</xref></sup> Moreover, its correlation with the combination of regime durability and internal conflict is stronger than each of the separate correlations (<italic>r </italic>= .624, <italic>p </italic>&lt; .001)</p>
<p><italic>Country fragility index </italic>is a Polity IV’s measure of political instability constructed at the end of each year. Its 2008 matrix combines scores on eight indicators and ranges from 0, “no fragility,” to 25, “extreme fragility” (<italic>M </italic>= 5.942, <italic>SD </italic>= 5.848). Some of the indicators on which this variable is based are Security Effectiveness, which is a measure of general security and vulnerability to political violence, 1984–2008 (based on wars in which the country was directly involved); Security Legitimacy, which is a measure of state repression, 1994–2007 (based on annual indicators drawn from US State Department and Amnesty International reports); and Political Effectiveness, which is a measure of regime/governance stability, 1994–2008 (based on regime durability, current leader’s years in office, and total number of coup events 1994–2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022002712446127">Marshall and Cole 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022002712446127">
<title>Independent Variable: Political Culture Incongruence</title>
<p>There are four measures of political culture incongruence in this study. <italic>Cultural incongruence-effective democracy </italic>subtracts a country’s effective democracy score from the World Value Survey’s (WVS) survival versus self-expression factor score.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022002712446127">14</xref></sup> As noted, effective democracy is produced by multiplying the 2008 Freedom House index (inverted and standardized to a 0–100 range) by the World Bank’s anticorruption scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0022002712446127">Welzel and Inglehart 2008</xref>). Both indicators (WVS factor and effective democracy index) are standardized to a 0–1 range. The descriptive statistics for this incongruence variable is <italic>M </italic>= .056, <italic>SD </italic>= .209. <italic>Cultural incongruence-effective democracy (RES)</italic> is produced by regressing the measure of democratic values on the measure of effective democracy, and saving the standardized residuals. <italic>Cultural incongruence-polity</italic> (<italic>M </italic>= −.335, <italic>SD </italic>= .309) subtracts a country’s polity score from the WVS’s survival versus self-expression factor score. As noted, we corrected the Polity score as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0022002712446127">Vreeland (2008</xref>). Finally, <italic>Cultural incongruence-polity (RES) </italic>is the standardized residuals produced when regressing the measure of democratic values on the Polity score. In all four variables, negative values of incongruence represent a demand-deficit condition (a gain area) and positive values represent a demand surplus condition (a loss area). Based on this, each country was assigned to either a gain condition or a loss condition.</p>
<p>The correlation between cultural incongruence-effective democracy and its residual counterpart is very strong (<italic>r</italic> = .997, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), as is the case with the correlation between cultural incongruence-polity and its residual counterpart (<italic>r</italic> = .902, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). These high correlations strengthen our confidence in the procedures for allocating the reference points. (Given these high correlations, we use only two out of the four measures in the following). As noted, we also use two questions in the World Values Survey, regarding “giving people more say in important government decisions” and “protecting freedom of speech.” Here, findings are mixed. As expected, a <italic>t</italic>-test shows that populations in a loss condition (i.e., receiving less freedom than they ask for) consider these values to be more important compares with those in a gain condition, which suggests that since they tend to wish for “more say” they feel, at least to some extent, deprived in this area (<italic>t = </italic>2.963, <italic>p &lt; </italic>.01, and <italic>t = </italic>3.504, <italic>p &lt; </italic>.01). This was the finding when the gain/loss conditions were defined based on cultural incongruence-effective democracy. Yet, when the gain/loss conditions were defined based on the Polity index, the difference between the two conditions was not significant. In any case, we cannot be certain that the arithmetical reference point is equivalent to the real reference point; we can only assume that the two equilibria are not much distant from each other.</p>

<title>Level of Democracy and Regime Coherence Controls</title>
<p>The analysis of the cultural congruence hypothesis controls for two main institutional indicators: level of effective democracy and regime coherence. The measurement of the <italic>level of effective democracy </italic>is specified above.

<sec id="section9-0022002712446127">
<title>Other Controls</title>
<p>In addition to the institutional and cultural congruence explanations, scholars recognize other variables that correlate with political stability. Among these are economic growth indicators, such as the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022002712446127">Inglehart 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022002712446127">Przeworski et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022002712446127">Diskin, Diskin, and Hazan 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022002712446127">Inglehart and Welzel 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022002712446127">Fails and Pierce 2010</xref>) and subcultural pluralism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022002712446127">Bollen and Jackman 1985</xref>), or ethnic heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022002712446127">Gasiorowski and Power 1998</xref>).

Note, however, that high variance was found between countries in the upper right graph. The first hypothesis is therefore supported only when using the corrected Polity index. The effect of the level of effective democracy on stability is positive and somewhat linear.

<title>The Cultural Congruence Hypothesis</title>
<p>An exploration of the two measures of cultural incongruence, cultural incongruence-polity and cultural incongruence-effective democracy, reveals that as might be expected, democracies (as measured by the corrected Polity index and the index of effective democracies) are found to a greater extent in the gain area (i.e., demand-deficit zone in which freedom provided by a country is greater than the amount of democracy requested by the public), compared with semidemocracies and nondemocracies, which are found to a greater extent in the loss area (<italic>t =</italic> 9.569, <italic>p &lt; </italic>.01, for Polity and <italic>t =</italic> 5.96, <italic>p &lt; </italic>.01, for effective democracies).</p>
<p>Based on the original cultural congruence hypothesis (Hypothesis 3), the expected impact of cultural incongruence on political stability should be as demonstrated by the solid line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022002712446127">Figure 1</xref> above: stability should be highest at the reference line/equilibrium point (where demand and supply meet), and lowest at the most distant locations, whether this location is in the gain or loss zone. This is because the cultural congruence hypothesis is blind to the direction of the incongruence, so that any unit of incongruence has a similar negative impact in both directions. The study’s fourth hypothesis revises the original cultural congruence hypothesis, based on the expectation derived from prospect theory: the negative effect of any additional unit of cultural incongruence on political stability is expected to be stronger among countries that are in a loss condition (demand surplus) than among countries that are in a gain condition (demand deficit). This hypothesis is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022002712446127">Figure 1</xref> by the dotted line.</p>

Note that the dependent variables move in opposite directions; higher values in political stability represent greater stability, while higher values in country fragility represent greater instability. Model 1 presents a simple test of the original cultural congruence hypothesis, with the absolute value of cultural incongruence as the only independent variable (cultural incongruence—effective democracy in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002712446127">Table 1</xref> and cultural incongruence—polity in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022002712446127">Table 2</xref>). Model 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002712446127">Table 1</xref> seems to support the original cultural congruence hypothesis, since the impact of cultural incongruence is negative, which means that the greater the incongruence, the lower the stability. However, in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022002712446127">Table 2</xref>, the hypothesis is rejected, since according to it the impact of cultural incongruence on country fragility should have been positive (greater incongruence leads to greater fragility).</p>

<p>Models 2 and 3 in both tables provide the first test of the revised cultural congruence hypothesis. They introduce two variables: first a gain (model 2) or a loss (model 3) condition. Each country with a demand deficit is considered to be in a gain condition and is assigned a value of 1 (model 2), while the other countries receive a value of 0. Similarly, in model 3 each country with a demand surplus is considered to be in a loss condition and assigned a value of 1, while all other countries are assigned with a value of 0. Next, an interaction between the absolute value of incongruence and the gain (model 2) or loss (model 3) condition completes the models.</p>
<p>To understand the significance of the model, we shall focus on model 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002712446127">Table 1</xref>. The constant (.265) represents the level of political stability for a hypothetical country in a loss condition (gain = 0) with a political culture incongruence = 0 (i.e., full congruence/equilibrium). The coefficient for political culture incongruence (<italic>b =</italic> −2.716) is the regression weight in a gain = 0 (i.e., a loss condition). In other words, it is the regression weight for the impact of cultural incongruence on stability among countries in the loss area. The coefficient for the gain condition (<italic>b = </italic>.205) tells us about the additional level of stability when moving from a loss to a gain condition when cultural instability = 0 (note that the range of stability is −2.5 to 2.5). Finally, with regard to the question of whether a gain/loss condition moderates the effect of cultural incongruence on political stability, what counts is the size and significance of the interaction term. The coefficient (<italic>b = </italic>3.856) shows that when moving from a loss to a gain condition, the effect of cultural incongruence on political stability becomes more positive, just as expected according to the fourth hypothesis. The significance of the interaction tells us that the relationship between cultural incongruence and gain/loss conditions is statistically different in the two groups. Models 2 and 3 therefore support the revised cultural congruence hypothesis (Hypothesis 4) and reject the original hypothesis (Hypothesis 3), which states that congruence in absolute terms, regardless of the gain/loss position, has a negative effect on political stability.</p>
<p>Models 4 and 5 in both tables add in the controls. Note that in both tables the revised cultural congruence hypothesis is supported even after controlling for cultural diversity (which, as expected, has a negative impact on stability); for GDP per capita (which has a positive impact on stability) and most importantly for levels of effective democracy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002712446127">Table 1</xref>) and regime coherence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022002712446127">Table 2</xref>), which are the variables representing the institutional hypothesis. In other words, the revised cultural congruence hypothesis still holds even after controlling for the institutional hypothesis.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022002712446127">Figure 3</xref> is based on the coefficients taken from models 4 and 5 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002712446127">Tables 1</xref> (the right-hand graph) and 2 (the left-hand graph). It presents predicted probabilities of political stability (or fragility) by the interaction while holding the other variables from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022002712446127">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022002712446127">2</xref> at their mean scores. As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022002712446127">Figure 1</xref>, the vertical lines at the center mark the reference/equilibrium point. As can be seen, the effect of cultural incongruence on political stability is negative in the loss area: the greater the cultural incongruence between the public and democratic institutions, the lower the stability (or the higher the fragility). But the picture shown by the graphs in the gain area is completely different: the greater the cultural incongruence, the higher the stability (or the lower the fragility). This function resembles the expected function according to prospect theory, although the famous S shape is absent here. These findings therefore point toward rejection of the original cultural congruence hypothesis (Hypothesis 3) and acceptance of the revised hypothesis (Hypothesis 4).</p>

<title>The Interaction of Democratic Institutions and Cultural Incongruence</title>
<p>Finally, we posed a research question regarding a possible interaction between democratic institutions and cultural incongruence. Specifically, the research question asks whether the effect of cultural incongruence in a gain or loss condition would have an identical impact on the political stability of effective and noneffective democracies.</p>
<p>We answer this question by dividing the countries into effective versus ineffective democracies and into loss versus gain conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022002712446127">Figure 4</xref>). Effects of incongruence among effective democracies are insignificant with regard to both the gain and the loss conditions, and hence, one should ignore their general direction. Results for ineffective democracies point to a rejection of the original congruence hypothesis, since the impact of incongruence on stability in the gain area is positive while for the loss area it is negative.</p>

<p>As for the research question of whether the effect of cultural incongruence in a gain or loss condition would have an identical impact on the political stability of effective and noneffective democracies, these findings suggest that to understand political stability better, one should take into account three major factors: the degree of incongruence, the state of incongruence (i.e., a gain or loss condition) and the level of democratic institution (i.e., whether a country has an effective or ineffective democracy) In other words, this analysis suggests that an interaction of institutional and cultural explanations expands our ability to understand and predict stability. We attempt to explain this interaction in the discussion following.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The idea that incongruence between political institutions and citizens’ values would lead to instability, namely the cultural congruency hypothesis, has existed for decades. So has the great concern of policy makers about it, usually in the context of democracy promotion and its effect on political stability. Only recently, however, has the concept of cultural congruence been empirically tested. A way to measure congruence was suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022002712446127">Inglehart and Welzel (2005</xref>), who proposed an elegant empirical method to measure levels of cultural incongruence as the difference between the supply of and demand for freedom. Our study uses their framework in order to develop an empirical examination and hence a conceptual understanding of the cultural congruence hypothesis.</p>
<p>The present study makes two main contributions: the first is a theoretical revision of the cultural congruence hypothesis and the second is empirical support for the revised hypothesis. Another contribution is the interaction found between cultural congruence and the alternative institutional hypothesis.</p>
<p>The original cultural congruence hypothesis maintained that the greater the congruence between individual democratic values and the level of democracy of political institutions, the greater the country’s political stability will be, and vice versa. But relying on prospect theory, which in our opinion is still not used enough in comparative politics, we argue that a crucial weakness of this hypothesis is that it is blind to the direction of incongruence. According to prospect theory, it is unlikely that a public would be willing to risk stability in a similar manner when receiving more or less democracy than they asked for. It is actually expected that they would behave quite the opposite in the two scenarios: those receiving less democracy than they asked for perceive themselves to be in a loss condition and are therefore more likely to be risk seekers, while those receiving more democracy than they asked for are in a gain condition and are hence expected to be risk averters. When it comes to political stability, these different scenarios matter greatly. Simply put, citizens are more willing to go on the streets, demanding a change in status quo, and hence risk stability, when they feel that they have less freedom than they want in comparison with a situation in which their state gives them more freedom than they want. We therefore present a revised hypothesis, according to which the negative effect of any additional unit of cultural incongruence on political stability is stronger among countries that are in a loss condition (demand surplus) than among countries that are in a gain condition (demand deficit).</p>
<p>This revised hypothesis was supported by most of our empirical analyses, while the original hypothesis was rather clearly rejected. Analyses show that while in the loss area, cultural incongruence has a negative effect on political stability, it has a reverse effect on stability among the states in the gain area; the greater the cultural incongruence, the higher the stability.</p>
<p>The finding in the gain area merits elaboration. Why does greater cultural incongruence increase stability in ineffective democracies that offer more freedom than is asked for by their public, while it does not have this effect on the stability of effective democracies? One possible answer may be found in the relative size of the surplus of freedom supply. Apparently, the freedom surplus (i.e., cultural incongruence) among the countries in the gain area is twice as large in ineffective democracies compared with effective democracies (.16 compares with .08; <italic>t = </italic>2.07, <italic>p &lt; </italic>.05). It is feasible that the large surplus in freedom in new democracies has a pacifying effect; it may serve as assurance that freedom provided by political institutions is not a public good in short supply. People are also much more sensitive to negative signs in their environment than to positive signs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022002712446127">Kahneman and Tversky 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022002712446127">1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022002712446127">Levy 2003</xref>), and are therefore more sensitive to limitations on their freedom than to having more freedom than they seek. Consequently, it is possible that populations in weaker democracies do not locate the equilibrium in its correct, arithmetical zero point, but rather feel that they have more restrictions on their freedom than they actually do, and thus behave as if they were in a loss area. All in all, although we conducted several robustness tests to locate the correct reference point, as we have said, we cannot be certain that our measurements indeed located it appropriately; we can only assume that the two equilibria, the arithmetical and the empirical one, are not much distant from each other.</p>
<p>The fact that cultural incongruence and its effects are different for effective and ineffective democracies, and for coherent and incoherent regimes, points toward the interdependence of the institutional and cultural congruence hypotheses. These findings suggest that taking into account the interaction between the state of incongruence (i.e., a gain or loss condition), the size of incongruence, and the level of democratic institution (i.e., an effective or ineffective democracy) improves our understanding of political stability. They also suggest that more than competing with each other, these two hypotheses for political instability—the institutional and cultural congruence hypotheses—supplement each other, each adding an important layer of information to the other. Hence, collation of these layers produces a more complex and complete picture of the effect the democratization process has on stability than each layer alone can do.</p>
<p>As noted previously, the question of how democracy promotion affects stability has been studied before. Existing frameworks and research rests mainly on institutional explanations that demonstrate that democratic countries are more stable than nondemocratic ones. Studies following the institutional hypothesis identify a U-shape structure of the effect of democracy on stability, in which countries at the democratic and autocratic ends of the regime-type continuum are more stable, while the hybrid anocracies in between are less so. As discussed, the accuracy of this U-shape curve has been questioned in recent studies because of difficulties in measurement of democratic levels. We have taken account of this problem, and found some evidence to support the U-shape relationship. The U-shape effect raises a major dilemma for policy makers: should Western leaders preach the democratization of autocratic countries?</p>
<p>On one hand, the institutional approach has proven to be correct: in the long run, effective democracies are more stable. We believe that incorporating the congruency hypothesis adds an important facet to our understanding of the democratization–stability dynamic. Attempts to impose democracy from below, that is, to convince the people in nondemocratic or semidemocratic countries to foster democracy in the hope that they will pressure their leadership may cause a severe demand–surplus condition (or a loss condition). According to the theoretical framework of this article and to the findings presented earlier, it might bring these countries close to a dangerous zone of political instability. Thus, for the sake of prudence, one should avoid the risk of creating a demand surplus. Our analysis of countries in the gain area actually shows that for noneffective democracies or for incoherent regimes the best approach might be to create a demand deficit, that is, to provide the public with much more freedom than it asks for. Our analysis shows that among this group of countries, the greater the demand deficit, the greater the political stability.</p>

<p>Yet, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022002712446127">King and Zeng (2001</xref>) and others argue that political stability is nonlinear because state repression is linear (decreases with democratization), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022002712446127">Davenport (2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022002712446127">2007</xref>) finds that the democratization process actually increases state repression, which decreases only at high levels of democracy. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022002712446127">Davenport (2007</xref>) notes, “The road to political openness is thus paved with political coercion but the arrival is generally pacific” (p. 11).

<p>The U-curve argument has been contested in recent years, mainly because of arguments regarding endogeneity and difficulties in measurement of the two most widely used indices of democracy; Polity: Political Regime Characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022002712446127">Marshall and Jaggers 2009</xref>); and the Freedom House index of Political Rights and Civil Liberties.

<p>It is worth noting that the level of incongruence between the supply of freedom and the demand for freedom may not be automatically translated into contentious collective action. As has already been demonstrated by studies of social movements, perceptions of relative deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022002712446127">Gurr 1970</xref>) on the part of aggrieved collectives are necessary but insufficient conditions for actual engagement in contention. Two important contributing factors that should be taken into consideration when addressing how (i.e., readiness) and when (i.e., timing) to act contentiously, are the mobilizing structure and changes in the structure of political opportunity, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022002712446127">Alimi 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022002712446127">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022002712446127">McAdam 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022002712446127">McAdam, McCarthy, and Zald 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0022002712446127">Tarrow 1998</xref>). Future research would certainly benefit taking these factors into account. They are not included in our present empirical model since to the best of our knowledge, there is no global database on mobilization structure, or on political opportunity. Since we expect these variables to mediate the impact of cultural incongruence the model can still work without them.</p>

<p>Please note that prospect theory is a theory of individual choice, and was not intended to be applied to group behavior, as it is here.

<p>There are two major limitations with these findings. First and most important, these questions were asked only in the 1990s, while our measure of cultural incongruence is based on data from a decade later, as specified in the methodology section. Second, these questions were asked only among a limited list of countries (please refer to http://www.wvsevsdb.com/wvs/WVSDocs.jsp? Idioma=I). Moreover, when it comes to direct questions on liberty there is always the chance that people, especially in nondemocratic regimes, will be more hesitant to express their views frankly. We therefore believe that the combined index of less direct questions, used for our main analyses, is preferable.</p>
