<abstract>
<p>The authors describe a semester-long action-learning project where undergraduate or graduate management students learn about ethics, responsibility, and organizational behavior by examining the policy of their college or university that addresses academic integrity. Working in teams, students adopt a stakeholder management approach as they make recommendations for improvements to their school’s academic integrity policy, its dissemination and enforcement. The authors detail their efforts facilitating this project at three universities. As students examine how an ethical conduct policy informs and is informed by individual and organizational behaviors, they come to more deeply understand the social processes through which all manner of responsibility-promoting outcomes are enacted. The approach to learning described in this project promotes students’ internalization of ethical principles and accountability for responsible behavior that is consonant with the core aims and principles of responsible management education.</p>

<p>The principles of responsible management education (PRME) have the aim of increasing social responsibility and sustainability in management education. In an effort to wed such commitments to action, we describe a semester-long action-learning project that asks students to examine university policy governing academic integrity. Academic integrity, enshrined in policy, is a matter of ethics and responsibility that affects every university and every student. In the project we describe here, students are asked to identify and evaluate the institutional structures, processes, and practices that support (or constrain) the assessment, creation, dissemination, enforcement, and improvement of academic integrity policies and their outcomes. In other words, students examine how policies of academic integrity are enacted. We report on our experiences piloting this project and provide detailed information for those who may want to undertake this project.</p>
<p>The description of an in-class assignment about ethics and academic integrity may seem modest compared with the lofty principles set forth in PRME. Yet, we believe that ethics and integrity are at the very heart of PRME because they are basic to definitions of social responsibility and sustainability. Both social responsibility and sustainability are normative concepts that recognize managers as moral actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562911428602">Carroll, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1052562911428602">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1052562911428602">Wood, 1991</xref>). Ethical integrity is therefore an implicit part of any definition of sustainability or social responsibility. A common definition of sustainability is economic activity that can “meet the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1052562911428602">World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987</xref>). This definition can be partially understood in instrumental terms, as a matter of self-interest to increase survival prospects. Yet people’s voluntary willingness to consider how their present conduct and resource use might affect future others, followed by a willingness to regulate accordingly, is inherently a stance of ethical integrity. Definitions of social responsibility often make the link to ethics and integrity even more explicitly. Carroll, whose definition is among the most commonly cited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562911428602">DeBakker, Groenewegen, &amp; DenHond, 2005</xref>), contends that a core goal and manifestation of social responsibility is to “integrate ethical decision-making into all decision-making policies and actions.” He asserts that there are moral dimensions of both mandated and discretionary behaviors and that fundamental to social responsibility is an obligation to ethicality. Not only are ethics, integrity, social responsibility, and sustainability inextricably linked theoretically but this interconnection can also be demonstrated practically. For example, when a national network of German business school students devoted to business ethics sought to advance their agenda, they did so by calling on all German management schools to adopt the PRME principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1052562911428602">PRME, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The efforts that management institutions make to take PRME seriously can improve ethical conduct and responsible, high-integrity, behavior. Conversely, absent specific actions and interventions, PRME has the potential to exist simply as a high-minded set of ideals. The UN Global Compact, that gave rise to PRME, has faced some criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1052562911428602">Sanquiche, 2010</xref>) for creating a “static document” that organizations would sign on to but would do little to actually change (at worst creating a moral hazard because the greater appearance of benevolence could, in fact, slow the pace of change or even provide cover for malfeasance). In recent years, the Global Compact delisted a large swath of organizations that had signed on to the principles but seemingly had taken no action to enact them or to report progress. It is essential that these initiatives are connected to real action and movement.</p>
<p>We believe the approach described in this project has several merits. Cheating and other unethical behaviors are a serious problem both in the classroom and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1052562911428602">Mello, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1052562911428602">Rosile, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, some scholars suggest a linkage between unethical micro-level behavior among business school students and organizational-level ethical violations such as corporate scandals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1052562911428602">Lund Dean &amp; Beggs, 2006</xref>). In many respects, an academic integrity policy is equivalent to policies designed to ensure or promote ethical conduct in the workplace. This project can serve as an effective bridge to analogous workplace considerations of ethical conduct and to the role of ethical conduct in social responsibility and pro-sustainability behaviors.</p>
<p>The project also provides useful scaffolding between PRME, which largely describes organizational or societal behaviors, and individual-level action. Conversely, this project helps students “see the individual amidst the organization” and consider the interface between individual action and organizational-level realities as students examine how academic institutions enact (or fall short of enacting) norms of ethical conduct. As students come to better understand how organizations promote norms of responsibility and the complex dynamics by which such goals are realized, they are equipped to better understand how organizations might advance all manner of social responsibilities. Ethics and integrity can be points of entrance to discuss a broader range of behaviors, values, and virtues that undergird the umbrella concepts of social responsibility and sustainability. Finally, this project helps students and faculty alike recognize that a commitment to PRME is not simply a matter of “doing new and doing different,” but of recognizing (and perhaps upgrading) the institutions and practices that support norms of social responsibility and sustainability, or that create the necessary preconditions for such commitments to take root.</p>
<p>The empirical foundation for this article is based on our experience developing and implementing this project at three institutions: a private religiously affiliated university, a private nonsectarian university, and a large public university. Despite differences in the size, type, and location of the academic institutions, the project yielded very similar outcomes at each school. It is an encouraging sign that the project is not esoteric to a particular context or setting. We believe that this project is amenable to any academic institution.</p>
<p>The remainder of the article is organized as follows: We detail our learning objectives and the rationale for the approach we have adopted in the project. Then we describe the project in detail and provide an illustration of the learning that the project has generated thus far. We briefly discuss possible variations to the project, student responses, assessment of learning, and limitations and further directions for this endeavor.</p>
<sec id="section1-1052562911428602">
<title>Objectives and Rationale</title>
<p>We developed this project, recognizing that much has been written about ethics education (24 articles in the <italic>Journal of Management Education</italic> in the past decade alone, including special issues on ethics education and sustainability) and mindful that ethics is a notoriously difficult topic to teach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562911428602">Beggs, Lund Dean, Gillespie, &amp; Weiner, 2006</xref>). Yet the challenging nature of teaching ethics in an effective and meaningful manner is also what motivated us to come up with a new approach. What follows are the learning objectives that guide the project and some theoretical and practical rationale for these choices.</p>
<list id="list1-1052562911428602" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Students will see how ethical values are embedded in organizations and influence individual and organizational behaviors</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We strongly subscribe to the notion that ethics education often overlooks and must attend to the organizational dimensions of ethics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562911428602">Moberg (2006)</xref> notes the potentially perilous and irresponsible job we do as educators if we successfully increase ethical awareness in students while not equipping them with the understanding to navigate the often complex intersection of individual and organizational values. Others assert that an understanding of the interaction between individuals and organizations is essential for students to adequately contend with the pressing and complex issues facing business and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562911428602">White &amp; Taft, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1052562911428602">VanSandt, 2003</xref>). We are also mindful that experiences in school and the workplace act as a comparatively more influential force in our lives, in part because we are involved in fewer organizations as participation in civic and religious organizations has declined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1052562911428602">Putnam, 2001</xref>). Therefore, the classroom and the workplace are indeed “mediating institutions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562911428602">Fort, 2001</xref>) that exert influence on the moral development and behavior of individuals who inhabit these settings.</p>
<p>As we looked at recent teaching resources related to ethics, we saw that the majority focus on individual-level values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1052562911428602">Goltz &amp; Hietapelto, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562911428602">James &amp; Smith, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1052562911428602">Kayes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1052562911428602">Landrum, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1052562911428602">Mello, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1052562911428602">Trocchia, Swanson, &amp; Orlitzky, 2007</xref>) whereas far fewer focus on the relationship between individuals and organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562911428602">Comer &amp; Vega, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562911428602">Lenaghan &amp; Smith, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1052562911428602">Reilly &amp; Ehlinger, 2007</xref>), and those that do tend to focus on shorter term exercises rather than longer, more in-depth projects.</p>
<p>The singular project that we have seen scholarly reference to, which bears real likeness to what we describe here, is that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1052562911428602">Giacalone, Jurkiewicz, and Knouse (2003)</xref>. Like the effort they describe, where students design a hypothetical ethics training session and training manual for a business, our project design involves an examination of ethical codes and relies on the same pedagogical assumption that to “grasp the ambiguities as well as complexities of real ethics problems, students must grapple with the realities of applying ethics to human behavior within organizational settings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1052562911428602">Giacalone et al., 2003</xref>, p. 592). Yet we believe that our approach reaches that goal more successfully because the project is based on an organizational setting that students have some familiarity with—the university—whereas students may lack adequate understanding of the workplace. This risk seems even greater when students are not developing policies for real organizations but hypothetical ones. This distinction, between exploring actual policy and practices, versus something imagined, is another reason we believe that the action-learning dimensions of our design may be more robust. We address the potential for this project to have real-world outcomes later in this section. Certainly, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1052562911428602">Giacalone et al. (2003)</xref> approach has real merit. For example, it may be that anticipating the ethical dilemmas of a specific industry proves useful for people who anticipate working in that field. We are pleased to offer management educators another possibility that bears likeness to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1052562911428602">Giacalone et al. (2003)</xref> and has some similar strengths and distinctive differences.</p>
<p>We thought it was essential that students consider how integrity policies encourage ethical conduct which then becomes (or fails to become) embedded in organizational practices dependent on various pressures and realities (e.g., busy research-focused faculty who fail to screen for plagiarism) and, in turn, influences ethical conduct. Yet, we did not want this assignment to be a purely organizational analysis but also something that would provoke individual-level reflection and learning. Thus, what we propose here is specifically intended to explore the interface between individuals and organizations. This project allows students to see how academic integrity influences many aspects of organizational behavior, such as incentives, motivation, teaming, and organizational culture as well as change-related topics such as innovation (in the age of the digital mash-up, see articles such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1052562911428602">Gabriel, 2010</xref>).</p>
<list id="list2-1052562911428602" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>2. Students will develop a stronger sense of stakeholder awareness</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We support the notion that the ability to skillfully grasp issues from multiple perspectives is a prerequisite to understanding complex business and society issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1052562911428602">Tucker &amp; Tromley, 2002</xref>), such as environmental sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562911428602">Collins &amp; Keirns, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1052562911428602">Westerman &amp; Westerman, 2009</xref>). It is central to the normative aims of responsible management that managers adopt a stakeholder perspective, as opposed to a shareholder-only perspective, but this project illustrates why stakeholder thinking is fundamental to even more basic instrumental understanding. Examining how academic integrity is thought about solely from the perspective of students, professors, administrators, or content providers would be so incomplete as to be of limited use. Although a stakeholder mind-set may prepare students to grapple with social issues, the ability to understand all concerns as others see them and to recognize validity in those perspectives is requisite for skillful interpersonal interaction, including collaboration, persuasion, and negotiation.</p>
<list id="list3-1052562911428602" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>3. The project will use action-learning and problem-based learning approaches to help students internalize ethical understanding and see the link between theory and action</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>We sought to develop an approach to ethics instruction that would complement other methods we were familiar with but overcome some of their limitations. Although we find formal learning and discussion of ethical frameworks valuable, we were convinced that little internalization or behavioral change was likely if learning occurred purely “at arm’s length.” Although more Socratic dialogue can be engaging, we knew firsthand that case-based learning can often be designed to drive students to overly tidy predetermined outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562911428602">Carboni &amp; Foster, 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1052562911428602">Tyler and Tyler (2006)</xref> note that for real change to occur, learners must go through states of precontemplation, contemplation, action, and maintenance. This project requires people to move from precontemplation through action and allows the possibility for maintenance to the degree that this experience has an ongoing impact. It is also “developmentally flexible” in that it allows students who may be anywhere on this continuum (from students who have never considered these matters to those who are deeply versed) to move through these many phases, unlike reflective exercises devoid of more robust action or action-based learning with limited reflection. We consider this project an example of action learning and a variant of problem-based learning. We will briefly discuss both of these pedagogies.</p>
<sec id="section2-1052562911428602">
<title>Action Learning</title>
<p>Research on action learning tells us that more active and engaged learning methods can facilitate student absorption, retention, recall, and transfer of knowledge more effectively than comparatively passive learning methods—particularly when the information at hand is complex and context-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1052562911428602">McCarthy &amp; Anderson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1052562911428602">Norman &amp; Schmidt, 1992</xref>). Team-based approaches to action learning can deepen this effect further by promoting peer learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1052562911428602">O’Donnell &amp; O’Kelly, 1994</xref>). Action learning is purported to foster internalization of learning in part because it involves greater attitudinal, emotional, and values-based experience which can extend and deepen learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562911428602">Anderson &amp; Speck, 1998</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1052562911428602">
<title>Problem-Based Learning</title>
<p>We see the parameters of this project as an example of problem-based learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562911428602">Coombs &amp; Elden, 2004</xref>) in that students are presented with a specific issue about which there is considerable ambiguity concerning how to approach the situation. Scholars of problem-based learning note that this approach, “promotes activation of prior knowledge and its reconstruction as new knowledge is integrated into existing schemata” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1052562911428602">Smith, 2005</xref>, p. 358). Activation, application, and integration of knowledge are part of why we see this project as a powerful method to take ethics frameworks that students have been exposed to and greatly deepen student learning. Furthermore, we believe that “people learn more when they are motivated to learn by curiosity or practical needs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1052562911428602">Smith, 2005</xref>, p. 358) more so than for other reasons, and our project design creates this necessity.</p>
<p>We deliberately avoid using the term <italic>problem-based learning</italic> with students or framing the situation as “a problem” because we want to emphasize that there are aspects of the situation that may, in fact, be strong or unproblematic. Although we aim to take a more neutral tone, we expect students to provide supporting evidence for what seems to be working well in addition to any other areas that require attention and improvement.</p>
<p>Problem-based learning informs our understanding that there is strong educative value in instances when the problem at hand is loosely defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1052562911428602">Bigelow, 2004</xref>). We considered our design against <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1052562911428602">Peterson’s (2004)</xref> exhortation that a worthy problem must escape easy definition, have multiple answers, be subject to change, bind theory to action, and require both theory and action to understand the matter at hand. Peterson also notes that an excellent problem should be complex enough to require team involvement. We believe that the process of students needing to determine the salient issues at hand, and defining the decision parameters rather than having them predetermined, enhances the ability of learners to apply their learning to other real-world contexts that invariably have these same qualities.</p>
<p>Although we have noted that team-based learning enables peer-to-peer learning and can be necessary for solving complex problems, part of our motivation for structuring the project as a team assignment relates to learning goals of the course as a whole, beyond the boundaries of this project. We concluded that having students examine university academic integrity would allow us to achieve many course objectives simultaneously. As student teams examine academic integrity, and its relationship to campus behavior, they are forced to consider the role of policy, procedure, structure, and culture in organizations. In other words, this project requires students to consider many of the topics that are addressed in any organizational behavior course and to focus on the relationship between organizational practice and human behavior. The deep examination that students are required to do of their own academic institutions can serve as a consciousness raising exercise where students become more aware of these policies and consider their own conduct with greater nuance. This project has led to modest but discernable changes in the academic integrity “program” of each of the institutions where this assignment has been conducted. These changes are detailed in the “Project Outcomes” section later in the article. In what follows, we describe the project in detail.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1052562911428602">
<title>The Project</title>
<p>The project is carried out by student teams and involves a semester-long analysis of the academic integrity policy (also referred to as an honesty policy, ethics policy, or academic code of conduct) followed by students making recommendations to improve the policy. We have used this project design in organizational behavior courses and this article is written with the assumption that the project would be carried out in an organizational behavior or general management course. This project design could easily be adapted to an ethics or business and society course and we discuss such adaptations in the “Variations to the Project” section. In addition to the formal policy, students are asked to consider the administration and enforcement of academic integrity at their college or university. Students consider the (formal and informal) organizational mechanisms or practices that serve to uphold or obstruct academic integrity. In this effort, students are required to provide analysis using a stakeholder perspective (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1052562911428602">Donaldson &amp; Preston, 1995</xref>) and to gather primary data from at least three stakeholder groups (e.g., students, faculty, administration) although students are asked to identify as many affected stakeholder groups as possible (e.g., parents, alumni, critics/evaluators, employers, academic authors). Students must also select at least three organizational behavior course topics to be highlighted in their analyses to ensure a strong integration with other course material. A project description intended for inclusion in the class syllabus appears in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1052562911428602">Appendix A</xref>, which is also available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jme.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://jme.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>.</p>
<p>This project is intended to prepare students to understand how an ethics policy depends on the effectiveness of the organization that surrounds, supports, and reinforces the policy. More broadly, this exercise demonstrates the interrelationship between organizational policy and individual, group, and organizational behaviors. Although instructors will undoubtedly have their own ideas about project preparation and what should be included in their overall course, relevant content areas include ethics frameworks; theories of organizational change, culture, learning, leadership, and structure; and stakeholder and performance management. That said, we do not believe that there is specific content that must be included or a precise sequence of delivery that should be followed. All organizational behavior topics have some relevance. As with any capstone course project, we assume that each topic in the course will be discussed with some consideration of how it might inform the final project.</p>
<sec id="section5-1052562911428602">
<title>Instructor Guidelines and Timeline of Project Activity</title>
<p>The project is designed to be completed in 12 weeks, allowing instructors some latitude to teach important preparatory topics in the first weeks of the course before the project begins. Project instructions for inclusion in the class syllabus are given in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1052562911428602">Appendix A</xref>. <italic>Students are told that the project instructions are deliberately</italic> “skeletal.” This approach allows teams both the latitude and challenge of approaching the assignment from diverse standpoints and perspectives, as existing project outcomes illustrate (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1052562911428602">Table 1</xref>). We have found that providing project guidelines that include intentional ambiguity about how to realize the project generally results in a diverse range of final projects that make the endeavor seem more varied and interesting to students during presentations but similar enough that groups (and instructors) can assess quality standards fairly and uniformly from group to group (we discuss assessment of learning at length later in this article). This decidedly basic assignment structure, which requires students to generate a novel approach and adequate project scope, is informed by problem-based learning. Learning is enhanced when groups have enough control over the process to learn in a way that interests them and have a complex enough issue to approach that it requires the collaborative involvement of the team members to decide how to address the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1052562911428602">Peterson, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Weeks 1 to 5</title>
<p>The instructor is initially focused on getting students organized into teams of 4 to 6 members, introducing the assignment, and guiding the teams into their initial research and discussions. Instructors should feel free to assemble teams according to whatever norms they see fit. After initial ice-breaking activities, the students are directed to briefly conduct <italic>individual</italic> research (e.g., trying to locate and interpret the policy, informally asking around for policy-related anecdotes, and recalling direct or vicarious experience) and to engage in intensive discussion of the academic integrity policy to establish an initial shared understanding of the policy’s content, organization, and implications. Then, student groups collectively develop a research plan, including data collection targets, goals and approaches, interview scripts, and survey designs. Teaching an early lesson on team-level methods of idea generation and decision making, such as brainstorming and the nominal group technique, has proven effective at encouraging innovative approaches and equal participation among group members.</p>
<p>Beyond teaching “standard” organizational behavior topics, instructors may wish to provide guidance to students on data collection techniques—such as interview and survey design basics. This requirement is, of course, true with any assignment that asks students to conduct any type of primary or secondary research. We therefore assume that instructors have already developed means to equip students to produce sufficiently rigorous and high-quality work. In addition to written resources that can provide ongoing support to students, we have found it helpful to devote a significant block of an early class session to essentials of producing high-quality research. Alternately, instructors may prefer to devote a smaller portion of time over several sessions to key points about different topics such as interview protocols, discerning the quality of secondary research, and the like. The student research plan should be complete (handed in, given instructor feedback, and returned) by Week 5 or 6, allowing enough time for the execution of data collection, analysis, and presentation. Having the plan due in Week 5 allows the instructor to intervene with teams and plans that require significant improvement or revision.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1052562911428602">
<title>Weeks 6 to 10</title>
<p>Equipped with their revised and instructor-approved research plans, students execute their data collection, then assemble and analyze their data. Besides providing some skill-training in data analysis to students, during Week 8 or 9 we recommend that the instructor devote an entire class to an in-class work session during which the instructor roams from team to team providing coaching and advice on the analysis and interpretation of project data (each team’s raw data would be due by class time, providing an important milestone). By the conclusion of Week 10, students should have assembled their project findings and developed most of their recommended changes in preparation for presentation and paper creation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1052562911428602">
<title>Weeks 11 to 12</title>
<p>During Week 11 students finish developing and prioritizing their recommendations and finally build and plan their presentations and written reports. Week 12 is devoted to student presentations, with written reports handed in by all teams on the first day of presenting. Presentations, designed to feature the most important findings and recommendations according to each team, are generally 15 to 20 minutes in length (including Q&amp;A) depending on class size and scheduling issues. Written reports, designed to elucidate all analysis, findings, and recommendations, were specified as 3 to 5 pages (single-spaced) and could include any number of appendices (e.g., interview data, contact lists, specific policy revisions) as additional pages. Instructors may wish to invite other relevant experts to sit in on the final presentations. For example, knowing in advance that a dean or other professors will be present has given added motivation to our students to produce excellent, high-integrity research and to deliver inspired presentations.</p>

<title>Diverse Team Approaches and Project Outcomes</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1052562911428602">Table 1</xref> illustrates the diversity of student approaches to the project and their associated outcomes. Students were varied in their approaches to data collection, using interview, survey, and benchmarking data, most commonly. Analytical foci varied across stakeholder perspectives (students, faculty, and administration), student awareness and education issues, faculty uniformity versus discretion in review and punishment processes, benchmarking comparisons with other schools, methods of policy dissemination and promotion, and potential changes in technology tools and usage.</p>
<p>Student teams varied in their conception of where the responsibility for improvement lies. Optimally, teams presented a balanced set of recommendations incorporating the views of multiple stakeholder groups and recommendations for procedural or behavioral changes from each of the stakeholder groups. Outstanding projects featured multi-method data collection, clear analysis, and specific and actionable recommendations that are well-matched to identified issues.</p>
<sec id="section10-1052562911428602">
<title>Assessment of Learning</title>
<p>We assessed student learning from the project, based on the three learning objectives, identified in the preceding “Objectives and Rationale” section of this article. We provide an appendix to this article with a complete grading rubric (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1052562911428602">Appendix B</xref>, which is also available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jme.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://jme.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>).</p>
<p>We were able to readily assess some elements of our three objectives, given the nature of the objectives and manner in which students demonstrated learning through the project deliverables. We assessed student understanding of ethical values, their embeddedness in organizations, and their influence on individual and organizational behaviors (Learning Objective 1). We accomplished this assessment by evaluating the quality and comprehensiveness of the final presentation and papers. We considered whether students adopted a stakeholder perspective in the final deliverable, and we used this finding as a reasonable proxy for the greater stakeholder awareness we were trying to foster (Learning Objective 2). Students used action-learning and problem-based learning methods “by design,” which achieved one aspect of Learning Objective 3.</p>
<p>Yet, we were reminded of the observations in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1052562911428602">Lund Dean and Beggs (2006)</xref> concerning how difficult it is to link ethics education to improved ethical behavior or conduct. Our assessment is not immune to these challenges. The final portion of our third objective that students will “internalize ethical understanding and see the link between theory and action” is something that we attempted to assess but were only able to do so imprecisely. We treat the policy as a theory here because an academic integrity policy contains theoretical claims about how a desired behavior will be upheld and an underlying theory about why such behavior is desirable. We evaluated how actionable and substantive the recommendations for improvement that each group provided were. We used these data as an indicator of how well students understood the link between theory and action. We presumed that student groups who made actionable recommendations for improvement to the academic integrity policy conveyed a deeper understanding of the link between theory and action. The relationship between theory and action may have been visible to all students as they moved from ethical frameworks in the classroom to action learning around the campus. Assessing student internalization of ethical awareness would require longitudinal assessment. A pre- and post-evaluation approach might provide a limited means to test for increased internalization even within the time span of the course. It is important to note that we made assessments at the level of the team, a method that fails to capture possible variation among team members relative to each of the learning objectives. An additional individual assessment may be warranted. We suggest using the rubric we provide here (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-1052562911428602">Appendix B</xref>), which includes prompts intended to elicit examples of internalization. It is certainly possible, however, that posing these questions to students provokes a socially desirable, yet manufactured response. Similarly, we ask about ways that the group members learned from one another as a means to assess the level of problem-based learning that took place in the group. This logic follows the problem-based learning notion that a strong problem-based learning experience cannot easily be solved by an individual and requires the group to solve the problem. This question also poses some risk of response bias. Yet, we did not see a means to gain insight into the group or individual learning about these matters without inquiring.</p>

<title>Student Reaction to the Project</title>
<sec id="section12-1052562911428602">
<title>Initial reaction</title>
<p>Because this project differs from a typical organizational analysis project and adopts problem-based learning norms of deliberate ambiguity about the scope of and approach to the project, students sometimes find the project puzzling initially. Often the idea that policy and organizing are related activities is a new revelation to many. It is not uncommon to have students respond somewhat quizzically to the assignment at this juncture. However, once discussion around the concept develops—first in an instructor-led introduction and then in a more intensive team format—comprehension of the project and the potential afforded by a project that can be tailored to varied interests often elicits enthusiasm among students. The following passage captures one team’s emergence from initial uncertainty into escalating engagement with the project and subject matter:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Upon being assigned this project at the beginning of the semester, “The Executives,” as we would later name ourselves, had a difficult time understanding what it is that we had to do. We knew we had to work with the academic integrity policy, so we started by reading the actual policy. From there we had an essential brainstorming, where we established the core values that the policy should incorporate. We concluded that the policy should be uniform across all schools at [the university], incorporating more than just the wording of the policy. Punishment for breaking the policy should be the same across the schools and equally enforced. For example, finance professors should crack down on cheating just as hard as communications professors.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This quote shows how students progressed from a sense of ambiguity to a clear project direction. In this instance, students explored questions of fairness and cheating, thereby connecting the assignment to terrain that most of them have some direct history or experience with. In this way, students can quite easily adapt this project to connect to topics that are somewhat familiar and interesting to them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1052562911428602">
<title>Post-project reaction</title>
<p>At the conclusion of the projects the teams reacted to the experience both in writing and in more informal conversations. The reactions tend to evidence signs of substantial change. Students have often progressed from a very narrow view of academic integrity at their university (driven by personal experience) to possessing an organizational, or even societal, understanding and set of opinions concerning the importance of academic integrity and the challenge of upholding it. Here is one representative response:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Our group, Team Venture, found the task of analyzing and improving the [policy] challenging yet rewarding. A strong sense of honesty and fairness are important to each of the members of the team individually, as well as to the team as a whole. The effectiveness of our revisions lies in the administration’s willingness to revise the existing policy as well as the extent of their commitment in adhering to our proposals for spreading awareness throughout the [university] community. As several of our initiatives illustrate, fostering academic integrity on campus, especially at the university level, is an essential task.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1052562911428602">
<title>Project Outcomes</title>
<p>In our efforts to carry out this project with students, we saw several examples of specific changes and improvements made to policies based on student recommendations. One school began requesting that faculty consistently mention the academic integrity policy in class, and include “boilerplate” language concerning academic integrity in all syllabi with current web links to policies. Another school developed a more “user-friendly” version of the policies based on benchmarking data shared by the students. At each institution, the process of students distributing surveys and conducting interviews with fellow students had an educative effect on other students by engendering conversation about fairness, honesty, and academic integrity. The consciousness-raising aspect of this project was more deeply visible between project groups in the class. An originally unintended but highly welcome outcome of this approach was the feeling during team presentations that the class had developed into a respectful community-of-practice around academic integrity issues, with all class members not only being well-versed in the central topic but also mutually enlivened and inspired by their diverse approaches and perspectives. This mutual inspiration is revealed in the respectful and impressed tone that students generally use in praising the approaches of other teams.</p>
<p>It is our belief that awareness of and adherence to academic integrity is a cornerstone for the broader aims of PRME. Maintaining this standard provides an important means to convey that norms of responsibility must be enacted by the individual and that a culture of ethical conduct is something that has value and can be fostered through deliberate goals and action. Although academic integrity specifically, and ethical conduct more generally, are certainly elements of the responsible leadership platform PRME seeks to encourage, these examples suggest that action learning about PRME could also increase the impact of these principles as a force for change.</p>
<p>This project also heightens student awareness of the complex interface between individual action and organizational policy. Students develop a much keener sense of how organizational structure, policy, and procedure interact with diverse stakeholder behavior. The understanding students gain from this project provides a useful platform to consider other socially responsible organizational behaviors in a similarly more nuanced manner. If we were to ask students to consider concepts of diversity or sustainability, for example, students could conduct a similar analysis looking at how the organization construes and articulates these values, how these values are enshrined in policy, and what actions and procedures contribute to valuing diversity and sustainability. Each step of the way students could identify possibilities for improvement or areas of strength. We will expand on this idea in the next section by suggesting possible variations to the project design.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1052562911428602">
<title>Variations to Project</title>
<p>There are a number of possible variations to the described project approach, each depending on the interest and goal(s) of the particular instructor, institution, or student population. We suggest a small number of such variations here. In each of these examples we keep the basic project structure intact but substitute a different policy focus.</p>
<sec id="section16-1052562911428602">
<title>Variation 1: A Dedicated PRME Approach</title>
<p>Examining and improving a school’s affiliation to PRME would be a suitable and interesting alternative for this project, with the likely side-benefit of increasing awareness of PRME across student, faculty, and administrative stakeholder groups. At some institutions, PRME has been incorporated as a key part of the institutional commitment to responsibility and sustainability. Such institutions publicize PRME and make internal reports to the campus community on their accomplishments and goals relative to PRME. At other institutions students may be hard pressed to know that a school had signed on to the PRME initiative. In this variation, the institution’s affiliation to PRME principles is substituted for the academic integrity policy. Students would explore and ultimately critique how various stakeholder groups enact (or fail to enact) PRME with the goal of optimizing outcomes for those same stakeholder groups, the institution, and the greater community. Beyond looking at the communication about PRME in general or perhaps mapping what activity is, or could be, seen as connected to PRME, students might take a comparative look at what other schools do, might look at how their home institution incorporates other similar affiliations, and so on.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1052562911428602">
<title>Variation 2: A Comparative Ethics Approach</title>
<p>Instructors choosing to implement this project in an ethics or business and society course could add a comparative ethics component to the project that would vividly portray how different ethical frameworks (e.g., common good, justice, rights, utilitarian, virtue), when used as baselines for policy formulation and organizational design, can result in very different outcomes. The instructor could execute this variation in one of two obvious ways. The first option would be to assign or have students select different ethical frameworks as the basis for their analysis of the academic integrity policy or PRME. Analysis and recommendations would then focus on “fitting” the policy and organization to behave according to the framework. On presentation of the projects, students would be exposed to an interesting contrast between the conclusions resulting from each framework. Alternately, students could first identify which ethical framework they see as most represented in their academic integrity policy, or in PRME, and then select or be assigned to make a comparative study of how the policies would change were they informed by differing ethical frameworks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1052562911428602">
<title>Variation 3: A Diversity-Focused Approach</title>
<p>Much of the learning from this project concerns how values are embedded in organizations and how organizational policies thereby encourage or constrain specific behaviors. Academic integrity is just one such example. An alternative would be to focus the project on an institution’s diversity or inclusion policy. Such a project could help students discern between aspects of policy that are more compliance driven versus more robust policies and practices that exist to promote diversity.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1052562911428602">
<title>Limitations and Further Directions</title>
<p>Thus far, we have conducted this project only with undergraduate students although we see no reason that this project could not be conducted with graduate students. We would simply expect that the depth of analysis and possible tie-in to workplace considerations would become more sophisticated. In some of the variations we propose, where this approach is linked to formal ethics frameworks or more formally to PRME principles, we imagine that these added dimensions of abstraction might be better suited to the graduate classroom. Although we can only speculate on the suitability of this project for graduate students, or adaptation to use this approach in an ethics course with a focus more directly on PRME or on another organizational policy such as diversity, our hope is that these limitations inspire others to fill these gaps.</p>
<p>Some may consider whether having students conduct this project in successive semesters creates a practical limitation because some of the people students may want to access to conduct this project could be the same individuals each semester (i.e., administrators who oversee academic integrity or management school faculty). This consideration is a possible challenge in any assignment approach that repeats a similar theme. We have found a number of easy ways to overcome this possible limitation. Perhaps the easiest is to ask key personnel to make themselves available once per semester and have all who wish to access that person do so then. Another approach is to make interview data available from one group to the next to minimize requests for additional data. Because groups have a near limitless number of ways that they can approach this assignment, imposing any constraints can simply inspire groups to find new and creative means to explore these questions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1052562911428602">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>A semester-long project focused on policies that enhance key parts of PRME, such as “right professional conduct,” can promote deep student learning, increase attention to ethics and “spillover activism” resulting from students’ action-learning recommendations, to academic integrity. This approach can help static statements of policy become much more engaged “living documents” that influence the behavior of an organization’s members. The understanding that students can gain through this project about how individual and organizational responsibilities are (or are not) upheld, prepares students to consider all matters of responsibility with greater skill.</p>
<p>PRME is influencing management educators and management institutions to expand and upgrade what it means to be socially responsible. In any such broad initiative, there is a need for innovation and quality improvement that focuses on new activity as well as a process of identifying current activity that supports the initiative. This classroom exercise is one means to link the ambitions of PRME to current university policies that help foster the ethical climate that PRME supports and is supported by. This endeavor is simply one example and we hope it inspires the efforts of others.</p>

<title>Syllabus Materials</title>
<sec id="section22-1052562911428602">
<title>Project Description</title>
<p>You will be discovering, critiquing, and recommending improvements for the way that the [University Name] community “organizes” around a policy designed to uphold academic integrity. In plainer language, your job is to locate, assess, and redesign (if you think it is necessary) the policy itself, and/or the way in which the policy is understood, communicated, and enforced by all members of the [University Name] academic community.</p>
<p>You must gather perspectives from at least three (3) of the various “stakeholder” constituencies that are influenced by the integrity policy (e.g., students, faculty, administration, parents, competitors, critics, etc.) as part of your research. This will require your team to execute a structured stakeholder analysis.</p>
<p>I will not be telling you what a “good” academic integrity policy or organization is. Instead, your team will have to agree on a set of organizational and ethical principles on which to base your analysis. In this Organizational Behavior class you will learn a wide variety of organizational theories and organizing principles—again, choose at least three (3) organizational behavior topics, theories, or concepts to feature in your analysis (e.g., motivation, communication, organizational structure, organizational culture, leadership). We will also discuss various ethical frameworks during the semester to assist teams in constructing a guiding set of ethical principles for the project.</p>
<p>The two deliverables of this process are a brief team presentation (15 minutes) and a 3- to 5-page (single spacing) written analysis; both equally count toward your project grade. The format of your presentation and paper is flexible, but make sure that you include a section called “Analysis” (discussing what you found, how you proceeded, and what your team’s prioritized values were) and a section called “Recommended Changes” (discussing what you would like to change and why this is a good idea). Your paper should include an additional section describing how team members gained understanding from one another during the project, including specific references to exchanges of experience, knowledge, and perspective that ultimately improved mutual understanding of project issues and solutions.</p>

<title>What Is Stakeholder Analysis?</title>
<p><italic>Stakeholders</italic> are groups of people with interest in a body of resources (e.g., an organization) and in policies or endeavors (e.g., projects) affecting those resources. In the case of this project, stakeholders either influence or are influenced by activity around, changes to, or outcomes of the academic integrity policy. <italic>Stakeholder analysis</italic> identifies the stakeholders who have some interest in the issues or outcomes influenced by the academic integrity policy. It may be helpful to consider that there are often primary stakeholders without whom an organization could not function (i.e., a manufacturing business could not operate without customers, employees, producers, suppliers) as well as other stakeholders who may be affected by the organization’s practices (in the case of the manufacturing business, competitors, government regulators, neighbors to the business, those who are indirectly affected by the business, such as people who may wish to use the resources the business consumes and now pay a higher price to do so, or those who travel on the same routes that the goods are transported on, etc.). The goal of stakeholder analysis is to develop a view of the interests and perspectives of the various stakeholders, and to understand the differences among stakeholders and the relationships between the different stakeholders and the policy and organizational practices and changes under consideration.</p>
<p>Creating a table like the one below will help you structure your stakeholder analysis. To populate the table, you will need to first fill in the stakeholder column (possibly in a brainstorming session) with the names of many stakeholder groups and then probe more deeply into at least three groups by conducting primary research (e.g., interviews, surveys). You will want to gather as much depth as possible concerning how members of the stakeholder group perceive the policy and how they would be affected, either positively or negatively, by changes under consideration.</p>

<title>Assessment Rubric</title>
<p>This is the grading rubric that specifies what is expected of students in their project efforts. You will notice that the rubric is founded on the three project learning objectives.</p>
<list id="list4-1052562911428602" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Learning Objective 1: Students will see how ethical values are embedded in organizations and influence individual and organizational behaviors</italic>. Analyze the following:</p>
<list id="list5-1052562911428602" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>How (academic integrity) policy is designed to (and actually does/does not) influence individual and organizational behaviors</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How academic policy is disseminated, communicated, upheld</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How (academic integrity) policy is affected by larger body of policies (codes of conduct, grievance procedures, classroom syllabi, technology use, etc.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How changes in policy might affect behavioral changes among stakeholders</p></list-item>
</list>
</list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Learning Objective 2: Students will develop a stronger sense of stakeholder awareness</italic>. Identify:</p>
<list id="list6-1052562911428602" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A list of all possible stakeholders who have an interest in academic integrity</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The interests and concerns of three stakeholder groups</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The influence each (of the three) stakeholder group has on policy</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The impact of any proposed changes on each stakeholder group</p></list-item>
</list>
</list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Learning Objective 3: The project will use action-learning and problem-based learning approaches to help students internalize ethical understanding and see the link between theory and action</italic>. Identify:</p>
<list id="list7-1052562911428602" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>How the three organizational behavior concepts from the course influence individual or organizational action</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>New thinking or awareness (if any) related to ethics and/or integrity prompted by this project for individual group members of the team as a whole</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Recommendations to improve policies and predict how recommendations will influence stakeholder behavior</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How team members learned from or gained understanding from one another and made decisions as a group</p></list-item></list>

<title>Assessing Project Quality</title>
<p>Your learning on this project will be assessed based on how you complete each of the items identified above. The difference between an outstanding project and one that is simply average or below average is judged based on the following criteria:</p>
<sec id="section26-1052562911428602">
<title>Depth and comprehensiveness</title>
<p>How completely and to what extent you respond to each of the bullet point items above. An excellent project would respond in a thorough manner to each of the bullet points and provide more substantive analysis. For example, an outstanding consideration of the “the impact of any proposed change on stakeholder groups” might consider possible unintended consequences of changes or the ways that changes to one stakeholder group might affect another. An average analysis might go into depth on some of these points but not treat each bullet point item in as much depth. A poor analysis would neglect to cover some points or do so in insufficient depth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section27-1052562911428602">
<title>Persuasiveness</title>
<p>An outstanding project makes use of compelling evidence and displays clear, logical, easy to follow, and possibly innovative reasoning. An average presentation is less persuasive because the quality of the evidence provided is less ample or less convincing (from less trusted sources, etc.) or has some unevenness with flow and clarity. A poor project might fail to account for alternative explanations, or rely on opinions more than data, or simply fail to use a coherent line of reasoning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section28-1052562911428602">
<title>Real-world impact</title>
<p>How actionable are the recommendations (i.e., how ready for implementation are your suggestions)? What changes, if any, have already been realized as a result of the project? An excellent project would make recommendations that could be implemented easily and perhaps propose a strategy for implementation or have already effected some changes in the data-gathering phase of the project. An average project might offer specific recommendations but comparatively little analysis of how to implement these changes or have made no impact during the course of the project. A poor presentation would offer recommendations that cannot easily be implemented and would not have made changes that increase ethics and integrity as part of the project.</p>
