<abstract>
<p>In this rejoinder the authors respond to the three reactions to the major contribution, “Ethnic Minority Psychological Associations: Connections to Counseling Psychology,” provided by Chung and Wu, Neville, Flores, and Dobson, and Yakushko, Wang, and Warrior. In their thoughtful reactions, these current and past leaders of the Society of Counseling Psychology (SCP) furthered the dialogue and offered additional insights into the relationship between Ethnic Minority Psychological Associations (EMPAs) and SCP. In the authors’ rejoinder they focus on (a) the commonalities across these reactions and (b) the unique contribution of each reaction. Each of the reactions offered a new framework (or analogy) for how the EMPAs and SCP can work together to advance a social justice agenda.</p>

<body>
<p>As the editors of the major contribution, “Ethnic Minority Psychological Associations: Connections to Counseling Psychology,” we were eager to read the three responses by leaders of the Society of Counseling Psychology (SCP): the current president of the SCP and his coauthor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012446376">Chung &amp; Wu, 2012</xref>), one of the current American Psychological Association (APA) Council members representing SCP and her coauthors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012446376">Neville, Flores, &amp; Dobson, 2012</xref>), and a past chair of the SCP Committee on Early Career Professionals and APA Committee on Early Career Psychologists and her coauthors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000012446376">Yakushko, Wang, &amp; Warrior, 2012</xref>). These authors have added richness to the major contribution by offering three new frameworks for better understanding current and the potential for stronger future relationships between SCP and Ethnic Minority Psychological Associations (EMPAs). We were gratified that the authors supported our goals to provide a comprehensive account of EMPAs’ history and development, honor EMPAs’ accomplishments and their contributions to counseling psychology and psychology more generally, situate EMPAs as professional organizations from which SCP could learn a great deal, and encourage greater collaborations between EMPAs and SCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012446376">Delgado-Romero, Forrest, &amp; Lau, 2012</xref>). These authors, like us, hope that counseling psychology leaders, members, early career professionals (ECPs), and students will have a broad and systematic exposure to the EMPAs via this major contribution and that the EMPAs will be a more integral part of counseling psychology’s future.</p>
<sec id="section1-0011000012446376">
<title>Common Themes That Underscore the Importance of EMPAs to SCP</title>
<p>We identified several common themes across the three responses that reassured us that a greater knowledge of EMPAs’ history and strengths has much to offer SCP and its members and affiliates. First, we are in agreement that EMPAs serve and represent a number of important functions in psychology. As all the reactants have highlighted, EMPAs foster a sense of belonging in a culturally responsive environment with a strong emphasis on creating personal and professional benefits for students and ECPs. This is achieved through mentoring and networking opportunities that offer participants many ways to be engaged, involved, and take leadership roles in the organization. We agree with the reactants that these EMPA efforts serve as models for SCP especially in engaging ethnic minority and nonminority students and ECPs in the scholarship and professional development of ethnic minority psychology.</p>
<p>A second commonality across two of the reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012446376">Chung &amp; Wu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012446376">Neville et al., 2012</xref>) was a clear sense that the relationships among the EMPAs and between EMPAs and SCP offer a potential for interconnectedness. At the same time, both sets of authors asserted the critical need for independence and distinctiveness unique to each cultural group and its ethnic minority professional organization. Members of EMPAs must navigate this tension with SCP and the greater APA, while SCP members strive to become effective allies to EMPA members. This process is reciprocal and mutually informative.</p>
<p>Third, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012446376">Chung and Wu (2012)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012446376">Neville et al. (2012)</xref> in their reactions noted that important contextual information was missing. Neville et al. would have liked to see more information about the larger sociopolitical environment from which the EMPA emerged. Chung and Wu commented that understanding the macro issues in the larger world would help us understand past conflicts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000012446376">Delgado-Romero et al., 2012</xref>). Looking forward, we agree with Chung and Wu’s comment that “by focusing our collective attention toward macro-level issues, we will achieve our micro-level goals of creating sustainable connectedness and loyalty within and between the EMPAs and SCP” (p. 735). Finally, both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000012446376">Yakushko et al. (2012)</xref> and Neville et al. noted that creating smaller, more intimate environments for engagement is an important strength of EMPAs and serves as a model for how SCP might appeal to and better serve the professional needs of students and ECPs.</p>
<p>As all of the contributions in this volume have described, the emergence of EMPAs was in part a reaction to the status quo of psychology as a science and profession. An important challenge in shaping the future of these relationships is deepening the connections while maintaining individual organizational identities. We believe that the simultaneous optimism for collaboration and the need to assert organizational individuality is a necessary and healthy dynamic.</p>

<title>Reactants’ Frameworks and Metaphors Provide New Insights</title>
<p>Beyond these commonalities, each set of authors offered a unique framework or metaphor for understanding EMPAs and their relationship to SCP: (a) viewing SCP as an ally organization to EMPAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012446376">Neville et al., 2012</xref>), (b) using a “both–and” perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012446376">Chung &amp; Wu, 2012</xref>), and (c) understanding cohort influences on joining professional organizations by using the “bowling alone” analogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000012446376">Yakushko et al., 2012</xref>). We think each of these frameworks offers new insights that further our goal of better connecting SCP with the EMPAs, and we use these frameworks to make further recommendations in the ensuing paragraphs.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000012446376">Neville et al. (2012)</xref> proposed that SCP assume an ally stance, and we strongly affirm that this would be an excellent way for SCP to proceed with developing its relationship with EMPAs. Counseling psychology has a strong tradition of conceptualizing our professional work within advocacy roles, especially when concerning multicultural competency and social justice work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000012446376">Atkinson, Thompson, &amp; Grant, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000012446376">Mio &amp; Roades, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000012446376">Vera &amp; Speight, 2003</xref>). Moreover, many other scholars outside of counseling psychology have similarly argued for the need for allies to combat racism and oppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000012446376">Kivel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000012446376">Tatum, 1997</xref>). We see the commitment to assume ally and advocate roles in our professional and organizational activities as a natural extension of this tradition. To us, using an ally framework suggests that SCP leadership and members would (a) show great respect for the autonomy of each EMPA, (b) be curious about the uniqueness of each EMPA’s history and goals, (c) bring a learning attitude to building a satisfying and successful relationship with EMPAs, (d) focus on EMPAs’ organizational strengths and traditions (e.g., the integration of cultural traditions, honoring elders, intergenerational mentoring, more intimate social opportunities), and (e) find ways to support EMPAs when challenged or ignored by others in psychology. Neville et al. provided an excellent example of being an ally by supporting EMPA journals as publishing outlets for multicultural scholars and challenging others who view EMPA journals as less rigorous or significant in the tenure review process. Further discussions between leaders of EMPAs and SCP will identify many more ways that SCP can serve as an ally to EMPAs. We especially like the ally metaphor because it provides clear guidance for SCP and its leaders about how they can support the organizations of the EMPAs for who they are and what they do best.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012446376">Chung and Wu’s (2012)</xref> suggestion of using a “both–and” framework also provided a rich and informative way of understanding the relationship dynamics between EMPAs and SCP. The example they provided of using the both–and perspective to understand the strengths of both written history and story telling was excellent. We particularly liked their recommendation to capture the oral histories of those counseling psychologists who have been active in both EMPA and SCP and how they participated in and maneuvered between the two organizations across their careers. As mentioned in the article on Division 45 of the APA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000012446376">Morales, Lau, &amp; Ballesteros, 2012</xref>), there have been efforts to record the oral history of ethnic minority scholars involved in the formation of the division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000012446376">Pickren, 2006</xref>). With the advent of social media and the ease of uploading and sharing videos, we feel that the oral tradition could be best preserved through modern technology. For example, the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi) has a lecture series available through their website and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://youtube.com">youtube.com</ext-link> (e.g., an interview with ABPsi cofounder Joseph White at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pfpBBv5k6o&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pfpBBv5k6o&amp;feature=related</ext-link>). Creating and sharing interviews with counseling psychologists who have provided leadership in both EMPAs and SCP would offer both rich training tools for counseling psychology programs and recruiting tools for EMPAs and SCP. In addition, technology can make these interviews freely available to anyone with – an internet connection.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000012446376">Chung and Wu (2012)</xref> also used the “both–and” framework for understanding the micro and macro influences on the EMPA–SCP relationship dynamics. Their suggestion to examine macro-level influences on relationship dynamics between the organizations and to use collaborative meaning making is another excellent suggestion. We agree such efforts could serve as a model for other divisions in APA and the larger society to grow their connections with ethnic minority psychology. The allegory of the five brothers was a powerful way to understand the collaborative potential of a stronger relationship between the EMPAs and SCP.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000012446376">Yakushko et al.’s (2012)</xref> “bowling alone” analogy borrowed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000012446376">Putnam (1995)</xref> provided us with a challenge. We found the two previous frameworks to be immediately relevant and useful, ones that were easy to apply to understanding and improving the relationships between EMPAs and SCP. The bowling alone analogy we viewed as less positive yet important because it points out the need for careful attention and perhaps substantial changes in how professional organizations reach potential new members, especially students and those who have graduated recently. Although only 40% of APA members are also division members, according to Yakushko et al. less than 12% of ECPs have joined a division. This fact suggests that our ECPs may be more “alone” in their professional relationship with APA. Yakushko et al. suggested that perhaps ECPs are not bowling alone but are building community in smaller, more meaningful ways. They noted the vital function that smaller, more intimate EMPAs may perform for ECPs by creating more inviting and comfortable places for feeling connected and easier avenues for active involvement. These new ways of organizing that may be more attractive to younger cohorts should be nourished and supported. Our concern though, and a reason for developing this major contribution, is how to bring the influences of these smaller communities and their benefits and accomplishments into dialogue with the larger organization of SCP. The authors of recent publications in <italic>The Counseling Psychologist</italic> focused on ECPs assert that recruitment and retention of ECPs should be an SCP priority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000012446376">Forrest, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000012446376">Hahn, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000012446376">Israel, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000012446376">Smith et al., in press</xref>) and provide many useful recommendations for doing so.</p>
<p>The future challenges for professional organizations will be to create organizations that adapt and change with larger societal influences that are shaping cohort values and inclinations. In all likelihood this will be a common problem across EMPAs and SCP. This makes us curious if there is a similar drop in students’ and ECPs’ membership within the EMPAs. And if not, SCP could learn from studying EMPA students and ECP members. If EMPAs are experiencing a similar drop-off, we recommend a joint project between SCP and EMPAs that identifies and analyzes cohort effects and builds organizational outreach plans based on those discoveries. Professional organizations probably need to mirror the “real” lives of students and ECPs we hope to recruit. Using current technology as a model, we suspect this means we need to build rich ways for students and ECPs to explore options with limited need for commitment initially yet allow for progressive gradations of commitment as the benefits of belonging and engaging become more apparent.</p>

<title>Concluding Thoughts</title>
<p>The larger issue that we see emerging from these reactions is a tension surrounding two issues. First, there is the call for continued and creative collaboration between EMPAs and SCP. At the same time, there is a worry that there will be dilution of organizational identity and accomplishments. Second, there is fear of increasing disengagement, especially by emerging professionals, from organizational participation. We are hopeful that the lack of participation is evidence that grassroots efforts are coalescing elsewhere and are addressing emergent issues not yet evident to the larger profession. We believe this is a desirable and healthy dynamic that is a great example of the “both–and” perspective. It is through separation and organization that EMPAs emerged and in turn stimulated the growth and development of SCP in attending to the issues raised by EMPAs. We need to continue this “both–and” dynamic tension to stir future growth for both EMPAs and SCP. The key, however, is knowing how to encourage these smaller communities of emerging professionals to bring back to the larger organization their work and perspectives and for the larger organization to continue to keep these discussions as an organizational priority.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe there is knowledge and experience that can be drawn from this collection of articles and reactions that have implications for the internationalization of counseling psychology. There are cultural differences and power imbalances embedded in the collaborative work among psychologists working across cultures and national boundaries. There are many good examples and recommendations in these articles about how the EMPAs and SCP jointly have and can in the future advance social justice agendas. These examples and recommendations provide a good model for collaborative efforts by U.S. scholars and practitioners working in other countries. We end with comments about the internationalization of counseling psychology because they remind us that the energy and enthusiasm for this major contribution orginated at the International Counseling Psychology Conference (ICPC) during and after a symposium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000012446376">Forrest et al., 2008</xref>) that sparked great interest among students and ECPs. Given the strong transnational history of many people of color, many EMPA members have strong international ties, so focusing on international issues at ICPC was a natural fit for them. We believe the benefits of EMPAs and SCP building stronger relationships also apply to working cross-nationally at the professional organizational level.</p>
