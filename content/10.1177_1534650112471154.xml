<abstract>
<p>This is a single case study of a middle-aged man with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Dissociative Disorder Not Otherwise Specified following sexual assault as an adult. Treatment consisted of supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy, focusing on reintegrating the patient into his community, followed by insight-oriented psychodynamic psychotherapy with an emphasis on processing trauma and decreasing PTSD and dissociative symptoms. Daily subjective, self-report measures were used to track his symptoms over a 29-month period. Simulation Modeling Analysis for time-series was utilized to assess the phase change from pretreatment baseline phase to total treatment phase and also <italic>between</italic> supportive psychotherapy phase and insight-oriented psychotherapy phase. Symptoms tracked included overall distress, preoccupation with the trauma, and dissociation. All symptoms significantly improved from the pretreatment baseline phase to the total treatment phase. Overall distress and preoccupation with the trauma significantly improved from the supportive to the insight-oriented psychotherapy phase.</p>

<title>1 Theoretical and Research Basis for Treatment</title>
<p>Male survivors of sexual assault, especially adult males, are less well represented in the empirical literature than are females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534650112471154">Chapleau, Oswald, &amp; Russell, 2008</xref>), perhaps due to the lower occurrence of rape in males versus females and to the relative unwillingness of males to report it or seek treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534650112471154">Walker, Archer, &amp; Davies, 2005</xref>). Nevertheless, 3% to 8% of adult American or British men report having been sexually assaulted as an adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534650112471154">Elliott, Mok, &amp; Briere, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, males report similar symptoms to females: fear, anger, depression, somatic complaints, problems with relationships, and sexual dysfunctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534650112471154">Koss &amp; Harvey, 1986</xref>). There is no current literature on the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adult male rape victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534650112471154">Turchik &amp; Edwards, 2012</xref>). However, in an early study, 94% of rape victims (male and female) reported symptoms associated with PTSD one week following the rape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534650112471154">Foa &amp; Rothbaum, 1989</xref>): re-experiencing of the traumatic event, avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma, numbing of general responsiveness, and increased arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534650112471154">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Dissociation may also result from the experience of severe trauma, including rape. Dissociative symptoms characterize individuals who develop PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534650112471154">Bremner, Scott, Delaney, &amp; Southwick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534650112471154">Marmar, Weiss, Schlenger, &amp; Fairbank, 1994</xref>), and dissociation may be considered an avoidance symptom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534650112471154">APA, 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534650112471154">Spiegel (1986)</xref> theorized that dissociation is a defense mechanism activated in response to overwhelming pain and helplessness following trauma. He suggests that dissociation is different from other defense mechanisms. Rather than protecting an individual from unconscious desires and drives, he thought that dissociation would shield an individual’s psyche from immediate traumatic experiences. However, fragmentation of one’s sense of self may then occur, and dissociation may become part of the person’s emotion regulation strategy, reactivated when exposed to future stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534650112471154">Spiegel, 1986</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1534650112471154">
<title>Psychodynamic Psychotherapy and PTSD</title>
<p>As with exposure therapy for treating PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650112471154">Foa, Rothbaum, Riggs, &amp; Murdock, 1991</xref>), psychodynamic psychotherapy encourages the patient to confront his trauma to diminish and alleviate symptoms. However, psychodynamic psychotherapy additionally focuses on the creation of meaning by integrating the trauma into the individual’s sense of self, the other, and the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534650112471154">Solomon &amp; Johnson, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534650112471154">Horowitz (1976)</xref> first conceptualized the traumatized individual’s response to trauma as “vacillating” between an intrusive phase and an avoidance phase, and he devised a brief psychoanalytic treatment for each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534650112471154">Horowitz, 1976</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534650112471154">Horowitz (1997)</xref> later acknowledged that these phases may overlap, consistent with a current diagnosis of PTSD. Therefore, in this study, Horowitz’s approach to treatment is slightly modified in terms of a lengthier treatment and in terms of treating the intrusive and avoidance symptoms concurrently.</p>
<p>When an individual experiences intrusive/obsessive thoughts, nightmares, and flashbacks, the therapist encourages the patient to regulate affective responses to memories and thoughts that are disturbing and/or triggering the posttraumatic stress symptoms of hyperarousal. This emotion regulation is fostered through a supportive and safe therapeutic atmosphere, the transmission and acquisition of anxiety-management and coping skills, and potentially medication. When the individual is experiencing avoidance symptoms, such as emotional numbness, selective inattention, withdrawal, frantic overactivity, being “dazed,” or even having partial or complete amnesia for the traumatic incident, the patient is attempting to manage the overwhelming distress of the trauma. Therefore, the therapist encourages the patient to confront traumatic memories, any associations or triggers, and the related emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. Subsequently, the overwhelming affect is diminished and the therapist then puts an emphasis on obtaining understanding and meaning behind the patient’s various posttraumatic stress symptoms. The purpose of this is for the patient to gain a sense of mastery over the trauma and, thus, restore the previous level of functioning and self-efficacy in the patient’s life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534650112471154">Horowitz, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534650112471154">1997</xref>).</p>

<title>Treatment Outcome Research of Rape Victims Who Develop PTSD</title>
<p>There is currently no treatment outcome research for adult male rape victims with PTSD, because adult male rape victims are rarely studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534650112471154">Ratner et al., 2003</xref>), and there are relatively few of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534650112471154">Walker et al., 2005</xref>). There are, however, numerous treatment outcome studies regarding adult <italic>female</italic> rape victims with PTSD, which support the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral approaches (e.g., stress inoculation therapy, prolonged imaginal exposure, systematic desensitization, cognitive processing therapy) in treating adult female rape victims with a diagnosis of PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650112471154">Foa et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534650112471154">Leiner, Kearns, Jackson, Astin, &amp; Rothbaum, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534650112471154">Resick &amp; Schnicke, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534650112471154">Taylor &amp; Harvey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534650112471154">Vickerman &amp; Margolin, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, supportive counseling is effective in treating PTSD symptoms in adult female rape victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534650112471154">Foa, Rothbaum, &amp; Steketee, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534650112471154">Foa, Zoellner, &amp; Feeny, 2006</xref>), although less effective than many of the cognitive-behavioral approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534650112471154">Resick, Jordan, Girelli, &amp; Hutter, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534650112471154">Taylor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534650112471154">Vickerman et al., 2009</xref>). In meta-analyses conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534650112471154">Sherman (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534650112471154">Taylor et al. (2009)</xref>, cognitive-behavioral therapy approaches to treatment of PTSD are overwhelmingly more effective than many other types of treatment for PTSD.</p>
<p>There is a lack of treatment outcome research on insight-oriented psychodynamic sychotherapy with rape victims with a diagnosis of PTSD. However, there are treatment outcome studies investigating insight-oriented psychodynamic psychotherapy for treating PTSD generally, but not for rape victims with a diagnosis of PTSD specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534650112471154">Brom, Kleber, &amp; Defares, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534650112471154">Sherman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534650112471154">Solomon et al., 2002</xref>). These studies found that insight-oriented psychodynamic psychotherapy is as effective as is exposure therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534650112471154">Brom et al., 1989</xref>). Finally, studies that compared active treatment (cognitive-behavioral, supportive, or insight-oriented psychodynamic) to a wait-list control group found that individuals in active treatment had more improvement than their wait-list counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534650112471154">Brom &amp; Kleber, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650112471154">Foa et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534650112471154">Foa et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>To have a clearer picture of treatment efficacy for individuals with PTSD, more research needs to be conducted using various treatment modalities and theoretical orientations. More attention needs to be paid to less visible victims of severe trauma, specifically adult male rape victims. This case study utilizes a time-series methodology to assess the efficacy of supportive and insight-oriented psychodynamic psychotherapy for an adult male sexual assault survivor. Time-series longitudinal data supplement the clinical case study material.</p>

<title>Single Case Studies, Time-Series Design, and Phase Change Analysis</title>
<p>A relatively new design has received attention for its ability to monitor a patient’s progress during the course of therapy and for assessing clinically significant improvement in the individual’s self-identified distressing symptoms. Quantitative research of patient-rated symptoms in a single-subject (<italic>N</italic> = 1) design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534650112471154">Borckardt &amp; Nash, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534650112471154">Borckardt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534650112471154">Nash, Borckardt, Abbas, &amp; Gray, 2011</xref>) tracks symptoms daily and provides a detailed and rich picture of the patient’s change (or lack thereof) over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534650112471154">Nash et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>2 Case Introduction</title>
<p>Mr. V was a single, 29-year-old Caucasian male who lived at home with his retired parents. He was on medical leave from his job as a server at a restaurant, due to informing his boss that he had been supposedly diagnosed with cancer and needed surgery. This was in fact untrue, but used as a cover for his distress following the disclosure a few months earlier of a female friend who had experienced a sexual trauma, whereupon Mr. V was flooded by intrusive memories, nightmares, and flashbacks of his own sexual assault that had occurred eight years prior. Mr. V was referred for psychotherapy and was prescribed 50 mg of sertraline approximately one week prior to intake by his primary care physician to treat symptoms of PTSD (309.81) and Dissociative Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (300.15).</p>
<p>Details of the assault were revealed at intake. At age 21, Mr. V was invited to the home of a middle-aged, self-identified homosexual male friend of the family under the pretense of attending a party. When he arrived, he found no other guests there and began to feel uneasy but convinced himself of his own safety with this man whom he had known his whole life. After some time had passed and no other attendees arrived, Mr. V attempted to leave, whereupon the perpetrator emerged from the kitchen naked, threw Mr. V away from the front door onto the floor, and began to anally rape him. Mr. V reported becoming completely immobilized and silent, which has been termed <italic>tonic immobility</italic> or “the last-ditch defense against entrapment by a predator” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534650112471154">Lima et al., 2010</xref>, p. 225). In addition to the involuntary immobility, it also includes analgesia and near complete unresponsiveness to the external stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534650112471154">Gallup, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534650112471154">Lima et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1534650112471154">
<title>3 Presenting Complaints</title>
<p>Mr. V presented with posttraumatic stress and dissociative symptoms. His posttraumatic stress symptoms included intrusive/obsessive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks of the sexual assault, and avoidance of triggers that reminded him of the trauma (the word “rape;” images or conversations in person, on TV, or in movies relating to rape; any contact with or even mention of perpetrator; interest and/or participation in any romantic or sexual relationship); hypervigilance; sleep disturbance; detachment and isolation; and eventually refusal to leave his home. His dissociative symptoms included losing time or “blacking out” in which he had no recollection of his activities; fabricating detailed stories (such as his diagnosis of cancer and his need for surgery); spending large sums of money on credit cards he did not recall doing; and a general sense of numbing and dissociation at times when reminded of the trauma.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1534650112471154">
<title>4 History</title>
<p>Mr. V lived with his biological mother and father in a city of approximately 200,000 in an upper-middle socioeconomic status home until he was 1-year-old when his parents divorced. He then lived with his mother and had only sporadic contact with his father. At the age of 5, his mother remarried to a man who eventually legally adopted him. Mr. V referred to this man as his “dad.” He reported that his adoptive father was an alcoholic when his mother married him and physically abused Mr. V at age 6 while intoxicated. Mr. V’s mother took the child and left her new husband until he agreed to end his alcohol abuse. Following this incident, his adoptive father became sober and did not physically abuse Mr. V again. Nevertheless, Mr. V reported continued verbal and emotional abuse: being called stupid or dumb, which made him feel as if he was not good enough. Furthermore, Mr. V’s biological father was largely absent from his life. When Mr. V was 18, his biological father told him that as he had not been in his life up until this point, he did not think he should be in his life in the future. Mr. V reported being devastated and that this was the last time he spoke to his biological father.</p>
<p>Mr. V did not report a history of alcohol or substance use, abuse, or dependence. He reported no previous therapy, use of psychotropic medications, hospitalizations, or legal history. He did not have any major accidents, illnesses, neurological problems, or deaths in the family as a child. Mr. V reported that he had been diagnosed as a child with a learning disorder, was placed in remedial classes, and graduated with a special diploma. Since high school, Mr. V had a series of unskilled restaurant and retail jobs. He always lived with his parents and had difficulty managing his finances even prior to the rape and subsequent dissociation. He had never been married, had no children, reported being heterosexual, and had one serious romantic relationship at age 19. He stated that prior to his traumatic memories being triggered, he had several friends and numerous acquaintances. He had no history of suicidal/homicidal ideation, auditory/visual hallucinations, or delusions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1534650112471154">
<title>5 Assessment</title>
<p>To identify symptoms to be tracked over time, Mr. V completed an intake interview in which he was asked, “How would you know you were getting better during treatment?” Therapist and patient collaboratively identified overall distress and preoccupation with the trauma. These were rated on a 9-point Likert-type scale, where 1 indicated <italic>not at all feeling distressed or thinking about the trauma</italic> and 9 indicated <italic>feeling extremely distressed or thinking about the trauma all day</italic>. The therapist decided at intake that Mr. V’s dissociative symptomatology would also be monitored by administering the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534650112471154">Bernstein &amp; Putnam, 1986</xref>) at the beginning of each therapy session. The DES is a self-report measure assessing dissociation on a continuum. His initial score on the DES was 38. A score of 20 to 30 is considered a high score on the DES.</p>
<p>Following the intake interview, Mr. V was found to be non-emergent, non-suicidal, and nonpsychotic allowing him to be eligible to participate in the time-series study. At that time, his case was sent to be staffed and was assigned to the intake therapist for individual psychotherapy. Prior to beginning treatment, Mr. V completed additional psychological testing as well as 40 days of daily symptom tracking during the initial pretreatment baseline phase. Throughout this phase, Mr. V had access to his therapist as well as a 24-hour clinic crisis line. It is important to assess whether a pretreatment baseline phase is appropriate for each patient on an individual case-by-case basis, bearing in mind the criteria stated above regarding the individual’s mental status at the time of the intake interview.</p>
<p>The total treatment phase was 28 months of individual psychotherapy in which the first 24 months were conducted weekly and the last four months were switched to biweekly sessions. Mr. V rated his symptoms daily. During the total treatment phase, four months of supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy occurred, to reintegrate Mr. V into his community. A subsequent 24-month period of insight-oriented psychodynamic psychotherapy followed to process the trauma and to decrease his level of distress, PTSD symptoms, and dissociative symptoms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1534650112471154">
<title>6 Case Conceptualization</title>
<p>Mr. V was conceptualized as someone prone to approval-seeking and unconditional compliance with male authority figures following abandonment by his biological father and a strained relationship with a critical adoptive father. Following the rape, Mr. V refused to tell anyone due to feeling that he would be judged, that his masculinity would be compromised, and his sexuality questioned especially by the men in his life. However, after his friend’s disclosure of her own sexual assault, Mr. V’s need for emotional support following the trauma manifested itself in a way that he perceived as being immune from harsh judgment. He began losing time and “story telling” that he had been diagnosed with cancer and would need surgery. This elicited the sympathy and compassion that Mr. V so desperately needed following his rape that he was unable to acknowledge. However, these large-scale stories were impossible to sustain. Mr. V’s stories were discovered by his parents, which prompted him to reveal that he had been raped and to subsequently seek medical and psychological treatment.</p>
<p>Treatment was designed to address Mr. V’s posttraumatic stress symptoms of hyperarousal, intrusive thoughts and nightmares, and withdrawal in addition to his dissociative symptoms of losing time, emotional numbing, and “story telling.” Supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy would address the consequences of Mr. V’s overwhelming intrusive symptoms. That is, supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy addressed his drastic decrease in daily life functioning, his reintegration into withdrawal from his community, and his strained interpersonal relationships by encouraging him to confront each of these overwhelming situations after obtaining anxiety-management and other coping skills while purposely deemphasizing the trauma to foster emotion regulation and stabilization. Insight-oriented psychodynamic psychotherapy addressed his resistance, his losing time, the “stories,” as well as his PTSD symptoms to allow him to create meaning in relation to the trauma and integrate that meaning into his self-concept.</p>

<sec id="section10-1534650112471154">
<title>7 Course of Treatment and Assessment of Progress</title>
<sec id="section11-1534650112471154">
<title>Overview</title>
<p>Mr. V participated in once weekly individual psychotherapy for 24 months of treatment. Due to his highly dependent traits and previous experiences of separation anxiety that Mr. V displayed in his relationships, the remaining four months of therapy were switched to biweekly sessions in preparation for termination. In the theoretical literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534650112471154">Pistole (1999)</xref>, among others, stated that termination can evoke previous losses and separation anxiety for patients, which can be induced by the loss of the current attachment figure, that is, the therapist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534650112471154">Graybar &amp; Leonard, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, Mr. V’s dependency issues surrounding his transference toward of the therapist as an attachment figure and his proneness to seek approval may have played a significant role in the patient’s consistent treatment attendance and adherence to daily symptom tracking. Thus, transitioning from weekly to biweekly therapy was a vital factor in readying the patient for termination.</p>
<p>Following the pretreatment baseline phase, supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy began, followed by insight-oriented psychodynamic psychotherapy. The primary goal of the treatment was to establish a safe and comfortable space for Mr. V and to create a strong therapeutic alliance. Obviously, this goal is important with any patient in any psychotherapeutic context; however, it is particularly important when working with traumatized individuals whose illusion of safety in the world has been shattered.</p>
<p>During supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy, the therapist encouraged Mr. V to deemphasize his focus on the trauma to foster emotion regulation and stabilization through the use of various approaches, including antidepressant medication prescribed by his physician, a supportive and safe therapeutic atmosphere and alliance, psychoeducation about posttraumatic stress and dissociative symptoms, and a focus on the use of anxiety-management and coping skills. The choice to deemphasize the trauma rather than process it during this phase of treatment was due to the extensive destruction and reactivity the intrusive symptoms had recently caused (i.e., flooding, dissociative episodes of losing time, complete withdrawal from relationships, loss of job). Through the use of supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy, Mr. V decided to reveal to his community that he had not been diagnosed with cancer and that he was seeking psychological treatment, following a period of extended isolation and inability to work. This enabled Mr. V to reintegrate into his community by reestablishing previous relationships, rejoining his church, and initiating a job search. Thus, following this reintegration into his community, the transition to insight-oriented psychodynamic psychotherapy occurred.</p>
<p>During insight-oriented psychodynamic psychotherapy, the emphasis was on processing Mr. V’s trauma and decreasing his level of distress, PTSD symptoms, and frequency and degree of dissociative symptoms. Therefore, during this phase of treatment, Mr. V was encouraged to confront his traumatic memories, any associations or triggers, and his related emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. Subsequently, his overwhelming affect was diminished, and the therapist then put an emphasis on obtaining understanding of unconscious and conscious meaning of Mr. V’s various posttraumatic stress symptoms. The purpose of this was for Mr. V to gain a sense of mastery over his trauma and, thus, restore his previous level of functioning and self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534650112471154">Horowitz, 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>Throughout the treatment, each session began by discussing Mr. V’s tracked symptoms and the level of distress they created during the previous week. This discussion shaped the remainder of the session and allowed the patient a sense of control. Thus, Mr. V’s treatment consisted of more than symptom reduction and improving his level of functioning. As other therapeutic issues emerged, they were processed. Many of which were interpersonal in nature revolving around abandonment and dependency issues with regard to an absent and emotionally unavailable biological father, an abusive, critical adoptive father, and an enmeshed mother. Therefore, the patient’s autonomy (or lack thereof) was a recurring theme. Moreover, the patient’s “story telling” was processed with varying degrees of depth throughout the course of treatment. This brought up feelings of shame, embarrassment, self-loathing, and depression, which were processed and resolved. Also the patient’s level of intellectual functioning slowed the progress of treatment as his ability to articulate his thoughts and emotions as well as his ability to be abstract and symbolize was limited and needed to be practiced and refined over time. Finally, in response to these aspects of Mr. V’s treatment and in the tradition of psychodynamic psychotherapy, timing of termination was generally initiated by the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534650112471154">Murdin, 2000</xref>) and an end date was mutually agreed upon through the collaboration of patient and therapist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534650112471154">Graybar et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Assessment of Progress</title>
<p>Simulation Modeling Analysis (SMA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534650112471154">Borckardt, 2006</xref>) for time-series data was used to analyze each daily and weekly measure to assess for phase-effect. This approach compares phases of treatment while accounting for the autocorrelation of the data stream. That is, the program accounts for the autocorrelation, which is the lack of independence of the sequential (daily or weekly) observations of each data stream. Then, an effect size and a significance level are computed and the mean scores of the two data streams are compared. When investigating phase-effect, significant effect sizes indicate statistically significant change in the measured symptom. The valence of the effect size indicates which phase is significantly higher or lower.</p>
<p>To use the SMA program, which only allows for 200 data points, and still be able to analyze the full length of treatment, the original data stream was truncated. Days were collapsed into 5-day means of consecutive daily measures. Subsequently, there were 8 points (40 days) in the pretreatment baseline phase and 167 points (835 days) in the total treatment phase. For the weekly measure of the DES, there were 5 points in the pretreatment baseline phase and 119 points in the total treatment phase. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1534650112471154">Table 1</xref> for number of data points in each phase of treatment analyzed.</p>

<p>To assess and ensure that the integrity of the model was not compromised by truncating the data, the autocorrelations of the truncated data were compared with the autocorrelations of the original data stream using a Paired Samples <italic>t</italic>-test. The two sets of autocorrelations were not significantly different, <italic>t</italic>(1) = 3.88, <italic>p</italic> = .161.

<title>8 Complicating Factors</title>
<p>A complicating factor in Mr. V’s treatment was his low level of daily functioning and borderline intellectual functioning that were present prior to treatment and prior to the rape. First, during the supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy treatment phase when reintegrating into his community and regaining his former level of functioning was the primary focus of treatment, basic life skills were needed. For instance, Mr. V could not balance a checkbook and had been avoiding paying his credit card bills due to feeling overwhelmed. With the help of his parents, Mr. V was able to master these and other independent living skills, which provided the foundation necessary to delve into the sensitive material related to the trauma. Second, Mr. V’s level of dependence on his mother and adoptive father did not foster a sense of autonomy, or competence in his ability to take care of himself or trust his own judgment. This manifested itself in treatment as Mr. V insisted that all decisions regarding his treatment or capability to function in the world be made with his parents present. As treatment continued, this dynamic was explored with Mr. V and his reliance on it decreased drastically. Finally, Mr. V’s borderline intellectual functioning further complicated treatment by making articulation of the traumatic event challenging. This also affected his capacity for symbolization and creation of meaning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1534650112471154">
<title>9 Access and Barriers to Care</title>
<p>There were no managed care considerations or access/barriers to care in this particular case. Mr. V was charged on a sliding fee schedule and therapy could continue as long as was deemed necessary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1534650112471154">
<title>10 Follow-Up</title>
<p>Mr. V was not asked to complete follow-up measures. However, in the six months following termination, Mr. V contacted the therapist twice by phone to share positive events in his life and inform her that he was continuing to function effectively in his community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1534650112471154">
<title>11 Treatment Implications of the Case</title>
<p>All of Mr. V’s daily or weekly tracked symptoms, including overall distress, preoccupation with the trauma, and dissociation, improved significantly from pretreatment baseline phase to total treatment phase (i.e., supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy followed by insight-oriented psychodynamic psychotherapy). Moreover, overall distress and preoccupation with the trauma improved significantly from the supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy treatment phase to the insight-oriented psychodynamic psychotherapy treatment phase. This demonstrates the effectiveness of insight-oriented psychodynamic psychotherapy above and beyond the improvement that generally occurs simply by the individual entering treatment.</p>
<p>The improvement that occurs during insight-oriented psychodynamic psychotherapy is the gaining of mastery over the trauma and regaining of mastery over one’s life. Reintegration occurs when the creation of meaning surfaces and the trauma victim can incorporate the trauma into his or her self-concept. This is not only the alleviation of symptoms but is also thought to be a transformation of one’s perception of self, the other, and the world. The insights that Mr. V gained throughout treatment helped illuminate his long-standing issues with men and allowed him to interact interpersonally with men, even with his adoptive father and other male authority figures (e.g., his boss), in a more assertive and confident manner. In addition, these insights allowed Mr. V to forgive himself for not trusting his judgment prior to the rape and continuing to remain at the perpetrator’s home despite his feelings of uneasiness and impending doom.</p>
<p>Mr. V’s dissociation score improved significantly between the time before therapy and his average dissociation score during therapy. However, dissociation did not change significantly between the supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy treatment phase and the insight-oriented psychodynamic psychotherapy treatment phase. This is likely due to a floor effect as dissociation had almost completely disappeared by the end of the supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy treatment phase. The significant decrease of dissociation demonstrates the necessity of treating individuals with supportive psychodynamic psychotherapy prior to insight-oriented psychodynamic psychotherapy in order to stabilize the individual, strengthen adaptive coping skills, and bolster self-efficacy before dismantling the individual’s resistance and defenses.</p>

<title>12 Recommendations to Clinicians and Students</title>
<p>This study focused in a unique way on various aspects of treatment outcome that have been neglected in the empirical literature. First of all, it focused on an adult male rape victim. Second, it focused on the psychodynamic treatment of rape victims with PTSD, which was also lacking in the current treatment outcome literature. In addition, it focused on the decrease of dissociation as a primary goal of treatment for individuals with PTSD, which is unavailable in the PTSD treatment outcome literature, including in the cognitive-behavioral treatment tradition. Finally, a time-series single-subject (<italic>N</italic> = 1) design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534650112471154">Borckardt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534650112471154">Nash et al., 2011</xref>) tracked patient-rated symptoms across baseline and intervention phases. It is important to note that even though a time-series design can only measure one individual’s therapeutic outcome at a time and has no control group, a time-series design has one advantage over the large-<italic>N</italic> designs, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs). That is, due to the time-series daily tracking of symptoms, a detailed and rich picture of the patient’s change (or lack thereof) over time is captured in a way that can be transmitted easily to other clinicians and researchers.</p>
