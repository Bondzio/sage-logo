<p>Jussi Parikka’s <italic>What is Media Archeology?</italic> offers a welcome introduction to a burgeoning area of media theory and history that has not yet been given such comprehensive treatment. Parikka casts his net across a diverse collection of scholars and practitioners—from Siegfried Zielinksi and Wolfgang Ernst, back to Walter Benjamin and Sigfried Giedion, forward to media artists like Paul DeMarinis and Zoe Beloff—a through-line of this tradition being the claim that our tools structure the very possibilities of thinking, being, and remembering. Often drawing on or paralleling the work of Friedrich Kittler and/or Michel Foucault, media archeology as sketched out by Parikka seeks to explore the ways in which our conceptions of knowledge, time, communication, and subjectivity are necessarily conditioned by always material and affect-producing technological media. The general focus is on 19th-century devices through to contemporary digital culture—and Parikka frames his book as an introduction to a set of methodologies with which we can excavate our digitalized present—yet ‘new’ and ‘media’ are very broadly conceived here: phenakistoscopes, the spiritualist ether, holodecks and (imaginary) time machines, video gaming, encoding formats, and software platforms are all worthy of attention according to the media-archeological point of view.</p>
<p>After a general introduction to the theoretical orientation and some recurring themes, the book begins by considering the technological entertainments of high modernity (both cinematic and pre-cinematic) as a fruitful means of thinking media outside of more traditional, text-based methodologies; New Film History’s idea of media as sense-affecters is also connected by Parikka to more recent researches on digital culture. Chapter 2 runs through contributions of artists and scholars (e.g., Jeffry Sconce, Siegfried Zielinksi) who have urged us to confront Foucauldian ruptures and forgotten potentialities across media history. If media are contingent products, then ‘virtual’ or ‘impossible’ media—gadgets in science fiction narratives, diagrammed but yet-to-be-built inventions—are just as real as mp3 players or televisions: ‘Media archeologists interested in the imaginary are as interested in the actual as they are in the impossible’ (p. 47). Chapter 3 then offers an accessible introduction to ‘German’ media theory, with a focus on the hardware-oriented work of Kittler and Wolfgang Ernst. Chapter 4 turns to a particular phenomenon, noise, Parikka’s explication of which showcases the interdisciplinary rigor of the approach; Chapters 4 and 5, respectively, explore how media-archeological insights can be brought to bear on new systems of archivization, and how various transmission and media artists have managed to explore germane themes. Each chapter closes with a helpful summary and ‘Further reading and links,’ which could make the work an ideal companion text for a course or reading group.</p>
<p>Media archeology generally involves both the close analysis of technological processes and a self-reflexive criticality; it takes equally seriously poststructuralist philosophy and the intricacies of, for instance, network protocols. The approach is refreshing because, as Parikka suggests, it encourages us to think past commonsensical truisms put forth by media industries, from a highly theoretical yet thoroughly materialist-historical standpoint. Media archeology’s sympathetic a-humanism, which grants things and processes both agency and their particular temporalities, reconfigures the field of media studies entirely—dust and e-waste, for instance, are broached as forgotten yet crucial actors in our global media ecology, in the book’s concluding chapter.</p>
<p>Media archeology has often been involved in an effort to reclaim thinkers often treated with suspicion, if not contempt, in some corners of contemporary communications and cultural studies (Marshall McLuhan and, via Kittler, both Jacques Lacan and Claude Shannon), and this may be enough to scare away certain readers. Yet Parikka does not just genuflect towards his heavyweights—also put forth in the book are new directions and challenges. In the chapter on imaginary media, for instance, he insists on the need for a more materialist account of such discursive phenomena. Parikka’s measured identification of some of the political blind-spots of media archeology is particularly promising: ‘What is often missing from recent political and philosophical analyses in [work on ‘cognitive capitalism’] is the medium-specificity and accuracy German media theory does well; although, at the same time, one can say that it is not often that one finds strong articulation of politics in the context of the techno-epistemological research of such media theory’ (p. 73). Although much of the work inventoried can seem to fetishize technological capabilities and anti-humanist positions, which he acknowledges, Parikka’s sober provocations open the field to new conversations.</p>
<p>Yet, the sheer breadth of the study—but this perhaps also applies to media archeology more generally—is both a strength and a limitation. Demonstrating a command of cultural studies, film studies, the histories of science and technology, critical theory, and the specifications of computational hardware, <italic>What is Media Archeology?</italic> enters into an adventurous interdisciplinarity—military history, Gilles Deleuze, and the intricacies of the phase alternation line (PAL) are all fair game. The range, and the pace of exposition, can be intellectually invigorating; but this is an eclecticism that some readers will find problematic, as Parikka’s text occasionally seems to race too quickly over its subjects, never seeming to settle for very long on any one point or thinker.</p>
<p>Still, Parikka’s work admirably pulls off what it can only seem to promise, not giving us a single solution as to what media archeology is, or even what media are, but rather a pragmatic collection of approaches to rethinking ‘new,’ ‘old,’ and even ‘media.’ Appropriately multifarious, <italic>What is Media Archeology?</italic> offers a lively introduction to its subject that illuminates exciting avenues for both scholarship and aesthetic practice, and the book should be of interest to Parikka’s fellow travelers as well as anyone wanting a critical overview of this challenging approach to modern media culture.</p>
