<p>Two articles in this issue of <italic>Violence Against Women</italic> address the long-term consequences of intimate partner violence. The relationship between women’s financial status and intimate partner violence is complex. Studies have documented how economic disadvantage is a risk factor for intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization among women; additional studies have shown how IPV victimization contributes to women’s economic disadvantage and may propel some women into poverty. The research discussed in the opening article by Adrienne Adams, Richard Tolman, Deborah Bybee, Cris Sullivan, and Angie Kennedy contributes to our understanding of this complex relationship by analyzing how job instability mediates the effects of IPV on women’s economic well-being. Adams and her colleagues show that IPV negatively affects women’s job stability, which in turn has a damaging impact on women’s economic health. Perhaps more important is their finding that these harmful consequences continue long after the IPV ends—at least three years longer, in fact. Services for survivors of abuse now often include financial literacy programs, but Adams et al.’s research also highlights the need for jobs programs for IPV survivors that directly address the employment problems posed by a history of job instability.</p>
<p>The second article in this issue, by Kimberly Fleming, Tamara Newton, Rafael Fernandez-Botran, James Miller, and Vicki Ellison Burns, also examines long-term consequences of abuse—specifically, intimate partner stalking. Fleming and her colleagues make the important point that there are different types of stalking. Federal law requires that the behavior in question induces fear in the victim in order for it to be considered stalking, but Fleming et al. note that fear may be induced by stalkers’ threats. They examined, therefore, the consequences for women in their study—all of whom were “postabuse”—of a history of different types of stalking victimization. Their findings demonstrate the lasting impact of stalking victimization accompanied by fear <italic>and</italic> threat: Women who experienced stalking accompanied by both fear and threat had greater posttraumatic stress symptoms, even after accounting for other types of IPV, and they were especially likely to experience hyperarousal. Fleming et al.’s study alerts us to the need to assess abuse survivors for severe stalking victimization and to offer long-term services for these women, since the mental health consequences of severe stalking may persist long after the abuse has ended.</p>
<p>The third article in this issue presents a public health approach to IPV prevention. Jennifer Wagman and her colleagues discuss the Safe Homes and Respect for Everyone (SHARE) project that they implemented in Uganda. Wagman et al. carefully lay out for us the various steps involved in the project and the theoretical framework that informs it. They emphasize the importance of community collaboration, including enlisting the support of not only community leaders, but also men and boys in violence prevention efforts. But for me one of the most important takeaways from this article is the need for <italic>patience</italic>. The authors make clear that for violence prevention programs like SHARE to be successful in terms of achieving widespread community buy-in, program staff must be willing to put in the painstaking, time-consuming effort of building relationships with <italic>all</italic> stakeholders. Wagman et al.’s experiences with SHARE will prove valuable to advocates and researchers involved in implementing violence prevention programming in other communities.</p>
<p>And finally, Shana Maier, in the article that concludes this issue, discusses her research with rape victim advocates. Maier interviewed a sample of advocates from different types of sexual assault service organizations and in this article she discusses advocates’ responses in terms of whether they contain victim-questioning (as opposed to victim-blaming) attitudes, negative judgments of rape victims, or frustrations with victims’ behaviors or decisions. Maier reports that although more than three quarters of the advocates she interviewed expressed no victim-questioning attitudes, nearly one quarter revealed their frustration with some victims’ behaviors or choices or called victims’ judgments into question. Importantly, Maier points out that all the advocates who did this were also quick to add that none of the victims <italic>deserved</italic> to be sexually assaulted. Moreover, they emphasized that they would never share their concerns with the victims themselves. But as Maier notes, there is no way to determine from her study whether advocates unwittingly convey their questioning attitudes or frustrations to victims. Maier’s research indicates that while considerable progress has been made in sexual assault advocacy since the late 1970s, more still needs to be done, especially given that the advocates in her study continued the tradition of focusing their rape-prevention advice on changing women’s, not men’s, behavior.</p>
