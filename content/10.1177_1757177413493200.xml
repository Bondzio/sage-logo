<p>The journal watch feature is provided as a service to our readers. The intention is to highlight new research and other developments in infection prevention and control and related fields, published elsewhere. A brief description of each article and its main findings is given here; readers are encouraged to refer to the full published article for the details of the work. The editorial management group would welcome feedback and recommendations for articles to feature in this column; for comments and recommendations please contact the editor: <email>editor@ips.uk.net</email></p>
<p>For the July 2013 issue, the articles in this Journal Watch are an eclectic collection drawn primarily from the publications of some of our colleagues in The Association for Practitioners in Infection Prevention and Epidemiology (APIC) and the Healthcare Infection Society (HIS). In addition I have added a very helpful basic lesson in understanding the use of statistics in healthcare from the journal <italic>Vaccine</italic>. The other articles discussed include two that remind us that innovation is still both possible and necessary in hand hygiene and a useful primer on the impact of cleaning and disinfection of the inanimate environment.</p>
<p>To begin with we have a very interesting article that, for me, is a useful introduction to risk perception:</p>
<p><bold>Burnett E, Kearney N, Johnston B, Corlett J and MacGillivray S. (2013) Understanding factors that impact on health care professionals’ risk perceptions and responses towards <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> and meticillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>: A structured literature review. <italic>American Journal of Infection Control</italic> 41: 394–400</bold></p>
<p>This article is interesting and useful for two reasons; the content itself, and for me, the introduction to the theory and understanding of risk perception. In brief the authors conducted a structured review of the literature, initially to identify healthcare workers’ risk perception with regard to <italic>C. difficile</italic>, but found it necessary to widen the scope to meticillin resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA), owing to the paucity of literature. The methodology itself is an object lesson in how to conduct and report a review of the literature where said literature is disparate in terms of methodologies. The authors shy away from the term ‘systematic’; however this may be a touch of academic modesty on their parts. Even with no restriction on methodological quality, the review identified only 11 publications, a clear indication of the need for further research in this area. Of those 11, four were specific to <italic>C. difficile</italic> and seven to MRSA. There were both differences and similarities in the findings between the articles focussing on each organism and I would strongly recommend reading the full article for the rich detail of the complex perceptions and responses to risk. I will highlight just one specific finding, that for both <italic>C. difficile</italic> and MRSA, healthcare workers ‘questioned the effectiveness of preventative measures […] and believed that prevention and control is often not achievable’. This is a deeply worrying finding and this study reinforces further the need for much more research into the psychological basis of healthcare worker behaviour.</p>
<p>The next two articles both concern hand hygiene, I realise a cry of ‘not again’ may go up, but both of these give us food for thought…</p>
<p><bold>Fitzgerald G, Moore G and Wilson APR. (2013) Hand hygiene after touching a patient’s surroundings: the opportunities most commonly missed. <italic>Journal of Hospital Infection</italic> 84: 27–31</bold></p>
<p>On first reading, this study could be seen as just (yet) another report of hand hygiene compliance rates, but that would be a mistake. Fitzgerald and colleagues have joined the small but growing group of researchers introducing, albeit tacitly, the science of human factors or ergonomics to infection prevention and control. ‘Human factors’ looks at the interaction between the human actors and the environment, processes and multi-layered complex systems in which they operate. In this particular report the authors performed fifty eight, 90 minute observations of hand hygiene in a variety of clinical settings. So far, so typical, but in this case, using a technique from human factors called ‘Link Analysis’ the authors looked at the staff movement in terms of their interaction with their environment and that of their patients. The key message coming from this study is that, no matter what the clinical setting, including critical care and isolation rooms, there are many hand hygiene opportunities classified as ‘after touching the patient’s environment’ (WHO My 5 moments; moment 5) and very many of these are missed. The details of the movements of the staff and the hand hygiene compliance compared with the number and nature of the opportunities are given in detail, but it is striking that ‘after touching the patient’s environment’ constituted 40%–50% of all opportunities and was associated with some quite dramatically low compliance results. The authors of this study should be commended for considering some alternative solutions to the problem of hand hygiene compliance, rather than giving the ‘traditional’ call for education and punitive disciplinary measures.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that, in this study, overall hand hygiene ‘compliance’ varied between 34% and 60%. In the May issue of <italic>Journal of Infection Prevention</italic> I commented that there is a miss-match between the low hand hygiene compliance results reported in the literature and (anecdotally) the very high compliance figures reported by UK healthcare facilities. In the next article, Professor Elaine Larson discusses this issue.</p>
<p><bold>Larson E. (2013) Monitoring hand hygiene: Meaningless, harmful or helpful? <italic>American Journal of Infection Control</italic> 41: S42–5</bold></p>
<p>In this review and commentary, Elaine Larson explores the dichotomy that exists in the UK as well as in the USA between hand hygiene monitoring for improvement and for judgement or performance management. As mentioned above I have alluded to these issues previously and this article describes the problem rather eloquently. Larson divides strategies to improve hand hygiene and importantly outcomes, i.e. prevent infections, into two types that she terms evidence-based and indicator-based. She makes the point quite starkly that where hand hygiene is measured for the purposes of performance measurement (in her terms indicator-based), the results are always high and she argues, often false. The argument is that such approaches lead healthcare providers to ‘overestimate adherence, seek quick fixes [and] undermine incentives to make real sustainable change’. My response is ‘hear hear’. So what is the alternative? To that end Larson describes the characteristics of what she terms evidence-based strategies to engage staff and achieve real improvement. As an aside, one of the approaches quoted, ‘positive deviance’ has also featured previously in <italic>Journal Watch</italic>. The strategies that the author advocates, have what she describes as several characteristics in common, these merit repeating in full (fans of top down management approaches may wish to look away now); ‘they took a long time, sometimes years; they fully engaged unit level staff as well as administration and clinical leadership; they were respectful and non-punitive, they helped to transfer the “ownership” and responsibility for hand hygiene performance from infection prevention staff to clinicians…’ The key point for Larson is the nature of the feedback given to staff and she suggests it needs to be timely, non-punitive, individualised and customisable. There is also a short commentary on the use of automated monitoring systems such as sensor systems. Overall this article is a refreshing look at an issue that confronts infection prevention practitioners every day.</p>
<p>Within the same supplement as the Larson article is a very useful ‘state of the art’ review of the contribution of cleaning and disinfection to reducing healthcare associated infections:</p>
<p><bold>Donskey CJ. (2013) Does improving surface cleaning and disinfection reduce health care-associated infections? <italic>American Journal of Infection Control</italic> 41: S12–9</bold></p>
<p>Despite the fact, which the author admits upfront, that this is not a true systematic review, it is a very useful resource for an infection prevention practitioner wanting to familiarise themselves with the state of the evidence in this area. Donskey reviews the literature around four types of intervention; disinfectant product substitutions (e.g. chlorine-based disinfection compared with routine cleaning), interventions to improve effectiveness of cleaning and disinfection practices, automated disinfection devices (e.g. hydrogen peroxide vapour systems) and disinfection or elimination of contaminated equipment. This is an article with a lot of detail, but in summary the author suggests that on balance, the recent evidence from the last decade suggests that improvements in cleaning and disinfection of the inanimate environment and potential fomites may contribute to the transmission of pathogens and reduce healthcare-associated infections; in particular where the environment is considered to be a significant factor in the transmission of the organism, such as <italic>C. difficile</italic>, Glycopeptide-resistant enterococci and Norovirus. The review acknowledges that the quality of the evidence remains ‘suboptimal’ and the author proposes a number of questions for further research, including, as examples, the optimal frequency of environmental disinfection and should the strategies aim to eliminate the pathogens from the inanimate environment altogether?</p>
<p>Before moving to the last of the publications featured in this <italic>Journal Watch</italic> I would encourage readers who look up the article by Donskey above to also peruse the review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177413493200">Otter et al. (2013)</xref>, which takes the question one stage back, to that of the impact of surface contamination on the transmission of pathogens.</p>
<p>The last article in this issue is unusual, it is not actually specific to infection prevention and control or any specific clinical situation or scenario, but is a primer in how to understand the information in the scientific literature when it includes statistics.</p>
<p><bold>West CP and Dupras DM. (2013) 5 ways statistics can fool you – tips for practising clinicians. <italic>Vaccine</italic> 31: 1550–2</bold></p>
<p>If you do not like or do not understand statistics <italic>do not</italic> look away now! The authors of this short commentary suggest that practising clinicians (at whom this article is aimed) are not especially statistically literate. If this applies to you, read on. The article has five very useful tips for understanding what the statistics in an article are and are not telling you. Regular readers of this column, if such people exist, will recognise at least some of the following from my occasional comments on previous articles. The five tips given are all very useful, although number 5 is not phrased in the most helpful way. The tips are as follows.</p>
<list id="list1-1757177413493200" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Statistical significance does not equate to clinical significance</italic> (translation: the result needs to show a meaningful difference to the patient outcome not just a great <italic>p</italic> value, as I have said before, if a study is large enough, every difference becomes statistically significant).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Absolute risk rather than relative risk informs clinical significance</italic> (translation: in very simple terms the relative difference between 2% and 1% is 50% (huge!), but the absolute difference is 1% (not nearly as exciting)).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Confidence intervals offer more information than</italic> p <italic>values</italic> (translation: <italic>p</italic> values tell you nothing about the real values of the results, but confidence intervals show a range of statistically possible values for the outcome, in clinically relevant units).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Beware multiple testing and the isolated significant</italic> p <italic>value</italic> (translation: a <italic>p</italic> value of 0.05 as a cut off means a 1 in 20 chance of the result being due to chance, so if you do 20 tests on the data there is a risk one will come out as ‘significant’ purely by chance!).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence</italic> (this one needs a health warning, the author quite rightly points out that a result that is not ‘statistically significant’ may be because the study (sample) is too small, but equally if the study has been properly designed, do not be fooled by comments like ‘trend towards’ and ‘approaching statistical significance’).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To get the full benefit of this article you need to read it and I can only paraphrase. Many of these issues should be picked up during the peer review process, but experience tells us this is not always the case, so a little reader understanding can go a long way.</p>
<p>From risk perception to hydrogen peroxide, from positive deviance to <italic>p</italic> values, the literature in infection prevention and related fields is diverse and fascinating. This column intends to highlight this diversity and complement the articles that our readers are exposed to in <italic>Journal of Infection Prevention</italic>.</p>
