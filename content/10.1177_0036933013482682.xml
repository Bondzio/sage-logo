<sec id="sec2-0036933013482682"><title>Abstract</title>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> There is evidence that the intravenous giving sets may be a source of contamination during surgery via the contaminated hands of anaesthetists. This study, using saline effluent as a marker of contamination, quantifies the degree of microbial contamination of intravenous giving sets at the end of anaesthesia and surgery and the degree of contamination of intravenous saline injections drawn up by anaesthetists.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> For the first arm of the study, 50 intravenous giving sets were obtained at the end of surgical procedures. Sterile saline (5 mL) was injected into the port of the three-way tap that had been accessed during the procedure. For the second arm of the study, 40 anaesthetists performed five injections of 1 mL sterile saline into each port of a three-way tap. The degree of microbial contamination for each arm was quantified.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Bacterial organisms were recovered from the effluent in 4 of the 50 samples obtained from surgical giving sets. Bacterial organisms were recovered from the effluent in 8 of the 80 anaesthetist injection samples.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Our results show that the anaesthesia provider is a source of contamination in the intraoperative environment and there is a need for an improvement in strategies of aseptic practice.</p>

<p>The long saphenous vein (LSV) is the predominant conduit utilised in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and can be retrieved via endoscopic vein harvesting (EVH). Whilst EVH is associated with significantly greater recovery, wound healing and cosmetic appearance than the traditional open vein harvesting technique, the long-term outcome has been questioned. Retrieval of the LSV has been associated with elevated risk of bleeding in the tunnel during harvesting. This complication is even more distinct when a branch of the Y-type, anatomical variant of the LSV is dissected and cauterised, due to the size of the vessel being cut. However, we demonstrate a case in which the Y-type variant of the LSV was instead harvested and successfully utilised as a conduit. We present the benefits associated with our approach. The postoperative results of this case were compared to the outcome of 5 other patients, in whom the same anatomical variant of the LSV was dissected and cut by diathermy. Our findings indicate that harvesting, rather than cauterising the Y-type vessel, resulted in fewer complications, including intraoperative bleeding. This reduced the operating time and did not necessitate the conversion to either open or bridging techniques in order to extract the vessel.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0036933013482682"><title>Abstract</title>
<p>The optimum time frame for cranioplasty following decompressive craniectomy has not been established. Early insertion (&lt;3 months) has been associated with higher infection rates, yet is thought to enhance rehabilitation. This study aimed to establish whether early cranioplasty is both safe, and associated with superior functional outcome compared to late cranioplasty. The case notes of 69 patients receiving cranioplasty between 2006 and 2011 were analysed, comparing infection risk with time to cranioplasty. In 51 patients, Glasgow Outcome Scores (GOS), a measure of functional outcome, were derived from clinical notes at 3, 6 and 12 months following craniectomy and compared against time to cranioplasty. Cranioplasty insertion time was not associated with graft infection rates or functional outcome. Because too few patients had cranioplasty within 3 months (<italic>early</italic> cranioplasty) it was not possible to establish whether infection rate or functional outcome differed with that of <italic>late</italic> cranioplasty. However, results suggest cranioplasty before 6 months is safe (in contrast to recent advice to delayed until after this point). Furthermore, once the cranioplasty has been delayed by 3 months, earli<italic>e</italic>r insertion has no effect on functional outcome; the beneficial effects of the 3-month ‘early window’ may be lost by delaying beyond this point.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0036933013482682"><title>Abstract</title>
<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Quarter of million people present to burn centre across UK yearly. Burns that affect more than 50% of body surface has insufficient autograft split skin graft to be harvested. Hence, bioengineered skin substitutes such as, Integra, Biobrane, Matriderm, TransCyte, Dermagraft, Epicel and CEA used as adjunct to autograft.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Review of 26 randomised controlled trials comparing efficacy of skin substitutes on quality of functional, aesthetic recovery, scar evaluation, healing time, dressing changes and re-epithelialisation, etc.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Biobrane require fewer dressing changes as compare to Transcyte. Integra significant improves functional and aesthetic, lower tendency forming hypertrophic scar in clinical trials and good vascular ingrowth in animal study. Take rate of Matriderm/Graft combinations was not different from autologous graft alone. The only difference was Matriderm demonstrated a significant improvement of pliability (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.04) compared to conventionally grafted wounds. A review of 301 cases of burns treated with CEA has shown that the success rate improves from 53% to 83% if the CEA is applied to a well-vascularised dermal bed. Dermagraft produced results as good as allograft, with regard to wound infection, wound exudates, wound healing time, wound closure and graft take.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> There are limitations and factors affecting outcomes included diversity of skin substitutes and ways of surgical management methods for both minor and extensive burns. Besides, the lack of standard comparator, differences in techniques used to measure wound healing and closure throughout the studies.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0036933013482682"><title>Abstract</title>
<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Urethral web is a known anomaly in boys, but there are no documented case reports as such in girls. We report a 3-year-old girl whose symptoms dramatically improved after excision of a urethral web.</p>
<p><bold>Patient:</bold> A 3-year-old girl born at 32 weeks’ gestation presented with recurrent urinary tract infections and a urinary stream which directed upwards towards the toilet rim. She was listed for examination under anaesthesia (EUA), cystourethroscopy and positional infusion of contrast (PIC) cystogram. During EUA, a posterior meatal web was found at the external urethral orifice. On suprapubic pressure, the stream was directed ventrally.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> The web was divided in the midline with cutting bipolar diathermy and the mucosa approximated with interrupted 7/0 vicryl rapide. Suprapubic pressure demonstrated a straight downward stream post procedure. The PIC cystogram revealed no vesicoureteric reflux. She made an uneventful recovery, and the family were delighted.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We describe a girl with recurrent urinary infection and marked anterior deflection of urinary stream caused by a posteriorly placed, external urethral meatal web. Anomalies of the external urethral meatus in girls with non-neurogenic bladder dysfunction have been reported. However, true metal webs have not been reported in girls.</p>

<p>Department of Surgery, University of Glasgow, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, UK</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-0036933013482682"><title>Abstract</title>
<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Colonoscopy is the gold standard for colorectal cancer detection and helps determine tumour location for surgical planning. This study aimed to establish colonoscopic localisation accuracy, which until now has remained unclear.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> This prospective, multi-centre, statistically powered, observational study involved patients undergoing prearranged colonoscopy, diagnosed with colorectal tumours. Those who subsequently received colorectal resection were included, allowing intraoperative and colonoscopic localisation comparison. Covariate analysis was performed using two-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests, 95% CIs and Fishers exact test.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> 64 of 79 (81.0%) patients had accurate colonoscopic localisation. Patients with inaccurate localisations were significantly younger (<italic>p</italic>=0.047). 5 of 15 patients with inaccurate localisations required on-table alterations in planned surgical management. Pre-operative CT was unable to identify the primary tumour in 23.4% of cases. 88.1% of the remaining CT localisations were accurate. 35.4% of patients had a colonic tattoo placed.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Bowel cancer screening and laparoscopic resection have heightened the importance of preoperative lesion localisation. A colonoscopic localisation inaccuracy of 19.0% was found which led to altered surgical management in 33.3% of cases. With CT unable to visualise lesions 23.4% of the time, localisation is heavily reliant on colonoscopy. Tattooing allows accurate intra-operative localisation but was used in only 35.4% of cases.</p>

<sec id="sec14-0036933013482682"><title>Abstract</title>
<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Hepatic steatosis has a major influence on the outcomes of liver resection and transplantation. We summarise current knowledge on the assessment and management of steatosis and its consequences for patients undergoing liver surgery.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A non-systematic literature search on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and strategies for reduction of the effects of steatosis in liver surgery was undertaken. MEDLINE (1946–2012) and EMBASE (1974–2012) were searched using phrase searches, truncated terms and medical subject headings (search date 9 March 2012).</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Steatosis affects nearly 20% of western populations. Non-invasive methods of diagnosis and staging are yet to replace the ‘gold standard’ of liver biopsy which has its own limitations. Pharmacological agents have been used to reduce and reverse steatosis and to alleviate its effects in liver surgery. Additionally, normothermic perfusion has been shown to be of utility in reversing steatosis in <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> animal studies. These interventions are yet to make an impact in clinical practice.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> More than two decades since its significance on the outcomes of liver surgery was recognised, understanding the pathogenesis, diagnosis, staging and management of steatosis remains challenging. Novel pharmacological and interventional techniques offer promise in reversing steatosis and reducing its effects.</p>

<sec id="sec16-0036933013482682"><title>Abstract</title>
<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> Abdominal visceral artery aneurysms (VAAs) are a rare, potentially lethal form of vascular pathology. This retrospective review analyses cases of VAAs in the Cardiff and Vale UHB from 2002 to 2012, focusing on their management compared to current American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association recommendations for intervention of VAAs ≥2 cm in diameter.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> The Cardiff and Vale radiology database was searched for patients with VAAs and data such as relevant past medical history, location and size of VAA was obtained.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Eight patients were found to have VAAs in the study period. Two patients had VAAs ≥2 cm and were treated in accordance with current guidelines. Three patients were found to have multiple VAAs, all with underlying connective tissue disorders. These all required surgical intervention due to VAA rupture, and all VAAs that ruptured were &lt;2 cm. This study found no correlation between VAA size or location and rupture.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Findings from this study suggest current guidelines may need reviewing to consider treatment of VAAs &lt;2 cm in patients with underlying connective tissue disorders, with clarification on need for radiological follow-up and further studies into the natural progression of VAAs.</p>

<sec id="sec18-0036933013482682"><title>Abstract</title>
<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> The aim was to assess compliance with the steroid reduction regime in renal transplant patients.

<p><bold>Method:</bold> Retrospective case note audit of 45 consecutive patients transplanted between April and October 2011. Data was recorded on a spreadsheet.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Combination immunosuppression therapy: mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus and prednisolone was used for all patients. Appropriate steroid reduction to 5 mg was only achieved in 56% (<italic>n</italic>=25), compared to an expected performance of 100%. Performance level for treatment of acute rejection was 100% (<italic>n</italic>=6).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Overall performance levels were desirable; all patients received correct immunosuppression therapy with acute rejection episodes treated appropriately. Many patients received higher doses of prednisolone for longer than expected. Steroid reduction has not achieved a desirable performance level with factors contributing to the poor performance being easily modifiable.</p>

<p>Leicester General Hospital, University Hospitals of Leicester, UK</p></sec>
<sec id="sec21-0036933013482682"><title>Abstract</title>
<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Continuous infusion analgesia in thoracic surgery (CIATS) used for post-thoracotomy pain control. CIATS consists of a catheter in the wound topped up with 10 mL of 0.25% chirocaine and connected to continuous infusion of 0.1% chirocaine 5 mL/h. We reviewed the impact of CIATS in thoracic surgery in decortication patients.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> 15 cases that had undergone thoracotomy for decortication were retrospectively analysed. 8 had CIATS with morphine PCA (group 1), 7 patients had only morphine PCA (group 2). Patients had supplementary analgesia consisting of paracetamol, tramadol, di-hydrocodeine, and non-steroidal inflammatory drugs. Post-operative pain scores, amount of morphine used and length of hospital stay (LOS) were measured.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Mean morphine infused, mean duration of PCA, mean post-operative pain scores on day 1–2 and mean hospital stay recorded in Table 1. Supplementary analgesia utilised in group 1; 3 patients required 1 extra drug, 4 required 2, and 1 required 3. Supplementary analgesia utilised in group 2; 4 patients required 2 extra drugs, 3 required 3, while 1 required 4 different drugs. Better pain scores and reduced morphine usage in CIATS but not significant. There was statistical significance between the 2 groups in mean duration of PCA usage (<italic>p</italic>=0.05).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> CIATS is efficacious in the management of post thoracotomy pain.

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> All patients 16 years and under, at QMC, who had insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal or ventriculoatrial shunt between January 2010 and December 2011.</p>
<p><bold>Method:</bold> A retrospective review 3 months after the end of the study period using theatre records and BPNG activity audit. Failure defined as need for a further shunt. Infection defined as bacterial isolate from CSF or component of failing shunt.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> All: 67 patients, 91 shunt insertions; Failure rate at 30 days: 15/91 (16.5%); Infection rate study duration: 11/91 (12.1%); Failure rate study duration: 34/91 (37%). Further analysis of patient age and operating personnel was carried out.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> Simon et al.’s 2009 study reported shunt infection rate per procedure over 24 months of 7.2%. They excluded any patients who had had a previous shunt, previous external drain or reservoir and was limited to ‘uncomplicated initial’ shunt insertion. Our patients were unselected with &gt;50% having had a previous shunt, external drain or reservoir so we might expect higher complication rates. Simons et al. had an end of study shunt failure rate of 35% at 24 months and our 37% compares favourably with this.</p>

<sec id="sec25-0036933013482682"><title>Abstract</title>
<p>J.T., an 89-year-old Caucasian male, developed pseudophakic bullous keratopathy in his left eye 1 month following phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation. Although the development of pseudophakic bullous keratopathy after cataract surgery is usually a late postoperative complication, this patient’s corneal decompensation developed quite rapidly due to pre-existing endothelial instability, which is likely to be associated with his past history of penetrating trauma to his left eye during World War II. The high risk of the operation was anticipated, but due to marked deterioration in his dependent right eye from wet age-related macular degeneration, the patient made the decision to proceed with the cataract surgery in his left eye despite guarded prognosis. The patient’s corneal decompensation was later managed with Descemet's Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSAEK). This report reviews the fundamental anatomy and physiology of the cornea in order to provide a basis for understanding the pathophysiology of pseudophakic bullous keratopathy and the mechanism of DSAEK, which is emerging as an alternative to penetrating keratoplasty. Brief history of corneal grafting and the role of eye banks are also discussed.</p>

<p><bold>Introduction:</bold> To study whether granulocyte colony-stimulating factor together with Gelfoam (absorbable gelatin sponge) could enhance the healing of freshly perforated tympanic membranes by looking at closure rats, immunocompetent cells, and collagen types.</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> Laser perforations were made in the tympanic membrane of rats that were sacrificed on day 1, 3, 6, and 12 post-myringotomy. Tympanic membrane specimens were immunohistochemically stained (macrophages, B-cells, T-cells, type I-IV collagens), semi-quantified, and analysed statistically.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> No significant difference in closing rates was observed between experimental and control ears. The sections initially stained positive for type I and II collagen, but after day 6, the regenerating tissue stained positive for mainly type III and IV collagen. The recruitment of immunological cells could not be mapped with a statistical significance.</p>
<p><bold>Discussion:</bold> This study showed that at 6–12 days post-laser myringotomy, type III and IV collagen has replaced the collagen type II that constitutes the healthy tympanic membrane. There is a concern for excessive scarring involving adjacent structures, which is of interest when selecting matrices in otological surgery. The combination of Gelfoam and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor did not affect the closure rates in perforated tympanic membranes. No significant results regarding the inflammatory cell recruitment could be obtained.</p>

<p>A description of the Anatomy and Histology of the Posterior Capsule of the knee with respect to Complications in Total Knee Replacements</p>
<p>The Posterior Capsule of the Knee (PCK) and surrounding structures have been poorly described, specifically relating to surgery. However, Capsular release is frequently performed in total knee replacement (TKR) with little understanding of complications. Nonetheless TKR complications are infrequent; however, studies focus on the popliteal artery (PA) with little data on other structures. It is therefore necessary to investigate the risk to these tissues. The aim was to develop anatomical and histological descriptions of the PCK with respect to TKRs, and recognise at-risk areas. Methods employed included dissection of formalin-fixed specimens, histological preparation of joint-line knee sections, measurements of fresh-frozen specimens and literature review. The project provides interesting images of the PCK but answers few questions. Histology confirms the PA is the closest and most exposed structure to a weakened region of capsule leaving a small operative safe zone. Results illustrate numerous vessels, nerves and fabellar bone across the capsule, presenting further difficulties. To conclude, while TKR and Capsular release are generally safe, fear of serious iatrogenic injury has led to emphasis on PA damage, neglecting a plethora of minor complications. Future research should consider seemingly minor injuries associated with tissue releases, that, though less dramatic, may still become debilitating.</p>
