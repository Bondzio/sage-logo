<p>The key words in the title (‘interactional organization’) catch the constituent nature of academic talk. From a theoretical and analytical perspective, Limberg tackles how teachers and students as two parties of participants organize and construct office hour consultations. His monograph comprises nine chapters with transcript notations in Front Matters and sample transcripts in the Appendix.</p>
<p>In Chapter 1, the author claims the centrality of doing research on office hour talk indicates a gap between previous studies on academic discourse and his present focus, outlines research purpose, gives a preview of office hour opening, raises research questions, and indicates the organization of the book. In Chapter 2, ‘Office hours in a theoretical context’, the author formulates a theoretical framework by reviewing, defining and contextualizing office hours as a formally organized and institutionally situated event. In Chapter 3, ‘Methodological framework and research design’, conversation analysis is justified for the analytical framework of the study.</p>
<p>Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 show how language mediates participants’ physical and mental reactions in the four discourse phases of office hour consultations. Chapter 4, ‘Office Hour Openings’, is the first phase. It discusses how institutionalization is established in the preliminaries of office hour consultations, how office hour talk is usually opened, and what activities are routinely performed when participants meet. Chapter 5, ‘The agenda: Co-constructing the academic concern’, is the second phase. It investigates how students are situated in the position to present their academic concerns in the phase which is right after the office hour opening but before the inception of its main body. Chapters 6 and 7 look at the third phase, the body of office hour talk. These two chapters do not deal with how professors, instructors or tutors address students’ concerns or problems. Instead, the author, in Chapter 6, teases out from his data three types of students’ academic concerns: (1) organizational and administrative business; (2) course- and exam-related business; and (3) study abroad business. How each type of academic concern is translated into action sequences is elaborated on in this chapter. In addition, the author identifies an interaction pattern in consultations. He reports that dyadic interaction is a prototypical format, and that a similar pattern emerges when a teacher counsels a small group of students. In Chapter 7, ‘Advice-giving in office hours’, the author explores how students discursively construct requests for advice, how they respond to the suggestions given by their teacher, and what their response behavior tells us about whether they are likely to follow their teacher’s suggestions. Chapter 8, ‘Closing the consultation’, is the final phase. He looks into participants’ closing verbal sequences and their corresponding physical actions at the finishing stage of service-oriented encounters. He reveals how a cordial socio-academic relationship between participants is maintained.</p>
<p>Chapter 9 concludes the whole empirical study. The author summarizes his main research findings, discusses the practical implications of his study, and points out the prospects for further research. As one of its main findings, the characteristics of institutional talk in office hours are identified as ‘a multifaceted, socially-organized, and interactionally accomplished practice at the university’ (p. 366).</p>
<p>How to organize a constructive face-to-face talk in a non-teaching environment has received intense attention at colleges and universities. This volume addresses this less explored area in academic discourse. It can guide both advice-givers and advice-seekers in planning and organizing their office hour meeting in a stepwise manner. It will be of practical value to both teachers and students who want to make good use of this session for academic purposes. At the same time, its theoretical contribution will be of use to scholars and faculty members who hope to socialize their students into the conventions of the academic community. Its theoretical and practical use can be further applied to research related to talk-in-interaction more generally.</p>
