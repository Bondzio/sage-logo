It hypothesizes that the difficulties and the delays in implementing restorative justice and VOM in Southern Italy may be related to the pre-existing mediatory role played historically by Mafia leaders, which runs <italic>parallel</italic> to the ‘official’ VOM system. This paper also proposes some working hypotheses concerning the improvement of VOM in areas where criminality is strongly linked to Mafia-type organizations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This paper provides some reflections on the feasibility and implementation of victim–offender mediation (VOM) in countries or geographical areas characterized by particularly serious types of criminality, such as Mafia-like organized crime. In this perspective, the Italian case may be considered paradigmatic, as Italy appears to be suspended between modernity and tradition. Indeed, the Italian parliament has passed modern and effective legislation introducing a restorative justice approach in criminal matters, adopting a variety of restorative instruments, including, in particular, recourse to VOM and conferencing, also applied to regional contexts characterized by criminality with deep historical roots. We are mainly referring here to organized crime in the form of Mafia-type organizations, which today is moving from archaic to modern patterns of behaviour that are often violent, pervasive, opaque in their methods and consequently difficult to detect and oppose.</p>
<p>Can restorative justice and VOM find their proper place and an effective role in the criminal contexts that principally but not exclusively characterize Southern Italy? Can Italy be considered as a case study?</p>
<p>This paper starts from the assumption that Italy can be considered an interesting field of analysis for at least three different reasons:</p>
<list id="list1-1477370812467600" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>Mafia-like organizations have existed for a long time and have been thoroughly investigated from different points of view (historical, anthropological, criminological, economic and juridical).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Italy has implemented specific and complex anti-Mafia legislation, which, in response to criminal activities, includes strategies based on collaboration by so-called ‘<italic>pentiti</italic>’ (‘turncoats’ – individuals willing to disclose information regarding events in which they have taken part or heard about in their roles as ‘Mafiosi’).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Particularly in Southern Italy, a substantial proportion of petty offences and relational crimes are linked to organized crime, thus rendering both the conflict and its resolution subject to conditioning by the dominant Mafia subculture.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To better investigate the complexities of adopting restorative justice in geographical areas characterized by a ‘crisis of legality’ owing to the massive presence of organized crime it is opportune to start with some brief comments on the two fundamental topics this survey will discuss:</p>

<title>Shared definition and possible outcomes</title>
<p>Victim–offender mediation is an instrument of restorative justice, a new paradigm of justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1477370812467600">Zehr, 1990</xref>) that seeks to promote conflict resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1477370812467600">Galaway and Hudson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1477370812467600">Marshall, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1477370812467600">Van Ness and Heetderks Strong, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1477370812467600">Wright, 1996</xref>) through responsibilization, reparation and reconciliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1477370812467600">Braithwaite, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1477370812467600">Strang and Braithwaite, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1477370812467600">Weitekamp and Kerner, 2003</xref>) instead of punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1477370812467600">Von Hirsch et al., 2003</xref>). Despite its limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1477370812467600">Daly, 2009</xref>: 218–28) and difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1477370812467600">Gray, 2005</xref>: 938–57; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1477370812467600">Johnstone, 2002</xref>), restorative justice represents an attempt to achieve a better justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1477370812467600">Crawford and Newburn, 2003</xref>). Mediation, in particular, is a process, usually formal in nature, in which a neutral third party (a <italic>mediator</italic> or a <italic>facilitator</italic>) uses dialogue to assist opposing parties to exchange their respective points of view and to promote conflict resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1477370812467600">Baker, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1477370812467600">Bonafé-Schmitt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477370812467600">Castelli, 1996</xref>: 52; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477370812467600">Ceretti, 1998</xref>: 27; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1477370812467600">Mannozzi, 2002</xref>: 228; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1477370812467600">Mannozzi, 2003a</xref>: 339–59).</p>
<p>The results of mediation (and of the consequent reparation) may affect the criminal trial process at several levels: (a) in the <italic>pre-trial phase</italic> (as a technique of diversion); (b) in the <italic>trial phase</italic> (as a mitigating factor); (c) during the <italic>enforcement of punishment</italic> (as grounds for the early release of the inmate<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1477370812467600">1</xref></sup>); (d) in the <italic>post-release phase</italic> (to encourage reintegration of the offender). This implies that VOM can result in different outcomes, depending on the stage of criminal trial in which it is used, which may also rest on the type of crime giving rise to the conflict and on the criminal contexts in which VOM programmes are operating. This paper will attempt to explain why organized crime may affect the efficacy of VOM, using the Italian experience as a case study.</p>

<sec id="section4-1477370812467600">
<title>A brief overview of Italian legislation on VOM and of the use of mediation in Italy</title>
<p>As an approach for managing conflict, mediation was initially tested in Italy in the juvenile justice system. Although no regulations expressly provide for VOM, the system allows juvenile judges to establish a space for mediation, which was applied to the hearing and observation of the minor to determine whether to adopt diversion options or trial suspension, according to international agreements (see Articles 9, 27 and 28 of Decree 448/1998) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1477370812467600">Mazzucato, 2002</xref>). Mediation has not been applied systematically but only in the Courts of Appeal which have stipulated an agreement with local public bodies to establish mediation centres.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1477370812467600">2</xref></sup> Empirical research shows that mediation is used to deal with both <italic>petty relational offences</italic> (bodily injury, damage to property, assault, breaking and entering) and more <italic>serious crimes</italic> (theft, robbery, affray, extortion, attempted homicide, drug trafficking, rape) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1477370812467600">Mastropasqua and Ciuffo, 2004</xref>: 125).</p>
<p>Mediation was expressly introduced into the Italian criminal justice system for adults under the law that transferred penal jurisdiction to Justices of the Peace (Act No. 274/2000, Art. 29) as a means of dealing with crimes for which legal action is voluntary (minor conflicts among individuals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1477370812467600">Mannozzi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1477370812467600">Sotis, 2004</xref>). As a consequence, it was necessary to extend and strengthen the network of mediation centres. Indeed, the inspiring principle for the jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace is, according to a Latin expression, <italic>favor conciliationis</italic>: the justice of the peace <italic>must</italic> ‘encourage, as much as possible, reconciliation between the parties’ (Act No. 274/2000, Art. 2). However, this founding principle risked remaining a dead letter if the offices and structures needed for VOM were inadequate.</p>
<p>Although Italian legislation principally assigns the role of mediator to the Justice of the Peace in person, he/she can delegate this role to professional mediators, who must attend a course on the ‘communicative’ management of conflicts, because their functions require specific know-how based on psychological and criminological competences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1477370812467600">Monineau, 1998</xref>). Unfortunately, the current application of VOM for crimes coming under the jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace reveals limited interaction between the judges and mediation practitioners: economic constraints often hinder the establishment and day-to-day running of mediation centres, which overall have been operating longer in Northern Italy.</p>

<title>Organized crime and Mafia-type organizations: Excursus</title>
<p>Organized crime in Italy displays different aspects according to the type of criminal organization: the Mafia (which operates mainly in Sicily), the Camorra (which operates mainly in Campania), the ’Ndrangheta (which operates mainly in Calabria) and the Sacra Corona Unita (which is active in Apulia). All these organizations are expanding to Northern Italy, where they are attempting to penetrate the legitimate economy.</p>
<p>The oldest and most notorious Mafia phenomenon is also known as ‘Cosa Nostra’. It can be viewed as a <italic>subculture</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1477370812467600">Hess, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1477370812467600">Massari, 2009</xref>: 247; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1477370812467600">Santoro, 2007</xref>: 55) with its own rituals and symbols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1477370812467600">Buttitta, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1477370812467600">Mangione, 2008</xref>: 163) whose roots lie in mid-19th-century Sicily, which has evolved into a criminal organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1477370812467600">Lupo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1477370812467600">Paoli, 2003</xref>). To understand the Mafia criminal system it should be noted that it is an association of criminal groups that share a pyramidal-hierarchical organizational structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1477370812467600">Savona, 2010</xref>: 29) and a code of conduct. Each group, known as a ‘family’, ‘clan’ or ‘cosca’, claims sovereignty over the territory in which it operates its rackets, given that today the most common Mafia enterprise is protection racketeering. Mafia members call themselves ‘uomo d’onore’ (men of honour), although the public often refer to them as ‘Mafiosi’, ‘boss’ or ‘picciotti’, if they belong to the lower levels of the organization. The vertical, hierarchical structure is what differentiates the Mafia from the other Italian criminal organizations, whose structure is more akin to a horizontal network with groups that collaborate for illicit ends.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind this difference, which is mainly due to anthropological factors, one should note what the most sophisticated Italian organized criminal groups have in common: clear leadership, a multilevel organizational structure, hermetic groups and strong personal ties between members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1477370812467600">Fijnaut and Paoli, 2004</xref>: 476).</p>
<p>Some East European criminal organizations exhibit organizational structures similar to the Sicilian Mafia whereas West European criminal organizations show greater affinities to the horizontal networks of the other Italian criminal groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1477370812467600">3</xref></sup> According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1477370812467600">Savona (2010)</xref>, Italian organized crime provides the only exceptions among European criminal organizations because both the Mafia and ’Ndrangheta have a pyramidal structure while the Camorra oscillates between a pyramidal and a horizontal structure.</p>
<p>This paper will focus principally on the Sicilian Mafia because it is the oldest and most extensive criminal organization, and hence the most interesting when evaluating the complexity of restorative justice implementation dynamics.</p>

<title>Victim–offender mediation in Southern Italy: Criminological paradoxes and operational difficulties</title>
<p>An overview of the use of VOM will show how mediation centres have until now been operative mainly in Northern Italy, where there is an efficient network of offices, mediators and professional educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1477370812467600">Mestitz 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1477370812467600">2004b</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1477370812467600">Casado Coronas, 2006</xref>: 19). In contrast, the implementation of mediation has been fraught with difficulties in Southern Italy. This raises the question of why mediation began operating effectively from its inception in Northern Italy, whereas it is still struggling in Southern Italy (with the exception of the Office for Mediation in Bari) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1477370812467600">Gerbino, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1477370812467600">Russo, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1477370812467600">4</xref></sup> Three (concurrent) explanations are possible.</p>
<sec id="section7-1477370812467600">
<title>Criminological and victimological characteristics of the conflict</title>
<p>Southern Italy appears to be characterized by a ‘crisis of legality’ owing mainly to the massive presence of organized crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1477370812467600">La Spina, 2005</xref>). Many of the crimes committed in Southern Italy originate in systems and their corresponding criminal subcultures, rather than in individual forms of deviancy. which, however, may also be common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1477370812467600">Pasculli, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>From the point of view of the <italic>objective gravity of the act</italic>, crimes committed by criminal organizations are generally serious because they are widely distributed and because the damage and threat they can cause can be quite extensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1477370812467600">Arnone, 2010</xref>), increasing social alarm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477370812467600">Davigo and Mannozzi, 2007</xref>: 269). In Southern Italy, even crimes against property, which elsewhere are the typical expression of ‘common’ criminality, are committed mainly through processes that place them outside the competence of the Justice of the Peace, whose jurisdiction is confined to petty offences.</p>
<p>In terms of <italic>intention</italic>, criminals operating in a subculture such as that of the Mafia can elaborate a ‘self-justification’ for their behaviour principally based on two ‘techniques of neutralization’ that are extremely difficult to undermine: ‘appeal to higher loyalties’ and ‘denial of the victim’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1477370812467600">Davigo and Mannozzi, 2007</xref>: 269).</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of <italic>victimology</italic>, Mafia crimes are often much more ‘asymmetrical’ than common crimes. The ‘level of violence’ to which the victims are subjected is so great that they are generally silenced or inhibited by fears of reprisals, either direct or indirect, and are reluctant to report the crimes to the police. The loss of ‘power’ of such victims is thus much greater than in contexts where there is greater cultural plurality and where networks exist outside of family or clan-centred social groupings based on intimidation and the conspiracy of silence.</p>
<p>Last but not least, from the point of view of the <italic>criminal</italic>, the simple fact of affiliation with a strongly structured subculture means that any return to legality – either through norms that discourage action or through VOM – is much more difficult and costly (see the irrevocable status of ‘Mafioso’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1477370812467600">Falcone, 1991</xref>: 97).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1477370812467600">
<title>The criminal context of reference</title>
<p>Common crimes against property and offences related to interpersonal conflicts both have particular characteristics when they occur in contexts where Mafia culture is pervasive.</p>
<list id="list3-1477370812467600" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Extensive involvement in crime by juvenile offenders may feed a sort of honour-bound relationship between them and any criminal organizations that employ them, hindering their participation in mediation programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1477370812467600">Santoro, 2007</xref>: 106, 110–11).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The specific nature of the ties that exist between members of criminal organizations cannot be ignored: a ‘subculture’ whose rules and procedures are antagonistic to the legal system may strongly inhibit any participation in mediation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Similarly, crimes committed by adults on commission for or instigated by Mafia-like organizations are often the product of a consolidated career within such criminal subcultures. Applying re-educational/re-socializing sanctions in these instances has historically been hard, and embarking on mediation is even more difficult.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Hence, in regard to theoretically mediable crimes, a significant ‘inverted funnel effect’ may exist where the base – the shared family and social environment of the parties – limits mediation because it rests on the implicit <italic>consent</italic> of both parties.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1477370812467600">
<title>The presence of a Mafia-like culture running parallel with mediation</title>
<p>The third and perhaps most significant obstacle to mediation in areas where Mafia-like organizations are strong is the pre-existing mediatory role played historically by Mafia leaders that runs <italic>parallel</italic> to the ‘official’ system (yet to be fully applied). This phenomenon will be examined more deeply by analysing the expansion of Mafia power – from the institutionalization of ‘honour’ to its transformation into ‘power’.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1477370812467600">
<title>Mafia power and mediation</title>
<p>Authoritative studies of criminal sociology have structured Mafia power into three categories: protection, repression and mediation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477370812467600">Arlacchi, 2007</xref>). It is convenient to summarize them here.</p>
<sec id="section11-1477370812467600">
<title>Protection</title>
<p>The primary role of Mafia affiliates is to protect vested interests in society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1477370812467600">Gambetta, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1477370812467600">Pizzorno, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1477370812467600">Santoro, 2007</xref>: 48–54). Historically, their role served to protect property, assets and people in typically rural contexts. Over time, this protection became a ‘business’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1477370812467600">Vannucci, 1994</xref>: 52–67), guaranteeing a constant source of income for the Mafia as it moved into extortion. This has become the emblematic crime committed by the Mafia, which has adopted the operational model of the <italic>racket</italic>, for which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1477370812467600">Coser (1974)</xref> proposed the label ‘greedy institution’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1477370812467600">
<title>Repression</title>
<p>Maintenance of order is the mission/profession of the ‘man of honour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1477370812467600">Dickie, 2004</xref>). Common or conventional crime is tolerated by Mafia leaders only within strictly defined limits. They have traditionally been opposed to thieves, robbers, homosexuals, bandits and prostitutes. Such a role seems to contradict the definition, as elaborated by Max Weber, according to which the state has the ‘monopoly of violence on a determinate territory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477370812467600">Arlacchi, 2007</xref>: 49). Sometimes, in areas characterized by a high rate of Mafia activity, the state’s system of repression has had to admit its own inadequacy in dealing with particularly serious crimes and seek the support of local Mafia organizations to overcome prolonged and uncontrolled criminal behaviour (such as ‘banditry’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477370812467600">Arlacchi, 2007</xref>: 40).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1477370812467600">
<title>Mediation</title>
<p>‘The third function of Mafia power was by far the most important. The traditional Mafioso spent much of his everyday life in the task of mediating in conflicts within the local society, and mediating that society’s relations with the outside world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477370812467600">Arlacchi, 2007</xref>: 31). This type of mediation of both horizontal conflicts (between individuals and groups) and vertical conflicts (between authorities and individuals) is intrinsic to Mafia power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1477370812467600">Jamieson, 1997</xref>: 461), in the sense that it grounds and consolidates it as well as characterizes all of its internal processes: from the ‘anomic’ stage, when it springs from the individual struggle for affirmation, to the ‘legal’ stage, when the Mafioso approaches people and institutions representing the state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1477370812467600">Lupscha, 1996</xref>). This role is also based on a language (including non-verbal signals) that reminds us of the particular ‘friendship’ that characterizes family and interpersonal Mafia ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1477370812467600">Mills, 1971</xref>).</p>
<p>In practice, certain situations require the intervention of the Mafioso:<disp-quote>
<p>Every failure to respect any of the traditional norms of behaviour, and every one of the numerous cases of actual or potential conflict between individuals and groups, whether arising from economic or social relations or from the competition for honour. The Mafioso acted in such cases as a veritable Justice of the Peace; his intervention ensured that order would be restored – or, in other words, that the dominant socioeconomic system would be maintained. . . . A creditor may use Mafia power to persuade a debtor to make payment. A debtor may turn to a Mafioso to ask for an intervention on his/her behalf. In this way the interested parties prevent clashing interests from turning into a judicial conflict or into an honour conflict, saving time, human resources and materials. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477370812467600">Arlacchi, 2007</xref>: 52)</p>
<p>The power of mediation possessed by the Mafioso, and the fact that he could give speedy and coercive effect to his decision, were one barrier against the uncontrolled development of the disruptive tendencies that arise from the competition for honour between families. Local people indeed shrink particularly from feuding because it has effects of social disorganization deriving from its length and from the tendency to involve wider and wider family groups. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1477370812467600">Arlacchi, 2007</xref>: 54)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here is a case – reported by Arlacchi – of a Mafia leader’s intervention to mediate a conflict between two families at the request of the police:<disp-quote>
<p>Two families had been slaughtering one another for ten years, with one vengeance-killing answered by the next. Four people had already died on one side and four on the other, and each time the marshal had been driven to fury, because when he looked for a culprit he found twenty – and then the judge had to acquit them, because twenty people can’t get their hands round one dagger at the same moment.</p>
<p>One day he said to Don Ferdi, ‘You sort it out.’ Next Sunday the two families met up, eighty people in all, in an outdoor clearing . . . they brought along roast lambs, dried figs, . . . fruit, wine, . . . They made speeches full of the most sincere cordiality. Then came the kiss of reconciliation: the men kissed one another, and so did the women. During the next few months marriages began to take place between the young people of both families. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1477370812467600">Familiari, 1971</xref>: 25)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An analogous mediation pattern is used in other archaic forms of conflict resolution that occur in Mani, an isolated area in the Peloponnese region of Greece. The description by P.L. Fermor of mediation between two families in order to end a cycle of revenge and violence constitutes a splendid page of juridical anthropology in which mediation exhibits a pattern common throughout Southern Europe (for example, the symbolic meaning of the ritual of shared food accompanying apologies). The author refers to the ‘<italic>psychadelphosyne</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1477370812467600">Fermor, [1958]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1477370812467600">2004</xref>: 132), a reconciliative device typical more of archaic communities than of ‘simple societies’ that is used mainly to deal with very serious cases (for example, the unintentional homicide of one member of a family). It presents aspects of great juridical and anthropological interest because it is based on the author of the crime ‘doing something’, which includes activities such as making good, repairing damage or apologising. In this way, the offender becomes the protector/benefactor of the victim and his/her family. In the traditions of Mani, the appeal for forgiveness and the ensuing concrete reparation are the components that allow conflicts to be mediated, enabling a durable ‘state of peace’ – ‘αγάπη’, an expression that refers to the ‘invisible sphere of feelings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1477370812467600">Gioja, 1859</xref>: 201). Other simple conflict resolution devices were founded on a spontaneous request for forgiveness based on the precondition of recognition of the damage caused and the expression of true repentance or some form of transaction.</p>
<p>In conclusion, both in Mani and in ancient Sicily mediation was seen as a means of social pacification and functioned for the self-preservation of a group or for the conservation of a ‘monopolistic’ power held by the Mafia associate.</p>
<p>In regard to the Italian tradition, mediation is linked to the logic of power mainly when it evolves from a problem-solving device for horizontal conflicts inside the community into a device for mediating vertical conflicts between the community and individuals or between the community and the external world (that is, national, economic and political realities). Very often the Mafia leader will not tolerate competition in his sphere of action, also because the super-profits derived from his ‘legal’ activities depend on his monopolization of a natural resource or business sector.</p>

<title>Similarities and differences between Mafia mediation and penal mediation</title>
<p>The description of Mafia power as a form of mediation of conflicts is of particular interest if we compare it with the alternative dispute resolution instruments that find their specific conceptual and epistemological justifications within restorative justice, an autonomous paradigm of justice originating from a composite discipline fashioned from anthropological research on how so-called ‘simple communities’ solve conflicts, victimological perspectives and criminal justice abolitionism. In the perspective of extending recourse to legal mediation, it is very important to understand the cultural foundations and the ‘communicative act’ of the Mafioso. Currently, the <italic>institutional</italic> model of mediation introduced in Italy runs parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1477370812467600">Rouland, [1988] 1992</xref>: 427) with the ancestral Mafia model of mediation of conflicts (<italic>rectius</italic>) while seeking to overlap with and ultimately replace it, because mediation must take place within the criminal law and not on the basis of tradition. Hence, it is opportune at this juncture to give a brief overview, simplified where necessary, of the similarities and the differences between the traditional model of mediation, as an expression of Mafia power, and its parallel official form as elaborated by advocates of restorative justice in law and culture.</p>
<sec id="section15-1477370812467600">
<title>The similarities</title>
<p>At first sight, institutional mediation appears to exhibit significant similarities to the ‘autochthonous’ forms of mediation that are emanations of Mafia power. There are essentially four of these:</p>
<list id="list4-1477370812467600" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Management of conflict by the community leader</italic>. This structural aspect of mediation highlights the shared anthropological context where conflict mediation is entrusted to the community in which the controversy originated and, in particular, is managed by a person holding both civil and religious authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1477370812467600">Bohannan, 1967</xref>: 277). In this context, the Mafia boss is akin to the head of a clan. This method of settling conflict is based on the informality of the procedure and its supplementarity with respect to the penal trial.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Mediation involving the extended family</italic>. The form of mediation conducted by Mafiosi is similar to family group conferencing, an archaic mediation model that today is widely used in Australia and New Zealand to deal with juvenile delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1477370812467600">Morris and Maxwell, 1998</xref>: 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1477370812467600">Morris and Maxwell, 2000</xref>). Family group conferencing is mainly employed in very close-knit communities because of the type of conflict and its negative potentialities: the more the conflict expresses a horizontal development, involving more individuals of the same group, the more it will be necessary to exercise forms of mediation involving the extended family, which can operate as public reassurance factors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Community management of restoration and social control of follow up</italic>. The community is basically entrusted with the role of bringing the conflicting parties back into the community that was the original setting of the dispute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1477370812467600">Ceretti, 1998</xref>: 33; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1477370812467600">Christie, 1978</xref>). However, in the case reported by Familiari, marriages between members of families once at odds with each other seal the reconciliation: in general, the duty of the respective communities is to witness the fulfilment of the promise of compensation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Social pacification function of mediation/restoration</italic>. The function of the mediation meeting and the promise of reparation is to restore social dialogue between the parties (or opposing groups) and to act as collective stabilizing factors that can break the vicious cycle of vengeance and violence (Aristotle, <italic>Politica</italic>, I, Ch. 1,2).</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1477370812467600">
<title>The differences</title>
<p>Comparatively, the differences between Mafia-style mediation and penal mediation, conventionally called ‘modern’ in current literature (as carried out by practitioners who have attended complex training courses that confer psychological, criminological and legal skills), are much more numerous and profound than the similarities.</p>
<list id="list5-1477370812467600" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Mafia style mediation has an overriding compulsory aspect</italic>. This is based on the authority (<italic>rectius</italic>), the power and the capacity of the Mafia leader to intimidate, which is completely extraneous to modern mediation. In fact, the latter is a private decision between the single parties of the dispute as a result of the <italic>dialogic</italic> meeting of the parties promoted by the mediator. In contrast, Mafia-style mediation is more akin to a private decision devolved upon third parties, like arbitration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1477370812467600">Castelli, 1996</xref>: 45). In Mafia mediation, the boss of the clan ‘imposes’ conciliation and his decision has a compulsory aspect.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>The Mafia mediator does not have a neutral role in the dispute</italic>. Although there are epistemological doubts over the structure of penal mediation and its <italic>iter</italic>, which tend to reintroduce so-called ‘forced mediation’, it is clear that the role of the mediator in a modern system is that of a neutral, third party that is ‘equidistant’ from the parties in conflict. His/her function is to assist the reconstruction of the intersubjective communicative space and to help the parties to find a <italic>common</italic> interpretative background to their conflict. This allows them to overcome the dispute, mostly through reparative conduct, even if only on a symbolic level. Such a role – central to encouraging the reopening of communication channels that were blocked by the offence, yet recessive in terms of finding a solution to the conflict – distinguishes the mediator from the Mafioso conflict broker. The latter belongs to the same cultural context as the parties and is himself a party to the dispute with a vested interest (whether direct or indirect) in maintaining social harmony as well as ensuring that conflicts between families do not weaken the clan. His role could hardly be neutral because he acts in pursuit of a specific aim, useful <italic>in primis</italic> in consolidating the power relationships within the clan.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>The conduct of mediation reinforces the power of the Mafia in the community</italic>. In modern mediation, mediators have nothing to gain from their role. In Mafia mediation, in contrast, the mediator gains extra profit from his activity, which is the consolidation of his power, because he is able to guide the individual’s behaviour and to bring the conflict back within tolerable limits.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Mafia mediation pays little heed to reciprocal recognition by the parties</italic>. One of the specific elements of mediation is that the competitors must overcome their perception of each other as antagonists and enter a shared vision of the conflict by recognizing each other as persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1477370812467600">Bouchard, 1992</xref>: 191). Reparation, which ideally corresponds to a ‘win–win’ model where each party ‘gains’ something from the settlement of the dispute, is the objective. This aspect also differentiates mediation from the criminal trial, where the greater complexity of the proceedings leads the parties to adopt antagonistic roles that tend, in turn, to radicalize the conflict. Hence trials can reflect a ‘zero-sum’ logic. Sometimes, when the trial does not reach its natural conclusion (for example because of the statute of limitations, which deprives the victims of a declaratory judgment and a penalty, even if only moral compensation), the trial, being a ‘punishment’ in itself, ends up becoming a ‘negative sum’ game.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Mafia mediation is strongly oriented towards the outcome desired by the mediator</italic>. When mediating, the Mafioso tends to replace disorder with an order imposed by his own strategies of power and self-preservation, not with the law. The asymmetry of the conflict is also a factor, because the process only allows conventional agreements that can neutralize the voice of the victims. ‘Imposed’ words, not ‘mutual’ words, conduct this mediation. If it is true, as affirmed by Lacan, that ‘the world of words creates the world of things’, the words of Mafia mediation seek to reproduce and crystallize the logic of the conservation of (a subcultural) power, instead of attempting to promote an internal change in the attitude of the parties towards the conflict and towards the law.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Limited opportunity to access judicial redress in the event of the failure of mediation</italic>. Mafia mediation, while sharing with penal mediation its parallel and alternative role in regard to penal law with its codes and procedures, cannot interact with it. Under certain conditions, criminal law can devolve the resolution of conflict to external agencies or mediation offices. Subsequently, it can take the result back and insert it into procedural formulas of anticipated extinguishment of the trial or dismissal of the case. Mafia mediation is devoid of this connection because the authorities are not always aware of the dispute and therefore the mediator lacks a further proxy to resolve the conflict. Hence, if Mafia mediation is successful, the authorities cannot take any result back, even if they were aware of the dispute, because <italic>ab origine</italic> the mediator had no right to act and in any case there could be no guarantee of the accuracy of the <italic>iter</italic> of the mediation. Likewise, if Mafia mediation is unsuccessful, there might not be any activation or resumption of the legal process, not only because of the understandable lack of interest by the parties in informing the authorities about the conflict and the mediation, but also because of the excessive ‘asymmetry’ of the conflict, originating as it does from deep within Mafia culture.</p></list-item>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Following these observations about the similarities and the differences between Mafia mediation and modern mediation, it is possible to present some considerations with a view to establishing some working hypotheses on how to improve VOM in an area characterized by subcultures rooted in ancestral sociocultural structures, such as the Mafia.</p>
<p>As noted, the Italian VOM has come into competition with a pre-existing mediatory model – mediation as a specific and fundamental prerogative of the ‘man of honour’. Consequently, penal mediation may face at least three different risks:</p>
<list id="list6-1477370812467600" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>of <italic>being misunderstood</italic> when it seeks to establish dialogue by recognizing the offender who admits his/her guilt and by restoring any damage inflicted on the victim – such negative perceptions could compromise the outcome of penal mediation because the parties would be unwilling to consent to it;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>of <italic>being limited in its efficacy</italic> owing to a lack of inputs;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>of <italic>being linked more strongly to judicial activity</italic> instead of professional mediator activity – the judge is called in to act as mediator so it becomes more difficult to distinguish ordinary from restorative justice.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Before elaborating further about ‘acclimatizing’ mediation to a social system characterized by a Mafia subculture, it is useful to make some general comments about mediable crimes in terms of the implementation of VOM programmes. In general, the actual possibility of implementing VOM may be affected by several factors.</p>
<sec id="section18-1477370812467600">
<title>The victim</title>
<p>Not all crimes have a ‘victim’ in a strict sense. In the case of victimless crimes, mediation encounters far more difficulties because it can be carried out only with ‘surrogate victims’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1477370812467600">Bloch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1477370812467600">Mannozzi, 2012</xref>: 843).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1477370812467600">
<title>The author</title>
<p>Not all crimes are suited to mediation because the author may have an oppositional attitude (for example, in cases where he/she is a terrorist or belongs to the Mafia). In these cases, mediation is often inadequate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1477370812467600">
<title>The need for the consent of the parties</title>
<p>Mediation cannot be imposed: it presupposes the consent of both the parties involved. Consent is a variable that mediators, prosecutors or judges cannot control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1477370812467600">
<title>The presence of a threshold of mediable crimes</title>
<p>Establishing the degree of ‘mediability’ of a conflict can be done in two different ways: by the <italic>legislator</italic>, in a general and abstract sense, or by the <italic>judge</italic>, on the basis of his/her discretionary power.</p>
<p>The first method can be termed ‘formal’: the definition of mediable crimes derives from legislation that sets a ‘rigid’ threshold based on the juridical good protected by the incriminating law, the type of injury, or the merit of the punishment associated with the abstract criminal case (which is given by the sum of the negative value of the act, the negative value of the injurious or dangerous event, and the negative value of the intention).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1477370812467600">5</xref></sup> Only crimes below this threshold may be managed by recourse to mediation. This solution was adopted in Italy by the law instituting the penal jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1477370812467600">Mannozzi, 2003b</xref>: 288).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1477370812467600">6</xref></sup> Returning to the perspective of the implementation of mediation in areas characterized by the considerable presence of organized crime, it should be noted that many Mafia-type crimes are situated above the threshold fixed by the Justice of the Peace Act 2000.</p>
<p>The second method of selecting mediable crimes establishes a ‘flexible’ threshold, in which the class of crimes that can be dealt with through conciliation/reparation is open and the choice of mediation ultimately depends on the characteristics of the actual case, sometimes independently of its objective and subjective seriousness. This relies on the discretion of the judge. This model has been adopted in the Italian juvenile justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1477370812467600">Moro, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1477370812467600">Paliero and Mannozzi, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1477370812467600">1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Mafia-type crimes, which are normally serious, can theoretically be mediated by the legal system only when committed by minors, because the penal law pertaining to minors places no limits on mediation. However, these same crimes may not be amenable to mediation for criminological reasons such as prevailing sub-cultural influences on the offenders, the intimidation of victims, the strong ‘asymmetry’ characterizing the conflict and the direct mediation of criminal organizations which have an interest in avoiding internal splits caused by competition over issues of honour or family power.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1477370812467600">
<title>The type of conflict</title>
<p>The last and more complex factor is that recourse to mediation depends on the type of conflict and, in particular, on the type of disagreement. The parties normally disagree not about the existence of a ‘fact’ (which may or may not be defined as a crime) but about its meaning (which is criminal for the victim but may not have antisocial significance for the offender).</p>
<p>To explain this phenomenon it is useful here to use the tools of logical analysis. Copi and Cohen have observed:<disp-quote>
<p>[Two people] may disagree about whether something has in fact taken place, and when they do they may be said to have <italic>disagreement in belief</italic>. On the other hand, they may agree that an event has actually occurred, thus agreeing in belief and yet they may have different or even opposite attitudes towards that event. One may describe it in language that expresses approval; the other may choose descriptive terms that express disapproval. Here too there is a disagreement, but it is not disagreement in belief. This disagreement is rather a difference in feeling about the matter, a <italic>disagreement in attitude</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370812467600">1968</xref>: 109)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If the disagreement regards the belief as to whether or not the event took place, then mediation is an inappropriate tool, unsuitable for resolving the conflict.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Different kinds of disagreement call for different methods of achieving solutions . . . Disagreement in belief can best be resolved by ascertaining the facts. To decide them, if it is sufficiently important, witnesses can be questioned, documents consulted, records examined, and so on. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370812467600">Copi and Cohen, 1968</xref>: 110)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is therefore clear how disagreements regarding whether or not the event took place can be resolved not so much through mediation as through the trial process, whose task it is to ascertain the facts. To reach truth, increasingly rigorous and complex analyses of the facts are carried out, which are examined to the point of being ‘vivisectioned’ by using sophisticated scientific methods (think of the application of causal laws, expert testimony, toxicological analyses, chemical dating, etc.). As Bouchard observes:<disp-quote>
<p>In contrast, in mediation truth is based on a reconstruction of perceptions and feelings in an essentially subjective mode. Truth is manifested by relating the reality of the facts as accepted by the parties and is not the object of a judgement formulated by a third party extraneous to the dispute. . . . While juridical truth may be as distant from the reality of events as it may also be from the perceptions of the protagonists, the truth as expressed through dialogue . . . however much it may appear distant from the reality of events, always totally coincides with the reality as perceived by the protagonists. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477370812467600">2001</xref>: 252f)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mediation does not mediate the <italic>fact</italic> or the <italic>belief</italic>. Normally, mediation moves from recognition of the fact − that is not in question at least as an essential objective element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1477370812467600">Moretti, 2004</xref>: 108) – towards the satisfaction, by ‘reactivating a dialogue relationship between the two parties, of the need to find a more complex and inter-personal truth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1477370812467600">Bouchard, 2001</xref>: 252) and towards ‘recognition’ of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1477370812467600">Ceretti, 2001</xref>: 57). These aims are unconnected with the trial, where ‘fact’ rules supreme and the need or demand for its recognition by the parties is undervalued, making even the admission of guilt – given that it can be proved elsewhere – as unnecessary as listening to the victim. Responsibility is attributed. Reactivating dialogue between the parties is not one of the court’s institutional tasks nor can it be inserted as a ‘side-effect’ of the trial itself.</p>
<p>If the disagreement between the parties lies in <italic>attitudes</italic> towards a fact (that is, about how it should be evaluated) instead of <italic>beliefs</italic> regarding a fact, the most suitable techniques for resolving the conflict are no longer those used in the trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370812467600">Copi and Cohen, 1968</xref>: 110). The conflict that emerges from a disagreement regarding attitudes towards a fact is the field of operation for mediation. The mediator offers an exit from a ‘homeostatic’ situation, where no change can be promoted from within (that is, by the parties themselves) because communication has been blocked. Hence, a range of external situations that would be extraneous to a trial are instead drawn into the field of mediation.</p>
<p>As Copi and Cohen again observe:<disp-quote>
<p>Efforts to resolve this disagreement in attitude may involve reference to factual questions, but not the one about which there is attitudinal conflict. It may be fruitful to consider what happy (or unhappy) consequences would have been entailed had the event in question not occurred. Motives and intentions may also be of importance. These are factual matters, to be sure, but none of them is identical with what would be the issue if the disagreement were in belief rather than in attitude. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1477370812467600">1968</xref>: 110)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>If the above is true, the resolution of a conflict requires considerable work to be done on the <italic>perception</italic> of the facts and above all on the recognition of the other as a person having rights. Mediation can therefore transcend the rigidity of the criminal trial model for conflict resolution by placing dialogue before truth in a context where <italic>strepitus fori</italic> is replaced by the privacy reserved for the mediation meeting, allowing reparation to overtake sanction.</p>
<p>At this point it is difficult to give methodological indications except in the most general terms. Referring to the ‘list of risks’ mentioned above, it is possible to propose at least some working hypotheses:</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1477370812467600">
<title>The risk of being misunderstood</title>
<p>Although mediation has difficulties in acclimatizing to those areas where the Mafia presence is very strong, the struggle to extend mediation is one and the same as the one to establish the rule of law. Law and mediation are thus two fronts in the same war. In the former, the ‘weapons’, are sanctions, where punishment is akin to a <italic>pharmakon</italic>, mimetic with the violence it purports to oppose. In the latter, the ‘weaponry’, is of a cultural-dialogic type, founded on a paradigm linking ethics to law, which implies recognition of the other as a person and where the ultimate objective is restoration.</p>
<p>Mediation is subject to the same implementation difficulties as the re-educational/treatment approach for perpetrators of Mafia crimes. However, if it is adapted to the ‘effective reality’ of its context, it could offer advantages that should not be underestimated in the middle to long term. It is necessary to promote a culture of restorative justice where institutional mediation emerges as a device that is independent of ancestral mediation frames, which may still play a pivotal role in re-establishing social relationships. For the same reasons, VOM should be given precedence over conferencing, also to avoid the risk of increasing the influence of a Mafia subculture managed by the ‘extended family’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1477370812467600">
<title>Lack of inputs</title>
<p>Where mediation encounters difficulties for lack of inputs, it could be moved forward within the time frame needed for the investigation and trial and be used during the execution of the punishment. It would thus lose part of its deflationary efficacy, but it could help place offenders on the path towards rehabilitation (Act 354/1975, Art. 47, n. 7, which expressly specifies that the offender ‘work as much as possible in favour of the victim’).</p>
<p>Input to VOM during the enforcement of punishment may derive from judicial activity in relation to the enforcement of punishment (by the Italian ‘Magistratura di sorveglianza’), from prison staff and social services. Moreover, inmates are not confronted by any real obstacles to their consent to VOM because they are assisted and, to a certain degree, protected by the penitentiary staff – and can even gain penitentiary benefits (for example, early release) from VOM.</p>
<p>Improving mediation during punishment enforcement not only may counterbalance the lack of inputs to VOM but also can represent a viable channel through which to encourage a culture of mediation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1477370812467600">
<title>Who must act as mediator?</title>
<p>Normally mediators are volunteers or professionals but not judges. In the Italian legal system, Justices of the Peace can act as mediators. In Mafia-affected contexts the link between mediation and the judiciary could be strengthened, in contrast to the customary approach that separates the judge from the mediator. This would help the citizenry understand that penal mediation represents a conciliatory solution to controversies founded in penal law and that it can be adopted not as a traditional measure but as a penal precept and a victim-oriented measure.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it should be underlined that the restoration, reconciliation and mediation of conflicts between individuals, extended families or groups, practices that are regularly attributed to the aboriginal communities of Australia, New Zealand and Central America, are also deeply rooted in certain ethnic and geographical realities of the Mediterranean. Moreover, the spirit of ‘reconciliation’ so thoroughly permeates Old Testament and Evangelical traditions that even the religious creed can affect – either fostering or inhibiting – the successful implementation of restorative justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1477370812467600">Lodigiani, 2011</xref>: 41–42; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1477370812467600">Ballor, 2008</xref>: 481–484).</p>
<p>Consideration should be given, however, to the opportunity of cleansing such cultural legacies of their less noble or authoritarian attributes so that they do not burden the application of modern mediation with their archaic characteristics. For mediation to have any chance of success in South European countries, a truly secular and modern culture of restoration must be promoted, based on an informed awareness of the past. This objective can be attained by activating channels of communication between the law and restorative-reconciliative models, by investing in the training of mediators, by increasing public awareness, and by increasing the number of mediation centres, as indeed has already occurred in Northern Europe.</p>
<p>Unevenness in the implementation of restorative justice cannot be eliminated, as can be seen when countries are compared or when one analyses the different sociocultural realities that obtain even within a single country. In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1477370812467600">Tonry (2006</xref>: 22–3) argues that the presence of hostile conditions should not preclude the success of restorative justice and mediation. Even tough obstacles can be overcome.</p>

<p>Act 274/2000 established that all prosecutable crimes subject to the jurisdiction of a Justice of the Peace could be mediated. These crimes are characterized by the following criminological characteristics: the offender is always a physical person without any particular subjective qualifications; the victim is always a physical person; the victim is clearly identifiable from the start of the reconstruction of the criminal event; the objective seriousness of the crime is limited; the injured juridical good is always personal (physical integrity, honour, property).</p>
