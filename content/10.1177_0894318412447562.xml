         <abstract>
            <p>As the nursing profession continues to expand, the tendency to think based on the medical model also seems to be increasing. The thinking that is currently taught in nursing curricula is well known as critical thinking. However, over the years, the numerous attempts to revise and redefine critical thinking indicate awareness, by educators and members of the profession, of its limitations. The author of this column discusses some of these limitations, while proposing a more open and transparent way of thinking for nurses based upon humanbecoming ontology involving the emerging now, the resurrection of listening and silence, and contemplative thought.</p>

      <p>I recently received an email inviting me to participate in a research study involving nurse practitioners. While I am not a nurse practitioner, there is a nurse practitioner program at our university, so I glanced at the guideline for inclusion in the study. The first criteria read: “Three to 30 years of practicing medicine.” As I reflected upon this reference, I could not help but ponder the turbulent path upon which nursing, and in this case, advanced nursing practice is embarking. How can nursing as a profession survive when our activities are categorized as <italic>practicing medicine</italic>? Yet, nurse practitioners are increasingly following the medical model, relinquishing nursing’s history while ignoring nursing knowledge. The thinking by these practitioners is often focused toward cause and effect, prescribing medications or behavior changes, and may even go so far as trying to change the way others think.</p>
      <p>While the above exemplifies difficulties with the nursing profession at the advanced practice level, the belief that nursing is a <italic>medical profession</italic> is not limited to advanced practitioners. Undergraduate curricula often lean strongly on the medical model as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447562">Gracian (1647/2007)</xref> wrote, “To swim against the current is just as useless for setting a matter right, as it is dangerous for the swimmer” (p. 18). At the moment, a strong <italic>current</italic> in nursing is critical thinking. One reason for the introduction of a focus on critical thinking in nursing curricula was to encourage independence and autonomy in hopes of furthering nursing as its own profession separate from its medicinal counterpart. Yet, I wonder if we have not in fact, pedaled backwards, as critical thinking has become akin to medical thinking. Keeping Gracian’s words of caution in mind then, this column will swim against this critical thinking <italic>current</italic> in nursing in an effort to open minds toward a less limiting and less habitual way of thinking, a more transparent way of thinking with humanbecoming underpinnings.</p>
      <sec id="section1-0894318412447562">
         <title>Philosophy of Thinking</title>
         <p>Much of what is written about thinking is rooted in philosophy. Thinking about thinking has captured the interest of many philosophers over the years. The ever familiar, “cogito ergo sum” or “I think therefore I am” is credited to Descartes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447562">Connor, 2010</xref>) in 1637. This is evidence enough that thinking has been on the minds of great philosophers for years and the search for philosophical discussions related to thinking yielded an enormous number of references. Thinking, it seems, has been thought about a lot. The results of this literature search reinforced the original notion that there is still much unknown about thinking.</p>
         <p>In philosophical writings, thinking is often talked about as either a process or an object. To explain, when a person responds to the question, <italic>What are you thinking</italic>? the response given is no longer the thinking activity, it becomes a thought. So in this sense, thinking is not the object, the thought is the object. Thinking itself then is a process or activity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894318412447562">Descartes (1637/2004)</xref> supported the notion of thinking as an activity in his explanation of a thinking being as one capable of participating in a variety of actions. He wrote “what is a thinking thing? It is a thing that doubts, understands [conceives], affirms, denies, wills, refuses, that imagines also, and perceives. Assuredly it is not little” (pp. 97-98). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447562">Heidegger (1977/1993)</xref> further supported the notion of thinking as an action in his answer to the question, what is called thinking? In his 1951-52 lecture course <italic>Was heist Denken</italic>, Heidegger described thinking as involving a variety of activities. He stated, “We give the name ‘thinking’ to calculating, reckoning, figuring, planning, and problem solving, and also in less earnest moods to whimsical reverie and day-dreaming. Thinking is having ideas or pictures before the mind” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447562">Heidegger, 1977/1993</xref>, p. 366).</p>
         <p>So how exactly do thinking and thoughts relate? Regarding the question, <italic>What are you thinking</italic>?, the answer is the thought, but did the thought develop after thinking began or was it the thought that the thinking was about. Much discourse has centered on this question alone. Heidegger believed thoughts are not something that you create, but are ideas that are to be thought about. In other words, thoughts are <italic>apriori</italic> to thinking. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894318412447562">Bion (1962)</xref> concurred with this idea saying, “thoughts are regarded as epistemologically prior to thinking and . . .thinking has to be developed as a method or apparatus for dealing with thoughts” (p. 2). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447562">Heidegger (1977/1993)</xref> discussed the makings of a pure thinker when he stated, “Socrates is the purest thinker” (p. 382) because he did nothing but stay in the draft following thoughts on his way toward thinking. This is why he wrote nothing down, “for anyone who begins to write out of thoughtfulness must inevitably be like those people who run to seek refuge from any draft too strong for them” (Heidegger, p. 382). Once something is written down it is no longer a pure thought. It becomes a part of literature, and literature, according to Heidegger “has decided the fate of Western science” (p. 382). Once something is written down then it begins to dictate how others should think, or more specifically what thoughts others should think about. Perhaps this dictating or directing of thought content is the limitation that can be found in the nursing profession as it relates to critical thinking.</p>

         <title>Nursing and Thinking</title>
         <p>In nursing curricula, critical thinking is the rave. Faculty members teaching in nursing schools are encouraged to implement an ongoing evaluation of the critical thinking skills of their students, and they base revisions to nursing curricula on such data. Yet definitions of critical thinking are elusive, as is the actual carrying out of such an activity. It is ironic that while critical thinking itself relies heavily on empirical knowledge, it is, as a singular concept, poorly supported empirically. Definitions abound describing critical thinking, but it remains a mystery in many ways. So what is it exactly? Is being able to give certain symptoms a label critical thinking? Is having knowledge of the various drugs to prescribe critical thinking? Is recognizing symptoms of medication interactions critical thinking? Or, is being able to do all of these things together critical thinking? No one seems to know for certain, yet these examples are what nurses and nurse educators have come to think of as critical thinking in nursing education at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.</p>
         <p>Where then, is nursing and nursing knowledge in this critical thinking process? The nature of critical thinking within the nursing profession, and as it is taught in nursing curricula, threatens to <italic>medicinalize</italic> the science and art of nursing, placing nursing and nursing education into a totality paradigm straightjacket. This reductive view of thinking is laced with a means-ends, cause-effect paradigmatic belief. Today’s critical thinking trend onerously addresses the science component of nursing, often neglecting entirely the requisite art aspect. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894318412447562">Vandenberg (2009)</xref> wrote, “critical thinking should be concerned with the truth within its own operations. Perhaps any consideration of thinking for educational purposes should be domain-specific” (p. 156). In other words, nursing needs to build its thinking upon nursing knowledge and nursing science not medical science. Nurses not only need to learn or relearn how to think, they must be allowed to do so.</p>
         <p>Literature is littered with idealistic views regarding the benefits of critical thinking in nursing curricula and while critical thinking should not be eliminated entirely from nursing curricula, it also should not be the focus for nursing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447562">Davidson (2011)</xref> wrote of “Attention-Blindness as the basic feature of the human brain that, when we concentrate intensely on one task, causes us to miss just about everything else” (B 6). An example of a student’s thoughts as to what critical thinking is as well as evidence that attention-blindness exists concurrently with critical thinking surfaced during a recent experience of overseeing senior level undergraduate students as they completed their preceptor experience. One student wrote the following in her journal regarding her experience.</p>

            <p>Starting with our first nursing class, the importance of critical thinking in the nursing field has been pounded into our brains. A situation with one of our patients proved this to be true. As the nurses worked on a patient, there was on-the-spot critical thinking occurring. They were thinking about everything that they could do in the given situation with the available resources that they had. It may have appeared to be more of a second nature type of thing for these nurses, but there is no way they could have gotten there without critically thinking. In urgent conditions such as this, critical thinking has proven to be vital. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894318412447562">Hunt, 2012</xref>)</p>

            <p>The family members in the room were very confused and kept asking questions such as “what is that?” and “why are you doing that?” I realize that the nurses were focused in on what they were doing to get the patient back to baseline as soon as possible, but they weren’t addressing any of the family members’ questions. I hope that I can remember this when I am put in a similar situation, and be aware of the presence and questions of those in the room and address them as quickly and as appropriately as possible.

         </disp-quote>
         <p>This example may demonstrate usefulness for critical thinking in some instances in healthcare, but it also demonstrates the tunnel vision that often accompanies it. Critical thinking limits thinking to what one can recall at the moment and how it can be applied to a situation and in this sense it is objective and empirical. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894318412447562">Livingston (2010)</xref> cautioned against relying solely on empirical data to think, because doing so is to focus on an incomplete present. The truth of the moment is not visible or knowable through empirical data alone. The tunneled objectivity associated with critical thinking neglects the subjective, often neglecting personal patterns or the person behind the objective.</p>
         <p>If nurses are limited to the type of thinking embodied in critical thinking as defined by many nursing governing bodies, the developing thoughts from this type of thinking are nothing more than recollections. Not only are recollections a very low level of thinking having to do with memory, but they are also frequently medically-based, since they are often taught in a program reflective of the medical model. Recollections are the beginning of thinking in that it gives food for thought. Nursing and nurses need to un-focus, move beyond recollections toward places unknown, and be allowed to experience the benefits of all thinking. Yet encouraging and practicing the spirit of free thought and unlimited thinking may prove to be professionally challenging. For example, a nurse is expected to operate as a thinking, knowing being in the practice arena, and in doing so will encounter thoughts and ideas that deviate from the prescribed plan of care. These thoughts often bring the nurse into uncomfortable moral and ethical dilemmas that have no solutions lying within the legal dictates of the nursing’s professional bodies. One nursing student unknowingly identified confusion associated with critical thinking, following prescribed directives, and the freedom involved in thinking when she wrote the following in her journal from a day in the emergency department.</p>

            <p>Nursing school has a way of molding our thinking skills into a set list of do’s and do not’s. A big thing from medical-surgical nursing was not doing anything without a doctor’s order. If someone comes in with a trauma though, the nurse has certain freedoms to act upon. It’s nice to see critical thinking skills applied.

         </disp-quote>
         <p>Nurses often, in an effort to avoid moral and ethical dilemmas that may arise from questioning orders or thinking for themselves, may choose to limit their own thinking, often settling for medically-directed activities and thoughts to guide their practice.</p>

         <title>Thinking and Humanbecoming</title>
         <p>The ontological view of humans in the humanbecoming school of thought, involves beings that are different from the sum of their parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894318412447562">Parse, 1998</xref>). This notion rejects the limitations established by the totality paradigm, the paradigm reflective of the current beliefs of critical thinking. Critical thinking often requires nurses to separate persons into parts involving the bio-psycho-social-spiritual. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447562">Parse (2012)</xref>, the “<italic>becoming visible-invisible becoming of the emerging now</italic> is the living moment that brings to the fore the idea that meaning changes with each unfolding living experience incarnating the remembered with the prospected all-at-once” (p. 44). The emerging now is an all-at-onceness that cannot be broken down into parts to be explored. Therefore the critical thinking as described in nursing today is incongruent with the beliefs encompassed in the humanbecoming school of thought. In addition, the linearity involved in critical thinking is too restrictive in nature to be a part of humanbecoming thought. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318412447562">Parse (2007)</xref> described four postulates that permeate the principles of humanbecoming (freedom, mystery, paradox, illimitability) (p. 308). These four postulates will be used as a guide for further discussion on humanbecoming and thinking.</p>
         <sec id="section4-0894318412447562">
            <title>Freedom</title>
            <p>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318412447562">Parse (2007)</xref> wrote “freedom is contextually construed liberation; it ‘is the foundation of all essences . . .the stuff of being’ [Sartre, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318412447562">Parse, 2007</xref>, p. 308] lived in context” (p. 308). Many philosophers believe the human being’s ability to think is what differentiates them from other living creatures. If thinking and Being really do co-exist, as many philosophers believe, then thinking should be one of the human’s greatest activities reflective of freedom. Yet, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447562">Heidegger (1977/1993)</xref> wrote, “We must learn thinking, because our being able to think, and even gifted for it, is still no guarantee that we are capable of thinking” (p. 381). This is especially true if persons are told not only how to think and what to think, but even more damaging, what is the meaning of their thinking. Critical thinking in current nursing practice often does just this, limiting the much greater ability of nurses to think freely. Nurses and nurse educators should learn from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894318412447562">Gracian’s (1647/2007)</xref> simple directive, “thinking is free, and it may not be, nor can it be strangled” (p. 18).</p>

               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318412447562">Parse (2007)</xref> described mystery as “the unexplainable, that which cannot be completely known unequivocally. It is a puzzlement, an impenetrable . . . . No one or no thing is completely knowable; there is always the unfathomable with the indivisible, unpredictable, everchanging humanuniverse” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318412447562">Parse, 2007</xref>, p. 309). This notion of mystery encourages the questioning of the ever unknown. Nurses should not be satisfied with textbook knowledge alone. The very idea of the world as full of mystery, directs nursing to step outside the linearity of critical thinking, moving toward thinking involving the ever-changing, all-at-onceness of the emerging now (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447562">Parse, 2012</xref>). Instead of solely focusing on <italic>what is</italic> nurses should be encouraged to recognize the mystery of the whole being through exploration of questions such as, <italic>What isn’t yet known? What might be?</italic>, or <italic>What patterns may be emerging?</italic>. In asking questions similar to these the nurse becomes open to the unknown possibilities.</p>

               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318412447562">Parse (2007)</xref> described paradox as “an intricate rhythm expressed as a pattern preference. Paradoxes are not opposites to be reconciled or dilemmas to be overcome but, rather, are lived rhythms” (p. 309). Paradoxes abound in the concept, thinking. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894318412447562">Connor (2010)</xref> wrote about thought bubbles. These bubbles initially appear empty of content; they are “the possibility of thoughts without a thinker” (p. 15), until the thought appears in the largest bubble. This thought bubble is an excellent metaphor for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894318412447562">Parse’s (2007)</xref> humanbecoming paradoxes, reflective-prereflective and explicit-tacit, which are found within the concept, imaging. Imaging and the paradoxes flow from the first principle of humanbecoming, and relate to thinking in that persons have thoughts or ideas that are both implicit and explicit all-at-once. Because some thoughts are implicit humans are not aware of all that they are thinking about at any given time, and these thoughts cannot always be described. In this sense the unutterable nature of thinking is akin to the thought bubble. As thinking occurs the idea grows or the context in which persons find themselves changes, the thought surfaces and becomes utterable as it is found explicitly in the largest thought bubble.</p>
            <p>Another paradoxical example present in thinking is certainty-uncertainty. Thinking always involves certainty-uncertainty. In fact, without it no thinking would occur. While persons may think they are certain about some aspect of their lives, there is always an element of uncertainty that accompanies every new moment. Thinking about this certainty-uncertainty is part of endless transforming in the emerging now. The very notion of emerging now (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894318412447562">Parse, 2012</xref>) as moment to moment change implies no certainty without uncertainty, thereby giving much food for thought.</p>

Nurses and nurse educators often fail to recognize the illimitable nature of thinking. The attempts at defining critical thinking are in themselves restrictive. Nurses are often unable to think beyond any prescribed beliefs about the recognition of unfolding patterns in the emerging now. This inability to think illimitably is found in many nurses afraid to make waves or think outside the constraints. An awareness of <italic>what if</italic> and <italic>what about</italic> ideas and thoughts are absent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894318412447562">Cameron (2011)</xref> in a discussion of politics and nursing gave examples of questions nurses might ask themselves, “As nurses we might ask what are things like for us today? In what kinds of situations do we find ourselves? What do we know about the constraints that limit us, the possibilities that present themselves” (p. 153)? These types of questions may help nurses to move away from the constraints of critical thinking towards a more open way of thinking involving recognition of the illimitability present in all.</p>

         <p>The world is changing at a rapid pace and nursing cannot be left behind. The concept of critical thinking in nursing and the teaching-learning process has been around for over 15 years. The frequent efforts to refine it and define it during this time, indicates a collegial recognition of its limiting nature. Yet, nursing clings to critical thinking, touting it as a badge of honor or a defining characteristic of a nurse, something that differentiates nurses from their medical companions. Unfortunately, critical thinking, with its strong reliance on the medical model, does little to raise nursing in its own professional light. So what can be done with this critical thinking dilemma in which nursing finds itself?</p>
         <p>One suggestion is to incorporate thinking from a humanbecoming ontological viewpoint bringing nurses to a more authentic way of being. Such authenticity would bridge the gap from critical thinking to an open and more transparent way of thinking. Thinking in this manner would no longer flow within the confines of professional guidelines or definitions, but would be free flowing while being respectful to others’ ideas and thoughts. Suggested ways for developing this transparency in thinking includes (a) emerging now thinking, (b) reconsidering the value of listening and silence, and (c) reflective contemplation.</p>
         <p>
            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447562">Bunkers (2003)</xref> wrote of the need for preparing students in nursing who are aware of emerging patterns. She wrote, “Teaching-learning in the 21<sup>st</sup> century will require sensitivity to a world of constant change. Instead of looking at prediction as a way of organizing one’s knowledge of society, we will need to develop an awareness of emerging patterns” (p. 25). Bunkers’ recommendation stands true today. Yet, the trends in nursing education have not demonstrated awareness of this needed change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894318412447562">Freed and McLaughlin (2011)</xref> built on Bunkers’ thought and recommended considering “futures thinking” (p. 175) as a part of the teaching-learning process for nurses. Futures thinking was discussed as a means of considering the future through the lens of <italic>what ifs</italic> and encourages the inclusion of a class in nursing curricula related to this. They explained, “having dialogues with students about possible futures helps them relinquish the idea that the future is fixed and predetermined” (Freed &amp; McLaughlin, p. 175).</p>
         <p>Emerging now thinking based on the humanbecoming ontology would not aspire to a fixed or predetermined future, so having dialogues that erase this notion would lift the fogginess imposed by current critical thinking strategies. In addition it would open awareness to emerging patterns of relating involving person-person, person-technology, and beyond. This more transparent and open way of thinking, encourages nurses, during nurse-person encounters, to be directed by the person’s value priorities recognizing pattern preferences in the emerging now. Such thinking moves nurses away from those pre-established ideas, prescriptive thoughts, or an immediate fix mentality. The recognition of a person-driven quality of life instead of a medically-dictated one would soon emerge.</p>
         <p>The transformation to transparent thinking with a humanbecoming base begins with teachers and researchers who “must recognize that learning issues forth from listening, which silences what we think we know” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447562">Caranfa, 2006</xref>, p. 98), and therefore what we are directed to think about. So, as the act of listening silences what we think we know, preconceived thoughts are set aside making each encounter and interaction unique and person-centered, with nurses finally able to be truly present and open to the unknown. This idea encourages educators to reconsider the importance of the concept of listening, a concept troublingly absent in many schools. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894318412447562">Bunkers (2003)</xref> wrote, “It is in the listening process where insights, understandings, and meanings reside” (p. 26). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894318412447562">Caranfa (2006)</xref> concurred with Bunkers in stating, “Our failure to teach that there is ‘more’ to knowledge than what ‘we can tell’ is perhaps our greatest shortcoming as educators. The problem of education is a direct result of our failure to listen, to teach silence. To be alone and to listen should have priority over discourse and critical thinking” (p. 98).</p>
         <p>The transformation related to thinking then involves the recognition that listening to others in modern society cannot be allowed to be replaced with technology. Yet, a strongly held belief that the answer to most questions is only a keystroke away exists. No listening skills are required to read blogs and perhaps eventually no thinking itself will be required. A current student during discussion about communication made the following statement, “I would much rather text back and forth with someone than talk face to face, especially if we disagree.” With notions such as this existing in today’s students, greater emphasis must be placed on the relearning how to listen, while respecting the silence that may accompany it. This silence must not be overridden with any form of technology, for it is during that listening and within that silence that thinking ensues, and personal knowledge as well as nursing knowledge may be transformed.</p>
         <p>A final suggestion for transforming thinking in nursing education is pulled from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894318412447562">Dahlin (2009)</xref>. Dahlin recommended incorporating <italic>contemplative practice</italic> in education. Dahlin explained, “Contemplative practice is a way to learn to think, that is, to learn to <italic>live consciously</italic> in the <italic>activity</italic> of thinking, not only in thoughts” (p. 551). In other words, nurses should not only think about the thoughts that are given them to think, but the fact that it <italic>is</italic> being thought, that in fact, there is thinking occurring. This recognition brings people closer to validating the humanuniverse aspect of Being, that humans are all thinking beings. Such recognition will move nurses beyond cause-effect, shifting to an open thinking that embraces questions regarding the self, others, and the unknown. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894318412447562">Koerner (2009)</xref> encouraged “active intelligence” (p. 169), a notion similar to contemplative practice which incorporates inner wisdom and creative capacity. Koerner wrote “the more we are ruled by standards, norms, and requirements, the less we hear those soft intuitive whispers from deep within our authentic and creative souls” (p. 169). Moving away from the standards, norms, and requirements constraining the critical thinking process, opens to a conscious awareness of the activity of thinking that creates a more transparent process, whereby knowledge that once was dictated is set aside for a more profound and authentic interpretation of the emerging now.</p>

            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894318412447562">Heidegger (1993)</xref> stated, “Our logical and technological training does not prepare us well for such . . .thinking” (p. 336). Heidegger’s words were quite visionary given the advancements of today. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894318412447562">Davidson (2011)</xref> cited a <italic>Newsweek</italic> cover story as proclaiming “iPod, Therefore I Am” (p. B6) and while this heading is obviously a pun of Descartes famous quote, it may be eerily prophetic. With access to technology offering immediate gratification to questions once requiring extensive contemplation and reflection, nurses and society in general, are forgetting how to think about anything. Are nurses as professionals therefore, moving toward a world where persons are no longer expected to think? A world where relying on machines to do the thinking is becoming acceptable? Have we already made this move?</p>
         <p>Nurses need to recognize the limitations surrounding critical thinking as it is known today in the profession. Such recognition will help nurses differentiate the practice of nursing from the practice of medicine. If critical thinking for nursing continues to adopt non-humanistic patterns of relating involving problem-solving through the recollection of context-specific information to determine a diagnosis, prescribe a medication, and advise appropriate behaviors, then nurses may soon be replaced by machines. The purpose of this column was about rethinking whether critical thinking is enough for the nursing profession, and whether critical thinking is in reality taking the profession down a road where thinking beings are actually no longer required.</p>
         <p>Nurse leaders, in an effort to stay abreast of rapid paced changes, must be willing to move to a more transparent way of thinking based upon aspects of Parse’s humanbecoming ontology by (a) incorporating emerging now thinking, (b) encouraging the resurrection of the art of listening and silence, and (c) employing the notion of more contemplative thought. Such transparent thinking will fortify the profession with nurses able to recognize the ever-changing emerging now through the ever-constant asking of <italic>what if</italic>? Adopting this open, transparent way of thinking encourages the nurse to bear witness as others’ health patterns emerge in living their value priorities. Nurses can be truly present with others recognizing the freedom, illimitability, paradox, and mystery in each person, each moment, and each encounter.</p>
