<abstract>
<p>This article examines the relation of empathy and rational judgment. When people observe a conflict most are quick to side with one of the parties. Once a side has been taken, empathy with that party further solidifies this choice. Hence, it will be suggested that empathy is not neutral to judgment and rational decision-making. This does not mean, however, that the one who empathizes will necessarily have made the best choice.</p>

<p>Empathizing with a specific person influences how one views and describes her behavior. Different descriptions of her behavior will suggest different rational arguments for or against her actions. Hence, empathy is not neutral to judgment and rational decision-making. This does not mean, however, that the one who empathizes will necessarily have made the best choice. Is it necessary for empathy that “we feel ourselves <italic>out of</italic> a shared interactive emotionality” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754073911421394">Söffner, 2012</xref>)? Probably so.</p>
<p>In the past two decades, most interest in empathy has been focused on its mechanisms and definitions. However, less attention has been paid to the situations that engender empathy. Which social situations lead one to be empathic? How does empathy pair with other emotions and social practices?</p>
<p>Central to the proposed three-person model of empathy is the assumption that empathy is not an automatic act, but rather a social practice that is engaged when needed. The article suggests that side-taking in observed situations of conflict often triggers empathy. However, there may be other social practices that may lead to empathy’s activation.</p>
<p>The basic model of three-person empathy applies to cases in which the decision of what side to take has not yet been made. If an observer is already affiliated with one side of an observed conflict (such as a spouse), there will not usually be an act of side-taking. The free choice, its uncertainty, and the actual decision are essential elements of this model in so far as they mark the decision for a side as potentially preliminary. Hence, the empathic reinforcement of this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1754073911421394">Figure 1</xref>) serves to confirm and stabilize the prior decision. In this sense, empathy might be an element of the confirmation effect (or halo effect) that makes first impressions stick. Observers who empathize with a taken side are likely to convince themselves that they made the right decision in the first place. Empathy thus helps to reduce the ambiguity or “grayness” of a social conflict and turn it into a black-or-white decision. This does not mean, however, that the one who empathizes will have made the best choice. Empathy can justify both sides.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073911421394">Peter Goldie (2012)</xref> asks whether the empathic reinforcement simply adds “more motivational oomph” to a prior decision or whether it also gives normative support and reason for the decision in the first place. Goldie does not dispute the “oomph,” but wonders about the normative dimensions of empathy. This is an important question.</p>
<p>Empathy, paired with side-taking, may not in itself provide rational arguments but stimulate the search for those arguments that can justify one’s side-taking decision. And this includes rational arguments.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073911421394">Goldie (2012)</xref> considers the sports example as irrelevant in this context. Is it? The assumption is that one can randomly side with a team and then observe a foul by the other team. The empathic observer can feel the pain of the fouled player. Does this empathy not fuel a rational argument that that team is unworthy of winning because it resorted to unfair play? Likewise, if one sided with the team that fouled, empathy may make one perceive the situation differently. One may perceive the man on the ground as a simulator who enhances his display of pain to draw a free shot. In this case, one could rationally conclude that a team using shady techniques does not deserve the victory.</p>
<p>Empathy influences the way we perceive the situation in the first place (foul or simulation). Social actions allow more than one description. The variety of descriptions includes differences about basic facts of the event, as well as complex internal states, such as intentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754073911421394">Anscombe, 1957</xref>). Hence viewing a situation from different perspectives (empathy) can alter its description in both emotional and rational ways. Empathy here does not in itself provide a normative argument for or against a side, but it changes how one describes the situation, and each description warrants a different set of rationale and normative arguments. (In general, it would be misleading to separate emotions and rationality too harshly; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754073911421394">Engelen, 2007</xref>). One can find support for most sides by means of empathy and thereby complicate normative assessments.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754073911421394">Jan Georg Söffner (2012)</xref> outlines models of swarm intelligence and shared interaction, and he asks how these phenomena relate to the three-person model of empathy. Söffner points out that evolutionary biology increasingly champions cooperation, whereas the three-person model of empathy includes dark sides of exclusion, competition, and <italic>schadenfreude</italic>. In fact, he asks the pointed question of “how we feel ourselves <italic>out of</italic> a shared interactive emotionality and gain or take perspectives.” The question is a good one, and it forces us to think about the evolutionary history of empathy that may still inform its structure today. Söffner’s question suggests that the development of empathy did not take place on the basis of shared emotionality, but as its limitation.</p>
<p>Indeed, Stephanie Preston and Frans de Waal have given an account of potential precursors of empathy and have identified shared emotions and emotional contagion as potential candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754073911421394">Preston &amp; de Waal, 2002</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754073911421394">Decety, 2011</xref>). They suggest that it is the line between self and other that increasingly limits the spillover of emotions from one to the other. In terms of my article, I am tempted to consider to which degree human and nonhuman animals may have developed a blocking mechanism against the prior “shared interactive emotionality.” More research is needed to understand such blocking and channeling mechanisms of empathy.</p>
