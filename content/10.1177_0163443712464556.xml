This axis, initially working through a wider Oslo University-led network, provided the infrastructural hub for intercontinental developments. The axis was the result of a diffusion of conceptual impulses from different, but related sources: Oslo’s reading of British media studies with a Habermasian input of public sphere theory, a new-found independence in the case of Zimbabwe, and an interest in related radical scholarship in South Africa, exemplified by CCMS.</p><sec id="section1-0163443712464556"><title>The British connection, 1980–2009</title><p>In the 1970s, an emergent cultural studies entered English South African scholarship via the History Workshop at the University of Witwatersrand (Wits), which pursued Edward Thompson’s ‘culture from below’ approach to social history. The Wits Development Studies programme, in contrast, studied Marx, Althusser, Gramsci, Poulantzas and other historical materialists (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0163443712464556">Tomaselli, 2000</xref>). These scholars were also influenced by sociology and the Rhodes University Department of Journalism, initially led by Les Switzer. A key scholar who participated in both the Wits and Rhodes projects is Ruth Teer-Tomaselli, who was the primary interpreter of both culturalism and Marxist political economy into South African media studies. In the late 1970s Stuart Hall and Richard Johnson at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies in Birmingham were informally consulted about the possibility of establishing a similar postgraduate centre at the then University of Natal.</p><p>The CCMS was formally established at Natal (later KwaZulu-Natal) in 1985. It had its political roots in the 1976 Soweto uprising. A group of lecturers and students had wanted to establish something like the Birmingham Centre that had pioneered studies of the relationship between domination and resistance. CCMS’s mandate, as piloted by the Tomasellis, Eric Louw and their colleagues, was to develop graduate research that would: (1) theorize the mobilization of ‘culture’ and ‘media’ in the service of the anti-apartheid struggle; (2) enable interdisciplinarity; and (3) work with civil society and oppositional movements (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0163443712464556">Louw, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0163443712464556">Tomaselli, 1989</xref>). Where most Afrikaans-language universities offered administrative research and communication science, it was the anti-apartheid English-language universities that inaugurated critical media studies following the belated introduction of broadcast TV in 1976. CMS globally had struggled to reclaim these sites during the Thatcherist and Reagan era, and to restore the integrity of the public sphere (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0163443712464556">Rønning, 1997</xref>). All cultural and media sites, we argued, should be contested, not simply abandoned to hegemonic forces as had been the case previously with the four English-speaking universities. CCMS, thus, was born directly from the anti-apartheid struggle with a strong emphasis on social justice, and from the start worked with, alongside and through anti-apartheid organizations. This emphasis continued after apartheid ended in 1994, and CCMS today continues to work with civic, community, and development organizations, helping to shape state cultural and media policies (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0163443712464556">Louw, 1993</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section2-0163443712464556"><title>The Zimbabwe–Oslo connection</title><p>In the early 1990s, a research project entitled ‘Media and Democracy – Cultural Change in Southern Africa’, received funding from the Norwegian Research Council under the programme ‘State and Society, Democracy and Political Change in the Third World’. The project’s partners were the Department of English at the UZ and the Department of Media and Communication at Oslo. The impetus for the partnership was the long-time support from the Nordic countries and Nordic academics for the liberation struggles in southern Africa, in which the independence of Zimbabwe was seen as an opportunity for strengthening the democratic aspirations and academic importance of the cooperation that started during the struggle. A further contribution was the impending demise of the apartheid regime, and the ‘wind’ of democracy then supposedly sweeping across Africa. The UZ–Oslo axis was a crossroads for three salient strands: (1) a Nordic trajectory, represented by Helge Rønning, Michael Bruun Andersen, Knut Lundby, Ragnar Waldahl, Gunnar Liestøl, Anita Werner among others; (2) early counter-hegemonic sites of African cultural studies, represented at UZ by Kimani Gecau, a Kenyan in exile in Zimbabwe due to his association with the dissident Kamiriithu Theatre in Kenya; and (3) the pioneering of Zimbabwean media studies. This third strand was represented by key members of the English Department, Rino Zhuwarara, Tawana Kupe, Musa Zimunya and graduate students, with contributions from linguistics and sociology.</p><p>With the coming of independence in 1980 the former University College of Rhodesia became the UZ and the English Department immediately confronted the imperative to re-think completely the study of English Literature as it had been taught in the colonial era. It now defined its task as a commitment to Literatures in English, with a special emphasis on African literatures and an emergent indigenous Zimbabwean literature. This new approach to teaching literature as a form of decolonization, in contrast to its former imperialist Anglo-Saxon leanings, became the cultural and ideological foundation of the partnership between the department and the University of Oslo. The UZ–Oslo collaboration, however, was the culmination of a wider history of southern African cultural and media praxis. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0163443712464556">Moyana (1988)</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0163443712464556">Vambe (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0163443712464556">Zhuwarara (1999)</xref> – the latter a key member of the English Department and a central figure in the UZ–Oslo media studies partnership – the birth and growth of African literature in English manifests not only a sensibility rooted in African oral traditions but is also intrinsically linked to the colonial encounter. Oral communication and memory are the historical basis of modes of cultural and media praxis that existed before colonialism, that were displaced by colonialism and which outlived colonialism in various, mostly written forms.</p><p>The first such creative works to come out of Zimbabwe were published in the Central African Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (1953–63) – now Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Most were penned in Shona by the South African educated Solomon Mutsvairo (<italic>Feso</italic>, 1956) and Herbert Chitepo (<italic>Soko Risina Musoro</italic>, 1958). Mutsvairo and Chitepo were graduates of Fort Hare University where they were exposed to the black press. The ‘black’ press such as the <italic>Bantu Mirror, African Daily News, Moto</italic> and the <italic>African Parade</italic>, and the Southern Rhodesia Literature Bureau, all contributed to a writing culture among black Africans, though this remained largely depoliticized. In fact, such writing tended to be more British culturally than African. The struggle for independence (1966–79), however, saw the birth of what Zhuwarara calls a ‘long-term and optimistic historical vision’, tempered somewhat by the post-1980 realism in the face of the ‘pitfalls of national consciousness’. UZ thus attempted to bring this history to bear on the reading of contemporary Zimbabwean literature in English by Dambudzo Marechera, Charles Mungoshi, Stanley Nyamfukudza, Chenjerai Hove, Tsitsi Dangarembga and Yvonne Vera, centring African literature in general against comparative world literatures.</p><p>A Nairobi debate of sorts ensued at UZ as part of the process of de-Rhodesianizing literary studies. The situation in the 1980s UZ English Department was not unlike the one at the English Department at the University of Nairobi in 1968 when three junior lecturers, Ngugi wa Thiong’o, Owuor Anyumba and Taban Lo Liyong, initiated the so-called Nairobi Literature Debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712464556">wa Thiong’o 1981</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0163443712464556">1</xref></sup> Though on the surface the Nairobi debate was about literature, wa Thiong’o’s later performance work suggests that the discourse extended beyond literary studies. As wa Thiong’o reveals, ‘My work at Kamiriithu in 1977 made me lose all interest in the novel’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712464556">1981</xref>: 81).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0163443712464556">2</xref></sup></p><p>Kimani Gecau was one of four academics (along with Ngugi wa Mirii, S. Somji and Kabiru Kinyanjui) from Nairobi who participated with wa Thiong’o in the formation of the Kamiriithu Community Education and Cultural Centre, with a focal emphasis on developing a popular political community theatre there that spoke to the concerns of local people. It was a great success, but fell foul of the political authorities in Kenya. Wa Thiong’o was arrested and imprisoned and Gecau fled the country, eventually taking refuge in Zimbabwe and joining the English Department. The following description by wa Thiong’o of the theatre project shows, for instance, that a concept such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0163443712464556">Jürgen Habermas’ (1989)</xref> public sphere – though carried on the wings of the Oslo project – was not exactly new to Kenya and Africa:<disp-quote><p>The four acres reserved for the Youth Centre had at that time, in 1977, only a falling-apart mud-walled barrack of four rooms which we used for adult literacy. The rest was grass … the peasants and workers from the village … built the stage: just a raised semi-circular platform backed by a semi-circular bamboo wall behind which was a small three-roomed house which served as the store and changing room.… It was an open air theatre with large empty spaces surrounding the stage and the auditorium. The flow of actors and people between the auditorium and the stage, and around the stage and the entire auditorium, was uninhibited: Behind the auditorium were some tall eucalyptus trees. Birds could watch performances from these or from the top of the outer bamboo fence. And during one performance some actors, unrehearsed, had the idea of climbing up the trees and joining the singing from up there. They were performing not only to those seated before them, but to whoever could now see them and hear them – the entire village of 10,000 people was their audience. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712464556">Wa Thiongo’o, 1981</xref>: 42)</p></disp-quote></p><p>Kamiriithu was one of several villages in Limuru province originally set up in the 1950s by the British as a way of cutting links between the people and the Mau Mau. Wa Thiongo’o thought of the educational project he initiated in the village of his birth as an ultimate riposte to the Berlin conference of 1884 which inaugurated the late 19th-century European ‘scramble for Africa’. In wa Thiong’o’s words: ‘Berlin of 1884 was effected through the sword and the bullet. But the night of the sword and the bullet was followed by the morning of the chalk and the blackboard. The physical violence of the battlefield was followed by the psychological violence of the classroom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712464556">wa Thiong’o, 1981</xref>: 9). Kamiriithu was thus a ‘delayed’ response to the chain reaction set in motion at Berlin. The ‘wind’ of democracy sweeping through southern Africa in the 1970s appears to fall within the same pattern of colonial/postcolonial and apartheid/democratic exchange which later spawned critical variants of African cultural and media studies in Harare and Durban.</p><p>The Department of Media and Communication at Oslo was formally established in September 1987 jointly between the faculties of social sciences and humanities. A central element was to establish an international profile based on broad media studies where theories and methods from the humanities and the social sciences interrelated in educational and research programmes that included media policies in Scandinavia and internationally, both social and textual analyses. Theoretical insights from the Frankfurt School, including Habermas, played an important role with regard to public sphere analysis, civil society theory, the configuration of media and democratization, as well as the discussion of transitions to modernity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0163443712464556">Keane, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0163443712464556">Melber, 1993</xref>). Another intellectual inspiration from British cultural studies, particularly the work of Raymond Williams, whom Helge Rønning had known personally, was extended to an attempt to establish a transnational understanding of what constitutes different media cultures.</p><p>Following the demise of apartheid after 1990, CCMS moved into a number of general trajectories: policy and regulation, media history, documentary, indigeneity and identity, reception, and development, and public health communication. Action research and African philosophies read through critical indigenous methodological applications offered praxis-oriented solutions for a newly democratizing society. CCMS’s holistic imagination examines the <italic>relationship</italic> between texts and contexts (political economy, social institutions, policy and regulation), as well as how meanings are made, represented, interpreted and (re)circulated. In this period international links were established through a series of international biannual seminars held in Harare, Oslo and Durban between 1993 and 2004 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0163443712464556">Hall, 1997</xref>), and simultaneously, the registration of UZ graduates for MAs and PhDs at Oslo, UKZN and the University of Westminster. Rønning played a definitive role in facilitating these international connections and in articulating Habermas’s theory of the public sphere on the African mediascape (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0163443712464556">Tomaselli and Tomaselli, 2003</xref>). Student and staff exchanges established a common ground for understanding the role of media in cultural and political processes in a comparative perspective between different societies – northern European and African. These linkages were further strengthened by an international conference in 1997, sponsored by <italic>Media, Culture &amp; Society</italic> and hosted by CCMS in Durban, which brought together for the first time South African and Zimbawean media scholars and students. Stuart Hall was the keynote speaker, in his first visit to Africa (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0163443712464556">Teer-Tomaselli and Roome, 1997</xref>).</p><p>The current economic and political crisis in Zimbabwe from 2000 onwards impacted severely on the UZ. Norwegian funding was withdrawn and collaboration ended between the English Department and Oslo’s Department of Media and Communication. Working conditions deteriorated and many faculty and graduate students looked for career opportunities outside the country. From the end of the 1990s, the Norwegians continued working with KwaZulu-Natal and Rhodes, and then regrouped in Norway following completion of a number of regional projects (see e.g. <italic>Critical Arts</italic> issue on copyright and intellectual property, and the political economy of culture, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0163443712464556">Rønning et al., 2006</xref>). Graduates of the early Oslo–UZ programme are now working in South Africa (Sarah Chiumbu, Kupe, Selina Mudavanhu, Alice Kwaramba (now Kanegoni)), Wallace Chuma, Dumisani Moyo, Last Moyo) or in the UK and Norway (Winston Mano, Andrew Morrison, Nkosinathi Ndlela, Brilliant Mhlanga), while the veterans remain in Zimbabwe (Gecau, Zhuwarara, and the new generation represented by Susan Manhando-Makore, Nhamo Mhiripiri, Peter Mandava, Zvenyika Mugari, Manyaardze Hwengwere, Selina Mudavanhu, Jerome Dube, Tazzen Mandizvidza, and those who studied at CCMS and who are now working in education, civil society or in government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0163443712464556">3</xref></sup> When the contemporary history of Zimbabwean media scholarship comes to be written, this dispersed cohort will be seen, like the graduate products of Birmingham in the 1970s, to have made a crucial contribution to the diffusion of the study of culture, media and communication at home and abroad. The tragedy is that neither the Birmingham nor the Zimbabwean initiatives survived their home institutions<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0163443712464556">4</xref></sup> – in both cases however the impulses set in motion have had global purchase.</p><p>The implications of the cooperation between Oslo, the Media Programme at UZ and CCMS can also be seen in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0163443712464556">Orgeret and Rønning (2009)</xref>. Its contributions come from many of the media researchers who started their careers as part of the links described above. One of the book’s contributors, Terje Skjerdal, a lecturer at Gimlekollen School of Journalism and Communication in Norway, took his Master’s at CCMS. He coordinated the Norwegian-funded MA programme in Journalism and Communication at Addis Ababa University, where many other participants in the links between Oslo, CCMS and UZ also played key roles.</p><p>CCMS continues as a formally constituted centre at UKZN, though increasingly in opposition to regressive tendencies now filtering through the new state. The centre expanded significantly after 2006 as it firmly lodged many of its well-funded programmes within community, provincial, civic and rights-based projects (public health and development communication, indigeneity issues, media freedom and regulation, history, heritage and cultural industries research, etc.) This contribution has been recognized by UKZN and supported unconditionally. Students work with a variety of development NGOs throughout the country in doing their research, shaping outcomes along the way, empowering the marginalized and cautioning power. In this set of tasks, CCMS breaks with classroom hegemony, it questions uncritical appropriations of western canons (including CMS), and adapts Enlightenment thought in reconstituted ways in order to understand and shape the new social, cultural and ontological conditions that inform electoral majorities. CCMS applies critique in ways that directly benefit host, subject and other partner communities. It has done this while retaining a critical distance from new hegemonies and recognizing the value that indigenous ontologies, essentialist as they may be, can bring to the academic table. Its approach to media and cultural studies offers interventionist mechanisms via action research that can shape outcomes sought by individuals and groups within the conditions imposed by history. This is one of the reasons that CCMS shifted from Arts and Languages into the university’s new School of Applied Human Sciences in 2012. The latter emphasizes empirical application that opens up a disciplinary polygamy that will ensure academic relevance in an increasingly hostile instrumentalist and/or textualist-led world.</p></sec><sec id="section3-0163443712464556"><title>African media studies today</title><p>In February 2012 a three-day international conference, ‘Beyond Normative Approaches: Everyday Media Culture in Africa’, was held at the University of Witwatersrand. It was initiated by Susan Douglas and Paddy Scannell from the Department of Communication Studies at the University of Michigan and organized by Wendy Willems of the Media Studies Department at Wits. Participants came from many countries throughout the length and breadth of Africa, as well as from North America and Europe, and many were PhD students, post-doctoral researchers and younger scholars still in the early stages of their academic careers. Their youthfulness was indicative of a very striking lift-off of interest in the study of media in Africa, stimulated by economic and political liberalization taking place across the continent from the mid 1990s onwards. The traditional elites in Africa gravitated towards politics, medicine and law. Many who were educated at overseas universities preferred to remain abroad rather than return home. The new elites of the early 21st century are mostly entrepreneurs. They too have been educated in overseas universities and business schools but have staunched the brain haemorrhage of previous generations, preferring to return home to develop businesses in their countries of birth. In the forefront of these developments has been the spread and creative adaptation of new media, most notably the mobile phone, whose transformative impact on economic and social life throughout Africa can hardly be exaggerated. These developments in turn stimulated rapid and widespread interest in the academic study of the uptake, adaptations and effects of the media in African everyday life – a focal concern of the 2012 international conference.</p><p>In many respects this brief survey of the beginnings of cultural and media studies in southern Africa a generation ago has been written with today’s generation of students and younger scholars in mind. The study of media has always been concerned with ‘the shock of the new’: with radio in the then new sociology of mass communication that began in the USA in the late 1930s; with the very new medium of television in British media studies that began in Birmingham in the 1970s; and globally, with the impact of new ‘social media’ in the last decade or so. Each new generation needs to reconnect with its past if it is to understand where it is coming from. This all too brief narrative, which merits a far fuller elaboration, is offered as an initial sketch map of the beginnings of media studies in southern Africa and its contribution to its florescence across the continent today.</p></sec></body><back><notes><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-0163443712464556"><label>1.</label><p>The three questioned why ‘structures of the literary studies evolved in the colonial schools and universities had continued well into the independence era completely unaffected by any winds of cultural change’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712464556">wa Thiong’o, 1981</xref>: 93) Not only were they ‘shocked’ that syllabuses designed to meet the needs of colonialism could be seen continuing well into the independence era, but African literature – that is, literature relevant to the daily lives of the majority of Africans – continued on the margins.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0163443712464556"><label>2.</label><p>‘If the Literature Department at Nairobi was influential in my thinking on language and literature’, says wa Thiong’o, ‘it was Kamiriithu that was decisive in my actual break with my past praxis, in the area of fiction and theatre’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0163443712464556">1981</xref>: xii).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0163443712464556"><label>3.</label><p>Mhiripiri, Mandava and Mugari are all lecturers at Midlands State University.
