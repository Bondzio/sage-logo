<p>Reflective insulations are being used in attics, flat roof, and wall systems. Numerical modeling and experimental investigations were conducted to assess the thermal performance of assemblies with reflective insulations. In this article, the present model was used to verify the use of the ASTM C-518 test method for measuring the effective thermal resistances (R-values) of sample stacks comprising reflective insulations. Two tests were conducted on sample stacks using heat flow meter apparatus. The sample stack consists of two expanded polystyrene layers and a reflective insulation installed in between. The model predictions agreed with the measured heat fluxes within ±1%. The article also discusses the combined effect of heat transfer by convection and radiation in the airspace facing the reflective insulation, showing that the derived R-value from the test data resulted in underestimation of the effective R-value of the sample stack.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the means to reduce the operating costs is to limit the heat transmission through building envelope. According to the Reflective Insulation Manufacturers Association International (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744259112444021">RIMA-I, 2002</xref>), reflective insulation is defined as “thermal insulation consisting of one or more low-emittance surfaces, bounding one or more enclosed air spaces.” Currently, reflective thermal insulation is being used in home attics and wall systems (Craven and Garber-Slaght, 2011). In this application, the reflective insulation has at least one reflective surface that faces airspace.</p>
<p>Enclosed airspaces always contribute to the overall thermal resistance (R-value) of a system, but the presence of a reflective surface increases the thermal resistance of that airspace. Within an airspace, there are three modes of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259112444021">Saber et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744259112444021">2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744259112444021">2011c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744259112444021">Saber and Maref, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744259112444021">Saber and Swinton, 2010</xref>, for more details). The contribution of the enclosed airspace in roofing or wall systems to the R-values depends on</p>

<p>Any surface of adjacent materials that faces a transparent medium (e.g. airspace) absorbs and emits long-wave thermal radiation (e.g. surfaces of wood furring and drywall in furred-airspace assembly (FAA); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259112444021">Saber et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744259112444021">2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744259112444021">2011c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744259112444021">Saber and Maref, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744259112444021">Saber and Swinton, 2010</xref>). The amount of radiative heat transfer of this surface depends on its temperature and emissivity. Most of the construction materials have a surface emissivity of 0.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744259112444021">ASHRAE, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The contribution of the reflective insulation on the thermal performance of wall systems was investigated by the authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259112444021">Saber et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744259112444021">2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744259112444021">2011c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744259112444021">Saber and Maref, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744259112444021">Saber and Swinton, 2010</xref>). In these wall systems, a low emissivity material such as foil was installed within a FAA. A parametric study was conducted in order to investigate the effect of low emissivity of foil bounded to extruded polystyrene (XPS) foam when used within a FAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744259112444021">Saber and Swinton, 2010</xref>). The results showed that the modeled wall system with foil emissivity of 0.05 increased the effective R-value by ~10% in the case of the indoor and outdoor temperatures of +20°C and −20°C, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744259112444021">Saber and Swinton, 2010</xref>). Recently, the present model was benchmarked against the experimental data of a full-scale above-grade wall system (8 ft (2438 mm) × 8 ft (2438 mm)) consisting of a 2 in × 6 in wood frame construction with stud cavities filled with friction-fit glass fiber batt insulation and a foil bonded to wood fiberboard installed in a FAA (the foil was facing the airspace and the interior finishes). A test was conducted in the guarded hot box (GHB) to determine the effective thermal resistance of this wall system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744259112444021">Air-Ins Inc., 2009</xref>). This test was conducted in accordance with ASTM C-1363 test method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744259112444021">ASTM, 2006</xref>). The results showed that the predicted R-value of this wall system was in good agreement with the measured value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259112444021">Saber et al., 2011c</xref>). The present model was used to investigate the effect of outdoor and indoor conditions on the steady-state and transient thermal performance of a foundation wall system (including the above-grade and below-grade portions of the wall) having FAA that incorporates a low emissivity material (foil) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259112444021">Saber et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744259112444021">2011b</xref>). To quantify the contribution of a FAA with foil bonded to expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam on the energy savings, reference walls were considered (identical to these foundation walls but without FAA). The results showed that at steady-state condition, the effective R-value of the wall with FAA can vary by as much as ~3%, depending on the foil and outdoor and indoor temperatures through the year. Moreover, these wall configurations resulted in the energy savings of ~17% more than the same walls but without FAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259112444021">Saber et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744259112444021">2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>Note that in the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259112444021">Saber et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744259112444021">2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744259112444021">2011c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744259112444021">Saber and Maref, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744259112444021">Saber and Swinton, 2010</xref>), the orientation of the enclosed airspace was vertical. As indicated earlier, the reflective insulations can also be used in home attics and flat and sloped roofs. In these types of applications, enclosed airspace would have a zero or nonzero slope with a horizontal surface. Recently, Craven and Garber-Slaght (2011) tested a number of reflective insulation products at the Cold Climate Housing Research Center (CCHRC) to quantify the contribution of enclosed airspace to the R-value of an assembly. In that study, the ASTM C-518 test method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744259112444021">ASTM, 2003</xref>) was used with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744259112444021">FOX-314 Heat Flow Meter (2011)</xref> that accommodates product samples up to 12 in (304.8 mm) in width and length and up to 4 in (101.6 mm) in thickness. Craven and Garber-Slaght (2011) tested a number of sample stacks with different types of reflective insulations (12 in (304.8 mm) × 12 in (304.8 mm) in area) to allow for air gap below the reflective facer material. The support structure for the air gap was a hollowed piece of EPS (12 in (304.8 mm) × 12 in (304.8 mm) × 1 in (25.4 mm)), cut in such a way that the exposed center airspace, not the edges of the EPS spacer, was situated over a gypsum board (12 in (304.8 mm) × 12 in (304.8 mm) × 0.5 in (12.7 mm)). The airspace was 8 in (203.2 mm) × 8 in (203.2 mm) in area and 1 in (25.4 mm) thick. The sample stacks were placed horizontally between the upper cold plate and lower hot plate of the FOX-314 Heat Flow Meter. Two types of reflective insulations were tested (referred to in this article as Type-A and Type-B). The thicknesses of Type-A was 1 in (25.4 mm) and 2 in (50.8 mm), and the thickness of Type-B was 1 in (25.4 mm). All tests were performed at an average temperature of 75°F (12.8°C), with upper and lower surface temperatures of 55°F (12.8°C) and 95°F (35.0°C), respectively (upward heat flow through the samples).</p>
<p>The ASTM C-518 test method is suitable for evaluating a thermal resistance of a sample when the heat flow through it is by conduction (one-dimensional heat flow). In the case of testing a sample stack such as described above using this test method, the heat transfer through it will be by conduction, convection, and radiation. This represents a multidimensional heat transfer through the sample stack where the middle layer with air cavity acts as a thermal bridge. The use of the heat flow meter apparatus according to the ASTM C-518 test method when there are thermal bridges present in the sample may yield results that are unrepresentative of the assembly (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744259112444021">ASTM, 2003</xref>, for more details). Alternatively, the ASTM C-1363 test method using the GHB can be used to determine the effective thermal resistance of sample with thermal bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744259112444021">ASTM, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the ASTM C-518 test method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744259112444021">ASTM, 2003</xref>), the thermocouples embedded in the surfaces of the upper and lower plates of the heat flow meter measure the temperature drop across the specimen, and the heat flux transducer (HFT) embedded in each plate measures the heat flow through the specimen. The uncertainty of the measurements in this test method is ±2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744259112444021">ASTM, 2003</xref>). Testing a sample using this method only requires preparing the sample and installing it between the hot and cold plates (i.e. no need to instrument the sample itself). As such, this test method sounds simple, accurate, and a cost-effective test. However, the question is “can the ASTM C-518 test method still be used to measure the effective thermal resistance of sample stack such as described above?” The objective of this study is to answer this question.</p>

<title>Comparison of reported lab measurements and model predictions</title>
<p>As indicated earlier, Craven and Garber-Slaght (2011) measured the R-value of sample stacks with different types of reflective insulations (Type-A and Type-B) in accordance of ASTM C-518 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744259112444021">ASTM, 2003</xref>) using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744259112444021">FOX-314 Heat Flow Meter (2011)</xref>. In that study, the emissivity of the foil bonded to the insulation of Type-A and Type-B was not measured. However, the authors stated that for shiny metal surfaces, the emissivity is around 0.05–0.1 according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744259112444021">ASHRAE (2009)</xref>. The measured R-values of three sample stacks are compared with the predicted R-values using hygIRC-C model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259112444021">Saber et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744259112444021">2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744259112444021">2011c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744259112444021">Saber and Swinton, 2010</xref>), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744259112444021">Figure 1</xref>, when the foil emissivities of these reflective insulations were 0.05 and 0.1. The predicted R-values of the sample stack with 2 in (50.8 mm) thick of Type-A were 8.0% and 6.9% higher than the measured R-values for foil emissivities of 0.05 and 0.1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744259112444021">Figure 1(a)</xref>). For the sample stack with 1 in (25.4 mm) thick of Type-A, the predicted R-values were also 8.5% and 6.8% higher than the measured R-values for foil emissivities of 0.05 and 0.1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744259112444021">Figure 1(b)</xref>). Additionally, for the sample stack with 1 in (25.4 mm) thick of Type-B, the predicted R-values were 9.1% and 7.3% higher than the measured R-values for foil emissivities of 0.05 and 0.1, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744259112444021">Figure 1(c)</xref>). It is surprising that the predicted R-value is consistently higher than the measured R-value (in accordance of ASTM C-518 test method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744259112444021">ASTM, 2003</xref>) using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744259112444021">FOX-314 Heat Flow Meter (2011))</xref> by approximately the same percentage for different types of reflective insulations. In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259112444021">Saber et al., 2011c</xref>), however, the prediction of the present model for R-value was in good agreement (within 1.2%) with the measured R-value in GHB (in accordance of ASTM C-1363 test method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744259112444021">ASTM, 2006</xref>)) for wall specimen having a reflective insulation and FAA. So, the question is “why was the predicted R-value found to be consistently higher than the measured R-value by approximately the same percentage for different reflective insulations using the ASTM C-518 test method with FOX-314 heat flow meter?”</p>

<p>It is expected that the combined effect of heat transfer by convection and radiation in the air cavity would result in higher heat fluxes on the middle portion of the top and bottom surfaces where the HFTs were located. Thus, the measured heat fluxes may not represent the actual heat passing through the whole sample stack since these measurements would depend on the size of HFTs (4 in (101.6 mm) × 4 in (101.6 mm) in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744259112444021">FOX-314 Heat Flow Meter (2011))</xref>. Depending on the shape of the heat flux distribution on the top and bottom surface (12 in (304.8 mm) × 12 in (304.8 mm) in area), using the measured heat fluxes to derive the R-value may result in determining lower R-value. Neither the measurements of heat fluxes were reported nor were the emissivities of the reflective surfaces measured (Craven and Garber-Slaght, 2011). To enable the judgment of whether the predicted R-value or the derived R-value from the test data information should be used to represent the effective R-value of the assembly with reflective insulations, two stack samples were tested using the same test method (ASTM C-518) as the tests conducted at CCHRC (Craven and Garber-Slaght, 2011).</p>

<title>Verification tests</title>
<p>Two tests were conducted in an attempt to answer the question raised earlier. These tests were conducted in accordance of ASTM C-518 test method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744259112444021">ASTM, 2003</xref>) to measure the R-values of two sample stacks with and without aluminum foil. These tests were conducted using a heat flow meter that accommodates samples up to 12 in (304.8 mm) in width and length and up to 4 in (101.6 mm) in thickness. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744259112444021">Figure 2</xref>, the sample stack consists of two 12 in (304.8 mm) × 12 in (304.8 mm) × 1 in (25.4 mm) EPS specimens and an air cavity (8 in (203.2 mm) × 8 in (203.2 mm) × 1 in (25.4 mm)) (Craven and Garber-Slaght, 2011) created in the center of another EPS layer (12 in × 12 in × 1 in, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744259112444021">Figure 2(c)</xref>), which was placed between the upper and lower EPS layers. The first test was conducted without installing foil in the specimen. The second test was conducted after installing an aluminum foil on the bottom surface of the upper EPS layer (i.e. foil facing the airspace, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744259112444021">Figure 2(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744259112444021">(b)</xref>).

<p>Before conducting these two tests, the thermal conductivity of the EPS layer (12 in × 12 in × 1 in) was measured using the same test method (ASTM C-518) and the same heat flow meter. To ensure the repeatability in the measurements, the thermal conductivity test was conducted for three EPS samples of same size. The measured thermal conductivities of each EPS sample were 0.0346, 0.0347, and 0.0347 W/(m K) with an average value of 0.0346 W/(m K). The value of the average thermal conductivity was used in the numerical simulations. In all tests, the specimens were placed between two horizontal plates, at a constant temperature difference between the upper and lower plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744259112444021">Figure 2</xref>). Also, all tests for both sample stacks and single EPS layers were performed at an average temperature of 75°F (23.9°C), with upper and lower surface temperatures of 55°F (12.8°C) and 95°F (35.0°C), respectively. Note that these test conditions were similar to those that were conducted by Craven and Garber-Slaght at CCHRC (Craven and Garber-Slaght, 2011). The NRC test results showed that the measured R-value in the case with aluminum foil (ε = 0.2) was 9.814 ft<sup>2</sup> h °F/BTU (within a standard deviation (SD) of ±1.07%). Also, the measured R-value in the case without aluminum foil (ε = 0.9) was 9.112 ft<sup>2</sup> h °F/BTU (within a SD of ±0.86%).</p>

Further investigations were needed to understand why the predicted R-value was consistently higher than the measured R-value and which R-value would represent the effective R-value of the sample stacks. In these investigations, data analyses and a number of comparisons between the model predictions and measurements were carried out and presented next.</p>

<p>Since the measured temperatures at the interfaces between the sample stacks and the upper cold plate (55°F (12.8°C)) and the lower hot plate (95°F (35.0°C)) of the heat flow meter were taken as temperature boundary conditions in the numerical simulations, an accurate model should be able to predict the measured heat fluxes at these interfaces. The combined effect due to heat transfer by convection and radiation in the air cavity results in nonuniform heat flux distributions on both the top and the bottom surfaces of the sample stack where the HFTs are located. A full description of the convection loops (six loops) due to the multicellular airflow in the cavity that greatly causes a nonuniformity of the heat flux distributions on the top and bottom surfaces of the stack sample is available in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744259112444021">Saber (2012)</xref>.</p>
<p>The size of the HFTs of the heat flow meter used in the tests conducted at NRC is 6 in × 6 in. The HFTs were installed at the centers of the upper and lower plates. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1744259112444021">Figure 4</xref> shows sample results of the measured heat fluxes on the top and bottom surfaces of the sample stack with aluminum foil (ε = 0.2) at the steady-state condition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1744259112444021">Figure 5(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1744259112444021">(b)</xref> show the predicted local heat fluxes at the top and bottom surfaces of the sample stacks in the cases with and without foil, respectively. As shown in these figures, higher heat fluxes are predicted on the middle portions of the top and bottom surfaces than that close to the edges. In the case with foil, the percentages of the maximum change in the heat fluxes on the top and bottom surfaces are about 25% and 33%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1744259112444021">Figure 5(a)</xref>). These percentages are 36% and 37% in the case without foil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1744259112444021">Figure 5(b)</xref>). However, in order to use the ASTM C-518 test method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744259112444021">ASTM, 2003</xref>), these percentages have to be ~0% (i.e. uniform heat flux distribution or one-dimensional heat flow through the sample stack). Consequently, it is obvious that with HFTs installed at the center of the top and bottom surfaces having smaller size than the size of these surfaces results in measuring higher heat fluxes. Due to the nonuniformity of the heat fluxes on these surfaces, the measured heat fluxes are not representative to the actual heat passing through the whole sample stack. In this case, using the measured heat fluxes to drive the experimental R-value (R = ΔT/q″, ΔT was controlled to be constant in the tests) would result in the underestimation of the effective R-value.</p>

<p>Since, the effective R-value has to be estimated based on the actual heat passing through the whole sample stack (or average heat flux based on area-weighted of whole sample stack), the predicted effective R-value is higher than the derived R-value using the measured heat flux. The authors are therefore postulate that the nonuniformity of heat flux in the test apparatus, in combination with the heat flux measured only in the central area, explains the difference between measured and predicted R-value from the tests that were conducted at both NRC and CCHRC (Craven and Garber-Slaght, 2011).</p>

Depending on the value of the foil emissivity, the derived R-values from the test data underestimated the effective R-values by 7.5% and 9.7% for the cases with foil (ε = 0.2) and without foil (ε = 0.9), respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1744259112444021">Figure 6(b)</xref>).</p>

Because the ASTM C-518 test method is quite simple, accurate (uncertainty of the measurement is within 2%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744259112444021">ASTM, 2003</xref>), and cost-effective, it is worth trying to test the applicability of this method with additional measures of controlling multilateral heat flow.</p>

<title>Summary and conclusions</title>
<p>In this article, numerical modeling and experimental investigations were conducted to compare the thermal performance of different types of reflective insulations. The present model was used to verify the use of the ASTM C-518 test method for measuring the effective thermal resistance (R-value) of sample stack comprising reflective insulations. In the first phase of this study, the predictions of the present model were compared with the CCHRC’s test data that were obtained using FOX-314 Heat Flow Meter in accordance of ASTM C-518 test method. Results showed that the predicted R-values were consistently 6.8%–9.1% higher than the R-values derived from the test data (Craven and Garber-Slaght, 2011). To verify these differences, two tests were conducted at NRC using the same conditions as in reference (Craven and Garber-Slaght, 2011) but with different heat flow meter apparatus. It was also found that the predicted R-values were 7.5% and 9.7% higher than the R-values derived from the test data for the cases with and without foil.</p>
<p>Further investigations revealed that the predicted heat flux distributions on the top and bottom surfaces of the sample stack were nonuniform because of the combined effect of heat transfer by convection and radiation inside the air cavity. Since the predicted and measured heat fluxes on the same area and same location of HFTs on the top and bottom surfaces were in good agreement (within ±1%), and these values were higher than the area-weighted average heat fluxes based on whole surface area of the sample stack, it was evident that the derived R-value from the test data resulted in underestimation of the effective R-value of the sample stack. Since the ASTM C-518 test method is quite simple, precise, and cost-effective, future work is recommended to investigate experimentally the possibility of using this test method after increasing the size of the HFTs to be the same as the size of the top and bottom surfaces of the sample stacks. Thereafter, the obtained test results should be compared with modeling results in order to proof this concept.</p>
