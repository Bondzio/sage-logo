<p>For decades, women of color, lesbians and gay men, and transgender persons have been reluctant to turn their abusive partners over to a hostile prison industrial complex. This situation has been confusing and sometimes frustrating to those in the battered women’s movement. Similarly, restorative and transformative justice has not taken hold in the battered women’s movement, yet transformative justice uses the community to hold offenders responsible and tries to make the victim whole. <italic>The Revolution Begins at Home</italic> argues that transformative justice is the only means truly to serve our marginalized communities and ensure justice for both victims and offenders (although the words <italic>offender</italic> and <italic>victim</italic> are not used).</p>
<p>Transformative justice was often used in indigenous communities to hold members accountable. The stories in the <italic>Revolution Begins at Home</italic> show us how these practices can bring justice and accountability through compassion and without the intervention of the state. These interventions are done without shaming and with the whole community holding both the victim and the offender with care.</p>
<p>The book includes stories from victims of domestic violence and sexual assault and explains why the prison industrial complex was not an option for these victims. Many are women of color, transgender men and women, and queer people who could not be sure that they or their offenders would be treated justly if turned over to the prison industrial complex. Some turned to transformative justice practices in their communities to try to obtain justice. The stories of transformative justice are powerful and compelling. Unfortunately, none of the stories concluded with complete success as measured by the offender completing the process. For the victims, the process may have been healing, and they found support from their transformative justice teams.</p>
<p><italic>The Revolution Begins at Home</italic> holds out hope for justice for marginalized communities that are seeking to address the complexities of sexual and domestic violence. Although perhaps not perfect, alternatives to the prison industrial complex are described in detail, and we hear from the voices of survivors about these alternative processes. Given the failure of the prison industrial complex to protect the most marginalized among us and our desire for peace and justice, the book offers an intriguing option for our communities.</p>
<p>Social workers and feminists find themselves faced with the issues brought forward by the stories shared in this book. As we struggle to find ways to support the most marginalized communities, we must consider alternatives to justice that do not revictimize survivors of this violence or further add to the oppression and injustice that are experienced in our communities. The voices in this book are important for those of us in social work education to understand, as we train future generations of social workers to intervene in culturally appropriate and accessible ways. This book is an important contribution to feminist literature, social work, and the antiviolence movements.</p>
