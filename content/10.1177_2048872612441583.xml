<abstract>
<p>Chest trauma is a major health problem with a high mortality. Myocardial infarction secondary to coronary dissection following blunt chest trauma is a rare entity. We describe the case of an inferior MI following blunt chest trauma. A 61-year-old male without any relevant medical history was transported to a hospital after a low-velocity motorcycle accident. The patient was asymptomatic before the accident. The patient developed severe chest pain and an ECG revealed inferior ST segment elevation. After ruling out aortic dissection with angio-CT, a coronary angiograph depicted a proximal occlusion of the right coronary artery. After thrombectomy, a typical image of coronary artery dissection was observed; the image persisted after several runs of thrombectomy and for that reason a bare metal stent was implanted with a good final angiographic result. Five days after admission the patient was discharged home.</p>
<p>Cardiac contusion is not uncommon; however acute myocardial infarction is a rare complication of blunt chest trauma. Thorough evaluation with clinical suspicion can lead to optimal medical care.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Blunt chest trauma (BCT) is a major health problem causing nearly 25% of traumatic deaths. Myocardial infarction (MI) following BCT can be due to myocardial contusion or acute coronary syndrome. Coronary dissection with subsequent thrombosis appears to be the most frequent cause of coronary occlusion in such patients. We describe a case of an inferior MI following BCT.</p>

<title>Case report</title>
<p>A 61-year-old male with no significant medical history was transported to a hospital after a low-velocity motorcycle accident. The patient was asymptomatic before the accident but on arrival to the emergency department (ER) complained of chest pain. Vital signs were normal. Cardiac and lung auscultation were irrelevant and peripheral pulses were normal. Chest X-ray was normal; 12-lead ECG was performed and revealed ST-segment elevation in inferior leads with ST-segment depression in V2–V4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2048872612441583">Figure 1</xref>). An angio-CT was ordered to discount aortic dissection. To evaluate cardiac structures, transthoracic echocardiography revealed mild left-ventricle systolic dysfunction secondary to inferoposterior akinesia, without valvular involvement or ventricular wall damage; there was no sign of pericardial effusion. Two hours after the accident a coronary angiography revealed a total occlusion of the proximal right coronary artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2048872612441583">Figure 2A</xref>). On the coronary angiography after thrombectomy (Eliminate<sup>TM</sup> Aspiration Catheter, Terumo), a typical image of coronary artery dissection was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2048872612441583">Figure 2B</xref>). The image persisted after several runs of thrombectomy and for that reason a bare metal stent was implanted (Integrity 3.0 × 18 mm Medtronic<sup>TM</sup>, MN, USA) with good final angiographic result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2048872612441583">Figure 2C</xref>). Five days after admission the patient was discharged home without symptoms and double antiplatelet therapy prescribed for a year.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cardiac contusion following chest trauma is not uncommon; however, acute myocardial infarction is a rare complication of blunt chest trauma. MI following blunt chest trauma can be secondary to coronary artery dissection, aneurysm, intimal tear, subintimal hemorrhage, intraluminal thrombosis and spasm of the coronary artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2048872612441583">1</xref></sup> Another described mechanism of thrombosis is vessel rupture and external compression by epicardial haematoma, occlusive dissection of the artery or haemorrhage into a pre-existing atheromatous plaque. However, most patients are young and without traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Coronary artery dissection has not been described frequently because this condition is usually underdiagnosed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2048872612441583">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The left anterior descending artery (LAD) is the most commonly affected artery because of its anatomical relationship. This higher incidence may be related to its proximity to the chest wall. A relative weakness to acceleration/deceleration forces at the junction of the proximal and middle LAD could also explain the higher incidence of injuries to this vessel.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2048872612441583">3</xref></sup> The right coronary artery is the second most commonly affected artery; it is particularly vulnerable to blunt trauma because it runs anteriorly towards the sternum during systole and is affected by rapid deceleration with resultant disruption from its junction with the aortic root.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2048872612441583">4</xref></sup> Involvement of the left circumflex artery is uncommon.</p>
<p>Early identification represents a clinical challenge. Diagnosis can be difficult because chest pain may be interpreted as being secondary to chest contusion or overshadowed by concomitant injuries. Initial evaluation should be oriented to stabilisation according to standard protocols. Diagnosis of coronary dissection following chest trauma requires clinical suspicion and systematic evaluation. ECG should be performed in every patient with thoracic trauma because clinical manifestations may be misleading. Echocardiography is necessary in patients with haemodynamic compromise to rule out mechanical complications such as cardiac tamponade, wall ventricle rupture or valve regurgitation.</p>
<p>Therapies described in the review of the literature include percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), emergency bypass surgery and pharmacological treatment. We can conclude that PCI should be addressed in every selected case of chest pain with history of BCT with ECG abnormalities, once aortic and cardiac structural damage have been ruled out.</p>
