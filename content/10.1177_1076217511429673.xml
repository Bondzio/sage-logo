<p>The FBI Kids’ Page is split up into two sections designed for children and their parents to learn more about the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) through stories, games, and interactives. For students in kindergarten through fifth grade, there are sections that feature what the FBI is about, safety tips, and the different types of FBI dogs and what they are trained to do. For students in middle school and high school, they can learn about the history of the FBI, read about a day in the life of an FBI agent, learn how the FBI investigates, go on an FBI adventure, and take an agent challenge.</p>

<title>Do Early Achievers Lose Their Academic Advantage?</title>
<p>In the era of No Child Left Behind Act, the inclusion of a wider range of diversity within Advanced Placement programs, and limited grouping of students by ability, public schools have focused more on the kids at the bottom than at the top. A recent study reports that these “high flyers lose altitude” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1076217511429673">Xiang, Dahlin, Cronin, Theaker, &amp; Durant, 2011</xref>). Tracking the individual scores of nearly 82,000 students on the Measures of Academic Progress, analysts at the Northwest Evaluation Association found that only 57.3% of the students who scored in the top 10% scored as well by the time they were 8th graders and only 52.4% as well by the time they were 10th graders. Those students whose performance did drop below the 90th percentile did stay at the 70th percentile or higher. However, these early achievers grew at about the same rates as low and middle achievers in math and at slower rates than low and middle achievers in reading. What do the researchers view as the implications from this longitudinal study? First, because more than half of the academically advanced students did not maintain their performance levels, educators need to ensure that a child with potential is supported and that their upward performance trajectory is maintained. If not, their long-term education outcomes may be compromised (e.g., entry into gifted programs, selective colleges, higher merit aid). Those students who begin to achieve in the top 10%, “late bloomers,” indicate that educators should also be focusing on other students performing in the 70th and 90th percentiles. Second, because academically advanced students grew about half as fast as low-achieving elementary/middle school students, educators need to be concerned about the “leveling” of work. Third, high poverty schools have little relationship to academic growth of high-achieving students. Finally, students who enter school in the top 10% tend to stay within the top third. The authors conclude that if educators are serious about excellence then they should consider changing accountability systems to place emphasis on the growth of low-, middle-, and high-achieving students.</p>

<title>Powerful Ways of Expanding Learning Time</title>
<p>More time in school does not always guarantee improved learning outcomes. How can schools maximize the great potential of expanded time and make the most effective possible use of this important resource? The National Center on Time and Learning (NCTL) chose to address this question by identifying 30 schools nationwide with high concentrations of poverty that have used extended days, weeks, or years to improve student achievement. Using observations and discussions with schools over a 5-year period, the NCTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1076217511429673">Kaplan &amp; Chan, 2011</xref>) identified these eight powerful practices that improved achievement:</p>
<list id="list1-1076217511429673" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p><italic>Make every minute count</italic>. Lesson plans, pacing of instruction, meetings, schedules, and procedures eliminate wasted time.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Prioritize time according to focused learning goals</italic>. Teachers use data to plan lessons that are based on clear goals for each student. They set goals for student development that goes beyond academics—excellence in the arts, career readiness, and character education.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Individualize learning time and instruction based on student needs</italic>. The amount of time, content of the instruction, group size, and expertise of the instructor are tailored to the student.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Use time to build a school culture of high expectations and mutual accountability</italic>. The school builds a positive culture that emphasizes achievement, hard work, and self-discipline.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Use time to provide a well-rounded education</italic>. Schools provide a broad array of learning opportunities in the arts, foreign languages, hands-on science, business, community service, and leadership.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Use time to prepare students for college and career</italic>. This preparation starts as early as elementary school and assists secondary students in the college application and admission process.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Use time to continuously strengthen instruction</italic>. Teachers spend substantial amounts of time working with colleagues and instructional coaches who serve as mentors.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p><italic>Use time to relentlessly assess, analyze, and respond to student data</italic>. Assessment reshapes programs and schedules and continues until each and every child achieves mastery.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>They discovered four components that must work together for expanded-time schools to be successful: time for teachers to assess student understanding and to analyze and respond to data, time to teach and reinforce high expectations for behavior and achievement, time for a rigorous and well-rounded education that prepares students for success in college and careers, and time to coach and develop teachers and continuously strengthen instruction.

<title>College Graduation Crisis</title>
<p>In July 2010, the National Governors Association (NGA) adopted the Complete College American Common Completion Metrics to document the progress and success of postsecondary students across all states. In their report, “Time is the Enemy,” researchers at Complete College America (CCA) found that 75% of college students are part-time students and juggle some combination of families, jobs, and school while commuting to class. Only one quarter attend full-time, residential colleges and have most of their bills paid. Whereas more than 60% of full-time students graduate, no more than one quarter of part-time students do. CCA recommends that full- and part-time students need shorter and faster pathways to degrees and certificates, which might include some of these components:</p>
<list id="list2-1076217511429673" list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Using block schedules of courses so that students can continue to work</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Increasing the pace toward a degree or certificate by using shorter academic terms, less time off between terms, year-round scheduling</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Registering for a single, coherent program rather than each term</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Reducing class time by using online technology</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Forming peer support and learning networks among students in the same program</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Embedding remediation into the general college curriculum</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Providing better information about tuition, gradation rates, and job placement outcomes</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The CCA report includes data from 33 participating states regarding the percentage of students who graduate from 2-year and 4-year public colleges by ethnicity and degree.

<title>Is Single-Sex Schooling Effective?</title>
<p>Educators have argued for single-sex schooling as a way of improving girls’ and boys’ performance. In a recent study, however, researchers have reported that these studies have serious flaws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1076217511429673">Halpern et al., 2011</xref>). For example, previous studies do not account for academic differences in the students who enter them. When outcomes are corrected for preexisting differences, apparent advantages dissolve. Moreover, more transfers occur in single-sex schools than in their public school counterparts, which tend to inflate graduation rates. The authors add to their argument by citing research that shows few sex differences in children’s brains that relate to learning. The authors conclude that similar to new curricula, single-sex schools may yield a short-term gain because of their novelty but without experimental designs and consideration of selection factors, their effectiveness is still unknown. They also point out that the strongest argument against single-sex education is that it reduces boys’ and girls’ opportunities to work together in a supervised, purposeful environment and limits children’s development of a broader range of behaviors and attitudes.</p>

<title>Effective Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Afterschool Programs</title>
<p>With women and minorities underrepresented in the fields of STEM, improving access to STEM learning opportunities has become a critical issue. To close this opportunity gap, a recent newsbrief from the Afterschool Alliance describes promising programs that have reported improved attitudes toward STEM fields and careers, increased STEM knowledge and skills, and higher likelihood of graduation and pursuing a STEM career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1076217511429673">Afterschool Alliance, 2011</xref>). To improve attitudes, programs provided youth with engaging curriculum that sparked their curiosity, promoted teamwork that incorporated problem solving, and developed mentoring relationships with STEM professionals, which increased the youth’s interest and confidence. To increase STEM knowledge and skills, the afterschool programs taught and strengthened 21st-century skills, had students explore careers, and identified role models who might provide guidance. To improve graduation rates, the programs incorporated team problem solving, mentors, and competitions. While more studies are needed, the authors conclude that afterschool programs are making a difference and increase opportunities for groups underrepresented in STEM fields.</p>

<title>Digital Tools to Enhance Learning</title>
<p>A special report on K-12 educational technology in <italic>Education Week</italic> focused on how digital tools are connecting teacher and learning (<italic>Education Week</italic>, 2011). They described ways that technology might be used in science, math, language arts, history, art, and music. In science, students are able to participate in virtual labs, develop three-dimensional computer models, and adjust variables to get different results using a computer simulation model. In math, students can access tutorial videos on a variety of math concepts, use web-based tools to construct and examine the relationships in geometric shapes and other math concepts, draw and manipulate shapes and graphs, and use virtual manipulative diagrams. In language arts, students use wikis to develop digital anthologies; develop digital essays that incorporate images, audio, and video; create websites about different authors; develop digital stories; connect to writers in other classrooms; and distribute and publish student work through the Internet. In history, students are able to connect with people outside the classroom via Skype, collect personal histories, simulate historical events, and predict future changes. In art and music, students use digital tablets in design and computer programs to compose music. In these core subjects, multimedia tools are transforming teaching and learning.</p>
