<p>The College of Psychiatric and Neurologic Pharmacists (CPNP) is a professional organization representing more than 1000 specialist pharmacists practicing in the United States, Canada, and several other countries (cpnp.org). Now in its 15th year, CPNP’s mission is to promote excellence in pharmacy practice, education, and research to optimize treatment outcomes of individuals affected by psychiatric and neurologic disorders.</p>
<p>Most CPNP members have advanced training or certification, in psychiatric, neurologic, geriatric, pediatric, or other specialties. Members are active in a variety of health care, academic, and research settings. They directly contribute to the education and training of future pharmacists, manage health care systems, provide patient care, disseminate drug information, research, and advocate on behalf of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. </p>
<p>As a leader in providing education for psychiatric pharmacy specialists, the CPNP Annual Meeting attracts 450 to 500 pharmacists and other health care providers, providing a venue for education and the active exchange of scientific and practice ideas. Abstracts submitted for presentation at the Annual Meeting undergo a rigorous, standardized peer review by a committee of scientific reviewers and must meet specific criteria for acceptance. Accepted abstracts include scientific abstracts of original research, innovative practice models, therapeutic case report management, and works in progress. </p>
<p>The CPNP and the <italic>Journal of Pharmacy Practice</italic> share a common goal to disseminate information that will contribute to the advancement of pharmacy practice and improve patient care outcomes. Therefore, we are pleased to partner with the <italic>Journal of Pharmacy Practice</italic> to bring you the scientific abstracts presented at CPNP’s 15th Annual Meeting in Tampa, Florida, April 29-May 2, 2012.</p>
