<abstract>
<p>Tumoral calcinosis occurs as a well-defined pathologic entity in 3 heterologous groups of diseases—hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis, normophosphatemic tumoral calcinosis, and secondary tumoral calcinosis. The histological lesion is stereotypic developing from the concurrence of a juxta-articular injury with an elevated calcium–phosphorus product. The reparative response to injury is histiocytic featuring synovial metaplasia forming bursa-like structures that create the characteristic compartmentalization of the lesion. Histiocytic-derived osteoclastogenesis occurs as a response to the calcifying process initiated in the mitochondria of necrotic histiocytes forming the bursa-like structures. These calcifications, propelled by a gamut of conditions elevating serum phosphorus, facilitate the further nucleation of hydroxyapatite in mitochondria, matrical lipidic debris located in the cytoplasm and lysosomes of osteoclasts and in the locular contents, and on collagen and other extracellular matrix materials. The lesions enlarge because of new locule formation and failure to reduce the calcified burden by the compartment lining histiocytes and dysmorphic osteoclasts that are unable to solubilize the hydroxyapatite. The histological landmarks of tumoral calcinosis may be lost when its development becomes quiescent. The classic calcifying classifications are inadequate for tumoral calcinosis requiring creation of a new category for this entity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The term <italic>tumoral calcinosis</italic> (TC) was coined by Inclan et al in 1943<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896912444925">1</xref></sup> for a disease encountered in 3 adolescent black patients with normal serum calcium and phosphate levels who developed large juxta-articular lobular calcified masses without visceral or skin calcifications. His coauthor pathologists (Drs Leon and Camejo) described the essential pathologic features of this entity, multiple cysts filled with calcified deposits lined by histiocytes, giant cells, and xanthomatous histiocytes. This entity was initially reported by Duret in 1899,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896912444925">2</xref></sup> and later in 1935, Teutschlander described it as lipocalcinogranulomatosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896912444925">3</xref></sup> It was soon appreciated that many patients were of African descent, their disease familial, and that their lesions, developing in the first 2 decades of life, were often multiple, tended to recur, and were associated with hyperphosphatemia. The latter was because of reduced urinary phosphate excretion caused by recessive mutations in GALNT3 and KLOTHO that caused the inactivation of FGF23, a phosphoturic hormone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896912444925">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912444925"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912444925"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896912444925">7</xref></sup> However, other patients with TC lesions did not have a familial history; some were non-blacks, and in this group, elevated serum phosphorus levels or other abnormalities of mineral homeostasis were not evident. Moreover, their TC lesions usually were solitary, occurred in the first 2 decades of life, and occasionally first presented in adults. Other entities such as chronic renal failure with secondary hyperparathyroidism, milk-alkali syndrome, hypervitaminosis D, and massive osteolysis also developed large periarticular calcified masses with similar histological findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896912444925">8</xref></sup> Further perplexity was created by the liberal and imprecise usage by some clinicians and radiologists of TC as a descriptive diagnosis for any massive collection of periarticular calcifications regardless of its etiology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896912444925">9</xref></sup> Since TC is both the name of the disease and its pathologic lesion, this practice led to the mistaken notion that there were different histological types of TC. Smack et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896912444925">10</xref></sup> classified the above-mentioned first 3 presentations of TC into hyperphosphatemic familial TC, normophosphatemic TC, and secondary TC. The histology of the TC lesions in these 3 groups is identical—the prototypic lesion represented by those encountered in familial TC. How these 3 heterologous states share an identical histology has not been resolved. The pathogenesis of TC remains obscure. This uncertainty is mirrored by ambiguities over the definition and sites of the calcifying processes, features made more confusing by the inclusion of other calcifying diseases into the TC classification and the type and role of the giant cells participating in this lesion. This article, representing a follow-up of a previous article concerning TC by the senior author and coworkers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912444925">11</xref></sup> will attempt to define its pathogenesis and resolve these uncertainties. This will be accomplished by correlating the biochemical and morphologic events reported in the calcifying process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896912444925">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912444925">13</xref></sup> and osteoclastogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896912444925">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896912444925"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896912444925">16</xref></sup> with an analysis of the histological and ultrastructural changes found in 2 new and 7 previously reported cases of TC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1066896912444925" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Methods and Materials</title>
<p>This study was based on 2 cases of TC from Legacy Emanuel Hospital and 53 resected specimens from 7 patients with TC previously reported from the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912444925">11</xref></sup> There were 11 blocks from the 2 new cases and 28 slides from UTMB selected by the senior author because of their content. All slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Movat’s pentochrome and Von Kossa calcium stains were used on selected slides. Two types of tissue were used for ultrastructural studies. Fresh tissue taken at UTMB was fixed, prepared, and examined as previously reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912444925">11</xref></sup> Areas from the 2 new cases, selected from paraffin blocks were deparaffinized, rehydrated, fixed in 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> in 0.1 cocodylate buffer, rinsed with water, stained en bloc with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate, dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded into Poly-Bed 812 resin (Polysciences, Inc, Warrington, PA). Ultrathin sections were cut on Leica Ultracut S (Leica, Bannockburn, IL), stained with 0.4% lead citrate, and examined in a FEI CM 100 transmission electron microscope at 60 kV.</p>
<p>Immunohistochemistry was performed on a Ventura Benchmark XT. Immunoperoxidase was used to stain prediluted polyclonal antibodies against α-1 antichymotrypsin, CD68, and lysozyme obtained from the Ventura medical system. Staining was performed on formalin-fixed tissue with appropriate controls.</p>

<title>Case Histories</title>
<sec id="section4-1066896912444925">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>This 18-day-old white male infant developed a subcutaneous “abscess” anterior to the superior sternum that extended close to the periosteum of this bone. It was excised, drained, and treated with antibiotics. Cultures for microorganisms were sterile. The lesion healed uneventfully leaving a flat scar. Three months later, it recurred presenting as a raised erythematous focally calcified nodule. Radiological studies showed several calcifications in the subcutaneous tissue and overlying skin. The surgeon noted that the lesion was multilocular and contained pockets of pasty-white material. It was widely excised. Cultures were sterile. The pathological diagnosis was TC. Serum phosphorus and vitamin D levels were not requested. The patient returned to his primary care pediatrician and was followed for more than a dozen years without developing similar new lesions. There was no familial history of similar lesions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1066896912444925">
<title>Case 2</title>
<p>The patient is a 6-year-old Mexican American who presented with a painful “bump” over the posterior lateral aspect of the right elbow first identified about 2 months before surgery. It was unrelated to recognizable trauma. The overlying skin was intact. No other joints were similarly involved. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a heterogeneous extra-articular and extra-osseous mass on the lateral aspect of the elbow. The e<italic>rythrocyte sedimentation rate</italic> was 37, the <italic>C-reactive protein</italic> 20.7, rheumatoid factor and blood work-up were unremarkable, and the antinuclear antibody was negative. At surgery, a mass measuring 2.5 × 5 × 2 cm located in the lateral triceps fascia was excised with a surrounding 2 mm margin. The lesion healed well, and after 14 months, no recurrences had occurred. Following the pathological diagnosis of TC, serum phosphorus and vitamin D levels were evaluated. These showed hyperphosphatemia (8.4 mg/dL; reference range = 3.3-5.6 mg/dL) and elevated 1-25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels (78 pg/mL; reference range = 15-75 pg/mL). Two siblings and the parents of the patient were questioned and examined. None gave a history of similar lesions.</p>

<sec id="section8-1066896912444925">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>The specimen consists of an irregular section of skin and subcutaneous tissue measuring 3 × 2 × 2 cm. The skin exhibited a 4-mm zone of ulcerated and calcified yellow-white polypoid lesions. The dermis and subcutaneous tissue showed scattered cystic lesions containing soft white pasty material.</p>

<title>Histological</title>
<p>Rather than repeating the pathology of TC in a static fashion, the following will describe how the lesions form and evolve. This dynamic interpretation is possible because of the asynchronous growth and maturation of TC lesions features that permit formulation of a 3-stage developmental sequence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912444925">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Stage 1 lesions consist of nodular and linear clusters of foamy histiocytes, frequently aggregated around small blood vessels. These cells, located in tendon or fascia, often extend in a finger-like fashion into adjacent tendon, fascia, muscle, and skin. The histiocytic aggregates undergo sheet-like granular necrosis with accompanying degenerative alterations in collagen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912444925">Figure 1A</xref>). This creates cavities—locules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912444925">Figure 1B</xref>) with a lining resembling synovial intima (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912444925">Figure 1C</xref>) composed mainly of lipid depleted histiocytes. Bordering this lining are residual foamy histiocytes and scattered lymphocytes, and transitions of the lipid-laden histiocytes to osteoclasts are evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896912444925">Figure 2</xref>). Stage 2 is the calcifying phase. The disintegrating histiocytes in the newly formed locules exhibit membrane-bound punctuate cytoplasmic calcifications, whereas admixed giant cells exhibit larger plate-like calcifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1066896912444925">Figure 3</xref>). A calcifying front forms at the border of the surviving locular lining cells and the locular calcifications. It consists of Von Kossa positive sand-like and larger plate-like calcifications distributed in and bordering around viable and disintegrating lining cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1066896912444925">Figure 4</xref>). These calcifications coalesce centrally to form larger spherules or agate-like calculi.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912444925">11</xref></sup> Some giant cells bordering the calcifying front are dome or half-moon shaped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1066896912444925">Figure 5A</xref>), whereas others are more elongated, vase shaped, and arranged perpendicular to the locules with their nuclei positioned opposite the locular contents and the vase mouth abutting the locular calcifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1066896912444925">Figure 5B</xref>). Distributed in the cytoplasm of some osteoclasts are varying-sized vacuoles containing clear contents, cellular debris, or calcifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1066896912444925">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1066896912444925">5B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1066896912444925">5C</xref>). These vacuoles tend to localize opposite their multiply grouped nuclei creating a jack-o’-lantern image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1066896912444925">Figure 5C</xref>). Incomplete fusions of bordering vesicles with large vacuoles bequeath membranous spurs to some large vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1066896912444925">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1066896912444925">5C</xref>). Aggregates of histiocytes clustered adjacent to or at a distance from the formed locules undergo disintegration with calcifications to form new compartments. In this manner, multiple chambers, some compressed into others by their calcified contents, develop into a mass lesion encircled by fibrous tissue. Many septa supporting the locules are collagen depleted and vascular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1066896912444925">Figure 6</xref>), with some exhibiting hemorrhagic foci. Stage 3 is characterized by disruption and fibrosis of the locular septa, disappearance of locular lining cells, and coalescence of the calcified locular contents into larger calcified masses that may exhibit osseous metaplasia in and around the calcified masses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1066896912444925">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1066896912444925">B</xref>). In skin, these mass lesions erode the epidermis causing ulcerations and draining sinuses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1066896912444925">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>

<p>Alpha-1 antichymotrypsin appears in foamy histiocytes as punctuate cytoplasmic droplets, whereas the cytoplasm of the nonfoamy histiocytes stains diffusely with this antibody. In osteoclasts, the antibody principally outlines the large cytoplasmic vacuoles, their spurs, and the inc luded HA contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1066896912444925">Figure 8</xref>). The antibody also coats the smaller locular calcifications. CD68 diffusely stains the cytoplasm of histiocytes and giant cells but did not stain their vacuolar contents. Lysozyme was absent in the mononuclear cells lining the locules but was detected in histiocytes peripherally located. Osteoclasts faintly stained with this antibody.</p>

<title>Histiocytes</title>
<p>The disintegrating histiocytes forming the locules and located at the calcifying front exhibited cytoplasmic vacuoles enclosing amorphous and crystalline HA of varying densities.

<p>HA appears in 3 different cytoplasmic locations: (<italic>a</italic>) fixed to membranous and amorphous organelle residues in areas of segmental (Figure 15 of Reference 11) or circumscribed cytoplasmic disintegration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1066896912444925">Figure 9</xref>), (<italic>b</italic>) nucleated in the mitochondrial matrix in viable cytoplasm adjacent to areas of cytoplasmic disintegration (Figure 15 of Reference 11), and (<italic>c</italic>) distributed within large cytoplasmic vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1066896912444925">Figure 10</xref>). The HA is highly organized in some vacuoles forming laminated calcospherites composed of rings of densely and lightly distributed HA crystals (Figure 16 in Reference 11); the HA in less dense crystalline deposits is dispersed in and fixed to membranous fragments and moderately electron-dense amorphous material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1066896912444925">Figure 11</xref>). Adjoining the vacuoles are smaller vesicles that generate the membranous fragments by opening into the large vacuoles through a process of fusion and partial loss of the membranous envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1066896912444925">Figure 10</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A variety of conditions can cause identical pathologic lesions because the repertory of pathologic responses to various injuries is more limited than the conditions causing them. Granulomas and complex lesions such as cystic medial necrosis of the aorta are examples of lesions having multiple etiologies. TC falls into this category representing a stereotypic lesion created rather uniquely by 2 concurrently occurring conditions—a juxta-articular or peri-osseous injury coupled with a metabolic abnormality—an elevated calcium phosphate product. The following explains how and why these 2 conditions create the TC lesion.</p>
<sec id="section19-1066896912444925">
<title>The Reparative Response</title>
<p>Trauma apparently incites the development of the TC lesion since reports of injury preceding the development of a TC are frequent, especially in primary normophosphatemic TC,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896912444925">10</xref></sup> and chronic pressure events, such as sleeping on hard surfaces, are suspect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066896912444925">17</xref></sup> The frequent finding of hemosiderin pigment near or in TC lesions supports this hypothesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066896912444925">18</xref></sup> and suggests that unrecognized or repetitive mild traumatic events can also trigger the reparative response causing TC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912444925">11</xref></sup> This response is a stepwise process principally developing in juxta-articular tendon, fascia, muscle, and skin. Its first manifestation is the aggregation of histiocytes with foamy contents derived from the phagocytosis of lipid debris putatively originating from released blood products, necrotic fat, or other injured tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066896912444925">19</xref></sup> A secondary response, initiated to cushion traumatized areas from joint movement and frictional force generated by adjacent periarticular bony prominences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912444925">11</xref></sup> or osteophytes and bone fragments,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066896912444925">20</xref></sup> is set into motion by the necrosis of the histiocytic aggregates cavated to form the compartments that are a significant diagnostic feature of the TC lesion. Despite its diffuse nature, the histiocytic granular degeneration may be apoptotic since it is not accompanied by inflammation, is associated with dilated cytoplasmic vacuoles in histiocytes putatively representing injured mitochondria filled with watery fluid (intrinsic apoptotic pathway,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066896912444925">21</xref></sup>) and the degenerative change has a physiological purpose—the attempted creation of adventitious bursa. Hyperphosphatemia can cause apoptosis in cultured chondroblasts and osteoblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066896912444925">22</xref></sup> The formed compartments have a synovial-like lining. Synovial epithelial cells are derived from histiocytes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066896912444925">23</xref></sup> and ultrastructurally, the mononuclear cells lining the locules exhibit prominent cell processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066896912444925">24</xref></sup> representing a ruffled border or filopodia—a feature typifying synovial intimal cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066896912444925">25</xref></sup> The notion that the formed chambers represent bursa-like structures is justifiable since adventitious bursa formation is a stereotypic response to chronic irritation occurring adjacent to joints and bone. There are articles proposing the genesis of TC lesions from synovial membranes and bursa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066896912444925">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066896912444925">27</xref></sup> A report of synovial metaplasia in skin following trauma supports the notion that bursa may develop in this organ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066896912444925">23</xref></sup> Released by the degenerated histiocytes are proteolytic enzymes that together with those discharged by the osteoclasts (see below) cause the collagenolysis that deprives the forming “bursa” of their fibrous component.</p>
<p>Ameliorating bursa function is lost with the filling of locules with HA released from vacuoles in disintegrating histiocytes. This inaugurates the third reparative response—the production and mobilization of giant cells to handle the newly formed HA deposits. There has been controversy about the type of giant cell found in TC. Lafferty et al identified the giant cells as osteoclasts in 1965,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066896912444925">24</xref></sup> but this has not been totally accepted. Early reports and more recent descriptions still regard them as a foreign-body type.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1066896912444925">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066896912444925"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066896912444925"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1066896912444925">31</xref></sup> The inclusion of calcifying entities masquerading as TC that do have bordering foreign-body giant cells may have contributed to this confusion. Other authors have called the giant cells osteoclast like.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066896912444925">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1066896912444925">32</xref></sup> Only polarized (activated) osteoclasts—that is, cells forming new membrane domains—best exhibit the classic morphologic features of osteoclasts—that is, the dome-shaped giant cell with a ruffled border and a sealing zone. Under physiological conditions this only happens after the osteoclast has migrated to a bone resorption site. We suspect that the osteoclast-like giant cells—the majority of giant cells found in TC—represent dysmorphic osteoclasts since they exhibit many of the morphologic characteristics of this cell type—a dome-shape, ruffled borders, abundant cytoplasmic vacuolization, and multinucleation. However, they are incompletely formed since they lack a sealing zone because of an absence of bone in stage 2 TC lesions. These osteoclasts, like physiological osteoclasts, originate from histiocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896912444925">14</xref></sup> The suspected trigger for the TC-induced osteoclastogenesis are the T lymphocytes sprinkled in the TC lesions that putatively produce RANKL, an osteoclast-differentiating factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896912444925">14</xref></sup> Osteoclasts teleologically are the ideal cells to handle the surfeit of HA formed in TC since they have the ability to both phagocytose and dissolve HA crystals. Under physiological conditions, HA is dissolved from bone under the ruffled border in an extracellular microenvironment by an acidic mechanism using an electrogenic proton pump via vacuolar adenosine triphosphatase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896912444925">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066896912444925"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896912444925">16</xref></sup> A matrix attachment to bone containing actin isolates this microenvironment. This process is dysfunctional in TC since there is no bone for either osteoclast attachment or formation of a sealing zone. In TC, the ruffled membrane forms randomly, its microenvironment is not isolated, and released h<italic>ydrochloric acid</italic> is neutralized by the alkaline locular content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066896912444925">24</xref></sup> Therefore, there is probably limited extracellular solubility of HA. Direct phagocytosis of HA represents the principal method of disposing of the locular contents. However, this fails to reduce the locular calcifying load because the HA in the phagolysomes cannot be dissolved by acidic lysosomal enzymes since many crystals become coated with α-1 antichymotrypsin (see below). The disintegrating osteoclasts therefore recycled their intact intracellular HA back into the locules, thereby contributing to the continued growth of the TC lesion.</p>

<title>The Calcifying Process</title>
<p>Initiating this process is the elevated calcium phosphorus product—hyperphosphatemia being the most important component of this equation. Inactivating genetic mutations that alter FGF23, the phosphoturic protein, and chronic renal failure with secondary hyperparathyroidism most commonly cause this condition. How do cases of nonfamilial TC fit this hypothesis? The solitary lesions in this group suggest that elevations in phosphorus may be locally induced and short-lived. Extensive tissue trauma causes hyperphosphatemia, the injured cells releasing phosphate into the extracellar space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066896912444925">22</xref></sup> Traumatic injury, very commonly reported in normophosphatemic TC,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896912444925">10</xref></sup> could cause local extracellular phosphate elevation especially if it involves muscle since this tissue stores the bulk of soft tissue phosphates. Cow’s milk or formula fed to infants, released growth hormone in adolescents and medications, or usage of laxatives and enemas in adults produce episodic hyperphosphatemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066896912444925">22</xref></sup> Transient elevations in phosphates, caused by one or more of the above conditions, putatively induce the calcifying process component in normophosphatemic TC.</p>
<p>The initial calcifying event apparently occurs in the cytoplasmic vacuoles (mitochondria) of the disintegrating histiocytes forming the locules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066896912444925">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066896912444925"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066896912444925"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066896912444925"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066896912444925"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066896912444925">24</xref></sup> The discharged HA not only vitiates bursa function and stimulate osteoclastogenesis but also promotes HA deposition from metastable phosphorus and calcium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896912444925">12</xref></sup> The HA nucleates on intracellular granular and membranous debris in osteoclasts and on cell membranes and membranous debris at the calcifying front and in the locules. These structures, rich in lipoproteins, serve as surrogate matrix vesicles. The latter, not identified in our material, represents 1 component of matrical lipidic debris—cellular detritus and membranous fragments that can initiate a calcifying process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912444925">13</xref></sup> A novel example occurs in large cytoplasmic vacuoles on membranous remnants originating from incomplete fusions with adjacent vesicles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912444925">11</xref></sup> Some vesicles contain α-1 antichymotrypsin, and with fusion, this is introduced into the larger vacuoles. Since similar vacuoles contain other types of debris, it is likely that they represent phagolysosomes. The introduced antiprotease protects the membranous remnants from proteolytic digestion and alters the acidic lysosomal pH to promote HA nucleation and prevent the dissolution of the formed calcifications. This process, like malakoplakia, represents a calcifying process developing within a lysosome.</p>
<p>Mitochondrial calcification also occurs in TC appearing both as needle-shaped HA within their matrix and as enlarged matrical mitochondrial granules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912444925">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066896912444925">19</xref></sup> Finally, HA nucleates extracellularly on collagen fibers and in the interfibrillary matrix between the fibers and in the interstices of the small blood vessels.</p>
<p>Beside its participation in the calcifying process, the osteoclast contributes to the formation of the TC lesion by expelling cytoplasmic bicarbonate into the locular contents where it combines with calcium and HA to contribute to the generation of the locular alkaline milky contents. Cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase II makes the bicarbonate while producing protons for the proton pump.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896912444925">16</xref></sup> The osteoclast also releases proteolytic enzymes used to degrade organic bone matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066896912444925">16</xref></sup> These contribute to the collagen depletion of the locular septa exposing the unprotected septal blood vessels to traumatic injury from the locular calcifications. The vulnerability of these vessels, underscored by surrounding replicated basal lamina,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912444925">11</xref></sup> cause septal hemorrhages that provides stimuli for the perpetuation or initiation of new TC lesions.</p>
<p>The variety of calcifying events in TC renders the classic concepts of metastatic and dystrophic inadequate for this disease. Only intramitochondrial calcification qualifies as metastastic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912444925">13</xref></sup> To shoehorn TC into the dystrophic category is nonsensical since TC lesions are cellular, vascular, and enlarge hardly features of dead or dying tissues. TC also does not fit into the HA deposition disease category since the HA in TC crystallizes principally in the reparative histiocytic response rather than nucleating directly on injured tendon or cartilage. An idiopathic category is not applicable since events precipitating this disease and the sites of calcifications are known. Ghadially has introduced a calcifying classification based on ultrastructural calcification sites,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912444925">13</xref></sup> but this also may not be totally applicable since several of his listed sites are involved (matrical lipidic debris, mitochondria, lysosomes, and collagen). TC, therefore, appears as an outlier in calcifying classifications requiring its own separate calcifying category.</p>
<p>Our first case is an example of TC occurring in early infancy, an uncommon presentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1066896912444925">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1066896912444925">34</xref></sup> TC at this age may develop in more than one site but excision is curative. This case is the first to present suprasternally and to recur soon after the initial extirpation, but like other reported infant cases, no new lesions developed after the initial surgeries. Associated with infant TC are normal or slightly elevated phosphate levels that return to normal with aging, a finding best explainable by consumption of high phosphate milk or formula diets.</p>

<title>Diagnostic Considerations</title>
<p>The generic usage of the term <italic>TC</italic> for all large calcifying juxta-articular masses has a histological analog. All these lesions are morphologically similar, exhibiting histiocytes and giant cells aggregated around calcifications. TC, however, exhibits several clear-cut morphologic differences that separate it from other calcifying entities, thereby establishing histology as the gold standard for the diagnosis of TC. Its calcifications are initiated in histiocytic aggregates rather than developing directly in soft tissues or cartilage. The TC lesion characteristically forms compartments that not only contain calcifications but also liquid milky chalky contents. The giant cells in TC are dysmorphic osteoclasts. Those classically configured are half-moon or vase shaped. Many show varying-sized cytoplasmic vacuoles: some fusing, leaving membranous spurs; others distributed in a jack-o’-lantern pattern; and importantly, many containing varying-sized calcifications. The lining cells at the calcifying front are not reacting to the calcifications but are active participants in the calcifying process exhibiting cytoplasmic and membranous calcifications associated with degenerative changes. As the lesion matures, the above morphological hallmarks may vanish, although the compartmentalized nature of the lesion frequently persists and is a valuable clue in distinguishing stage 3 lesions from other calcifying lesions. This distinction may be aided by an appropriate history, genetic analysis, elevated serum phosphorus, and radiological findings. The histologic diagnosis of TC should be accompanied with the caveat that this pathology occurs in 3 different etiologic settings each having its own clinical implications and prognosis.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The TC lesion is created by the concurrence of 2 events: (<italic>a</italic>) trauma that initiates a multistepped reaction to injury in juxta-articular soft tissues and skin and (<italic>b</italic>) a multifactorial elevation of the serum calcium–phosphate product principally caused by hyperphosphatemia. The pathologic lesion is specific, exhibiting features distinguishable from other calcifying entities but is stereotypic explaining its occurrence in 3 different clinical settings. This response is inaugurated by histiocytes and their derivatives—synovial intimal cells and dysmorphic osteoclasts. The histiocytes aggregate, phagocytize lipid, undergo necrosis both to form locules with bursa-like features and osteoclastogenesis to handle the excessive HA formed in a concurrent complex calcifying process. The initial calcifications occur in the mitochondria of the compartment-forming necrotic histiocytes—a change that facilitates the further nucleation of HA onto mitochondria, intracellular and extracellular matrical lipidic debris, and collagen. The mononuclear cells and giant cells lining the locules are active participants in the calcifying process rather than a reaction to the deposited calcium. The giant cells exhibit many morphologic features of osteoclasts, but in the absence of bone and the formation of a sealing zone, they are imperfectly formed and so are considered dysmorphic. With the loss of locular lining cells, many of the diagnostic landmarks vanish; the lesion undergoes fibrosis with ossification and histologically becomes nonspecific, resembling other calcifying entities. The multiple sites of HA deposition in TC exceeds those described in existing calcifying classifications, thereby requiring an additional category for this disorder.</p>
