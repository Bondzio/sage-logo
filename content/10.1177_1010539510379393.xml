<abstract>
<p>South Korean national university dental hospitals (NUDHs) face unprecedented challenges in maintaining primary function as public hospitals and surviving in intensified competition. The aim of the study was to evaluate the perceived service quality of NUDH patients and its influences on behavior and to gain managerial implications. Perceived service quality, value, satisfaction, and behavioral intention were measured in 438 NUDH patients from 3 NUDHs. With demographic analyses, the authors used structural equation models to test the validity to prove the relationship between dimensions. Results showed that the dimension of dentist concern directly influenced satisfaction and behavior, and tangibles was the only significant antecedent factor of value that had a significant positive effect on satisfaction. Based on demographic characteristics, highly educated, self-motivated patients who underwent multiple treatments had lower perceptions of value and satisfaction. NUDHs need to maintain their public image and to improve the dimensions of communication and tangibles to gain competitiveness.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The role of dental care is unlike that of other medical fields in the public health care system in a number of aspects. For example, most medical situations are unpostponable, unpredictable, and unbudgetable and have the characteristics of insurable risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1010539510379393">1</xref></sup> However, oral diseases have few of these characteristics. When oral disease does require treatment, the patient has considerable control over when treatment expenses are incurred, the nature of the treatment provided, and the associated costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1010539510379393">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In South Korea, the public dental care system is operated mainly through public health centers and national university dental hospitals (NUDHs). Although public health centers provide dental services for low-income patients, NUDHs offer high-skill dental services and treat patients who are referred from local clinics. As in the statement of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, one of the missions of NUDHs is to play a leading role in the development of national policies on public oral health and sanitation and to serve medically underprivileged people in ways that foster and maintain public confidence. NUDHs act as forerunners in the progress and development of dentistry (research) and as the preeminent centers for nurturing responsible specialists with top quality expertise (education).</p>
<p>Unlike those in other countries, the dental health care delivery system in South Korea allows patients wide latitude in choosing dental specialists. No mandatory referral is required for patients who want to visit a dental specialist, and all patients have easy access to NUDHs. In addition, because the national health care insurance system includes dental health care, national health policy facilitates patient visits to NUDHs. However, although accessibility and low costs have allowed more people to benefit from highly skilled treatment and have additionally enlightened the public about the characteristics of NUDHs, they have also resulted in a heavy load on service providers in NUDHs and several concomitant bad practices, including clinician authoritarianism and rude behavior from service providers that is also evident in the mannerisms of the board of directors.</p>
<p>Recently, South Korean NUDHs have faced a new situation resulting from the development of service concepts and unprecedented competition in the dental care industry. South Korean patients no longer consider dental health care service to be a specialty service. Instead, they recognize it as a shopping service, like that provided by a hair salon. They attempt to obtain information about dental care service through media such as the Internet and seek the best values in dental care by shopping around. A specialty service is distinguished from a shopping service on the basis of purchase effort.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1010539510379393">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1010539510379393">4</xref></sup> This means that patients are not willing to expend a significantly greater effort for dental care services and that dental practitioners inevitably face the advent of patient-oriented dental service and have to adopt marketing principles in dental service. Since the new millennium began, South Korean local dental clinics have been very competitive in terms of cost, patient comfort, and advertising. To provide a one-stop service with multiple specialties, it is not an unusual phenomenon for several local clinics to unite and share services. This practice has narrowed the technical gap between private clinics and NUDHs. Such improvements in patient-oriented care and in technology at local clinics threaten the status of NUDHs in South Korea.</p>
<p>As public hospitals under governmental control, NUDHs cannot advertise either commercially or noncommercially, whereas private clinics are relatively free to advertise through a variety of media. In addition, since 2004, the South Korean government has begun to incorporate NUDHs all over the country as part of a reformation plan and has cut the budget of NUDHs. As a result, NUDHs are being forced to attain 2 incompatible objectives: maintaining public roles and achieving self-sufficiency simultaneously. Because of this, South Korean NUDHs promptly attempted to change their business ethics to adapt to the new competitive environment through service reform plans and the application of a patient-oriented business strategy. However, there have not been comprehensive evaluations of this transformation, in terms of service quality, value, patient satisfaction, and behavioral intentions, over the past 5 years. The major aim of this study is to address critical issues such as how NUDH patients perceive service quality and how this perception influences their behavior.</p>
<p>To proceed with this study, we conceptualized each dimension as follows. Because it was known that quality evaluations from the perspective of customers are subjective, not objective,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510379393">5</xref></sup> the perceived service quality was evaluated by patients, not dental service providers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1010539510379393">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1010539510379393">7</xref></sup> Additionally, in this study, patient satisfaction refers to positive evaluations of distinct dimensions of dental health care services and patient satisfaction and dissatisfaction have impacts on the success of dental practices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1010539510379393">8</xref></sup> We hypothesized that South Korean NUDH patientsâ perceived service quality influences their satisfaction because having a satisfactory service experience may lead customers to modify their attitudes toward a provider in the long run.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1010539510379393">9</xref></sup> In this study, values refer to the customersâ overall assessments of the utility of a product based on perception of what is received. It is a more individual, personal, and higher-level concept than quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510379393">5</xref></sup> Finally, as Westaby<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1010539510379393">10</xref></sup> suggested, behavioral intentions refer to the subjective probabilities that a patient will engage in a specified behavior. Following our evaluation, we defined behavioral intentions as a signal that shows whether a patient will continue to utilize a NUDHâs services or choose to use a different clinic. We assumed that when patients have positive experiences, they are much more likely to return to NUDHs in the future. Based on the above conceptualizations, 6 hypotheses were conceptualized and are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1010539510379393">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1010539510379393">
<title>Sample and Procedures</title>
<p>A total f 483 patients from 3 South Korean NUDHs (SNUDH, PNUDH, and CNUDH) were randomly chosen in the spring and early summer of 2009. Each NUDH is located in a different province in South Korea and is the biggest dental hospital in its respective community. The survey was distributed in hospital lobbies. All participants had previously visited other local dental clinics before they visited the NUDHs, or they were referred from a local dental clinic. Participation was voluntary, and 96.6% of the volunteers completed the survey. Five trained interviewers collected the data for this study. Of the 500 questionnaires distributed, 483 questionnaires were returned. Because of missing data or incomplete responses, 45 questionnaires were excluded. Therefore, we analyzed data from 438 surveys.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1010539510379393">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>We used patient gender (male or female), age (20-29 years, 30-39 years, 40-49 years, 50-59 years, or 60 years or older), multiplicity of treatment (single treatment or multiple treatments), motivation for the visit (self-motivated or referred from a local clinic), insurance coverage of treatment (yes or no), and academic background as basic demographic information (completed high school, some college/university, or completed university degree).</p>
<p>To measure perceived service quality, we used previously validated measurements in a South Korean medical hospital<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510379393">11</xref></sup> under the assumption that scales developed to consider Asian culture may be more suitable for this study. According to the authors, the survey was originally devised to generate insights into how South Korean health care users viewed the health care services they were receiving and the aspects of the health care services that they felt were most important and/or that they wanted according to their own experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510379393">11</xref></sup> The survey included items that addressed the constructs included in the proposed model. These constructs were perceived service quality, perceived value, patient satisfaction, and behavioral intention. Since the survey was conducted in South Korea, measurements that were originally written in English were translated into Korean and modified for dental health care services items to ensure the equivalence of meaning of the items. The perceived service quality section contains 4 dimensions, which were developed by Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1010539510379393">11</xref></sup>: (1) convenience of the care process, (2) dental health care provider (other than dentist) concern, (3) dentist concern, and (4) tangibles. The perceived value assessment consists of 2 items based on the theory of Zeithaml et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1010539510379393">5</xref></sup> which states that the perceived utility/worth results from the trade-off of âgettingâ versus âgiving-up.â The perceived value items were the following: (1) âThe amount of money I paid for the dental care was appropriate,â and (2) âThe quality of the dental service I received was worth more than what I paid.â</p>
<p>As in the original measurement, patient satisfaction was operationalized using 2 items from Oliverâs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1010539510379393">12</xref></sup> study (1997): (1) âHow satisfied were you with the treatment you received in the NUDH?â and (2) âHow satisfied were you with your decision to use the NUDH?â Behavioral intentions were established based on a 3-item scale: (1) âI will recommend that other people use this NUDH,â (2) âIf I needed dental services in the future, I would consider this NUDH as my first choice,â and (3) âI will tell other people good things about this NUDH.â All items were measured on a 7-point Likert-type scale where 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 2 = <italic>disagree</italic>, 3 = <italic>disagree somewhat</italic>, 4 = <italic>undecided</italic>, 5 = <italic>agree somewhat</italic>, 6 = <italic>agree</italic>, and 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>.</p>
<p>Additionally, we collected information about the patientâs major complaint during treatment in the NUDH using open-ended questions regarding the 4 dimensions for descriptive reference.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1010539510379393">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The statistical program packages SPSS 15.0 and AMOS 7.0 were used to perform all data analyses. The analysis process consisted of 4 stages. First, the frequency distribution of the variables was used to identify the respondentsâ profiles and to compute the means and standard deviations for each perceived service qualityâs dimension. Second, we performed a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to support the issues of dimensionality and convergent and discriminant validity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1010539510379393">13</xref></sup> Third, the Pearsonâs correlation coefficients among the constructs were calculated. Finally, we used structural equation models (SEMs) to test the validity of the proposed model and the hypotheses. A <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 was considered statistically significant. As for descriptive complaints, no statistical analysis was applied.</p>

<title>Confirmatory Factor Analysis of Constructs</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1010539510379393">Table 2</xref>, we performed a CFA involving all items. The level of internal consistency in each construct was acceptable, ranging from 0.75 to 0.85. All the loadings of the indicators to their constructs are significant at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01, suggesting convergent validity of the constructs. Additionally, establishing discriminant validity requires an appropriate average variance extracted (AVE) analysis. AVE from all constructs was observed to be greater than 0.51. Next, we utilized AVE to assess the discriminant validity, which determines the extent to which 2 constructs are empirically distinct. Square roots of AVE values for each construct are greater than the correlations between that construct and other constructs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1010539510379393">Table 3</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1010539510379393">Table 2</xref> summarizes that the results from the CFA of constructs indicated a good fit to the data (Ï<sup>2</sup> = 265.460; <italic>df</italic> = 258; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01; goodness-of-fit index (GFI) = 0.915; comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.995; root mean square residual (RMR) = 0.058.).

<p>As for the descriptive survey of patient complaints, 137 patients (31.3%) recorded their complaints about any type of measurement, and a total of 218 complaints were described. Among them, 135 complaints were associated with dentist concern (98.5%). Meanwhile, the number of complaints described by patients related to the various dimensions were as follows: convenience of the care process, 67 (48.9%); dental health care provider concern, 44 (32.1%); and tangibles, 12 (8.8%).</p>

<title>SEM Results</title>
<p>To test the validity of the proposed model and the hypotheses, we conducted SEM analyses. The goodness-of-fit statistics of the structural model show that the model reasonably fits the data: Ï<sup>2</sup> = 312.828; <italic>df</italic> = 270; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01; GFI = 0.902, CFI = 0.972, RMR = 0.062.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1010539510379393">Figure 2</xref>, the dimension of dentist concern had a significant influence directly on patient satisfaction. Patient satisfaction was not significantly influenced by the convenience of the care process, the other health care providers, or tangibles of perceived service quality. These findings indicate that patient satisfaction is determined primarily by dentist concern (Î² = 0.549; <italic>t</italic> = 2.707; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). With regard to the relationship between the perceived service quality and value, the dimension of tangibles is a significant antecedent factor of value (Î² = 0.344; <italic>t</italic> = 2.289; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Conversely, convenience (Î² = 0.163; <italic>t</italic> = 0.265; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), health care providerâs concern (Î² = 0.186; <italic>t</italic> = 0.464; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01), and dentist concern (Î² = 0.045; <italic>t</italic> = 0.313; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) are not significantly related to value.</p>

<p>With regard to the relationship between the perceived service quality and patient behavioral intentions, dentist concern of the perceived service quality had an influence on behavioral intentions (Î² = 0.419; <italic>t</italic> = 1.961; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Patient satisfaction was a significant antecedent factor of behavioral intentions (Î² = 0.227; <italic>t</italic> = 1.970; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). However, behavioral intentions were not a significant determinant factor of value (Î² = 0.250; <italic>t</italic> = 1.572; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01).</p>
<p>With regard to the relationship between value and patient satisfaction, value had a significant and positive effect on patient satisfaction.</p>

<title>Analysis of Group Difference Comparison</title>
<p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1010539510379393">Table 4</xref>, the <italic>t</italic> test and 1-way ANOVA with Duncanâs multiple-range tests indicated clear differences based on some demographic characteristics of NUDHs. Age gradients and gender differences in relation to perceived service quality, patient value, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions were not found in this study (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). In addition, the scores of all dimensions were not significantly different according to the insurance coverage of dental treatment. However, the average of all dimensions showed a significant difference according to patientsâ academic backgrounds, multiplicity of treatment, and motivation for visiting (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Referred patients scored higher than self-motivated patients in all dimensions. Similarly, the patient group that was involved in a single treatment in a single department perceived a higher service quality and value and felt more satisfaction and behavioral intentions than the patient group whose dental disease involved multiple treatment units of NUDHs. Participants who had completed high school and some college/university showed almost the same score in all dimensions except dentist concern of perceived service quality. The score of dentist concern was significantly higher in the high school group than in the same college/university group. In contrast, the group of participants who had completed a university degree reported lower levels of perceived service quality, value, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions than all the other groups in all dimensions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, as expected, perceived service quality and value had a positive effect on customer satisfaction (H1, H2). In addition, perceived service quality and customer satisfaction positively influenced behavioral intentions (H4, H6). All supported hypotheses agree with the results of previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1010539510379393">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1010539510379393">17</xref></sup> However, each dimension of service quality had varying levels of influence. The effect of service quality on behavioral intentions was not only direct but also mediated through customer satisfaction. These results suggest that South Korean NUDHs share a common trait in the serviceâsatisfaction relationship with other kinds of for-profit service industries, even though NUDHs claim to be nonprofit institutions. In other words, patients at NUDHs regard themselves as customers deserving hospitable treatment. This means that the concept of consumerism should be adopted at NUDHs, and NUDHs should offer a successful service delivery process and achieve service outcomes that meet patientsâ expectations. In this point of view, the NUDHsâ attempts of the past 5 years to provide patient-oriented treatment seem to be successful to a certain extent because the scores of all dimensions were above the median values, which is an encouraging sign considering the system inflexibility of national public institutions.</p>
<p>Interestingly, only 1 dimension in perceived service quality directly affected patient satisfaction and behavioral intentions: dentist concern. In other words, factors such as convenience of the care process or other dental service provider concern do not carry as much weight with dental patients as dentist concern in NUDHs. We expected that dentist concern would be a key determinant of patient satisfaction because it has been reported that patients cited âbeing unhappy with the dentistâ as the main reason for changing dentists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510379393">18</xref></sup> However, because dental patient satisfaction was reported to be affected by various service quality attributes, NUDHs are unique in that other dimensions (such as tangibles and convenience) have no direct effect on satisfaction or behavioral intentions in patients visiting NUDHs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1010539510379393">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510379393">21</xref></sup> This finding may be explained by the past image of NUDHs, which is still deeply ingrained in South Korean patientsâ minds. In the past, the majority of South Korean dental patients were first treated at a local dental clinic by one practitioner and referred to NUDHs only when they were suffering from serious dental disease or they could not afford the high cost of dental treatment. NUDHs have played not only the roles of academic hospitals but also those of national public hospitals with supreme authority. In such a hierarchical situation, the main concern of patients must be absolutely inclined to dentist concern than other dimensions. In contrast, the dimension of tangibles showed a significant effect on patient satisfaction and behavioral intentions through an intermediate effect of perceived value (H3, H5). Moreover, the tangibles dimension was the only one that affected NUDH patientsâ perceived value. These results are other unique aspects of NUDH patients because, reportedly, tangibles is not considered to be as important as other factors in determining patient satisfaction in the dental service industry, and dentists should focus more on characteristics of the core service such as professional competence, personality, and the attitudes of the dentist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510379393">22</xref></sup> This contradictory and paradoxical double consciousness of NUDH patients can be attributed to the patientâs concept development of dental service caused by increasing competition in the South Korean dental service industry. Most NUDH patients have frequently visited local clinics whose recent trend is providing patients with a more comfortable and luxurious environment, including a neat waiting area, magazines, music, a complementary drink, and so on. Presumably, the tangible dimension must be a practical factor by which patients could evaluate what was gained based on the cost they paid (the trade-off between benefits and sacrifices), because the tangible dimension was the only dimension that they got used to and was the one that was most easily assessed.</p>
<p>Although an age gradient and gender difference in relation to satisfaction with dental care were reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1010539510379393">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1010539510379393">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1010539510379393">23</xref></sup> we did not find these differences in this study. In addition, insurance coverage was also not a significant factor in our study. However, another salient finding of this study was a significant difference in perceived service quality and customer satisfaction according to educational background, multiplicity of treatment, and motivation for visiting. The results show that highly educated, self-motivated patients who underwent multiple treatments generally had lower perceived service quality, value, and satisfaction with NUDHs. Considering the time lag and nontechnical processes involved, it is easily understood that patientsâ dissatisfaction increases as they get involved in multiple kinds of dental treatment because they are accustomed to âone-stop serviceâ in local dental clinics. In this regard, NUDHs need to reintegrate an interdepartment referral system to reduce waiting time and to increase the efficiency of multidisciplinary dental care. For example, South Korean NUDHs should consider the unification of departments that are closely connected to provide more comprehensive dental treatment.</p>
<p>Referred patients showed higher scores in all investigated dimensions, including perceived service quality, value, and satisfaction, than self-motivated patients. With regard to this phenomenon, there must be more research to explain it, but possibly, it can be explained by their limited choice of options. Most referred patients have more serious dental problems that family dentists cannot manage, and these patients have fewer choices in dental clinics to choose from to treat their problems. In other words, with few alternatives, referred patients are more likely to have higher perceived service quality, value, and satisfaction than their counterparts. In contrast, self-motivated patients presumably chose NUDHs by themselves. Unlike referred patients, they are liable to be disappointed with their choice if they do not feel they are receiving adequate care and attention or customized, one-of-a-kind service from NUDHs, and they will likely consider different alternatives in the future that offer benefits similar to competitive substitutes.</p>
<p>In this study, we set the lowest level of education to high school graduation because most of the patients (95.4%) had education no less than high school graduation. Nevertheless, such a categorization and overrepresentation of highly educated patients might not reflect the full range of possibilities in terms of education-related issues and might have had an influence on the results. In future studies, lower educational categorization should be included to overcome such a limitation. As reported, patients with higher education and income levels perceive lower levels of service quality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539510379393">24</xref></sup> We also found this to be true for South Korean NUDHs. Because well-educated patients with high incomes generally have more time and motivation to gain more detailed information about their diseases and treatment, they tend to be more critical of the dental services provided by NUDHs. However, their counterparts relatively lack sufficient knowledge and experience to evaluate whether the dental services of the NUDHs were performed properly. Consequently, they tend to believe unconditionally that NUDH dentists have good dental skills and that other dimensions of NUDH are adequate, if the patients experience no problems with their treatment.</p>
<p>In studies conducted at a public hospital in the United Kingdom, patients placed top priority on the technical skills of the dentist, and any major dissatisfaction stems from concerns about the costs of dental care and privatization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1010539510379393">25</xref></sup> In a Turkish study, the skill of the dentist and reasonable costs were the biggest determinants of service quality in public hospitals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1010539510379393">24</xref></sup> However, cost was also reported to have little effect on satisfaction with health care services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1010539510379393">26</xref></sup> Commonly, public hospital patientsâ, including South Korean NUDH patientsâ, principal concerns seem to focus on dentist concern. South Korean NUDHs undoubtedly have the best-qualified professional dentists, and South Korean patients can visit NUDHs without any referral; moreover, the privatization of NUDH dentists is illegal. Additionally, in South Korea, the national health care system covers dental health service, although its coverage range is limited to primary dental diseases such as dental caries, periodontitis, or third molar infections. Uninsurable treatments, including orthodontics or prosthodontics, can involve great costs for the patients. Nevertheless, as in the present study, the level of insurance coverage was not a significant factor that affected NUDH patient satisfaction. This means that NUDH patients believe that the dental service fee of the NUDHs is appropriate or the cost is not a critical consideration in their treatment. Therefore, superficially, NUDHs look to be competitive in the matter of dentistsâ technical skills, cost, and the accessibility of dental services. In spite of the above results and analyses, however, we doubt that the NUDHsâ strongest competitive factor, dentist concern, is properly perceived by patients because, in a descriptive survey, 98.5% of respondents complained that the most unsatisfactory factor about NUDHs was associated with dentist concern. They reported that âNUDH professors and residents were authoritarian and reluctant to explain my disease and always talked bluntly,â or âThey seemed to hate talking about my problem and treatment process.â NUDH dentists might be the best dentists academically, but they did not realize what patients really wanted to know because of a lack of communication skills, which are important in limiting patient dissatisfaction and preventing liability claims.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1010539510379393">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1010539510379393">30</xref></sup> In this regard, NUDHs are on the verge of losing competitiveness in their patients in whom dentist concern is the primary interest. Based on the results of the present study, some managerial measures should be considered and implemented, as described below, to gain competitiveness for South Korean NUDHs.</p>
<p>First of all, it is mandatory for NUDH dentists to evaluate whether they manage patients in too authoritative or austere a manner or are reluctant to give patients sufficient information. NUDH dentists should willingly share information about the patientâs dental condition, and the importance of communication between the patient and the staff should also be emphasized. Through the implementation of training, educational, and public relations programs, NUDHs can increase the level of patient value, satisfaction, and behavioral intention. In addition, intensive and periodic monitoring of patient-perceived service quality and satisfaction will improve the quality of dental services. Second, NUDHs should maintain their ingrained public and academic hospital images; the NUDHs were established for the general public because successful image branding can allow marketers to gain a competitive advantage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1010539510379393">31</xref></sup> At the same time, NUDHs should bolster their image through establishing a strong commitment from NUDH patients. As Kim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1010539510379393">32</xref></sup> suggested, customer relationship management (CRM) may be the only viable option for raising brand equity because, as mentioned earlier, the advertising of hospitals is illegal in South Korea. Finally, based on the demographic results of the present study, NUDH patients should not be treated as a single entity, although South Korea is a high-context country,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1010539510379393">33</xref></sup> that is, a country in which individuals are deeply involved with each other, and most South Korean people share similar cultural values. Individualized and customized management protocols and bottom-line performance should be implemented. Most of all, it is vital that each patient can recognize touches of high-quality service through communication and caring of NUDH dentists. Because dentists tend to believe that they know what patients should want, and they seldom take the time to find out what they actually want,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1010539510379393">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1010539510379393">34</xref></sup> frequent examining services and feedback should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Public health care systems are a common interest of all countries, and each government wants its own public hospital system to have a good image built on the trust of the general public. South Korean NUDHs are representative public hospitals that were created to manage public dental health and provide advanced dental treatment. In view of the nationalized public health care policy, it is not ideal, both for patients and for health care providers, to accept the concept of âpatients as customersâ and to make âgeneral marketing strategiesâ for a public hospital. Nonetheless, they are not exempt from the competition of the dental industry, and nowadays, they also need a service marketing strategy. As presented in this study, recognition of patientsâ perceived service quality and satisfaction and appropriate attempts to improve them is not a matter of choice but a matter of course for both the general public and the NUDHs themselves.</p>
