<abstract>
<p>Research shows clear links between lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth and deliberate self-harm (DSH), but there is a lack of research investigating the social context of young LGBT people’s lives and helping to explain the higher DSH risk. In this article, we report on a small-scale methodological study intended to test the feasibility of online qualitative interviews for investigating young people, sexual and gender identity, and emotional distress. There are many methodological dilemmas arising from researching such sensitive issues with marginalized groups. The study reported here was designed to examine (a) sampling diversity in terms of sexuality, gender identities, and class; and (b) the type of data produced. We found that a virtual methodology was effective in recruiting young LGBT participants who might otherwise not take part in research. Online interviewing successfully produced in-depth, “immediate” data that potentially gave access to insights that might not emerge through face-to face interviews.</p>

<p>That a relationship exists between lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth and deliberate self-harm (DSH) is fairly well established.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1049732311425052">1</xref></sup> Studies have shown a link between DSH and LGBT people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311425052">Bagley &amp; Tremblay, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311425052">Chakraborty, McManus, Brugha, Bebbington, &amp; King, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311425052">King &amp; McKeown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732311425052">Skegg, Nada-Raja, Dickson, Paul, &amp; Williams, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049732311425052">Whittle, Turner, &amp; Al-Alami, 2007</xref>), and LGB youth in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311425052">Fergusson, Horwood, &amp; Beautrais, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311425052">Fergusson, Horwood, Ridder, &amp; Beautrais, 2005</xref>). What is less clear is the nature of the relationship between LGBT youth and DSH.</p>
<p>Concerns about the elevated rates of DSH among LGB youth have generated a range of explanations relating to the effects of “gay-related stress” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311425052">Rosario, Rotheram-Borus, &amp; Reid, 1996</xref>) and homophobic abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311425052">Rivers &amp; Cowie, 2006</xref>). There is a consensus among researchers, from the United States in particular, that young people’s sexual identity itself is not a risk factor, but that “environmental reactions to homosexuality, such as family, peer and institutional harassment and discrimination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311425052">Savin-Williams &amp; Ream, 2003</xref>, p. 510) contribute to significant distress. However, little research has investigated the mechanisms linking young LGBT people, DSH, and these “environmental” factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311425052">Diamond, 2003</xref>). Consequently, there is only a scant understanding about why being young and having a marginalized sexual or gender identity increases the risk of DSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732311425052">Savin-Williams, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>This is partly because methodological difficulties make it challenging to do more than point to a relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311425052">D’Augelli &amp; Grossman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732311425052">Muehrer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732311425052">Savin-Williams, 2001</xref>). The difficulty of recruiting “hidden” population groups such as LGBT youth for research has led to a reliance on White, educated, urban convenience samples generated from young people who are connected to LGBT groups and networks (Savin-Williams). As a result, young people who cannot identify with these labels, and who might be questioning their sexual and gender identity, might have been excluded. An additional obstacle is that international research has overwhelmingly relied on survey methods, which have limits in terms of developing complex, in-depth, and theoretical explanations for the relationship between youth, marginalized sexual and gender identity, and DSH.</p>
<p>Through our ongoing research, we aim to generate qualitative data within a social and psychological framework to help explain the relationship between lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and queer (LGBTIQ) youth and DSH. In the present article, we address the twin methodological dilemmas of sampling a “hidden” population and generating in-depth data on a sensitive subject. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311425052">Adams, Rodham, and Gavin (2005)</xref> pointed out, the term <italic>deliberate self-harm</italic> can usefully encompass that which has been variously referred to as parasuicide, attempted suicide, self-mutilation, or self-injury. Research on DSH and suicide attempting is notorious for the use of terms that are not consistently defined across studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311425052">Mangnall &amp; Yurkovich, 2008</xref>). In the present study we followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732311425052">Skegg (2005)</xref> in using the term <italic>deliberate self-harm</italic> (DSH) to refer to behaviors that are intentionally self-injurious, regardless of whether there is suicidal intent. In addition, in this article we use the term to move emphasis away from suicidality and toward the engagement between the “self’ and embodied, emotional distress. In the following section, we outline some key methodological dilemmas encountered in research on young LGBTIQ people and DSH, and then consider the capacity of online methods to address these problems. In subsequent sections, we describe the virtual methodology utilized for the study and evaluate the potential of the methodological study in terms of sample diversity and the characteristics of the data produced.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732311425052">
<title>Methodological Dilemmas</title>
<p>A major methodological critique of LGBT research relates to sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311425052">Meezan &amp; Martin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732311425052">Mitchell, Howarth, Kotecha, &amp; Creegan, 2009</xref>). Large-scale studies that survey thousands of secondary school pupils, for example, provide an opportunity to demonstrate higher reports of DSH among LGBT youth than other young people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049732311425052">Wichstrøm &amp; Hegna, 2003</xref>), but such studies give little opportunity for generating detailed information about the specificities of LGBT youth and their subjective experiences. Some researchers have sought to find out about LGBT youth by sampling LGBT adults and asking them to talk retrospectively about their earlier experiences of “coming out,” homophobic abuse, and DSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311425052">Flowers and Buston, 2001</xref>), but this does not engage fully with young people’s immediate experiences, which are crucial to in-depth understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311425052">Hillier &amp; Rosenthal, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Other researchers have specifically recruited LGBT youth but have been criticized for working with unrepresentative convenience samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311425052">Savin-Williams &amp; Ream, 2003</xref>). The problem is that LGBT research has a tendency to include only “easy-to-reach” samples (urban, White, male, and middle class), who self-identify as lesbian or gay, are linked to sexuality-based communities and networks, and can be conveniently recruited through gay community events and celebrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311425052">Meezan &amp; Martin, 2003</xref>). Consequently, such studies might be more likely to provide data about urban, lesbian and gay youth who are open about their sexual and gender identity and connected to groups and networks, than about youth who are in rural contexts; who are not out; who are transgender or intersex; who avoid sexuality labels, groups, and venues; or who might be “hard to reach” for reasons such as homelessness or mental health problems.</p>
<p>The concern regarding unrepresentative sampling practices has led to increasing scrutiny of the conceptualization and definition of sexual and gender identity within research on young people and DSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732311425052">Savin-Williams, 2001</xref>). Some have argued that to understand the connection between sexual and gender identities and DSH, it is crucial for research to include those who might not necessarily identify with “named” categories such as gay or lesbian (Savin-Williams). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311425052">Hillier and Rosenthal (2001)</xref> argued that young people experience a range of sexual feelings, but sexual identification occurs later. Research that confines participants to a set list of named categories might, then, be excluding those youth who have same-sex desire or gender nonconformity and do not identify with LGBTIQ identity labels.</p>
<p>Critics have argued that we must build intersectionality and diversity into our sampling strategies for LGBT youth research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311425052">Hillier &amp; Rosenthal, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732311425052">Savin-Williams, 2001</xref>). In the past, researchers have focused on sexual identity to the exclusion of other intersecting identities such as gender, race, and social class. We know very little about the ways race and class can influence LGBT young people (Hillier &amp; Rosenthal; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311425052">McDermott, 2011</xref>) and DSH. In the present study, we sought to recruit participants from a spectrum of social classes and geographical locations, and a range of sexual and gender identities and “subjectivities,” including intersex and “questioning” young people.</p>
<p>The second methodological dilemma that we have discussed often in the course of this work, but have rarely seen dealt with in published literature, concerns the conceptual complexity of the topic. This is partly because qualitative methods have not been used very often to investigate the relationship of interest (for exceptions see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311425052">Dame, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311425052">Fenaughty and Harre, 2003</xref>). It is, of course, possible to ask research participants questions about the body, distress, sexuality, gender identity, and DSH in accessible terms; it is more difficult, however, to generate data about the relationships among these concepts and phenomena.</p>
<p>Underlying the motivation for our research in this area are questions of causality: Is there some kind of causal link between being LGBTIQ and engaging in DSH? In what ways might this causal relationship be bound up with concepts such as homophobic abuse, transphobic abuse, or minority stress, for example? One of the methodological challenges we face is to find ways to generate data on these relationships without prompting or accepting simple framings (“I cut myself because I’m gay”). The challenge is to find ways to generate data that give insight into conceptual relationships, and to offer productive analyses of any alternative and nuanced relationships that participants’ stories might suggest.</p>

<title>LGBTIQ Youth and Online Methods</title>
<p>There is a dual impetus for employing online methods to research the relationship between young people’s sexual and gender identity and DSH. First, virtual methods are increasingly used to successfully research marginalized groups and sensitive subjects and, second, there is evidence that cyberspace plays an important role in young LGBTIQ lives. Despite recent equality legislation which affords LGBT people rights and protection from discrimination in the United Kingdom, many young LGBTIQ people remain fearful of others’ responses to their nonconformist gender and/or sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311425052">Hunt &amp; Jensen, 2007</xref>). The Internet presents LGBTIQ youth the opportunity to obtain, without censure, information about sexual and gendered identities which do not conform to heterosexual norms. Researchers from Australia have suggested that young LGBTIQ people use the Internet as a way of practicing same-sex desire and identity in ways that are not possible in their offline lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311425052">Hillier &amp; Harrison, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311425052">Hillier, Harrison, Dempsey, &amp; Nieto, 2004</xref>). Half the sample in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311425052">Hillier et al.’s (2004)</xref> research described the Web as important for coping with their own and others’ depression and suicidal feelings. The Internet gave young people confidence and alternative positive ways to view their sexual and gender difference.</p>
<p>Increasingly, virtual methods have been employed to tackle subjects that are difficult to broach in face-to-face settings, such as suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311425052">Horne &amp; Wiggins, 2009</xref>), high-risk sexual behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311425052">Chiasson et al., 2005</xref>), sexual orientation and schooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311425052">Atkinson &amp; DePalma, 2008</xref>), and young people’s sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732311425052">Subrahmanyam, Greenfield, &amp; Tynes, 2004</xref>). Cyber methods have also proved successful in reaching marginalized, hidden, and disadvantaged groups who might not otherwise participate in research, including, for example, LGBT youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311425052">Hillier &amp; Harrison 2007</xref>), male gay youth suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311425052">Savin-Williams &amp; Ream, 2003</xref>), and young people who self-harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049732311425052">Whitlock, Powers, &amp; Eckenrode, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311425052">Dempsey, Hillier, and Harrison (2001)</xref> used online methods to generate a sample that included young people who did not currently identify with the LGBT community and were isolated from networks.</p>
<p>Online qualitative methods provide an opportunity to create a different type of interaction between adult researchers and adolescents compared to face-to-face methods, especially if the subject matter is sensitive or stigmatized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311425052">Hessler et al., 2003</xref>). Some have argued that participants are more open about sensitive subjects in virtual settings because the physical absence of the body and increased anonymity encourages more “honest” discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311425052">Atkinson &amp; DePalma, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732311425052">Suzuki &amp; Calzo, 2004</xref>). For example, Suzuki and Calzo’s research on young people’s use of the Internet for peer advice on health and sexuality suggests that, although young people might be reluctant to seek face-to-face advice, they are more willing to use online advice. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311425052">Dunne (1999)</xref> used online interviews in her study with gay fathers and argued that the anonymity of the technology encouraged participation.</p>
<p>Online qualitative methods can also generate data that have different characteristics to data generated through face-to-face qualitative methods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311425052">Baker and Fortune (2008)</xref>, for example, utilized in-depth interviews via email to investigate young people’s use of self-harm and suicide Web sites. They found that young people’s accounts of self-harm and suicide Web sites were strikingly different from professionals’ and the wider public’s understandings, which tend to focus on the risks connected with using such sites. Young people described these Web sites as sources of empathy and understanding, as communities, and as offering a way of coping with social and psychological distress.</p>
<p>Qualitative online methods have not been used, to our knowledge, to investigate young LGBTIQ people and emotional distress. Studies which have aimed to research this topic and population group have used mainly Internet surveys (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311425052">Savin-Williams &amp; Ream, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311425052">Plöderl, Faistauer, &amp; Fartacek, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049732311425052">Vanden Berghe, Dewaele, Cox, &amp; Vincke, 2010</xref>) and other online quantification methods (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732311425052">Silenzo et al., 2009</xref>). The two key aims of our small-scale methodological study were to explore the potential of online qualitative methods to generate “talk” with LGBTIQ youth about the complex and sensitive relationship between sexual and gender identity and emotional distress, and to recruit a diverse sample, or a differently distributed sample, through a virtual interface which might provide unique access to hard-to-reach youth who might not otherwise participate in identified “LGBT” research. In addition, we were interested to find out whether or not an online recruitment strategy would enable us to reach young people from a variety of social classes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311425052">Dempsey et al. (2001)</xref> found an underrepresentation of young people from disadvantaged socioeconomic circumstances in their online LGBT youth sample. In the next section, we outline the methods employed for the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732311425052" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Through the small-scale methodological study, we aimed to recruit a small but diverse group of young LGBTIQ people to complete a short online questionnaire and interview. We chose to conduct asynchronous online interviews by email, because this type of interaction requires a minimum level of technology and, therefore, would be less of a barrier to potential participants. Asynchronous interviewing allows the time and space for the participant (and researcher) to think, encouraging reflexive and in-depth personal “conversations” that might be absent in “uttered data” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311425052">James &amp; Busher, 2009</xref>, p. 28). There is, however, very little evidence about young LGBTIQ people’s use of the Internet in the United Kingdom. To understand how the Web is utilized by young people whose sexual and gender identities are marginalized and who might be experiencing emotional distress, we conducted a short ethnographic (scoping) exploration of online activity. This was not an attempt to document the volume of activity or produce an exhaustive account of online practices. Rather, the aim was to record key observations while spending time in virtual spaces that might be inhabited by prospective research participants; reflect on what these observations mean for recruitment and sampling processes; and reflect on what these observations mean for generating data (e.g., terminology, language, and discussion prompts).</p>
<p>Each member of the research team (<italic>n</italic> = 3) used the Google search engine to locate sites that were based in and used by young people in the United Kingdom, and that focused on sexual and gender identity. Search terms used included, for example, <italic>LGBT Youth, UK, Questioning Sexuality</italic>, and <italic>Queer</italic>. We visited the community and support Web sites we found in this way, and then we “snowballed” links to other related Web sites. We then, when possible, spent some time on these sites; some were restricted by age (we did not access these sites), but others allowed guests over the age limit. During our online observation, we recorded who managed the site; the presence or absence and level of moderation; age restrictions; and the purpose of the site. Then we observed chat or threads on DSH and mental health issues. The types of sites that were relevant for our purposes were (a) LGBTIQ youth forums which were used as “safe gathering places” to make friends, share stories and seek advice from other like-minded (or like-bodied) people; (b) LGBT youth group Web sites of face-to-face community groups (these were used for information, support, and to access regional organizations that meet regularly offline); and (c) online support organizations which were similar to information centers providing advice and private one-to-one confidential support through email and/or telephone. This virtual scoping work produced important information about the ways young LGBTIQ people might use the Internet to locate emotional and social support. Crucially, the exercise confirmed that a significant number of LGBTIQ young people use the Internet as a safe space for support for emotional distress and DSH. This virtual ethnography shaped the sampling strategy.</p>
<sec id="section4-1049732311425052">
<title>Sampling Strategy</title>
<p>For this study we aimed to recruit young LGBTIQ people aged 16 to 25 years from a variety of backgrounds in the United Kingdom. The recruitment strategy was designed to ensure that the study was not overwhelmed by participants. Informed by our virtual scoping work, we decided to target the three different types of online sites we had identified. We rejected the idea of using mainstream networking sites such as Facebook and Bebo, because we wanted to target a specific population group. Through the virtual ethnography we had ascertained that young people who were “questioning” their gender or sexuality were more likely to make contact on a Web site with a specific LGBTIQ purpose. We contacted the three following Web sites once only: “Queer Youth Network” claims to be one of the United Kingdom’s largest national LGBT youth networks. It acts as a social networking site/portal with a huge membership and active discussion forums particularly around “questioning” and “trans” issues. “Being Gay is OK” has a focus on supporting people (in the United Kingdom) who are questioning and has an active membership and chat forum. “Beau Belles” is the Web site of an online and face-to-face, city-based youth group. Queer Youth Network quickly responded to our request, and the administrators were willing for the study to be advertised via a notice on their site. The Web site is extremely busy, so we understood that information about our study would quickly disappear under a stream of newer notes being posted. We posted our note only once. The other two Web sites did not respond, and we did not contact any other sites.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732311425052">
<title>Recruitment, Support, and Ethics</title>
<p>Confidentiality and anonymity were vital to ensuring that LGBTIQ respondents participated safely in the study. The study Web site was “housed” on the University of York Web site, and was used to link prospective participants to the online questionnaire, provide information, and reassure participants that the study was legitimate. The study had been approved by the University of York Research Ethics Committee. We designed a protocol aimed to recruit participants ethically and to ensure that those who took part in interviews had adequate social support should they need assistance. To take part in the interview, respondents had to complete the following four-stage recruitment protocol: (a) answer an online survey via the study Web site, including choosing a pseudonym; (b) email the study, including the pseudonym in the email; (c) answer two questions emailed to the participant’s personal email address, checking on the participant’s age and access to emotional support; and (d) email the researchers a statement of consent.</p>
<p>We initially negotiated consent via an online form sent to prospective participants by email. Ethics guidance on research with young people, produced by the British Psychological Society and the National Centre for Social Research, recommends that when research participants are 16 years old and above, consent should be sought from the young person only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311425052">Reeves, Bryson, Ormston, &amp; White, 2007</xref>). We took this approach with the understanding that informed consent is an ongoing process, and that traditional methods of obtaining informed consent do not guarantee any more security or validity than emailed methods (for an extended discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311425052">Mann &amp; Stewart, 2000</xref>). The authenticity of participants—that is, the question of whether participants are who they say they are—is an important concern for online methods, particularly in this study, regarding age. We consider this to be an issue when researching young people (or any age-bounded study), whether the study uses online or conventional methods.</p>
<p>Confidentiality and anonymity were paramount in this study but presented difficulties, perhaps because we were more concerned than the participants about these issues. Our intention was to use participant-defined pseudonyms so we did not have access to real names. However, respondents’ own email addresses were often based on their full names, and some participants chose pseudonyms that contained revealing information about them, such as a personal nickname and birth year. This resonates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311425052">Ayling and Mewse’s (2009)</xref> observation that some of their participants showed little concern for confidentiality in online interviews. We created new email accounts using participants’ pseudonyms for the purposes of the email interviews. One of the problems was that this meant we only had contact with those participants who chose, or remembered, to log in to their study email accounts. On at least three occasions, after gaps in communication, we emailed the participants’ personal accounts to ask whether or not they would like to continue participating. After two such reminders, we stopped emailing, assuming that the participant was no longer interested. We have no information about why interviewees ended their communication with us when they did.</p>

<title>Data Generation and Analysis</title>
<p>The key concepts operationalized in the study were sexual and gender identity and emotional distress. We framed our study from a postmodern theoretical position that sexual and gender identities are socially constructed, fluid, and complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311425052">Butler, 1990</xref>). For the purposes of the study, we were interested in young people whose sexual and gender identities were outside the norms of heterosexuality. We wanted to include both young people who identified themselves as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, and those who were uncertain or “questioning” their sexuality and/or their gender identity. In the initial questionnaire, we asked participants to describe their sexuality and gender, and offered a wide range of answers, such as <italic>lesbian, gay, bisexual, straight, homosexual, male, female, transgendered</italic>, and <italic>intersex</italic>. We also provided space for participants to write their own terms instead of, or as well as, selecting from the list of terms we offered. In the interviews we also invited participants to define their sexuality and gender using their own terms.</p>
<p>DSH research is dominated by biomedical and psychological frames of inquiry that have been critiqued for individualizing and pathologizing young people’s experiences of emotional distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311425052">Bourke, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311425052">Redley, 2003</xref>). The narrow focus on an individual’s intrapsychic processes draws attention away from the social, cultural, and economic circumstances of young LGBT lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311425052">Fullagar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311425052">Roen, Scourfield, &amp; McDermott, 2008</xref>). Individualized psychological models tend to overlook the interpretations that young people themselves might have of their emotions and their circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311425052">Fullagar, 2005</xref>). Our intention in the study was to generate data which address young LGBTIQ people’s subjective experiences of emotional distress by encouraging them to speak openly. This stands in contrast to research which, for example, measures behaviors, outcomes, and risk factors.</p>
<p>The interview schedule for the in-depth email interviews was designed to address four broad exploratory research questions which had arisen from our previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311425052">McDermott, Roen, &amp; Scourfield, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311425052">Roen, Scourfield, &amp; McDermott, 2008</xref>): How do young people who are positioned outside normative gender and sexuality express and experience any distress that might be connected to their sexual/gender identities? In what ways do the social and material circumstances of young people’s lives influence the experience of distress that might be connected to their sexual/gender identities? How might social support feature in young people’s accounts of sexuality/gender and emotional distress? How do young people cope with emotional distress arising from sexuality/gender?</p>
<p>The interview schedule was divided into five key areas reflecting each of the four research questions and an extra set of questions regarding homophobia, transphobia, and gender/sexual transgression (not fitting in). This extra set of questions was included because experiences of these are well established risk factors for DSH in LGBT young people. In working with the interview schedule, we were careful to remember to adapt each question at the time to ensure that we were not asking sexual-attraction questions when gender identity questions were more appropriate (i.e., because the participant had identified themselves as transgender or intersex, and not as LGB). We specifically paid attention to whether we were asking too much, and if it was taking too long for participants to answer in writing. We did not specify any time limit for answering questions. Sometimes respondents answered our interview question on the same day; on other occasions it took a week for participants to respond. We were also careful to use easy and less-intrusive questions first to give the participants time to think and ourselves time to judge whether the participant was unhappy or distressed by the line of questioning. If at any point we believed the questions might be causing distress, we halted the line of questioning and moved on to a less-intrusive question. Participants did not articulate via email any distress during the project. However, both of us are experienced in this field of work, and also have backgrounds working with young people and in mental health settings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311425052">Ayling and Mewse (2009)</xref> noted that when using email interviews to research sensitive subjects, the researchers need to be experienced in Internet communication. In our study, this meant that when participants wrote about distress they had experienced related to their sexuality and gender, there were certain lines of questioning we did not pursue, such as “mining” this experience of distress through further questions. Instead, we concentrated on validating the experience and exploring participants’ approach to coping.</p>
<p>The data analysis involved a descriptive statistical analysis of the questionnaire data, a thematic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311425052">Mason, 2002</xref>) of the online interviews, and our field notes and collective reflections on the methodology. We held a data analysis workshop in which the data from the survey, interviews, and field notes were discussed. Using themes identified from this workshop, the online interviews and field notes were coded (on paper) using the coding schema outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732311425052">Table 1</xref>. Our attention here is less on the analysis of data and more on data production methods.</p>

<title>Online Recruitment</title>
<p>There were 14 respondents who completed the survey, but 7 did not email the study, so we were unable to seek further participation from them. Subsequently, 5 continued to participate in the online interview, but only 3 completed the entire interview (with very limited resources, we were unable to attempt to recruit more participants). The results of the survey showed that 7 of the 14 survey respondents described themselves as queer; 5 described themselves as transsexual, transgender, transboy, or gender queer; and 1 identified as intersex. This is interesting given that, in previous research in which we sought LGBT people in the same age range, but using face-to-face methods, we found it difficult to attract participants who identified as intersex, transsexual, or transgender. In the present small sample, almost half identified in ways that placed them clearly outside of a normative male/female binary.</p>
<p>There were three survey questions intended to measure social class. These related to educational qualifications, future education/work intentions, and participants’ assessment in relation to the question, “How well off do you think your family is?” Most participants indicated they had been or were planning to go to university, but 2 reported having left school at the age of 16. Most described their families as being “average” or “quite well off,” whereas 4 reported that their family was “not well off” at all. From this, we gained the impression that this recruitment approach reaches across a class and educational range, but attracts more people with higher levels of education. This has implications for the potential of this method for recruiting young LGBTIQ people who have been severely disadvantaged, (perhaps) because of their sexuality or gender, including those who leave school early because of bullying and those who are forced to leave home and discontinue their education because of family homophobia or transphobia. This recruitment method might reach a disproportionate number of LGBTIQ young people who are coping well and have been able to continue their education.</p>
<p>The 5 participants whose online interview data is cited in this article have been completely anonymized and are only referred to using (a) nongendered pseudonyms, (b) their age, and (c) their self-ascribed sexuality/gender terms. These 5 participants ranged in age from 16 to 24 years. Four of them lived in a city, whereas 1 of them lived in a town. They gave a spread of answers to our social class questions, with 2 indicating that their parents were “not well off,” and that they had either left school at age 16 or were (then) currently in low-skilled employment. One indicated that his or her parents were “quite well off,” and 2 indicated they were at, or aiming for, university.</p>
<p>There is a dearth of information on the ways that young LGBTIQ people use the Internet. Consequently, we want to reflect further on our LGBTIQ online sample and what this can tell us, methodologically, about LGBTIQ youth and cyberspace. We suggest, as others have, that the Internet is an important source of support, information, and connection for young LGBTIQ people. In addition, for some, it provides ways to construct sexual and gender identities. As two participants wrote:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The only place that has helped has been LGBT youth support sites on the Internet but I only started using them after I started to question my sexuality. They taught me that there is a wide range of sexualities and genders and that my sexuality didn’t really matter. (Ally, 16, queer, pansexual)</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I moved to the city for University that I was truly able to explore just who I was, now able to search the Internet without worry that someone else would see the browser history, I searched the web for information, and at around this time I came out as gay. Something still wasn’t right though, my identity still didn’t quite feel like mine, and I continued to explore, becoming increasingly more androgynous in appearance. It wasn’t until about 18 months ago that, after much searching, I found the name for the identity I had since I was that young child who wanted to be a boy. (Joker, 24, queer, male transsexual)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the context of an overwhelmingly heteronormative and gender-normative social world, young people who feel “at odds” with sexual and gender norms have limited options to access alternative meanings to explain and explore their experiences. Despite the increasing visibility of openly adult gay public and popular figures, spaces for young people to express gender and sexual identity differences such as school, family, and peers, still present heterosexuality as “compulsory.” In Joker’s extract above, it is evident that the Internet has enabled him to redefine his sexual and gender identity rather than be subject to the assumptions of heterosexuality and normative gender. The Internet allows for spaces of resistance, self-affirmation, and validation. It is here that young people can practice identities which are not easily accessible in their everyday physical worlds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311425052">Hillier &amp; Harrison, 2007</xref>). Cyberspace is where young LGBTIQ people can take up subject positions without fear of censure; they are able to position themselves freely and temporally as LGBTIQ. The Internet also offers a safe form of support when young people feel worried about their sexuality or gender:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As sad and 21st century as it sounds, I probably post on message boards most when it’s getting me down. There’s two youth groups I’m part of online, and everyone, especially the trans people I think, have such an amazing support network between ourselves. Those people are now real life friends too, so it’s a good place to vent, and then speak to friends online after. (Storm, 18, genderqueer, transboy)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<speech>
<speaker>Researcher (R):</speaker>
<p>Can you tell me about things that you do when you are feeling scared, worried or depressed? Like talking to someone?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Participant (P):</speaker>
<p>Well I start off by crying and then talk to a friend about whatever’s causing me to feel like that. They usually cheer me up . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>R:</speaker>
<p>. . . Do you mean talking online or face-to-face? . . .</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>P:</speaker>
<p>Online and face to face really. Mostly online, like on msn, because i feel more comfortable talking about it when I can’t see the other person mostly. However with a couple of friends who are also gay/bi I often talk to them face to face about it. (Ally)</p>
</speech>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Cyberspace is a place where young people are able to “tell” their stories and explore their identities, experiences, bodies, and emotions. The boundaries between virtual and real erode in social life. Cyberspace is not the only source of support, information, and connection; these young people rely on “real” relationships, too. As Storm made clear, offline and online friendships are mutually important; one is not more authentic than the other. No one type of space might be more authentic to young people’s experiences, identities, and social connections. What we are suggesting is that methodologies used to investigate young people, sexuality, gender identity, and emotional distress need to include online samples in conjunction with offline samples, because findings from this study indicate that for some LGBTIQ youth, the Internet is an important part of their lives. This is necessary if we are to generate a fuller understanding of the nature of the relationship between youth, sexual and gender identity, and emotional distress, and most crucially, find ways to support LGBTIQ young people who might be distressed.</p>

<sec id="section9-1049732311425052">
<title>Data Quality</title>
<p>Despite the difficulties of generating data at the intersection of youth, sexuality, gender, and emotional distress, we found that participants were willing to communicate in detail about their personal lives, experiences, and feelings. On average, over the duration of the interview, we sent 10 emails to each respondent, but any single email might have included one to four questions. Often the replies from respondents were lengthy. For example, without our asking for this, Storm sent us a copy of the long, highly personal email he had sent to close friends when he wanted to declare his gender identity. Joker also wrote about the private conversations he had about his gender confusion with his partner. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311425052">James and Busher (2009</xref>, p.11) suggested that this “textual reflexivity” is a feature of virtual communication that enables the articulation of rich data about the subjective self by removing all other frames of reference apart from the written word.</p>
<p>We also found there was an immediacy in the young people’s accounts, creating an “in-the-moment” data quality. For example, Storm voluntarily sent us a copy of an email he had received from a coworker the day before, regarding his gender identity. Similarly, Joker used a recent example from work to illustrate the difficulties of managing gender identity. During the interview, Ally reflected:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The most recent time someone asked me about my sexuality was a few weeks ago when a girl in my class said “Are you a lesbian?” I said “No, I’m bisexual” and she said “oh so you’re half a dyke”.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These data are different from retrospective data we have generated in the past through face-to-face interviews with LGBT young people sampled from support groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311425052">McDermott et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732311425052">Scourfield, Roen, &amp; McDermott, 2008</xref>). In the online study, there was a much stronger sense that we were walking alongside young people as they negotiated their emerging sexual and gender identities over a 2-month time span. We are not suggesting that immediate data are more authentic or provide a more accurate “truth” compared to retrospective data. We do argue that generating in-the-moment data provides a “rawness” to young people’s experiences before time allows work on the self where identities, subjectivities, and experiences are shaped into a cohesive narrative and a “story” to tell.</p>
<p>We want to illustrate the potential of this “immediate” data to generating understandings of the young LGBTIQ youth, emotional distress, and deliberate self-harm by examining some the data we identified and coded as “identity management strategies.” We are not presenting this as a substantive finding of the study. Rather, we are suggesting that the immediacy of online interview data can give access to insights that might not emerge via face-to-face retrospective “telling.” The following quotations and discussion should be read as exemplars of data that demonstrate the potential for producing important substantive findings.</p>
<p>Identity management strategies involve juggling sexual and gender identity performances across different sites (e.g., school/college, home, peers, work, leisure, public and private space, online and offline). This was quite striking in the interviews we had with young people. It takes psychological effort to give the “right” performance, and the self-surveillance required can be emotionally draining. One participant wrote:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>School can make it difficult to cope because it’s not the most supportive place for LGBT people. No-one there really seems to understand that my sexuality could cause me to be stressed or depressed. My parents can also make it difficult because they’ll say things, without thinking, that I can take offensively and it makes me feel like I can’t talk to them about any problems I have regarding my sexuality. Also people who can’t accept me make it hard because it just makes me feel like my life would be so much easier if i could change my sexuality. (Ally)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In response to a question about the reason for using the Internet for support, Storm wrote, “This means I can now have a little haven where I’m Storm completely. I don’t have to worry about who knows and who doesn’t, so that’s why it makes me happy.” We consider this to be important for understanding the social processes and mechanisms by which young LGBTIQ people become vulnerable to DSH, and we intend to explore this in further research. What is significant is that the immediacy of the data generated through qualitative online interviews has highlighted an aspect of young LGBTIQ lives and emotional distress that might not have come to light in a face-to-face setting.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study has demonstrated some value in using online methods to recruit a differently distributed sample compared to face-to-face methods. Working from a Web site that attracts a range of LGBTIQ youth, we were able to recruit marginalized young people from a much broader range of sexual and gender identities and subjectivities, including some identifying as “trans.” In addition, the data indicated consistently that the Internet is important for some LGBTIQ youth coping with emotional distress. In future research we will consider complementing this approach with face-to-face methods that might give better access to youth across a class spectrum, particularly those facing severe marginalization because of a combination of financial, sexuality, and gender issues.</p>
<p>Significantly, we have been able to use online methods to generate data that engage with complex and sensitive topics with a vulnerable group. The “immediate” quality of the data highlights the potential of engaging with young research participants’ lives as they weave across online and offline social worlds, and gives us insight into the emotional coping strategies that young LGBTIQ people use in their daily lives. This type of data is distinct from that generated from face-to-face qualitative methods and survey methods that have been used in previous studies. This data type could help to generate crucial explanations for why marginalized sexual and gender identities are associated with a higher risk of emotional distress, and how DSH in particular comes to be a coping mechanism. In addition, it has the potential to inform emergency/crisis intervention and support services for young people.</p>
<p>There are, however, a number of problems that we would seek to address in future studies using asynchronous online interviewing. Our main concern is the difficulty of maintaining contact with participants throughout the data-generation period. Asynchronous online interviewing gives time for reflection, but it might lead to participants losing interest sooner than hoped. In the present case, of the 5 who began the interview, only 3 completed it. Some of the ways to reduce the number of participants dwindling during the interview process might be to establish a clearer timeframe and time commitment for participants, so an interview is completed in an agreed-upon number of days or weeks, and have a clearer sense of closure at the end.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1049732311425052">2</xref></sup> Working differently with the technology might also encourage sustained participation by having a more direct access whereby participants do not have to log on to a separate email account to see what we have written to them.</p>
<p>There are also ethical considerations to using online qualitative methods to research deliberate self-harm and this population group. As we have demonstrated, this method seems to encourage disclosure of personal detail from young people. We were aware of the possible dangers this might present, and had devised, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311425052">Hillier and Harrison (2007)</xref>, an “adverse incident protocol.” In the event that research participants disclosed an intention to harm themselves or someone else, it would be necessary to break confidentiality. We would then follow the adverse incident protocol and inform the participants that the researcher is concerned for their well-being because of what they have written. We planned to, then, if possible, engage the participant in discussion about which source of support they wish to use (potential sources were established prior to interviewing), inform the other members of the research team, contact an appropriate source of (local) support, and facilitate contact between the participant and the support service. This protocol was to be completed, whenever possible, within 24 hours of the incident. However, we did not have the opportunity to utilize the adverse incident protocol, so we are unable to judge whether it would have been effective.</p>
<p>The online qualitative methods we have piloted seem to hold potential for researching LGBTIQ youth, but they are not a panacea. Such methods need to be utilized alongside conventional face-to-face methods to ensure diverse samples. It is important that the experiences of all young people are included in developing understandings of nonnormative sexual and gender identities and emotional distress. Health research, practice, and policy tend to privilege data generated through quantitative methods. Qualitative approaches to health research continue to be argued strongly (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311425052">Cheek, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049732311425052">Thorne, 2011</xref>). We suggest that the value of online qualitative methods is that they are able produce in-depth, “immediate” data from a vulnerable, marginalized population group, thus offering the potential to explain why young LGBTIQ people might be at a higher risk of emotional distress and DSH.</p>
