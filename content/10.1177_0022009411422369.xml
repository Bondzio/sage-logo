<abstract>
<p>Overwhelming the Trocadéro’s majestic esplanade, the Soviet and German pavilions faced each other in a commanding gesture across the central axis of the Paris ‘Exposition des arts et des techniques dans la vie moderne’ – the last French World’s Expo in the twentieth century. More often than not, the two pavilions have been dismissed in architectural terms as having merely ‘competed in archeological rhetoric’. In this article I argue, with a primary focus on the Soviet Pavilion, that far from displaying such reductive and unambiguous architectural qualities, each pavilion offered, in two very different ways, a complex response to the challenges of an exhibition dedicated to ‘modern life’. The two instrumentalized for their own political purposes both modernity and historicism. From two radically different ideological starting points, the pavilions exploited some significant aspects of the defunct avant-gardes, while reaching out, in different degrees, for stabilizing references to classicism. Frank Lloyd Wright’s unwavering admiration for the Soviet Pavilion, the main topic of this article, resonates with the astonishing discovery of white Suprematist ‘Arkhitektoni’ by Malevich’s disciple, sculptor Nikolaj Suetin gracing the interior of the Soviet Pavilion. The legacy raises the question of thus far unsuspected survival of the architectural avant-garde deep into the years of Stalin’s totalitarian terror.</p>

<p>What a pity that architecture in Soviet Russia is not as free as the man, so that the millennium might be born at once where the road is more open than anywhere else, instead of again wearisomely temporizing with the old time lag and back drag of human ignorance where culture is concerned.</p>

<p>Dominating the new Trocadéro’s majestic esplanade, the Soviet and German pavilions faced each other in a commanding gesture across the central axis of the Paris ‘International Exposition of the Arts and Technology in Modern Life’<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009411422369">2</xref> – the last French World’s Expo in the twentieth century. The Soviet pavilion’s power came to its fullest expression when observed against the Eiffel Tower from the Trocadéro; the German pavilion was best seen in the context of the classicizing palace. Designed by Boris Iofan (1891–1976), an Odessa born architect of Jewish descent, the Soviet pavilion emulated the Eiffel Tower’s bold vertical ascent; the German pavilion, by Albert Speer (1905–81), inscribed itself provocatively in the new, modernized classicist landscape of Paris.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009411422369">3</xref> The two designers were, respectively, Stalin and Hitler’s favorite architects. Representing opposing totalitarian systems, the pavilions formed a triumphal gate framing the Eiffel Tower in compliance with the site-plan the Exhibition’s chief architect Jacques Gréber (1882–1962)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009411422369">4</xref> conceived in 1934. Jacques Carlu (1890–1976), the chief architect of Paris, had suggested the profile of the ‘gate’ in a 1935 winning competition entry.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009411422369">5</xref> The new style of the Trocadéro (after the 1937 remodeling of Jean-Antoine-Gabriel Davioud’s 1878 palace) echoed the French ‘<italic>rappel à l’ordre</italic>’ of the 1930s – a stripped classicism Albert Speer likened to his own ‘National Socialist architecture’.

<p>In an accomplished ‘Beaux-Arts’ gesture, the fair’s chief architect balanced two concavely curved pavilions – Rob Mallet-Stevens’ Palais de la Lumière and Albert Laprade’s Pavillion de la Paix – set at each extremity of the master axis named for the occasion ‘Avenue de la Paix’. This plan thus underscored the dominant themes of the fair: light and peace. While the Trocadéro and the Eiffel Tower (‘Arts and Technology’) became focal points of the composition, the river Seine formed its minor transverse axis, with the German and Soviet pavilions at each end.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009411422369">6</xref></p>
<p>The juxtaposition of Soviet and German pavilions has been looked at in other scholarly works, which have, at times, superficially dismissed them as having merely ‘competed in archeological rhetoric’.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009411422369">7</xref> The historic circumstances of the 1937 Paris fair are well documented as well; and so is the significance of the visual confrontation between National Socialism and Stalinism.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009411422369">8</xref> The ambition of the present article is to transcend the extant scholarship by locating the aesthetic and political discourse within a more elaborate framework, with an emphasis on the survival of Constructivism, and even Suprematism deep into Stalin’s cultural revolution most visible in the 1937 Paris pavilion itself. This aspect of the architectural production has received no scholarly consideration thus far.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009411422369">9</xref> The article also looks retrospectively to earlier similar Soviet representations, while discussing simultaneously highly relevant shifts in aesthetic expressions that took place in the Soviet Union in the first decade of Stalin’s established power. In so doing, the article captures the diversity of architectural and other debates of the decade, while bringing new arguments in rejecting the blanket assessments of socialist realism as a mere historicist visual expression, clearly stated in the pavilion’s own contradictions.</p>
<p>Much observed in the press, the perceived ‘confrontation’ of the Russian and German pavilions embodied emblematically the European democracies’ secret hopes that war with Hitler might be averted if these two totalitarian giants could be pitted against each other.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009411422369">10</xref> Given this symbiotic relationship of the two pavilions, it is not surprising that most contemporary accounts rarely spoke about one pavilion without bringing the other into focus. Each pavilion offered in its own way a complex response to the challenges of an exhibition dedicated to ‘the arts and technology in <italic>modern life’ </italic>[emphasis added]<italic>.</italic> From radically different ideological origins, they instrumentalized for their own political purposes both historicism and modernity.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009411422369">11</xref> The two pavilions exploited significant aspects of modernity, while using in different degrees stabilizing classical forms.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009411422369">12</xref></p>
<p>Though both of the Paris pavilions were composed of a pedestal and a statue, each belonged to disparate architectural territories. Because of its static character, Germany’s magnified the dynamic, ‘futuristic’ energy of the Soviet’s. The intentional contrast between them appeared most vividly at night. Then, the Soviet pavilion became a sweeping, brisk horizontal, with a sudden upward surge.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009411422369">13</xref> In contrast, the German pavilion stood as a motionless stud. Its horizontal body remaining in darkness, the pavilion’s immobility was further consolidated as a deeply rooted, solitary pillar. As for its maker, Speer readily accepted Gréber’s request to harmonize his pavilion with the Trocadéro’s new building by reducing its size by one fifth. How well he succeeded is evident in the panoramic photographs of the two buildings (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022009411422369">Fig. 2</xref>).
<fig id="fig3-0022009411422369" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Cartoon from the journal <italic>Candide</italic>, 15 July 1937.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022009411422369-fig3.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig4-0022009411422369" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Soviet and German pavilions at night.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022009411422369-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Paradoxically, correspondences between the two pavilions appear inverted, when invisible structural components are considered. Like the remodeled Trocadéro, whose old, undistinguished structure was now encased in an expanded box of marble, the Soviet pavilion used marble to cover a conventional structure. Conversely, Siemens and Krupp’s highly innovative steel structure of the German pavilion, as <italic>L’Architecture d’aujourd’hui</italic> reported, could be paralleled to the Eiffel Tower’s engineering sophistication<bold>. </bold>The only part of the Soviet pavilion exhibiting an original technical achievement was Paris-educated Vera Muhina’s monumental six-story statue.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009411422369">14</xref> Attached to an elegant system of riveted and welded 48-ton steel frame, the structural engineer P.N. L’vov devised at the Moscow Central Institute of Mechanics and Metal Works, the stainless steel shell, a major pride of the new Soviet industry, was used here for the first time in art. The envelope, weighing eight tons, was hammered to a wooden form and then secured to the main frame with an elaborate welding process. Stakhanovite (‘shock’) workers put the whole together in only 13 days.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009411422369">15</xref> Unlike the Germans who brought their own crews, the Soviets built their Pavilion exclusively with French workers.</p>
<p>These significant distinctions between the two pavilions were not lost on contemporaries. Echoing a widespread view, Perret asserted that Iofan’s work, ‘this large pedestal which carries a giant statue, is the work of a veritable artist,’ unlike the German pavilion ‘which carries nothing, and whose destination is unknown’.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009411422369">16</xref> The destination was known, of course, despite German efforts to present theirs as a harbinger of peace. But Perret’s remark reflected a general self-deception among the major powers of Europe, particularly of France as the host of the Fair.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022009411422369">17</xref> The critic of <italic>Arhitektura SSSR</italic> seemed closest to the mark: he called Speer’s pavilion a ‘stocky pedestal for a monument to Bismarck’.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022009411422369">18</xref></p>
<p>While this reading of hostile pavilions facing each other across the ‘Avenue de la Paix’ axis became immediately a defining, iconic view of the 1937 Fair, the reception of the pavilions in their respective countries amounted to the exact opposite. In images they published of their pavilions, German and Soviet journals censored with razorblade precision the pavilion of the other, not without creating a disturbing sense of imbalance.</p>
<p>As the German Pavilion’s designer wrote in his memoirs, he allegedly came across the Soviet project accidentally, choosing a rigid tower to counter the energy of the Soviet’s frontal, sweeping ‘aggression’.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022009411422369">19</xref> Iofan’s decision to enclose his pavilion in marble came after he learned the Germans would use expensive Bavarian granite.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022009411422369">20</xref> Another contest was over whose pavilion would be taller. At one point, the Germans demanded that their pavilion be moved two meters closer to Stalin’s, thus reinforcing the notorious ‘clash’ between the two. In response, the Soviets requested that their own Pavilion be moved forward by the same length. This near comic competition was virtually endless. Initially, the French government had offered a subsidy of 750,000 Francs for each pavilion, about 25 per cent more than that allotted other pavilions, national and foreign. As costs soared with the weight of the two enormous structures to be built over a tunnel, France agreed to increase their subsidy by 500,000 francs which was the total sum French pavilions such as George-Henri Pingusson’s ‘Union des Artistes Modernes’ (UAM) or Le Corbusier’s ‘Temps Nouveaux,’ were to receive from the Exhibition administration. Immediately, the Germans requested the same amount. As the work proceeded, however, the Soviets realized they would need yet another increase. At this point, Edmond Labbé, the Exhibition’s Commissioner General, refused to comply, assuming Speer would request the same hike in this endless cycle of demands.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022009411422369">21</xref> Invisible to the fair’s visitors, these chess moves of two dystopias emulating each other were, ironically emblematic of the soon to start secret diplomacy, leading to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Non-aggression act two years later.

<p>Lit like most official buildings and installations of the Nazi government, the German pavilion at night acquired the appearance of a giant luminescent topaz, its gilded mosaics lining the folds between pillars and reflecting concealed light sources. Echoing the new Trocadéro, the pavilion applied some of the Trocadéro’s basic lighting techniques, used for the first time in a world fair. However, unlike the Trocadéro whose façades were softly illuminated by concealed light sources, the light Zeiss-Ikon designed for the Germans illuminated only the building’s interstices, creating the ghostly appearance of a photo-negative. Even by day, the Trocadéro distanced itself from the blunt rigidity of the Nazi pavilion’s lines by modulating its forms with a degree of baroque softness in its concave surfaces and curved masses. While the Trocadéro embraced the viewers, the German pavilion kept them at bay. In a medieval spirit, foreign to the Palace’s classicist modernity, the use of mosaics exacerbated the pavilion’s photonegative quality: reflected light transformed the swastika-patterned ceramics of the folds into the apparent sources of its light. As contemporaries noted, ‘at night, bowls and sources of indirect light lit the tower so that, with its mosaics, the tower appeared to be a chiseled crystal and a source of light in its own right.’<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022009411422369">22</xref> Virtually dematerializing the massive building’s interstices, the diffused, indirect lighting reinforced the translucency of its ‘negative’ pilasters, adding to the nightly electric phantasmagoria to which the entire fair was dedicated in the name of modernity, Shhmidt-Ehmen’s nine-meter tall eagle and swastika on top of the 54-meter building was also gilded. With its crystalline appearance, Speer’s pavilion seemed a ghostly simulation of the Bauhaus ideal: ‘democratic transparency.’ Think, for example, of Werkbund glass-constructions, such as Gropius’ 1911 ‘Fagus factory’ with its large expanses of glass, or the two glass towers of his ‘Model Factory’ at the 1914 Werkbund exhibition in Cologne, where Bruno Taut’s ‘Glass Pavilion’ took center stage, or finally, the 1925 Bauhaus main building in Dessau.

<p>Speer’s (and Wekbund’s) crystalline light-play was no accident. References to the crystal architecture found in German medieval mythology reappeared throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century: notably in Wagner’s operas as a symbol of celestial Jerusalem; in the poetry of Paul Scheerbart – Bruno Taut’s source of inspiration; in German cinematography preceding the Nazi takeover, like Leni Riefenstahl’s ‘Das Blau Licht’ after a legend on Monte Cristallo; in Feininger’s ‘Glass Cathedral of the Future,’ etched on the cover of the 1919 Bauhaus Manifesto – or, for that matter, Taut’s own crystal temples forming his City Crowns.</p>
<p>With its huge ‘negative’ pilasters, which recalled the vertical search lights of the Nuremberg Licht Dom (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0022009411422369">Fig. 6</xref>); the pavilion’s gloomy skylight, which evoked Speer’s design for Hitler’s chancellery; and with the display of unlikely glass saxophones under the room’s 40 chandeliers, the pavilion brimmed with artifice. Even the enormous Zeppelin engine – a majestic specimen of industrial sophistication, raised on a pedestal under the chandeliers – gave the ambiguous appearance of a gigantic black crystal set in a quasi-Biedermeier salon, indeed ‘Hitler’s Salon’.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022009411422369">23</xref> It seems that this alliance of retro-provincialism with state-of the-art technology formed the core of Nazi aesthetic choices or to quote Joachim Fest, the marriage of ‘Biedermeier and Modernity’.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022009411422369">24</xref> Even a piano, the indispensable symbol of bourgeois achievement, reigned among incongruously misplaced objects and knick-knack window casings lining the walls with boredom. The sepulchral light in the windowless pavilion only reinforced the tomb-like aspect of the exterior – an oversized sarcophagus and a tombstone.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022009411422369">25</xref></p>
<p>An almost complete absence of photography as an art of display struck the contemporary observer already accustomed to flashy photomontages, not alien to the Nazis. Instead, immense ‘naturalistic’ oil paintings matching the retro style of the chandeliers that cast their vacillating light over a futuristic Mercedes-Benz racing car, represented on the walls industrial magnates like Leuna Werke. The Mercedes was branded with a swastika. Only small photographs surrounded the car, in addition to those that illustrated the Zeiss factory. Besides sleek machinery, precision instruments, electric and industrial innovations, the pavilion housed several displays of television circuits, including a video-telephone for visitors’ use. All these cutting-edge phenomena – Germany’s visible ‘will to modernity’ – showed under dim light and stood buried in stone. Embodying paradoxes and anachronisms, the pavilion seemed suspended between conservatism and modernity, reality and its simulation.</p>
<p>In tune with the official German speeches at the fair, Hitler’s pavilion proclaimed its dedication to peace. Yet its very foundations rested on the premise of war. Reduced in size to one-fifth of its original scale, the pavilion still concealed 3000 tons of steel behind pink granite veneer of equal weight. This steel structure was cast at the Herman Goering Werke, a military installation. The pavilion’s floor was covered with a synthetic, red rubber coat, referring, I contend, to the Nazi flag. A continuous band of hardwood parquet separated the red rubber surface from the walls, reinforcing the appearance of a flag. A first version of the pavilion, sufficiently advanced to be sent to Paris as an official blueprint, seems to confirm my hypothesis. This design featured a pavilion split at two thirds of its length to accommodate an intermediary porch. The floor, like the Reich’s flag, was branded with an enormous swastika in its center.
<fig id="fig7-0022009411422369" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Interior view of the German pavilion with oil paintings depicting large German factories.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022009411422369-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>From the exterior to the interior, from wallpapers to mosaics, wrought iron balustrades to the Mercedes racing car, the entire pavilion was full to the top with swastika-based designs – the only, if abstracted, reference to the regime’s ideology. In sharp contrast with the Soviet’s ubiquitous images of Stalin, virtually no portrait of Hitler was to be found in the German pavilion, a shrewd propaganda move by omission.</p>
<p>Steel and rubber, symbols of modern industry, stood for two essential economic achievements of Hitler’s war preparation. All the materials used in the pavilion’s construction, totaling 10,000 tons, were brought from Germany. French firms built only the foundations. The Germans brought the entire crew of 1000 workers from Germany, prefiguring, as it were, the imminent German invasion. The decision to bring workers from Germany to a large extent resulted from the country’s late acceptance to take part in the fair, but also to project the image of the Nazi regime’s high efficiency, in contrast to the ‘disorderly’ appearances of a Front Populaire democracy gripped with social unrest.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022009411422369">26</xref> They ultimately succeeded. The only three pavilions ready for the opening of the exhibition were the Fascist Italian, the Stalinist Soviet and the Nazi German.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022009411422369">27</xref></p>
<p>Germany had traditionally depended on Sweden and Norway for its steel, since domestic iron ore was too poor to be economically viable. In the prospect of war, Germany could no longer risk this dependence. As private industrial magnates had no interest in producing unprofitable steel, Hitler ordered Goering to create such an industry through state intervention. The same order was given for rubber, another vital war material almost absent in German manufacture. So, in the largest factory of its kind in the world, I.G. Farben, the Nazi regime started producing at greater costs a more resistant, synthetic rubber, the Buna, out of domestic coal. Eventually, the entire German war machine was fed from this plant’s three franchises, one of which was moved to Oświęcim, renamed Auschwitz as soon as Poland was occupied in 1939. Removed far enough eastward, Allied air forces could not reach the factory. I.G. Farben also produced a component of, and held the patent for, the pesticide ‘Zyklon B’ which was ultimately used in the Nazi extermination campaigns.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022009411422369">28</xref></p>
<p>Whereas the properties of the two materials – Buna rubber for the floor, and Goering steel for the structure – were tested on the pavilion, the pink granite and the scintillating chandeliers, which brought the pavilion a gold medal, masked them successfully. Granite and crystal blurred the origin and scope of the two materials in the same way the oil paintings on the walls, representing industrial corporations such as Krupp, gave these industries the allure of benign domesticity. Indeed, the implications of the pavilion’s black steel and red rubber went unnoticed: the public perceived only the building’s ‘ Olympian serenity’.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022009411422369">29</xref> The silence of the German pavilion’s classicism managed to conceal the rumbling of Germany’s modern war industry.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022009411422369">30</xref></p>
<p>Still imbued with memories of a receding avant-garde art, the Soviet leadership strove to simulate modernity as a means of ideological self-legitimating.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022009411422369">31</xref> Classicizing overtones, such as rigorous axiality and bi-polar symmetry, appeared primarily as a concession to an increasingly conservative society – ‘… an autocratic Russian ghost[s] (..) clothed in socialist garb’.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022009411422369">32</xref> In constant competition with the motionless German pavilion, the dynamic Soviet building Iofan designed in his Kremlin office prompted an analogous, yet opposing design strategy. Frank Lloyd Wright greatly admired the Soviet pavilion for its ‘low, extended and suitable base for the dramatically realistic sculpture it carries.’ He regarded Iofan’s pavilion as ‘… the most dramatic and successful exhibition building at the Paris fair… Here, on the whole, is a master architect’s conception that walks away with the Paris fair.’<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0022009411422369">33</xref> Comparing the other winning entries in the Soviet competition for the pavilion, including Mel’nikov’s and Moisej Ginzburg’s, a quick look at the projects suffices to conclude that Iofan’s pavilion was undeniably the best.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022009411422369">34</xref></p>
<p>Like the German pavilion, Iofan’s monument used light to reinforce its own myth. While Speer erected a frozen ‘Licht Dom’ that referred, in an Epimethean gesture, to the depth of a mystical folklore, Iofan conjured visions of a Promethean future standing for humanity’s age-long quest for redemptive self-realization.</p>
<p>At night, the pavilion turned into a comet dragging a tail of brilliant streaks with its glittery ribbon windows ‘sliding’ along multiple receding cornices (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022009411422369">Fig. 4</xref>). Swirling lights projected from the Eiffel Tower were reflected off its polished Samarkand marble. Formed as a giant pedestal, the pavilion carried a forward thrusting couple: a ‘Male factory Worker’ (‘Rabotnik’) and a ‘Female Collective-Farm Worker’ (‘Kolhoznitsa’). The silhouette of the shiny steel sculpture loosely espoused in profile the form of a five-pointed star of the Third International that preceded the Soviet symbol of the hammer and sickle.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0022009411422369">35</xref> More to the point, Muhina’s sculptural composition recalled, now in a ‘realistic’ mode, El Lissitzky’s 1920 new design for Malevich’s cubo-futurist ‘Victory over the Sun,’ first played in 1913. Lissitzky’s figure also featured a star, or rather two of them, a red and a black, apparently acknowledging the role of the Anarchists in the Russian Revolution in the ongoing Civil War.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022009411422369">36</xref> The reference to Lissitzky’s work of the early 1920s clearly pointed to the persistence of the avant-garde’s spirit in the imaginaries of Soviet artists, even when a switch in leadership occurred from the artistic avant-garde to a ‘Party vanguard’. Started in 1928 under Stalin’s ‘Revolution from above’, the vision of a mythical working class vanguard sponsored by the party and sanctioned by the state was gradually replacing the authentic artistic avant-garde.

<p>In keeping with the Bolshevik self-perceived roots in ancient Greek democracy<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0022009411422369">37</xref> and the French Enlightenment, Muhina and Iofan admitted a wide span of sources: from Doric – such as the fifth-century BC, bronze paired group of the <italic>Tyrannicides</italic> Harmodios and Aristogeiton – to Hellenistic – such as the Louvre’s second century Victory of Samothrace. Architecture topped with a giant sculpture could be found in the work of the French ‘revolutionary’ Neoclassicist of the late eighteenth century, Jean-Jacques Lequeu (1757–1826). The gigantism of the pavilion and of its statue evoked equally the spirit of Louis-Etienne Boullée’s architecture (1728–99), another ‘revolutionary’ French neo-classicist of the period, also featuring the predilection of the time for an ‘<italic>architecture ensevelie</italic>’. When Wright describes the Soviet pavilion as being a ‘low, extended and suitable base…’ he actually perceives its ‘sunken’ aspect, which reinforces the image Iofan desired of a boat moving towards Communism led by its ‘Victory’ as were the boats in ancient Greece. Even though Boullé’s projects were conceived before the French Revolution, they were routinely associated with it in Russia.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0022009411422369">38</xref> Immediately after 1917, references to both Boullée’s ‘<italic>architecture ensevelie</italic>’<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0022009411422369">39</xref> and themes from Claude-Nicholas Ledoux’s (1736–1806), or else Lequeu’s ‘<italic>architecture parlante</italic>’ could be found in the work of Russian Modernists.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0022009411422369">40</xref></p>
<p>Translating the official claims of the new vanguard, the sculpture was also meant to represent men and women’s joint struggle for emancipation, with peasants added to industrial workers in contradiction to Marx’s concept of a proletarian revolution. Replacing the black and red stars with a hammer and sickle, the couple was supposed to embody the promise of history as predicated by the tenets of Lenin’s dialectical materialism. This Leninist theme was now interpreted in the key of Stalin’s new social, political and economic order, he referred to as ‘Perestroika’.</p>
<p>The credo Bolsheviks derived from a form of historic determinism inexistent in Marx, led ultimately (in its Stalinian version ‘according to which universal reason is objectivised [sic] in the guise of inexorable laws of historical progress…’ <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0022009411422369">41</xref>) to a metaphysical notion of the party as the ‘vanguard of the proletariat’ – a vanguard historically destined to open the road for the final and irrevocable liberation of humanity, to which Muhina’s sculpture pointed with passion.</p>
<p>It is, therefore, no accident that at night, the visual means Iofan and Muhina chose to represent such promise evoked strikingly well the messianic call of the allegorical shooting star that led the Kings to the Savior’s cradle. Having gained control over history, Muhina’s ‘star’ pointed to the path humanity was called to take. As a whole, the Soviet pavilion reverted to the representation of an eschatological drive to salvation ingrained in the Communist project. In more than one way, indeed, the monument resonated with the tradition of Russian icons as ‘images of holy figures seen in the light of heaven in which the people believed so as to make the visible world around them credible’.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0022009411422369">42</xref> Firmly set on its sweeping, futuristic ‘iconostasis,’ Muhina’s idealized couple – the metaphor of a modern idea transplanted into a pre-modern condition – echoed Dostoyevsky’s claim that ‘ God took seeds from other worlds and sowed them on this world’ to clarify its higher, prophetic meaning. Newly established icons, which obliterated alienation ‘through the contact with other mysterious worlds’, mediated the discrepancy between reality and ideal.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0022009411422369">43</xref> The mystery of these abstract worlds provided crude reality with means of redemption.</p>
<p>Amidst a prolonged global economic crises and increasing threats of war as Mussolini’s Blue Division fought side by side with Franco’s rebels, and Hitler bombed Guernica, the promise placed in the hands of Muhina’s sculpture did not escape the public’s attention. Sensing its mythical power, even the critic of the conservative art magazine <italic>Beaux-Arts</italic> saw in the couple ‘an answer to the many painful questions that assail, at this hour, all those who live and suffer.’<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0022009411422369">44</xref> Finally, like the allegorical couple, the authors of the pavilion themselves were a man and a woman advocating equality of the two in Soviet society and beyond.</p>
<p>When Stalin secured his position as the absolute leader and interpreter of the Revolution, Marxism and history alike, this former seminarian translated Marxian thought into catechism-like precepts. These included his <italic>Digest Marxism in Six Points</italic>, imbued with scholastic nominalism, or <italic>The Short Course of the History of the All-Union 'Communist Party (of the Bolsheviks)',</italic> which turned history into a canonical breviary<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0022009411422369">45</xref></p>
<p>Stalin’s grip on power was strengthened, if not completely assured, at the Sixteenth Party Congress in 1930. By 1931, the most powerful Politburo member after Stalin, Lazar Kaganovič, was organizing the direct involvement of the party in artistic and intellectual activities. His preference for historicism contradicted Stalin's interest in American mainstream modernism so visible in the Soviet pavilion. The triangulation: Stalin, Kaganovič and the Constructivists, resulted in a virtual tug of war about the future of architecture that lasted to the end of the decade. The Soviet pavilion in Paris expressed all three.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0022009411422369">46</xref></p>
<p>Soon after the revolution, in 1919 Vladimir Tatlin designed his tower for the ‘Third International’ , with its energetic asymmetry and its implied state-of-the-art engineering, to embody the ‘free ascension of humanity.’ By 1937, strict axial balance consistent with the new Party Line replaced that vision. Clad in expensive porphyry, not the wood and glass Mel’nikov employed in his materially modest but formally complex 1925 Paris Pavilion, Iofan’s project represented a world-view that left little room for choice and doubt. Iofan replaced with linear certainty Tatlin’s ‘suspended,’ incomplete tower spiraling towards a redemptive future<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0022009411422369">47</xref>. The explosion of the new world arising out of a shattered past, implied in Mel’nikov’s work, was also gone. Both Tatlin and Mel’nikov used Lyssitzky’s notion of the diagonal as a legitimate means of energizing form. In 1937, the underlying formal premise of Tatlin’ and Mel’nikov’s structures was redirected into a theatrical posture.</p>
<p>Tatlin’s Tower was about technical virtuosity; Mel’nikov’s tectonically innovative pavilion worked from a strict economy of means. Both rested on a radical formal breakthrough. The material and technical difference between Iofan’s and Mel’nikov’s pavilions reflected the transformation of the Soviet regime within the 12 years that separated them. In Mel’nikov’s words, quoted in the official brochure, his pavilion featured ‘no elegant furniture or luxury fabrics. Visitors [could] find neither furs nor diamonds, but those able to sense the forward surge of the creative classes [were] able to appreciate the studied simplicity and the austere style of the worker’s club [Rodčenko] and the rural reading room [<italic>izba-čital'nja</italic>]. Here everything is new, everything reflects the burgeoning civilization of the two classes now leading Russia toward the reign of labor and liberty.’ <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0022009411422369">48</xref> By contrast, the ‘skin’ of Iofan’s building, the rare Samarkand marble and Black Sea porphyry, enveloped a structure of no technical distinction. While the Moscow competition program stipulated that ‘…the architecture of the pavilion [should] express the conquests of the most advanced building techniques,’ <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0022009411422369">49</xref> Iofan’s project, which, like the German pavilion, received a gold medal, expressed none. The Soviet pavilion was not rooted in the aesthetic of neoclassicism, as the German pavilion was. But, unlike the German’s, the Soviet pavilion failed to engage ‘technical modernity’ as the competition program stipulated. The luster of the marble was to make up for the banality of structure. Red, volcanic porphyry at the pavilion’s entrance with allegorical figures on its propylea by the former cubo-futurist Iosif Čajkov (1888–1979), celebrated the Stalinist ‘triumph of Socialism’.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0022009411422369">50</xref></p>
<p>Stalin proclaimed his strikingly democratic Constitution at the very peak of his ‘Moscow trials’ that followed the catastrophic famine provoked by forced collectivization. The Constitution’s passages quoted on the pavilion’s walls were surrounded by 10,000 gems inlaid on a 20m<sup>2</sup> ceramic map of the Soviet Union<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0022009411422369">51</xref> – an excess that recalled the gilded mosaics of the German pavilion. The Constitution bore little resemblance to the reality of labor camps that were the instruments of simulated economic success. If in 1937 the Soviet pavilion evoked any reality, it was the reality of a once spontaneous social movement diverted in favor of a petrified establishment – indeed the incarnation of ‘a thwarted attempt at liberation.’<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0022009411422369">52</xref></p>
<p>Nevertheless, there was more to Iofan’s work than compliance. Beyond its theatrical posture, Iofan’s pavilion harbored a radical departure from conventional Socialist Realism as it has come to be known. The competition program required that the pavilion be ‘an exhibition object in itself, and an expression of the thriving of socialist art and culture, of the technique and creativity of the masses, freed by the socialist system. The Pavilion must show, through a clear and joyful architecture, the system’s creativity, and its capacity to mediate an unprecedented development of mass culture, as well as of all the creative potential of Man.’<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0022009411422369">53</xref> Iofan claimed that he solved the architectural problem as he ‘first, [gave] the Pavilion as sober form as possible; and second, avoided any commercial aspect that usually pervades exhibition stands’. Addressing one of the fair’s preferred themes, the so called ‘union of the arts’, in vogue in the 1930s both in France and the USSR, Iofan attempted to develop ‘a composition based on a synthesis of architecture and sculpture’. Ribbon windows under flexible cornices and the assemblage of volumes engaged in a dynamic tension of multiple, sliding and overlapping prismatic masses recalled Wright’s early style. Loosely resembling a hand carrying a flaming torch, Iofan’s structure struck the viewer as a skillful compression of multiple architectural experiments – Futurism and Cubism, Neoplasticism and, most surprisingly, Malevich’s Suprematism itself. What is more, Iofan’s structure possessed intriguing analogies with Rationalist architecture, detectable, for example, in Ladovskij’s 1925 competition entry for Paris, second prize in the Moscow competition. As an example of ‘<italic>architecture parlante</italic>’, Iofan’s work reflected in a ‘realistic’ rendition, the psychological principles of Soviet Rationalist architectural experiments.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0022009411422369">54</xref> As the official program required, Iofan aimed at ‘[giving] the Soviet Pavilion an especially solemn and commemorative character, speaking to the immense achievements of the Soviet regime’.</p>
<p>The comparison of Mel’nikov’s dynamic staircase travelling obliquely through his 1925 pavilion, with Iofan’s monumental stairs splitting his pavilion rigidly in two symmetrical halves, is revealing of the stylistic and ideological realignment that had taken place. And yet, not only did the exterior of Iofan’s design encompass some modernist quests – albeit set in an axial framework of symmetrically composed marble slabs – but the interior too was decorated with Nikolaj Suetin’s abstract Suprematist sculptures – Suprematism, belonging to one of the most radical avant-garde movements, harked back to Kazimir Mal’evich’s <italic>Arhitektony</italic> of the early 1920s. These precast forms, that went unnoticed thus far, mirrored each other along an ascending axis, clearly indicating the place Suprematism still held in the work of Soviet artists. In other words, if some forms of modernism were still alive in the architecture of the 1930s, Suetin’s Suprematist sculptures indicate that this was true to a certain degree for avant-garde art as well. The monument left no one indifferent, not even Flank Lloyd Wright.

<p>Wright’s testimony about his conversations with Iofan and other Soviet architects whom he called ‘the liberated ones’ confirms this limited awareness, and, more importantly, a degree of genuine enthusiasm and faith still pervading their activity.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0022009411422369">55</xref> Paradoxically, belief in modernism and belief in the party still overlapped. Iofan, one of the first prize winners (ex equo with an American project) in 1931 of the Palace of the Soviets international competition, was most likely sincere when he assured Wright that modern architecture would return to the Soviet Union in some 10 years, once the masses were ready to embrace it. Wright’s very presence in Moscow in 1937, not to mention Kaganovič's thus far unknown efforts to bring the Modern Movement's CIAM leaders to meet in the Soviet capital,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0022009411422369">56</xref> and Iofan's personal invitation during a Paris visit exended to Le Corbusier to join the Moscow 1937 Congress, were there to prove it.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0022009411422369">57</xref> Upon his return from Moscow, Wright wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>The attitude of the Russian architects is sincere and, I am sure, far in advance of the social consciousness of our own American architects. I do not know one architect among us who looks so far in the future, able to smile indulgently at his own present effort, perspective given by a fine sense of humor in his idealism.’ <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0022009411422369">58</xref></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Wright registered in particular Karo Alabjan’s humorous, self-deprecating remarks regarding his Red Army Theater designed under the sponsorship of the first ranking Politburo member Kaganovič. Showing the theater to Wright, Alabjan pointed out its continuous peristyle of some 40 pseudo classical columns. ‘I thought I would put all the columns I would have to use the rest of my life into this building, and be done with it,’ he chuckled.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0022009411422369">59</xref>

<p>A direct reference to the machine aesthetics that some early Russian modernists shared with Stalin’s concept of modernity, was a magnificent black, sinuous Ford limousine, branded as GAZ, and produced under license since 1927 in the city of Nižnij Novgorod<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0022009411422369">60</xref> (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0022009411422369">Fig. 12</xref>). A similar modern automobile was strategically photographed in front of avant-garde and Stalinist architectural works considered important. Another graced the Italianate ‘Socialist Realist’ Frunze Military Academy rest home, opened the same year.</p>
<p>Placed on a monumental pedestal, a landing halfway up the ceremonial stairs, the GAZ reflected the Soviet eagerness to catch up with America’s technology, and in particular to conquer the redemptive mythology of the assembly line that created the legend of the United States industry. The Ford also referred indirectly to Lenin’s fascination with Taylorism, associated to the allegory of the ‘Electric Man’ that Vladimir Mayakovsky (1893–1930) celebrated in his poems and Gustav Klucis (1895–1938) represented in his posters as a Lenin carrying high-tension posts in a drive to electrify the country. Ford’s success with his Model ‘T’ produced on an assembly line and the broad possibilities it represented for the advancement of the ‘masses’ resonated deeply within the Leninist movement. Diego Rivera’s depiction of Henry Ford’s automobile production in a mural at the Detroit Museum of the Fine Arts speaks of the fascination with Ford that was characteristic of communists worldwide. In the Soviet Union, taking center stage on the mural, Ford and his Model ‘T’ were regarded as testaments to the promises of democratization through industrial production and the emancipation from rural backwardness.</p>
<p>The concept of the ‘Electric Man,’ with harmonious, rational and efficient movements – the ultimate urbanized human being – also informed El Lyssitzky’s ‘New Man’ featured in the 1921 version of the ‘Victory over the Sun.’ The Italian Futurists shared the theme of the ‘Electric Man.’ Both Russians and Italians celebrated being liberated from historically and biologically imposed constraints, and therefore in command of a substantial amount of liberated leisure time for human edification. The theme was also underlying Dziga Vertov’s films, in particular his <italic>Man with a Movie Camera</italic> (1929).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0022009411422369">61</xref> Lenin’s claim that ‘Communism is the power of the Soviets plus electrification,’ with the ‘soviets’ representing direct democracy and ‘electricity’ a society of abundance, was the bedrock of abiding Soviet aspirations in the first decade after the October revolution.</p>
<p>Since the end of the eighteenth century, the mystique of electricity held a central place in the collective consciousness of the public in industrializing societies. It was expressed in the wake of the Enlightenment in the works of architects such as in Louis-Etienne Boullée’s (1728–99) architecture. At the Paris Fair, where light played a central role, electricity was celebrated as ‘La Fée Electricité’ in the monumental murals of Raoul Dufy (1877–1953) painted for Rob Mallet-Stevens’s (1886–1945) ‘Electricity Pavilion’ that closed the Fair’s grand axis.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0022009411422369">62</xref> Laprade’s ‘Peace Column’, erected on the plaza behind the Trocadéro and with the Eiffel Tower across from it at the opposite end of the Fair’s Avenue de la Paix, coupled industrial progress and peace. In his ten-volume <italic>Rapport</italic>, the exhibition’s <italic>Comissaire Général</italic> Edmond Labbé, a former government inspector of technical education, still called electricity a ‘supra natural force.’ Electricity was equally part of Giuseppe Terragni’s ‘Realismo Magico’ as translated into his ‘Casa Elettrica,’ or even better, in his pervasively ‘electrified’ <italic>Casa del Fascio</italic> in Como.</p>
<p>The allegory of the Electric Man was closely related to the mystique of the automobile. The GAZ, placed as an art object halfway up the pavilion’s monumental staircase, basked in a surrealist glow. Granted that all kinds of incongruous objects are inevitably the lot of world’s exposition pavilions, an automobile pedestalled on a high stairwell landing, only underscored, by contrast, that in the Soviet Union hardly anyone owned a car. Acting more as an art piece than an object of use, the Ford, framed by Suprematist <italic>Arhitektony</italic>, had the unintended effect of ‘distanciation’ or ‘ e<italic>n</italic>strangement’ that in the early 1920s the Russian Formalists used to explain the essence of art. In the panoply of avant-garde artwork, such as Tatlin’s Corner Sculptures, everyday objects and materials ‘covered by the dross’ of banal use were mutually confronted to reveal their unsuspected connections to the sublime;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0022009411422369">63</xref> in 1937 the opposite became true: mythical objects masked the dreary reality of everyday life – <italic>‘an ideological simulation of reality’.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0022009411422369">64</xref></italic> Placed on such unlikely pedestal, the car could also be ‘read’ as a Marcel Duchamp found object, removed from its customary context, placement and use. Like the liberal ‘Stalinian Constitution’ exhibited in the pavilion, this ‘Stalinian car’ was suspended in a sphere of its own, as relevant to everyday life as a museum object.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0022009411422369">65</xref> In the early 1920s, the avant-garde indulged in innovative re-assemblages of common materials and objects in search for life’s unsuspected dimensions. By the end of the 1930s, the reverse was becoming true: extraordinary objects served as means to cloak reality. If untruthful representations, exacerbated by nationalist competitiveness, were often difficult to avoid in World Expos, both the pavilion and its displays were set to replace reality with illusion and everyday life with myth. Were the references to a modernist formal vocabulary themselves part of a conscious delusion? Kaganovič’s double standards might point in that direction.</p>
<p>In this Stalinist world of deceit that André Gide, a French communist party ally, so poignantly described in his 1936 <italic>Retour de l’URRS</italic>, Wright’s reaction to his Moscow experience was one of disarming candor: ‘Who can help loving such liberal, great-hearted fellows?’ he exclaimed, referring to the enthusiasm he sensed even as late as 1937 among the architects he met. Comparing the situation to the one in the United States ‘past long ago,’ Wright effectively underwrote the attitude the party leadership entertained towards the ‘masses’ as he stated, ‘Nothing pleases them [the masses] so much as the gleam of marble columns under high ceilings, glittering chandeliers, unmistakable luxury.’ Agreeing with Stalin, Wright warned that, ‘just now is no time to offer the liberated ones the higher simplicity which repudiates the falsity of that sort of luxury. This is no time to insist upon something they could not understand.’</p>
<p>Charles Pomaret, the 1937 Exhibition’s special envoy to the USSR, did not miss the trend. Upon his return from Moscow in January 1936, he remarked that the architectural achievements the Russians intended to exhibit in Paris were ‘of no distinction whatsoever’. In the Soviet Union, he said, ‘a taste for the New York skyscraper [was] becoming increasingly popular.’A number of critics of the most recent Soviet architectural developments held this view.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0022009411422369">66</xref> The fascination with ‘America’, the beacon of modernity, had always loomed large behind the Leninist doctrine. Pomaret was alluding to a growing number of designs for high-rises, among which Iofan’s 1934 and 1936 versions of the Place of the Soviets were prominent. Compelled to relinquish modernism but not modernization (Stalin’s first Five-Year-Plan for a fast industrial modernization was, after all, in full swing), Soviet architects were gradually adopting an American mainstream architectural simile known as ‘American corporate architecture.’ In 1937, the keynote speaker at the First Congress of Soviet architects, the Tsarist architectural chameleon A. V. Ščusev, author of the Lenin Mausoleum, was quite explicit when he insisted that the Soviet Union should look increasingly to the West, and in particular to America for inspiration.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0022009411422369">67</xref></p>
<p>Iofan’s pavilion, indeed, reveals significant references to Raymond Hood’s (1881–1934) recently completed Rockefeller Center, which he visited in New York and which was widely publicized in the Soviet architectural press.

<p>The early sketches of the pavilion stored in the Moscow Museum of Architecture showed formal concerns comparable with two of Iofan’s previous projects: the 1934 version of his Palace of the Soviets and his competition entry for the Ministry of Heavy Industry. The ‘Rockefeller skyscrapers’ assembled in the 1936 model of the palace were replicas of the Soviet pavilion in Paris, which had been in the works since the end of 1935 when the Soviet Union accepted an invitation to participate in the Fair. It is telling that the photograph of the pavilion published in <italic>Arhitektura SSSR</italic> cropped out the statue, obviously to emphasize the structure’s affinities with its American model. With the Rockefeller Center detectable in all three projects, Iofan created an American trinity celebrating Stalin’s power.</p>
<p>This complex architectural fusion in which political power controlled contradictory, if not outright incompatible architectural programs, was part of the strategy of the new Stalinist leadership to consolidate its position on the international scene and simultaneously legitimize its image with the leftist movements that had sided or sympathized with the Bolshevik Revolution. As the Soviets considered it important to cultivate a progressive stance abroad, they generally instructed foreign communist parties, notably the French, not to adopt Socialist Realism. The explanation was that capitalist countries had not yet reached the revolutionary conditions that made Soviet realism possible – a bizarre inversion of the Soviet architects’ claim that modernism would come back when the ‘masses’ were ready for it. The two stances were the opposite ends of the same myth.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0022009411422369">68</xref> Aware that pressing his own brand of official art would alienate the unwavering support he counted on amid progressive artists, Stalin also considered it important to convince the world that he had no designs for spreading the Bolshevik Revolution. Trotsky’s ‘permanent revolution’ or Marx’s view that socialism could be successful only if achieved worldwide, were abandoned in favor of Stalin’s determination to ‘build Socialism in a single country’ – the stated goal of his Perestroika.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0022009411422369">69</xref>

<p>An example of the official effort to project a non-threatening face abroad – one that renounced revolutionary expansionism – was the difference between the 1937 Pavilion in Paris and the 1939 Pavilion in New York, both by Iofan. The Paris Expo coincided with the rule of the Popular Front government in France, dominated by the socialists, and the Soviets felt they could safely display a hammer and sickle carried by a male industrial worker and a Collective Farm woman. This was a response to the split within the French social democratic party between its right and left wing at the 1921 Congress in Tours; the latter formed a communist party in support of the young Soviet Republic, while the former remained within the Second (socialist) International. Fifteen years later, France was undergoing the travails of a severe capitalist depression; while Russia projected the image of a country successfully building a new world that validated the communist option.</p>
<p>The message of the 1939 Soviet New York Pavilion was much more restrained. The pavilion exhibited only a diminutive five-pointed red star, a male worker brandished as a torch, lit by night like red stars on the Kremlin towers, in obvious reference to ‘Lady Liberty’s’ own. Communism was presented arguably as one of two paths that led to a single goal – human progress. In New York Stalin sought international acceptance through competition rather than confrontation, a stance toward the United States and the ‘West’ that the USSR would maintain to its final dissolution.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0022009411422369">70</xref></p>
<p>Responding ingeniously to the technical difficulties a rising underpass of the Avenue de Tokyo<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0022009411422369">71</xref> presented, running under the German and Soviet pavilions, Iofan gradually raised the floor of his own pavilion from the entrance toward the back, forming five stepping platforms connected by a central monumental stair system. He used each level to express a higher stage of the presumed revolutionary development of the country, starting with the central foyer after the entrance, brightly lit by two lateral floor-to-ceiling glass bays, a signature of modernity. The space displayed theoretical works of Marxism’s forefathers, framed left and right respectively by a ‘Stalin’ tractor (‘Stalinec’) and a ‘Stalin’ car, the ZIS (Packard)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0022009411422369">72</xref> that the ‘Father of the Peoples’ used for his daily needs. Such representation of the country’s would-be-tractors and cars appeared as a reversed Leninist concept of ‘base and superstructure,’ where the base seemed to be Marxism and the tractor and car its superstructure. In the foyer, Klucis’ large-scale photomontage adorned the frieze of the gate opening onto the monumental staircase. The work depicted the proclamation of the new constitution with a giant Stalin towering over a diminutive crowd of party delegates.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0022009411422369">73</xref>
<fig id="fig16-0022009411422369" position="float"><label>Figure 16.</label><caption><p>Last room of the pavilion with murals by Aleksandr Dejneka and Stalin’s statue by Sergej Merkurov.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022009411422369-fig16.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>As the ascension ended, past the car blocking the landing and three successive rooms, the visitor reached Sergej Merkurov’s statue of Lenin sitting in a Rodin-like ‘Thinker’ position. Beyond a large, five meter high gypsum model of Iofan’s Palace of the Soviets one finally arrived, having climbed a few more steps to the last room tucked into the windowless cloak of the building. Natural zenithal light and side ribbon windows lit the entire length of the pavilion. The last room, however, had no source of natural light of its own. It was lit only by the indirect light from the adjacent space, strongly suggesting confinement, a sudden ‘entrapment’, contrasted with the brightly lit, sunny entrance hall. The artificiality of ‘open air’ athletics A. Samohvalov depicted in arrested movements on the lateral walls reinforced the effect of entrapment. Having reached its apotheoses, the pavilion’s last space boasted in its center a larger than life statue of a standing Stalin in a Napoleonic posture – like an oversized exclamation mark. His numerous portraits throughout the pavilion hardly prepared the visitor for this solemn coda, a religious epiphany akin to the cella of an ancient temple.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0022009411422369">74</xref> The setting, with this god-like figure sculpted by Merkurov, reinforced the sense of being caught in an imaginary world. The bottom wall of this cloak, a mural by celebrated Socialist Realist Aleksandr Dejneka, showed an airy, almost floating group of people dressed in white (in those years, a widespread dressing code for the summer), smiling as they advanced behind their leader in bronze. Despite the architect and the artist’s doubtless sincerity, the ostentatious rhetoric of the monument as a whole was there to mask the discrepancy between ideals and reality.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0022009411422369">75</xref></p>
<p>Trying to present the German pavilion as an instrument of peace, Albert Speer (a high ranking member of the Nazi government) could not but be privy to the lie, which used artifice to cover a fundamental evil in the making. Conversely, Boris Iofan and Vera Muhina were privy to their hope. Regardless and despite Stalin’s terror – a ‘ historic necessity’ for some – and the gradual downsizing of the avant-garde’s achievements, the present was still but the token of the ‘Lendemains qui Chantent’. <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0022009411422369">76</xref> The enormous energy the Russian Revolution had unleashed was still far from being spent. For most architects, and not only the architects, the only choice was either to be part of history in the making or to be condemned by it.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0022009411422369">77</xref> Whether they agreed with Stalin’s ‘revolutionary’ methods or not (and many did), a much grander goal was at sake. This may well have been the most essential underlying difference between the German and the Soviet pavilions as the incarnation of two singularly different historic conditions: Epimetheus versus Prometheus.</p>
<p>In contrast with Mel’nikov’s 1925 pavilion, which revolutionized its own medium before consecrating a revolution, the 1937 Soviet pavilion was intended in the first place for the international promotion of an established order. It presented three supreme icons of industrial modernity: the automobile, the skyscraper and the Revolution. By realigning the original forms of the Russian avant-garde, now conjured to glorify an ideology of progress increasingly gutted out of its essence, the Soviet pavilion at the 1937 Paris Fair emerged as a successful harbinger of a party-sanctioned vanguard, an offshoot of Stalin’s ‘Revolution from above’. The supposed leadership of the proletariat’s vanguard, the Bolshevik Party, was sanctified in Iofan’s and Muhina’s rendition of the pavilion.</p>
<p>The survival of a significant residue among artists of a genuine devotion to the enduring myths of the Revolution, and a pervasive belief that they still could share a common ideal of revolutionary transcendence with a metaphysically conceived party<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0022009411422369">78</xref> is too often overlooked in the assessments of the period.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0022009411422369">79</xref> It is precisely the survival of such faith, so palpable in the Soviet pavilion, which accounted for much of the acclaim the pavilion received abroad, even as a hybrid between vanguard and reaction, cynicism and candor.</p>
<p>Still striving to partake in the modernist quest, albeit transfigured by an increasingly reactionary cultural environment, the new architectural trend reflected the enduring fascination with its American models. Prophesying that it would catch up with this major leader of modernity, the specific models sought after were primarily those in which the increasingly self-confident Soviet state recognized the reassuring image of its newly established social order. At the same time, the progressive architects’ surviving devotion to the Revolution – a belief so evident in the pavilion’s contradictions as a modernist interpretation of a rigid totalitarian regime – was still powerful enough to elicit admiration even from such staunched modernists as Frank Lloyd Wright. Although Soviet architects were clear that Socialist Realism was antithetical to their artistic ideals now sacrificed to the ‘masses’, the transcendental essence attributed to the party seemed to reconcile the chasm.</p>
<p>Informed by opposed ideologies – one grounded in the belief of a universal reason concretized in inexorable laws of historical progress,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0022009411422369">80</xref> the other simply grounded in radical evil – both the Soviet and the German pavilions were committed to specific political agendas. Competing for attention, both strove to overwhelm their Parisian context with the manifest intention to surpass and outdo it. The height and golden shine of the German pavilion was meant to overcome the Trocadéro’s laconic classicism; the ‘prophetic realism’ of the Soviet was intended to infuse the Eiffel Tower, built on the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution, with new purpose. What both pavilions had in common was the promotion of modernity – ambiguously in the case of the German, self-deceptively in the case of the Russian. Hitler’s tower restrained the aggressive thrust of German war industry behind a form of Epimethean nostalgia. Stalin’s monument attempted to project a Promethean image of a univocal and irreversible progress. The German pavilion <italic>concealed</italic> reality behind a classical façade; the Soviet pavilion <italic>substituted</italic> reality with fiction. Ultimately, they shared a common ground: forming together the most memorable image of the Paris Exhibition, they merged effortlessly their own representations of modernity into an unworldly mirage.</p>

<p>Oriented opposite to the river’s current the Soviet pavilion appeared from the left bank of the Seine, as if actually floating. Engaged both in the parochial and the universal, with its statue placed as an enduring Victory at the prow of an ancient boat, resisting the winds and the river’s flow, the monument managed to transcend the limits of its own attempted communist prophecy, inscribing itself into the historical landscape of the French capital whose emblem is: <italic>Fluctuat nec mergitur</italic> – it floats but does not sink.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0022009411422369">81</xref></p>

After 1922, the brochure abandoned what was until then a conventional graphic design for its cover, replacing it with a striking multicolor constructivist design with an abstracted hammer and sickle superimposed on the star with a large Roman number III.</p></fn>

The book is dedicated ‘To all, to all the children’ of the world, recalling the famous message launched from the battleship Aurora to the world upon the victory of the October Revolution. The telegraphed message started with the words ‘To all, to all,’ announcing to the nations of the world the advent of the first state lead by the Proletariat.</p></fn>

It is significant that the car branded as GAZ was not a Packard Stalin himself used – the famous ZIS (Zavody Imeni Stalina – Stalin Factories), even though by 1939 he had ordered automobile factories to produce imitations of Packards, i.e., Soviet made chassis and Packard copies for the shell.
