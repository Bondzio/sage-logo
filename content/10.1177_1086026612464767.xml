<abstract>
<p>Policy makers generally see resource extraction as a boon for local economies and citizens. Numerous studies, however, have shown negative socioeconomic outcomes in extractive communities, supporting the notion that resources can be more of a curse than a blessing. One aspect of this debate that requires further clarification is the role played by method of extraction. In this article, we use the case of West Virginia coal mining and a fixed effects model to test whether extraction methods affect socioeconomic outcomes. We observe little difference in these outcomes between surface and underground mining; rather, it is the presence or absence of mining that matters most. We find that nonmining counties have lower poverty and unemployment rates than mining counties. These results lead us to conclude that leaving remaining coal stores in the ground will likely prove most beneficial to the state’s people and economy in the long run.</p>

<p>Does resource extraction benefit local communities? Twenty years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1086026612464767">William Freudenburg (1992)</xref> addressed this misleadingly simple question and concluded it depended largely on the time frame employed. In the short term, communities are likely to benefit from increased employment and capital investment, the so-called “shot in the arm,” but in the long run such communities tended to far worse than those independent from resource extraction. This led Freudenburg to compare the short-term logic of policy makers with that of drug addicts, and to label these Faustian arrangements “addictive economies.” Freudenberg called for longitudinal research that could shed light on the human capital implications of these economies and determine how and why outcomes varied across regions and industries. A decade later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1086026612464767">Freudenburg and Wilson (2002)</xref> noted an increase in such studies but concluded that “while the overall body of literature addressing the economic well-being of mining-dependent areas is vast, the number of studies explicitly offering systematic, quantitative data on the impacts of mining in the rural United States is actually much smaller” (p. 554).</p>
<p>Yet another decade has passed and these socioeconomic relationships are still murky. Clarification is important because the empirically questionable belief that resource extraction will be a boon for local economies and citizens is typically accepted without question in policy circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1086026612464767">Wilkinson, 1998</xref>). These decisions often result in degraded landscapes and communities as the environmental justice literature illustrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1086026612464767">Gedicks, 2001</xref>). Empirical research assessing the impacts of coal extraction is more critical than ever in Appalachia, as the ecological impacts of the mountaintop removal (MTR) mining method are clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1086026612464767">Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], 2010</xref>). The MTR method of extraction uses explosives to remove up to 1,000 feet of mountaintop, which is then pushed into neighboring valleys to reveal coal seams. The result is similar to a landscape of plateaus as more than 2,000 square miles of woodland have been deforested and more than 2,000 miles of Appalachian headwater streams buried in the past three decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1086026612464767">EPA, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these significant ecological costs, little empirical evidence suggests that coal extraction tangibly benefits the people of the region, notwithstanding the claims of pro-industry supporters that coal is the lifeblood of Central Appalachia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1086026612464767">Bell &amp; York, 2010</xref>). In this article, we examine the impacts of coal extraction over a 13-year time period in West Virginia, the second leading producer of coal in the United States and its number-one producer of underground coal. As such, West Virginia is a useful case for evaluating the relationship between extraction and socioeconomic outcomes on the short- and longer timescales. West Virginia also permits examination of a key aspect of resource extraction that has received little empirical attention: the potential differential effects of methods of extraction on socioeconomic outcomes. Using a fixed effects model we analyze the association between poverty, per capita income, and unemployment rates with coal production and method of coal extraction, either surface or underground, in West Virginia counties from 1997 to 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1086026612464767">1</xref></sup> Our findings call into question the widely touted claim that coal adds to community well-being in the state of West Virginia, for coal may very well “Keep the Lights On,” but our findings suggest that ending dependence on coal regardless of extraction modality would likely prove more beneficial to the state’s economy and people.</p>

<title>Resource Dependence and Socioeconomic Well-Being</title>
<p>The political economy of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1086026612464767">Andre Gunder Frank (1967)</xref> grounds many debates of the costs and benefits of resource extraction, both internationally and domestically. Frank pointed out that peripheral nations economically enmeshed with core nations did not develop in the ways modernization scholars predicted, but rather were “underdeveloped.” Frank’s ideas influenced many key studies of economic development and dependency in Latin America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1086026612464767">Bunker, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1086026612464767">Cardoso &amp; Faletto, 1979</xref>), and informed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1086026612464767">Evans’s (1979)</xref> notion of the “triple alliance” of colluding political leaders, multinational corporations, and local elites responsible for underdevelopment. The paradoxical presence of extensive poverty in the presence of great resource wealth became crystallized as the “resource curse,” and stimulated numerous other studies attempting to unpack these complex dynamics on the international level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1086026612464767">Bebbington, Hinojosa, Bebbington, Burneo, &amp; Warnaars, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1086026612464767">Rajan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1086026612464767">Ross, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1086026612464767">Sachs &amp; Warner, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1086026612464767">Stedman, Parkins, &amp; Beckley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1086026612464767">Tonts, Plummer, &amp; Lawrie, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>A substantial body of literature has examined the relationships between resource extraction and variables such as income, unemployment, and poverty in the United States. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1086026612464767">Elo and Beale (1985)</xref> found not only that the counties heavily dependent on mining had higher proportions of households living in poverty and the highest rates of “extreme” poverty but also the “curious anomaly” of higher median wages. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1086026612464767">Krannich and Luloff (1991)</xref> compared agriculture- and mining-dependent counties, observing that mining-dependent counties had higher levels of unemployment than those dependent on agriculture, even in a period of agricultural restructuring and crisis. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1086026612464767">Rural Sociology Society Task Force (1993)</xref> on Persistent Poverty furthered understandings of these relationships in 1993, concluding that resource extraction was not a panacea for rural poverty, but rather related to the creation and persistence of poverty. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1086026612464767">Lichter and McLaughlin (1995)</xref> supported this contention, finding that areas heavily depending on resource extraction had higher rates of poverty. Others, however, have found that resource extraction is correlated with positive socioeconomic outcomes. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1086026612464767">Bender et al. (1985)</xref> found that “mining-dependent”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1086026612464767">2</xref></sup> counties had higher incomes and fewer people receiving social security benefits than nonmetropolitan counties, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1086026612464767">Fisher (2001)</xref> found that communities that converted their forested land to agriculture tended to be more prosperous than those that did not.</p>
<p>Most of these studies are limited, however, by their use of cross-sectional data, which fail to register the long-term impacts of resource extraction. Even fewer studies apply these criteria to examinations of the impacts of mining. On this point, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1086026612464767">Nord and Luloff’s (1993)</xref> work is seminal, because it compared data from the 1980 and 1990 U.S. censuses across three regions and three different mining sectors (coal, petroleum, and other). They found much better outcomes in the Western mining areas, including higher median family income and lower poverty rates, while the Southern region had much worse outcomes at both time points, while outcomes in the Great Lakes region worsened from 1980 to 1990. As such, Nord and Luloff made clear that time as well as space matter for the relationship between extraction and poverty. Nevertheless, few studies have used even the modest span of a decade to observe trends (but see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1086026612464767">Elo &amp; Beale, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1086026612464767">Fisher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1086026612464767">Frickel &amp; Freudenberg, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In their attempt to make sense of the mixed findings concerning mining and community well-being over time, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1086026612464767">Freudenburg and Wilson (2002)</xref> conducted a meta-analysis. Taking methodological differences into account, they found roughly half of the 301 findings analyzed were “adverse,” whereas the remaining were divided between “neutral” and “favorable” outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1086026612464767">Freudenburg &amp; Wilson, 2002</xref>, p. 556). Income proved to be the most consistently positive outcome, with a little under half of the findings pointing to mining dependence leading to higher incomes, whereas a third found income to be lower in these communities. Moreover, 44% of the findings observed higher rates of poverty in mining-dependent areas, 36% no statistical difference, and only 20% of mining-dependent areas had lower levels of poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1086026612464767">Freudenburg &amp; Wilson, 2002</xref>, p. 559). Mining-dependent areas had higher unemployment rates in nearly 60% of these findings, whereas only 16% indicated lower rates of unemployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1086026612464767">Freudenburg &amp; Wilson, 2002</xref>, p. 560). In sum, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1086026612464767">Freudenberg and Wilson (2002)</xref> found that mining-dependent areas more often had higher incomes, poverty, and unemployment than nonmining areas. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1086026612464767">Freudenberg and Wilson’s (2002)</xref> findings parallel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1086026612464767">Elo and Beale’s (1985)</xref> “curious anomaly” of higher wages and greater poverty. Freudenberg and Wilson contend that this paradox is likely the result of mechanization, which “has become associated with relatively high wages in most U.S. mining operations today, but only for the small numbers of workers still employed” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1086026612464767">Freudenburg &amp; Wilson, 2002</xref>, p. 569). The importance of mechanization in turn raises the larger issue of the <underline>method</underline> of resource extraction. However, this factor is largely missing from the literature linking mining and community well-being. Freudenburg and Wilson conclude by citing the need for “analyzing communities’ relationships with the characteristics of natural resources themselves and with the specific technologies that are developed to exploit these resources” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1086026612464767">Freudenberg &amp; Wilson, 2002</xref>, p. 572). This point is exceedingly important for studies of Appalachia and coal, as the mechanization of the coal industry revolutionized the modes of production and societal relationships in the region, with one commentator even referring to the post–World War II period as the “New Machine Age” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1086026612464767">Thomas, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In this context, numerous studies have focused on coal mining and social well-being in Appalachia. For instance, Tickamyer and colleagues found higher gender and racial inequality in mining-dependent communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1086026612464767">Tickamyer &amp; Latimer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1086026612464767">Tickamyer &amp; Tickamyer, 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1086026612464767">Latimer and Mencken (2003)</xref> analyzed socioeconomic trends in mining-dependent counties in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Virginia in the 1990s. The authors concluded the region to be stagnant and ill-equipped for the changing global economy. Using qualitative methods, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1086026612464767">Bell (2009)</xref> found greatly diminished social capital and solidarity in the coalfields. In West Virginia, the top coal-producing state in Appalachia, many of these negative outcomes are extreme. The Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1086026612464767">3</xref></sup> ranked West Virginia 50th (last) out of 50 states in “Physical Health,” “Emotional Health,” “Life Evaluation,” and “Overall Well-Being” for the years 2009 and 2010. In addition, Freudenburg’s drug metaphor seems most apt given that the coalfields are currently awash in prescription drug abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1086026612464767">Kobak, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Only recently have researchers attempted to differentiate social outcomes by mining type, however, notably by differentiating MTR areas from underground mining operations. Such research has documented negative health outcomes in MTR areas, including the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1086026612464767">Ahern et al. (2011)</xref> which found higher rates of birth defects and premature death from respiratory, heart, and kidney diseases near MTR sites. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1086026612464767">Hendryx and Zullig (2009)</xref> found higher rates of cardiovascular disease, angina, and heart attacks for both men and women living near MTR sites. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1086026612464767">Hendryx (2011)</xref> documented higher mortality rates, but importantly, also included socioeconomic variables, finding higher total poverty and child poverty rates in MTR areas. Although these studies are exceedingly valuable, more longitudinal work is needed to validate the above-mentioned findings. To this end, we seek answers to two main questions: (a) Do communities with coal extraction have better socioeconomic outcomes than other communities? (b) Among coal extraction communities, do those relying on underground mining methods have better outcomes than those where surface mining dominates? We use the case of West Virginia to answer these questions.</p>

<title>The Case: West Virginia and Coal</title>
<p>Like all coal-dependent states in the Appalachian region, West Virginia rode the “resource roller coaster” during the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1086026612464767">Wilson, 2004</xref>). As demand for Appalachian coal dwindled in the interwar years, the formerly thriving coal industry went bust and the Great Depression was especially painful in the region. With World War II and the war effort, however, the region was catapulted into a boom time. Recognizing the key role played by coal, the U.S. government took control of coal operations during World War II to ensure an uninterrupted flow of the fuel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1086026612464767">Couto, 1993</xref>), and miners suddenly became coveted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1086026612464767">Harry Caudill (1963)</xref> describes this reinvigoration:
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . And the creek and hollow mountaineers, and the multitude of one-time miners employed on W.P.A. projects, turned eagerly to their calling . . . Empty camps filled again and the ghastly, painted houses swarmed with new brigades of ragged irrepressible children. (pp. 220-221)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The federal government made labor friendly deals with John L. Lewis and the United Mine Workers, resulting in a strong union, generous wages, and high times in the mountains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1086026612464767">McGinley, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>But as quickly as it had begun, the boom deflated as the war effort ended. The coal operators resumed control of the nationalized mines and accelerated production, resulting in a glutted market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1086026612464767">McGinley, 2004</xref>). At the same time, domestic coal demand decreased as homeowners across the nation switched from coal to cleaner burning oil for their heat, while the railroads shifted to diesel power. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1086026612464767">Thomas (2010)</xref> notes, “the disruption or disappearance of traditional coal markets led to falling coal production, narrower profit margins, and discharge notices for growing numbers of miners as coal operators mechanized to reduce labor costs” (p. 12). Indeed, mechanization processes only accelerated following the war, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1086026612464767">McGinley (2004)</xref> points out, “In 1948, 117,104 miners were at work in West Virginia. In 1957, only 58,732 miners had jobs, and by 1961 employment of miners had shrunk to only 42,557 in West Virginia” (p. 34).</p>
<p>Mechanization altered both surface and underground mining operations. On the surface, the economies of scales created by massive power shovels, bulldozers, dump trucks, and train cars greatly increased efficiency and reduced the need for human labor, while simultaneously increasing coal extraction rates. Nevertheless, underground mining still accounted for 75% of all mining in 1950 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1086026612464767">Bonskowski, Watson, &amp; Freme, 2006</xref>), and the subterranean technological developments were every bit as dramatic as those on the surface, forever altering the work and health of deep miners. The continuous mining machine introduced by the Joy Manufacturing Company in 1948 automated the mines and virtually eliminated the need for hand loaders, dramatically reducing extraction costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1086026612464767">Thomas, 2010</xref>, p. 13). In terms of health outcomes, the number of mining fatalities decreased during the increasingly mechanized post war period, but injury rates increased due to the accelerated work pace and the increased noise of the jobsite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1086026612464767">Thomas, 2010</xref>). But the most insidious danger of mechanization was created by the continual sawing and release of fine coal dust and, pneumoconiosis, black lung disease, soon emerged as an eminent health threat to miners.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, those with jobs were grateful for them, as newly out-of-work miners and their families had tough decisions to make. Thousands reluctantly left the mountains in search of work in Detroit, Akron, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and other industrial hubs in what became known as the Great Migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1086026612464767">Berry, 2000</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1086026612464767">Rice and Brown (1993)</xref> note,
<disp-quote>
<p>Between 1950 and 1960 the population of West Virginia declined from 2,005,552 to 1,860,421, a loss in excess of seven percent at a time when nearly every other state gained population. More than seventy percent of the loss occurred in the ten leading mining counties. (p. 280)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the same time, the landscape underwent dramatic changes as denuded mining sites replaced many family farms. In addition to the loss of jobs and environmental degradation, broad-form mining deeds challenged that seminal hallmark of American Capitalism, private property. Such deeds granted mining companies the mineral rights beneath the surface, allowing these companies to surface mine land under color of law.</p>
<p>The 1970s saw a continuation of the boom/bust cycle of the coal industry. The pain inflicted by skyrocketing oil prices reinvigorated interest in coal as a fuel source, and a short-lived boom ensued. Many of the shuttered company towns of Appalachia again sprang to life, with
<disp-quote>
<p>. . . significant numbers of job postings for the first time in decades as electric energy producers shifted from petroleum to a more reliable and less costly product. In West Virginia alone, more than 17,000 new miners were placed on payrolls during the period between 1973 and 1978. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1086026612464767">McGinley, 2004</xref>, p. 43)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For perspective, the total number of miners in West Virginia in 2010 was just 20,225 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1086026612464767">West Virginia Office of Miners’ Health Safety and Training [WVOMHST], n.d.-a</xref>). But this time the bust came sooner than later, and the boom in the coal fields lasted but a few years. The 1980s saw the region entering into yet another bust phase as a consequence of the recession of the early Reagan years and the economic restructuring away from manufacturing toward service and information sectors. More than 1,600 West Virginian mines closed at this time, while the amount of miners declined by half from 1980 to 1990 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1086026612464767">Latimer &amp; Mencken, 2003</xref>, p. 81), and by 1984 West Virginia led the nation in unemployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1086026612464767">Rice &amp; Brown, 1993</xref>). A large factor in this decline was the surge in federal coal leasing in the Western United States, shifting production to these extensive and less expensive reserves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1086026612464767">Nelson, 1983</xref>, p. 178).</p>
<p>Amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990, specifically limits on sulfur dioxide emissions from burning coal, resulted in yet more upheaval in the coal industry. Utility companies, major emitters of sulfur dioxide, were left with two options: They could install expensive retrofits to their plants to reduce these emissions, or they could burn coal with less sulfur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1086026612464767">Faber, 1998</xref>). These legislative acts made the high-sulfur mines of the Midwest much less desirable, evidenced by the shuttering of more than 1,000 high-sulfur mines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1086026612464767">Faber, 1998</xref>, p. 45). In this context, the low-sulfur coal deposits in Appalachia became more attractive to utilities and 1997 (the first year of this study) witnessed the greatest total production recorded in West Virginia history, with about 180 million tons of coal extracted, roughly a third coming from surface operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1086026612464767">WVOMHST, n.d.-b</xref>). The use of MTR methods accelerated greatly at this time, expanding from about 77,000 acres in 1985 to 272,000 acres under MTR in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1086026612464767">Skytruth, 2009</xref>). Indeed, MTR has come to be the dominant type of surface mining as 43 million of the 56 million tons of West Virginia coal extracted from the surface in 2009 came from MTR mines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1086026612464767">WVOMHST, n.d.-c</xref>). While underground mining still dominates in West Virginia, production rates have declined steadily since the production highpoint of 1997. Conversely, surface-mined coal has increased at roughly the same rate that underground mining has declined since this time (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1086026612464767">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>These data show a clear shift in the way that coal is pulled from the ground in West Virginia. It is still unclear, however, if these methods of extraction matter for socioeconomic outcomes, or if coal extraction in general is associated with better socioeconomic outcomes for West Virginians. To shed more light on how coal dependency affects the people of West Virginia, we correlate available coal data broken down by county and extraction type from 1997 through 2009 with numerous socioeconomic indicators.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>Our analysis includes data from all of West Virginia’s 55 counties over a 13-year observation period from 1997 to 2009. Unemployment data come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, poverty data come from the U.S. Census Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) data set, and per capita income data come from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Coal-mining data come from the West Virginia Office of Miners’ Health Safety and Training, which includes underground and surface totals of short tons of coal produced and employment in the sector at the county level.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>For each outcome of interest (poverty, per capita income, unemployment), we estimated a fixed effects regression using the mean deviation algorithm procedure. In our analysis, the mean deviation method computes means over time for each county and each time-varying variable. County-specific means are then subtracted from the observed values of each variable and the differences for the dependent variable are regressed on the differences of the independent variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1086026612464767">Allison, 2009</xref>). The model was estimated using the “xtscc” procedure in STATA 12 as follows:</p>

<p>Fixed effects models help control for omitted variables that differ between cases (counties in our model) but are constant over time. For example, the size of each county is different, but is likely to be the same over our observation period. If county size is somehow related to poverty, a fixed effects model accounts for its effect even though county size is not included in the model. A key assumption of fixed effects models is that the omitted variables which could simultaneously affect both dependent and independent variables are time invariant. For example, one of the counties may have discovered another valuable resource during our observation period, plausibly affecting both coal mining and poverty levels. In additional models (not shown) we included a measure of new natural gas footage because it varied between counties and over time. The inclusion of natural gas production did not affect the significance of our key independent variables.</p>
<p>A potential problem in our study is that several counties have similar rates of both underground and surface coal extraction. For the analytic sample, underground and surface extractions are indeed positively correlated (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = .581, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), however regression diagnostics (conducted using ordinary least squares regression) suggest that collinearity is not a significant problem (variance inflation factor [VIF] &lt; 5 across all dependent variables, 1/VIF &gt; .01 across all dependent variables). Regression diagnostics also indicated the presence of serial correlation in the errors, groupwise heteroscedasticity, and cross-sectional spatial correlations of errors; thus, estimators of the standard error robust to the cross-sectional and temporal dependence are used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1086026612464767">Hoechle, n.d</xref>.).</p>

<title>Dependent Variables</title>
<p>We estimate three models, one for each outcome of interest: county-level unemployment percentage, county poverty percentage, and county-level per capita income in constant 2009 dollars deflated using the consumer price index. County-level unemployment is defined as the percentage of individuals who do not have a job, made at least one attempt to find a job in the past month, and were available for work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1086026612464767">U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012</xref>). County poverty estimates come from the SAIPE program. The SAIPE program uses administrative records, intercensal population estimates, and the decennial census with direct estimates from the American Community Survey “to provide consistent and reliable single-year estimates of poverty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1086026612464767">U.S. Census Bureau, n.d</xref>.). County-level per capita income estimates come from the Regional Income Division of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1086026612464767">U.S. Department of Commerce, 2011</xref>). Per capita personal income is calculated as the personal income of the residents of a given area divided by the total resident population of that area using the Census Bureau’s annual midyear population estimates as the area population estimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1086026612464767">U.S. Census Bureau, n.d</xref>.).</p>

<sec id="section6-1086026612464767">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>Independent variables included in the analyses are total coal tonnage produced within a county, tonnage of coal produced from underground mines as a percentage of total West Virginia underground production, tonnage of coal produced from surface mines as a percentage of total West Virginia surface production, a dichotomous indicator of either none or any mining activity (surface or underground) in a county, percentage of employment within a county in the mining sector, and an indicator for a linear effect of time. All these data are derived from WVOMHST. In addition, we included the price of underground West Virginia coal relative to the national average price of underground coal and the cost of West Virginia surface coal relative to the national average price of surface coal in constant 2009 dollars. These data come from the Annual Coal Report released by the Energy Information Administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1086026612464767">EIA, 2011</xref>).

<p>Average poverty across all observed counties and time periods is 17.87%. Mean per capita income was $26,249 and average unemployment was 6.43%. Approximately half of the counties had mining activity, with an average 2.975 million tons of coal produced per county over the 13-year observation period. Each mining county accounted for an average of 1.8% of all underground coal produced in West Virginia and 1.8% of all surface coal produced in West Virginia. Within each county, an average of 2.9% of all workers found employment in the mining sector. West Virginia underground coal was, on average, $7.65 more expensive than the average national price of underground coal, while surface coal was, on average, $32 more expensive than the average national price of surface coal.</p>

<p>The presence of mining activity, the percentage of West Virginia underground coal produced within a county, and the relative market cost of surface coal are significantly associated with unemployment. Counties with no mining activity are expected to have lower unemployment levels (<italic>b</italic> = −0.55, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Unemployment is also expected to decrease as the relative market cost of surface coal increases (<italic>b</italic> = −0.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). However, the percentage of West Virginia underground coal produced within a county is associated with higher unemployment—for each percentage increase in a county’s contribution to West Virginia’s total underground coal production, we expect a 0.16% increase in unemployment levels (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The foregoing analysis advances the literature on extractive industries and socioeconomic well-being by incorporating data over an extended period of time and by differentiating among extraction methods to identify whether they exert distinct effects on social well-being. We found that West Virginia counties with no coal mining have lower levels of poverty than mining counties. Moreover, counties that mine a higher percentage of underground coal relative to other counties have higher levels of poverty. These findings support much of the “resource curse” literature, which contends that dependency on natural resources results in stifled development and negative socioeconomic outcomes. This is due in large part to the fact that coal extraction is a primary industry; coal is pulled from the ground, cleaned, and shipped away. Therefore, little opportunity exists for these operations to be economically “linked” to secondary industries which process and transform raw materials into value-added finished products, such as refineries for oil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1086026612464767">Freudenburg &amp; Gramling, 1998</xref>) or paper plants and saw mills for forest products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1086026612464767">Overdevest &amp; Green, 1995</xref>). The very nature of the resource and the “fixity of extraction” require coal to be transported large distances to utilities and factories, reinforcing its peripheral nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1086026612464767">Bunker, 1985</xref>). Moreover, access to local markets ended after most Appalachian homeowners switched to oil and the railroads shifted to diesel-powered engines. These circumstances prevent coalfield communities and businesses from exploiting the processing and services which provide high-wage specialized jobs and additional tax revenue. As such it is not surprising that coal-dependent counties have higher rates of poverty than nonmining counties as little potential for capitalization of the resource exists.</p>
<p>The jobs found in the coal industry, however, are typically thought of as “good jobs” with relatively high pay, especially considering the low cost of living in the coal-bearing regions of the state. It is not, then, low wages paid to miners that contribute to the higher rates of poverty in coal-mining counties, but rather the sheer lack of opportunity. Mechanization of both underground and surface mines have dramatically reduced the number of jobs available to coalfield communities, for as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1086026612464767">Williams (2002</xref>, pp. 345-346) points out, more West Virginians work at Wal-Mart than in the mines. That the “curious anomaly” of higher poverty <italic>and</italic> higher per capita income was not found in this analysis suggests that even the relatively high-paying jobs of the mines are not substantial enough to raise overall income levels in these counties. Indeed, the increased capitalization and modest demand for labor in coal operations calls into question the assertion made by the coal industry and its supporters that coal is the lifeblood of the region. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1086026612464767">Bell and York (2010</xref>, p. 121) point out, although West Virginia is the leading producer of coal in the region, coal contributed only 7% to the gross state product in 2004. This highlights the minor economic benefits of the industry, while others suggest that if the hidden costs of coal were internalized, coal would actually be a net loss for coal state economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1086026612464767">McIlmoil, Hansen, Boettner, &amp; Miller, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>We argue that our second main finding, that as the relative market price of West Virginia surface coal increases, poverty increases while per capita income decreases, is due to several factors which make up what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1086026612464767">Freudenburg (1992)</xref> called the “cost/price squeeze.” In essence, higher coal prices do not necessarily infer higher profits, but instead signify a less attractive option for coal purchasers. In West Virginia, the main factors creating this cost/price squeeze are (a) depletion of productive and easily accessible reserves, (b) competition from cheaper Western coal, (c) increased competition from other energy sources, especially natural gas, and (d) tightening environmental regulations. These factors have increased the costs of coal production while reducing the price West Virginia coal can fetch, resulting in shrinking margins.</p>
<p>The most obvious of these factors is the exhaustion of productive and easily accessible reserves. Coal has been mined in West Virginia for hundreds of years and operators began mining in the most rewarding locations. Unlike the much newer mining operations in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana where coal is close to the surface and seams can reach 100-feet deep, Appalachian coal operators are forced to spend greater sums to reach and extract relatively thin seams of coal. Indeed, more coal is extracted from Wyoming mines than from all of Appalachia combined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1086026612464767">EIA, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Another crucial factor lessening the viability of West Virginian coal, both surface and underground, is the explosion of natural gas drilling and use. New methods of extraction, such as hydraulic fracturing, have opened new vistas to the natural gas industry. Coupled with extensive reserves in many regions of the country (including Appalachia), the price of natural gas has dropped precipitously in the past few years, pushing coal out of many markets as its cost drops close to that of coal. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1086026612464767">Nelder (2012)</xref> explains,
<disp-quote>
<p>In 1998, the cost of gas for electric utilities was 1.9 times higher than coal. That ratio rose to 5.4 in 2005. It now stands at a mere 1.2, making gas just slightly more expensive than coal for power generation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>When increased regulation and pollution control costs are factored into the equation, coal is even less attractive for utilities. Despite a recent ruling by U.S. District Judge, Amy Berman Jackson which restricted the authority of the EPA to withdraw Clean Water Act permits, allowing the largest ever MTR mining operation to go forward, the EPA has placed other significant obstacles in the path of the coal industry. Recently, the EPA proposed the first Clean Air Act standard for carbon emissions for future power plants, imposing much stricter allowances of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and forcing new coal burning plants to capture a large portion of their pollution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1086026612464767">EPA, 2012</xref>). Meeting these standards will be much easier for power plants using cleaner burning natural gas and coal’s primacy as America’s electricity provider is now in doubt. As the President of Duke Energy (one of the largest consumers of coal in the United States) Jim Roger concludes, “As we look out over the next two decades, we do not plan to build another coal plant” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1086026612464767">National Public Radio, 2012</xref>). In addition, to these new standards, utilities are facing tighter restrictions on the disposal of coal ash at their facilities following the catastrophic damage following the failure of the TVA Kingston Fossil Plant’s slurry lagoon in December 2008. Finally, as the reality of climate change is less easy to deny, regulations regarding the release of greenhouse gases will likely tighten further, a reality that utilities are undoubtedly factoring into their business models.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned factors have resulted in higher prices for West Virginia coal, which have in turn made it less competitive compared with coal mined from other regions and states. According to EIA, a short ton of underground mined coal from West Virginia in 2010 cost $11.65 more than the average short ton of underground mined U.S. coal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1086026612464767">4</xref></sup> West Virginian surface coal cost $42.11 more per ton than the U.S. average in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1086026612464767">EIA, 2011</xref>). Although the coal mined in West Virginia is of higher quality than that found almost anywhere else in the nation, its premium price coupled with the increasingly competitive nature of natural gas is making it a less attractive option for energy providers. Indeed, those conglomerates heavily invested in the region are experiencing difficulties, evidenced by the bankruptcy filing of Patriot Coal, the third largest producer of MTR coal, in July 2012.</p>
<p>Finally, our model predicting unemployment suggests that differing extraction methods exert slightly different impacts in this realm. Indeed, the relationship between underground coal mining and unemployment is somewhat counterintuitive: Counties that produce a higher percentage of underground coal are expected to have higher levels of unemployment. As underground mines require more human labor than those on the surface, it would seem that employment should increase as more coal is produced. However, in many ways, underground mining has become as mechanized as that on the surface and increased production does not necessarily mean more human laborers are required. In addition, counties with high levels of underground mining typically have longer legacies of mining, which, as these findings suggest, creates dependency and stifles the development of other opportunities for employment.</p>
<p>The high costs of developing, maintaining, and expanding underground operations will likely push coal operators to extract more coal from the surface. This will continue a trend, evidenced by the steady decrease in underground production since 1997 and the halving of underground employment in the past three decades; in 1983, more than 26,000 miners were employed in the underground mining sector, while barely 13,000 found work in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1086026612464767">Mine Safety and Health Administration, n.d</xref>.). Underground mines are the first to cut back on production and employment and to be shuttered by coal operators during bust cycles. For instance, in February 2012, Alpha Natural Resources announced plans to make cuts due to decreased demand. The company reduced worker hours at several surface mines, but two underground mines were completely shut down, resulting in the layoff of 320 workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1086026612464767">Ward, 2012</xref>). Such outcomes are likely to continue given the bleak future of the Appalachian coal industry, for as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1086026612464767">McIlmoil et al. (2010)</xref> project,
<disp-quote>
<p>coal production in Central Appalachia faces a decline from 234 million tons in 2008 to 99 million tons by 2035. . . .This represents a decline of 58% over the next twenty-five years, with the greatest share of the decline occurring in the next decade. (p. 9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As such, a replication of this study in another decade may yield very different results. For now, our findings make clear that transitioning away from coal dependence, regardless of extraction method, will benefit both the land and the people of West Virginia.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1086026612464767">Freudenburg (1992)</xref> pointed out, the temporal scale employed is critically important in natural resource decision making. Our analysis contributes to these understandings by analyzing the relationship between coal extraction and community well-being in West Virginia during a period when rates of surface mining increased and underground mining decreased. We find little difference in socioeconomic outcomes between surface and underground mining, but rather, find that it is the presence or absence of mining that matters most. These findings call into question the argument that coal extraction is beneficial for citizens of the Mountain State as counties that do not extract coal have lower rates of poverty than extracting counties, while poverty increases in mining counties as relative extraction rates increase. Moreover, coal-mining counties do not have higher per capita income or employment than nonmining counties. In addition, we find that as the relative market price of West Virginia surface coal increases, so too does poverty, a phenomenon explained by the “cost/price squeeze.” Given the negative socioeconomic ramifications of coal mining and the price squeeze on Appalachian coal, it seems that a radical restructuring of the West Virginian economy is in order <italic>before</italic> resource exhaustion. Indeed, it seems that the state would be better off capitalizing on other natural resources, namely its scenic beauty and economically viable wind power, while conserving its ancient ecosystems. Leaving remaining coal in the ground will likely prove the best alternative in the <italic>long run</italic> for West Virginians, as the opportunities to capitalize on renewable and, therefore, perpetual economic development are great.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1086026612464767">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>That said, it is still uncertain how generalizable these findings are to other regions and resources. Future research examining if and how extraction method matters in diverse contexts is needed, especially on the international scale. Our findings suggest that the method of extraction is less important than the capital intensity of production, supporting the main thesis of dependency theorists, as well as that of the treadmill of production school (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1086026612464767">Schnaiberg, 1980</xref>). The rapid acceleration of mechanization in both underground and surface mines following World War II, the concomitant production increases, and the demise of organized labor heightened the region’s dependency on coal. This dependency has resulted in dire socioeconomic outcomes in West Virginia that are similar to those found in other peripheries. Opportunities exist, however, for alternative economic pathways to be constructed as coal’s viability diminishes, but increased scrutiny of the relationships between local elites and outside capital is also necessary. Finally, communities contemplating or currently taking part in the natural gas boom should consider the outcomes found in the coalfields of West Virginia, for as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1086026612464767">Pellow (2011)</xref> notes, “the domination over people is reinforced and made possible by the domination of ecosystems” (p. 247). In this light, the relationship between resource addiction and the pain of withdrawal becomes all too clear.</p>

<p><italic>Surface mining</italic> is an umbrella term that refers to numerous specific methods of extraction, including contour mining, area mining, auger and highwall mining, and mountaintop removal (MTR) mining. The unifying characteristic of these various techniques is that instead of subterranean extraction of coal, the rock and soil (“overburden”) covering deposits are removed from the surface to facilitate mining. Because of limitations in coal production data we were unable to disaggregate these types of mining in our analyses. However, MTR mining has come to dominate surface techniques in the region.</p>
