<abstract>
<p>Research exploring the perspectives of stigmatized people has examined general processes related to experiencing prejudice. Past work, however, has invoked the assumption that prejudices against different group memberships are experienced in a similar manner. Across three studies we directly compare experiences of racism and sexism among female minorities and show, in contrast, that people respond to different forms of prejudice in distinct ways. In Study 1 we examined the attributions invoked by Asian women to explain prejudice and discovered that participants made stronger internal attributions to explain racism than sexism. In Study 2 we investigated emotional reactions to prejudice and found that Asian women report experiencing more depression following a race-based rejection than a gender-based rejection. In Study 3 we observed that Asian women reported perceiving more racism than sexism in their environments. Implications for advancing theories of prejudice experiences are discussed.</p>

<p>This quotation by author Amy Tan encapsulates the meaning assigned to Chinese culture by the Chinese women in her novel, <italic>The Joy Luck Club</italic>. It is clear from the author’s reference to race as being in the “blood” of her characters that these women are deeply aware of their race and the ways in which this group membership affects their attitudes, emotions, and experiences. Similarly, a well-established program of research shows that belonging to a stigmatized group and facing prejudice dramatically affects how people negotiate their environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430211411594">Crocker &amp; Major, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368430211411594">Major &amp; O’Brien, 2005</xref>). Although Tan’s quotation conveys the impact of race on her characters, it does not acknowledge the role that gender plays in their lives. Despite belonging to multiple stigmatized groups and encountering both racism and sexism, race-related experiences appear to be more salient to Tan’s characters than gender-related experiences. This quotation, as a result, raises the more general question: Do experiences related to race and gender differentially impact female minorities?</p>
<p>According to past research, people express different forms of prejudice towards different target groups. Asians, for example, are targeted by envious prejudice because they are perceived as competent and highly competitive; in contrast, women are targeted by paternalistic prejudice because they are perceived as incompetent and passive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211411594">Cuddy, Fiske, &amp; Glick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430211411594">Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, &amp; Xu, 2002</xref>). To date, however, research has neglected to examine whether people experience different forms of prejudice in different ways. In the current research we explore this question by directly comparing race and gender-based rejection experiences among Asian Canadian women. Across three studies we examine potential differences in individuals’ explanations for, emotional reactions to, and perceptions of racism and sexism and highlight the important ways in which these experiences diverge.</p>

<title>Attributions, emotions and perceptions in targets of prejudice</title>
<p>In 1989, Crocker and Major sparked widespread interest in examining the perspectives of people who are targeted by prejudice. More than 20 years later, researchers have documented a variety of responses to prejudice, focusing on how people explain and perceive events in which they are rejected by others due to their group memberships. When stigmatized people encounter prejudice, they search for ways to explain the event and provide meaning to the experience. Some research suggests that targets of prejudice identify an external causal locus (i.e., the cause of the event is external to the self) rather than an internal causal locus (i.e., the cause of the event is internal to the self; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430211411594">Crocker &amp; Major, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430211411594">Jones &amp; Davis, 1965</xref>) to explain discrimination. According to this view, stigmatized people focus on external reasons for prejudice they encounter because prejudiced treatment is perceived as unfair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430211411594">Crocker, Luhtanen, Broadnax, &amp; Blaine, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1368430211411594">Crocker, Voelkl, Testa, &amp; Major, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211411594">Major, Kaiser, &amp; McCoy, 2003</xref>). Recognizing that perpetrators of prejudice are to blame for the negative outcomes that stigmatized people experience allows these individuals to shift the blame for outcomes away from the self and towards prejudiced others. This model, termed the discounting hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211411594">Major et al., 2003</xref>), proposes that targets of prejudice protect their self-esteem by blaming negative outcomes on others’ biases. The authors acknowledge that perceiving prejudice is upsetting; however, they also highlight that there are specific, esteem-related benefits associated with attributing negative outcomes to prejudice.</p>
<p>In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211411594">Schmitt and Branscombe (2002)</xref> noted that attributions to prejudice involve a considerable internal component. Drawing on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368430211411594">Kelley’s (1973)</xref> attribution theory, Schmitt and Branscombe contended that people identify the causes of an event by considering the factors that are present when the event occurs and absent when the event does not occur. Some events can have multiple causal loci, meaning that they can be perceived as being simultaneously caused by internal and external factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368430211411594">McClure, 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211411594">Schmitt and Branscombe (2002)</xref> predicted that individuals recognize that a biased person (external factor) needs to be present for prejudice to occur, but that they also recognize that their own membership in a devalued group (internal factor) needs to be present as well. The authors asked male and female participants to imagine being refused entry into an important university course. Some participants imagined that the instructor rejected all of the students belonging to the participant’s gender group who requested enrollment into the class (i.e., the cause of the rejection was prejudice) and others imagined that everyone who requested enrollment was rejected (i.e., the cause was exclusively external). Consistent with their expectations, Schmitt and Branscombe showed that participants were more likely to attribute rejection to internal factors when the cause of rejection was prejudice than when the cause was exclusively external. In addition, participants who imagined being victims of prejudice experienced more negative affect than those who imagined that everyone was rejected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211411594">Schmitt &amp; Branscombe, 2002</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211411594">Major et al., 2003</xref>). Attributing negative outcomes to discrimination can protect people against emotions (like depression) that harm self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211411594">Major et al., 2003</xref>); however, targets of prejudice do experience negative affective consequences.</p>
<p>In addition to the attributions that stigmatized people make to explain the causes of prejudice, the extent to which individuals perceive themselves to be victims of prejudice across a variety of contexts has been shown to relate to important outcomes for stigmatized group members. Individuals who perceive prejudice in their environments experience decreased well-being (i.e., life satisfaction and positive affect), but also seek increased support from other stigmatized group members who can relate to their experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430211411594">Branscombe, Schmitt, &amp; Harvey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211411594">Schmitt, Branscombe, Kobrynowicz, &amp; Owen, 2002</xref>). Prejudice perceptions, as a result, have been described as an important component of the rejection-identification strategy employed by stigmatized people to improve well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430211411594">Branscombe et al., 1999</xref>). According to this model, people who perceive prejudice in their environment tend to experience decreased well-being; however, these individuals are also more likely to seek support from ingroup members as a way to buffer themselves against the negative consequences of constantly being rejected by dominant groups. Given that the literature has focused on attributions, emotions and perceptions of prejudice in order to understand how stigmatized people react to prejudice, the present research aimed to examine differences in these fundamental responses as a function of whether Asian women encounter racism or sexism.</p>

<sec id="section2-1368430211411594">
<title>Negotiating multiple stigmatized group memberships</title>
<p>To date, research has examined how stigmatized people explain, perceive, and respond emotionally to only one form of group-based rejection (e.g., sexism in women, racism in minorities). As a result, studies have neglected to compare stigmatized group members’ experiences of different forms of prejudice. People belong to multiple social groups, however, and they may respond to prejudice against these different groups in fundamentally different ways. Consistent with this prediction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430211411594">Macrae, Bodenhausen, and Milne (1995)</xref> showed that perceivers react differently to Asian women depending on whether the target’s race or gender is emphasized as the salient social category. Participants watched a video of a Chinese woman eating noodles using chopsticks or applying make-up. The target’s actions primed race or gender, respectively. The researchers then measured the extent to which participants activated Asian and female-related stereotypes. The results demonstrated that participants activated stereotypes associated with the salient category and inhibited stereotypes associated with the non-salient category.</p>
<p>Research also shows that individuals perceive themselves differently on important outcome measures depending on whether they are primed to contemplate their race or their gender. In one study, Asian women primed with their race (a group that is stereotypically associated with good mathematics performance) performed better on a mathematics test than participants primed with their gender (a group that is stereotypically associated with poor mathematics performance; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430211411594">Shih, Pittinsky, &amp; Ambady, 1999</xref>). In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368430211411594">Sinclair, Hardin, and Lowery (2006)</xref> observed that Asian women primed with their gender evaluated their verbal abilities more favourably than their mathematics abilities; however, Asian women primed with their race evaluated their mathematics abilities more favourably than their verbal abilities. According to the literature, then, others’ reactions to stigmatized group members, as well as targets’ perceptions of themselves vary depending on whether race or gender is salient.</p>
<p>In line with work showing that the behaviors and self-perceptions of Asian women vary depending on whether they are focusing on race or gender, we predicted that Asian women’s explanations for, emotional reactions to, and perceptions of prejudice vary depending on whether they are focusing on racism or sexism. As a starting point for exploring differences in how Asian women experience racism and sexism we turned to literature comparing how these forms of prejudice are expressed. Prejudice directed towards Asian women is particularly interesting because models of intergroup stereotyping suggest that Asians and women are exposed to opposing forms of bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430211411594">Fiske et al., 2002</xref>). The Behavior from Intergroup Affect and Stereotypes model (BIAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211411594">Cuddy et al., 2007</xref>) suggests that Asians are perceived as competent (i.e., high status) and cold (i.e., unfriendly) and so are treated by others in actively harmful and passively helpful ways. In contrast, women are perceived as incompetent (i.e., low status) and warm (i.e., friendly), and so encounter passively harmful and actively helpful treatment from others. Racism directed at Asian women is, therefore, negative and overtly harmful, whereas sexism directed at Asian women is subtle, condescending and often disguised as prosocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430211411594">Glick &amp; Fiske, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that prejudice against Asians is often more explicitly negative than prejudice against women, we expected Asian women imagining a race-based rejection to react more intensely than those imagining a sex-based rejection (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368430211411594">Levin, Sinclair, Veniegas, &amp; Taylor, 2002</xref>). Specifically, we hypothesized that Asian women contemplating racism would demonstrate greater awareness that part of the self has been rejected than those contemplating sexism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211411594">Schmitt &amp; Branscombe, 2002</xref>), and would also report a stronger desire to deflect responsibility away from the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211411594">Major et al., 2003</xref>). We further predicted that Asian women’s emotional reactions to racism would differ from their emotional reactions to sexism, with race-based rejections inducing greater negative affect than sex-based rejections due to the overt negativity inherent in anti-Asian bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211411594">Schmitt &amp; Branscombe, 2002</xref>). Lastly, we expected racism to be more salient than sexism and easier for Asian women to detect in their daily lives, leading Asian women to perceive more racism than sexism in their social environments. We began our exploration of whether different forms of prejudice are experienced in different ways by examining Asian women’s attributions to explain racism and sexism in Study 1.</p>

<sec id="section3-1368430211411594">
<title>Study 1: Attributions to explain racism and sexism</title>
<p>When stigmatized individuals experience prejudice they search for ways to explain the negative outcomes they subsequently endure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430211411594">Crocker &amp; Major, 1989</xref>). Do Asian women invoke different rationalizations to explain racism as compared to sexism? To examine this possibility in Study 1, we followed procedures developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211411594">Schmitt and Branscombe (2002)</xref> in which participants imagined being rejected admission to an important university course. As in past research, participants contemplated being rejected due to their gender or due to their own lack of intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211411594">Major et al., 2003</xref>). We added a third condition in which some participants imagined being rejected due to their race. Past research has explored whether stigmatized people make internal (i.e., cause is the self) or external (i.e., cause is in the environment) attributions to account for why they have been rejected in a variety of situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211411594">Major et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211411594">Schmitt &amp; Branscombe, 2002</xref>). We examined whether Asian women invoke different patterns of attributions to explain different types of prejudice.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-1368430211411594">
<title>Participants and recruitment</title>
<p>Female students who indicated their Asian descent on a mass testing form completed prior to the study were recruited by telephone to participate in the current experiment. Students who agreed to participate were asked to provide specific information about their ethnicities, and were also asked to report their ages and intended academic majors. (We were interested in only students’ ethnicities; however, we asked participants additional questions to avoid raising suspicion about the purpose of the study.) In total, 67 Asian women enrolled in an introductory psychology course at the University of Toronto participated in the study for course credit or $10 compensation. Prior to analyses, data from one participant were excluded due to her inattentive nature during the session. Of the remaining 66 participants included in analyses, 51 were Chinese, nine were Korean, three were Vietnamese, two were Taiwanese, and one was Japanese. Participants’ average age was 18.98 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.18).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1368430211411594">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were seated at individual computer terminals and informed by the experimenter that the purpose of the study was to examine social judgments in hypothetical situations. After participants provided informed consent, one of three brief vignettes describing a hypothetical situation appeared on the computer screen and participants were instructed to imagine themselves in the described situation. The vignettes illustrated a common university experience in which students attempt to obtain permission from a professor to enroll in a course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211411594">Major et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211411594">Schmitt &amp; Branscombe, 2002</xref>). In all cases participants’ requests were denied by the professor; however, the reason for this rejection was presented as due to participants’ race, gender, or personalities. For example, Chinese participants in the racism condition read the following scenario:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Suppose that it’s the beginning of the semester and you need permission to enroll in a course required by your major. You stop by the professor’s office and politely ask to be let into the class. To your disappointment, the professor turns you down and says, “Sorry, but I just can’t give you permission to enroll in my course”. Later that day, you talk to a good friend about not being able to get into the class. Your friend, a reliable source, says that she is not surprised the professor didn’t let you into the class. She tells you that no students of Chinese descent were allowed into the class, but about 10 White people were.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants always read about a male professor and about a female friend. For participants in the racism condition, the nationality of the students excluded from the course matched the nationality of the participant (obtained during recruitment). Korean participants assigned to this condition, for example, imagined their friend informed them that “no Korean students were allowed into the class”. We did this to ensure that the manipulation impacted our participants. Participants assigned to the sexism condition read an identical scenario; however, they learned that “no women were allowed into the class, but about 10 men were”. Finally, participants in the personal rejection condition read that the professor “thought they were stupid” and agreed to give permission to all other students who asked.</p>
<p>After reading the vignette, participants reported the extent to which they would attribute the event to internal causes, external causes, and to discrimination. Participants also rated the extent to which they would blame themselves for the outcome described in the scenario. Participants were then debriefed and compensated for their participation.</p>

Each scale consisted of two items which we combined to form composite attributions measures.</p>
<sec id="section8-1368430211411594">
<title>Discrimination attributions</title>

<title>Discrimination attributions</title>
<p>Two one-way between-subjects analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted to examine the effects of rejection type (racism, sexism or personal rejection) on discrimination attributions. The results revealed that the vignettes successfully illustrated racism and sexism. We observed an effect of rejection type on the extent to which the professor was perceived as sexist, <italic>F</italic>(2, 63) = 18.54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Tukey post-hoc comparisons indicated that participants in the sexism condition made stronger sexism attributions (<italic>M</italic> = 4.70, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.32) than those in the personal rejection (<italic>M</italic> = 2.86, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.22), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.45, and racism (<italic>M</italic> = 2.58, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.17), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.70, conditions. Participants in the personal rejection and racism conditions did not differ on this measure, <italic>p</italic> = .73. In terms of how racist the professor seemed, we observed a significant effect of rejection type, <italic>F</italic>(2, 63) = 12.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Post-hoc tests showed that participants in the racism condition perceived the professor as more racist (<italic>M</italic> = 5.48, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.62) than participants in the sexism (<italic>M</italic> = 3.75, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.05), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.27, and personal rejection (<italic>M</italic> = 3.67, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.42), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 1.19 conditions.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of Study 1 revealed that Asian women are more likely to make internal attributions to explain racism than sexism. We did not find, however, that participants blamed themselves more for race-based rejections than sex-based or personal rejections, illustrating that Asian women who internalize the causes of racism still recognize that they are victims of moral injustice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430211411594">Crocker &amp; Major, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211411594">Major et al., 2003</xref>). In line with this explanation, the findings showed that participants were equally likely to attribute racism and sexism to external factors. The goal of Study 2 was to examine whether a different prejudice manipulation would produce similar internal attribution results in order to establish the veracity of this finding. Because attributions to explain prejudice guide theoretical predictions about emotional responses to prejudice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211411594">Schmitt &amp; Branscombe, 2002</xref>), in Study 2 we also sought to determine the affective consequences of racism and sexism for Asian women.</p>

<title>Study 2: Emotional reactions to racism and sexism</title>
<p>Participants in Study 2 described a past experience of rejection due to race, gender or their personalities. We reasoned that this type of recall task would more closely approximate an actual experience of prejudice than the manipulation in Study 1 and, therefore, would allow us a clearer glimpse into participants’ emotions. We hypothesized that, as in Study 1, Asian women in the current study would be more likely to attribute racism (as opposed to sexism) to internal factors and that the externality of attributions would not differ across conditions. Guided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211411594">Schmitt and Branscombe’s (2002)</xref> assertion that internalized prejudice experiences produce increased negative affect in targets, we further expected that participants would express more negative affect in response to a past experience of racism than sexism.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section18-1368430211411594">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Sixty Asian women enrolled in introductory psychology at the University of Toronto completed this study in exchange for course credit or $10 compensation. In the current study, information about participants’ specific ethnic backgrounds was collected at the end of the experimental session. Thirty-seven participants were Chinese, 16 were Korean, four were Vietnamese and three were Filipino. Participants’ average age was 19.51 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.82).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1368430211411594">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Participants were informed by the experimenter that they would complete a computer-based narrative writing task. After providing consent, participants were randomly assigned to one of three past rejection conditions: racism, sexism, or personal. Next, participants received a narrative topic and instructions for completing the writing task. For example, participants in the racism condition read the following instructions:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>We have all experienced rejection at some point during our lives. Sometimes people are rejected for a particular reason, and one such reason is race. This task will ask you to spend a few minutes thinking deeply about a past experience of racism. Think of a particular instance in which you were discriminated against because of your race. Really try to express the feelings that you felt during this rejection experience. During this rejection experience, how did you react, how did you feel, and what did you think about?</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants in the sexism rejection condition received identical instructions with the exception that they were asked to recall a past experience of sexism. In the personal rejection condition, participants described a time in which they felt rejected as a result of their own personalities. All participants were given ten minutes to complete the narrative writing task. Next, participants rated their attributions for the rejection event, as well as their emotional responses to the rejection event, on 7-point scales. At the end of the session, participants were debriefed and compensated.</p>

<sec id="section21-1368430211411594">
<title>Attributions and self-blame</title>
<p>Participants rated the extent to which the rejection experience they recalled had been due to internal factors (r(60) = .46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>M</italic> = 3.86, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.52) and external factors (r(60) = .54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>M</italic> = 4.63, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.17). Participants also rated the extent to which they blamed themselves for the rejection (r(60) = .77, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>M</italic> = 2.88, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.61). The items were the same as those administered in Study 1 but were slightly modified to refer to attributions about a past experience as opposed to a hypothetical situation. Because the manipulation instructions in the prejudice conditions directly asked participants to write about a “discrimination” experience, we did not measure participants’ discrimination attributions.</p>

<title>Attributions and self-blame</title>
<p>We examined the impact of rejection type (racism, sexism, or personal rejection) on attributions and self-blame by conducting a series of one-way between-subjects ANOVAs. The results revealed that, in line with our main hypothesis and with the findings obtained in Study 1, the type of rejection participants described affected the extent to which they attributed the rejection to internal causes, <italic>F</italic>(2, 57) = 3.57, <italic>p</italic> = .04. We further examined this result using Tukey post-hoc comparisons and discovered that participants made stronger internal attributions when describing a past experience of racism (<italic>M</italic> = 4.55, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.15) than when describing a past experience of sexism (<italic>M</italic> = 3.33, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.73), p = .03, <italic>d</italic> = 0.74. Participants in the personal rejection condition did not differ significantly from either those in the racism (<italic>p</italic> = .19) or sexism (<italic>p</italic> = 0.64) conditions in terms of internal attributions. As in Study 1, participants’ responses in the personal rejection condition (<italic>M</italic> = 3.74, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.41) fell between the mean scores on this scale in the other two conditions. Once again, participants’ ratings of self-blame did not differ by rejection type, <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1. We also did not find that type of rejection impacted participants’ external attributions, <italic>F</italic>(2, 57) = 1.60, p = .21.</p>

<p>A one-way ANOVA demonstrated that depression was affected by rejection type, <italic>F</italic>(2, 57) = 5.32, <italic>p</italic> = .008.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of Study 2 replicated findings from Study 1 and revealed that Asian women were more likely to attribute past rejection to internal factors when they had been rejected due to race than when they had been rejected due to gender. Internal attributions in the personal and race-based rejection conditions did not differ, and we expected this result given that participants should internalize the outcome in both situations. We also examined the emotions that participants reported experiencing during past rejection events and discovered that Asian women experienced more depression in response to racism as opposed to sexism. Studies 1 and 2, therefore, revealed that Asian women internalize the causes of racism more than sexism and also experience more depression in response to racism as opposed to sexism.</p>
<p>Past research suggests that attributing an outcome due to prejudice to internal factors is theoretically distinct from assigning blame for a similar outcome to the self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211411594">Schmitt &amp; Branscombe, 2002</xref>). In line with this reasoning, we did not find that participants blamed themselves more for racism than sexism. The finding that Asian women are more likely to attribute the causes of racism to internal factors than the causes of sexism does suggest, however, that Asian women facing racism are more likely than those facing sexism to recognize that a constant, stable component of the self has been devalued. We conducted Study 3 to shed further light on the finding that Asian women internalize racism more than sexism by examining the perceived constancy and saliency of rejection due to race and gender among members of this population.</p>

<title>Study 3: Perceiving racism and sexism</title>
<p>The goal of Study 3 was to examine differences in the extent to which Asian women perceive racism and sexism in their environments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211411594">Schmitt and Branscombe (2002)</xref> explained that stigmatized people internalize the causes of prejudice because they are aware that prejudice signals the devaluation of a component of the self based on group membership. Because the self is constant across situations, stigmatized people who internalize prejudice recognize that they will be targeted by prejudice under a variety of circumstances. Given that Asian women in Studies 1 and 2 internalized racism more than sexism, we reasoned that Asian women also perceive racism as more of a constant threat than sexism in their daily lives. In contrast to Studies 1 and 2 in which participants contemplated a particular, circumscribed experience of prejudice, in Study 3 we conducted a correlational, self-report study to examine whether Asian women perceive racism as more salient than sexism across situations.</p>

<sec id="section34-1368430211411594">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>Two items assessed perceptions of race-based prejudice and two items assessed perceptions of gender-based prejudice.

<p>Initial examination of the data revealed two Chinese participants whose scores on the perceived sexism measure were greater than three standard deviations above the mean of the scale.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of Study 3 indicate that Asian women differ in the extent to which they perceive racism and sexism in their environments. Participants reported that experiences of racism were more salient to them than experiences of sexism, suggesting that Asian women are more sensitive to experiences of race-based rejection than to experiences of gender-based rejection. The present findings are consistent with predictions generated by the BIAS model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211411594">Cuddy et al., 2007</xref>); given that Asian women should encounter overtly negative forms of racism and subtle, seemingly positive forms of sexism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430211411594">Glick &amp; Fiske, 1996</xref>), we would expect that racism is also more salient and easier to detect than sexism. Importantly, the results of Study 3 provide additional context in which to consider differences in the attributions made by female minorities facing different forms of prejudice. Asian women recognize that both racism and sexism can be explained by external causes (i.e., something about the prejudiced individual) and that they are not to blame for negative outcomes due to these forms of prejudice. The greater saliency of racism relative to sexism for Asian women, coupled with the tendency for Asian women to attribute racism to internal factors, however, suggests that it is the perceived constancy of race-based rejection that makes experiences of racism different from experiences of sexism in this population.</p>

<sec id="section39-1368430211411594" sec-type="discussion">
<title>General discussion</title>
<p>Researchers have examined how people experience prejudice by comparing prejudice experiences to events that have exclusively external (i.e., everyone is rejected) or internal (i.e., only the individual is rejected) causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211411594">Schmitt &amp; Branscombe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211411594">Major et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, we compared the experiences of different types of prejudice among people who face both racism and sexism in their daily lives. We proposed that Asian Canadian women explain, react emotionally to, and perceive racism and sexism in different ways. Study 1 revealed that Asian women are more likely to attribute racism than sexism to internal factors. Study 2 showed that, in comparison to an experience of sexism, an experience of racism caused Asian women to feel more depressed. Study 3 indicated that Asian women perceive more racism than sexism in their environments. The present studies contribute to a growing literature examining the perspectives of stigmatized people by directly testing and disproving the assumption that prejudice targeting different group memberships is experienced in similar ways. It is particularly interesting to examine how female minorities react to different forms of prejudice because, in doing so, we are able to keep the group memberships of our participants constant while systematically varying prejudice type. This type of paradigm is preferable to comparing sexism directed towards White and minority women to racism directed towards male and female minorities, as this type of comparison may involve ‘comparing apples to oranges’. In other words, male minorities, as well as White females, cannot provide comparable perspectives on racism and sexism because neither group experiences both forms of prejudice as minority women do.</p>
<p>In Studies 1 and 2 we employed experimental paradigms used in past research to study responses to sexism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211411594">Major et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211411594">Schmitt &amp; Branscombe, 2002</xref>) in order to compare Asian women’s reactions to racism and sexism. Across these studies we observed that Asian women were more likely to attribute racism than sexism to internal factors; however, participants were also equally and highly likely to attribute both types of events to external factors. In addition, Asian women did not blame themselves more for negative outcomes due to racism as opposed to sexism. The findings suggest that Asian women regard perpetrators as being responsible for both forms of prejudice and understand in both cases that they are victims of others’ moral transgressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430211411594">Major, Quinton, &amp; McCoy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211411594">Major et al., 2003</xref>). How, then, can we interpret the finding that Asian women internalize the causes of racism more than sexism? Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430211411594">Schmitt and Branscombe (2002)</xref> explained that the causal locus of attributions is theoretically distinct from the assignment of blame for negative outcomes due to prejudice. When stigmatized group members internalize the causes of prejudice they reveal their awareness that an aspect of the self has been devalued and, because the self is constant across situations, that they will likely be targeted by prejudice across a variety of circumstances. It may be the case, therefore, that Asian women regard race as a more salient component of the self than gender and are more sensitive to the constant threat of racism as opposed to sexism. In other words, perhaps experiences of racism are regarded by Asian women as continuous and pervasive (because they are linked to the self), whereas experiences of sexism feel more immediate and circumscribed. This interpretation is supported by findings in Study 3 that Asian women perceive more racism than sexism in their environments.</p>
<p>In Study 2 we examined the emotional consequences of different types of prejudice for Asian women and discovered that participants reported feeling more depressed following a past experience of racism than sexism. Asian women remembering an experience of racism recalled feeling as depressed as participants in the personal rejection condition. Despite being aware that race-based rejections were not their fault, participants in Study 2 were unable to shield themselves against feelings of depression. Again, we suggest that the highly internal component of racism signals to Asian women that the threat of racism is constant (like the self), rendering attempts to defend against depression less effective.</p>
<p>The present findings imply that multiply- stigmatized people may use different coping strategies to deal with the different forms of prejudice they face. The discounting hypothesis, proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211411594">Major et al. (2003</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430211411594">Crocker &amp; Major, 1989</xref>), asserts that stigmatized people who attribute negative outcomes to prejudice can shift the blame for those outcomes away from the self and towards the prejudiced person, thereby protecting their self-esteem. Another coping method used by stigmatized people to improve their well-being has been described by the rejection-identification model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430211411594">Branscombe et al., 1999</xref>). According to this model, people who experience prejudice seek support from ingroup members as a way to buffer themselves against the negative consequences of constantly being rejected by dominant groups. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368430211411594">Major and O’Brien (2005)</xref> explained that people can choose among these and a variety of other coping mechanisms to deal with prejudice; the current research suggests, moreover, that different <italic>forms</italic> of prejudice may be handled most effectively by using coping strategies suited to deal with the personal impact endured. For example, Asian women may not be able to discount racism because this type of prejudice involves the denigration of a salient aspect of the self. Instead, they may be better able to protect their self-esteem by increasing the extent to which they identify with being Asian (as per the rejection-identification model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430211411594">Branscombe et al., 1999</xref>). Asian women who encounter sexism, alternatively, may avoid attributing negative outcomes to the self and so engage in some form of discounting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211411594">Major et al., 2003</xref>) as the optimal strategy to deal with this type of prejudice. Consistent with this suggestion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368430211411594">Garstka, Schmitt, Branscombe, and Hummert (2004)</xref> explained that young adults can envision leaving their low status age group and, therefore, they do not need to seek support from other young people when they perceive discrimination against their age group. In the current studies we were not able to test the role of identity importance in determining differential responses to racism and sexism or to examine the coping methods used by participants; as a result, it will be important for future work to explore whether some coping responses are particularly suited to dealing with rejections of more salient identities (e.g., race) than less salient ones (e.g., gender).</p>
<p>Critically, we were interested in whether Asian women respond differently to experiences of racism than sexism. It is interesting to consider, however, why participants in Studies 1 and 2 did not internalize personal rejection more than sexism. Similarly, we wondered why participants did not blame themselves more for a personal rejection than a prejudice rejection in general. These results may diverge from past findings because, unlike our participants, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211411594">Major et al.’s (2003)</xref> sample consisted mostly of White Americans who highly valued individual traits. Asians place less importance on personal abilities and, as a result, may be less likely to blame themselves for personal rejections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430211411594">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>). We are not aware of any research testing differences between White women and minority women to determine whether race moderates responses to sexism. Given that Asian women in the current studies viewed personal and sex-based rejections differently than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430211411594">Major et al.’s (2003)</xref> participants, future research is needed on this topic.</p>
<p>In addition, because the present studies involve Asian female undergraduate students, we are not able to generalize our findings to female minorities of different races and ages. Middle-aged women, importantly, are more likely than undergraduates to identify as female professionals and to experience hostile forms of prejudice directed towards business women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430211411594">Fiske et al., 2002</xref>). It is unlikely that participants in Studies 1 and 2 recalled sex-based rejections comparable to those experienced by female professionals; participants were instructed to contemplate present (Study 1) or past (Study 2) rejections and, as a result, should have focused only on forms of sexism directed towards their young adult selves. We encourage researchers, therefore, to examine how minority women of different races, ages and career stages respond to racism and sexism in order to build on the current findings. Our results provide a starting point for future work and suggest that multiply-stigmatized individuals’ responses to prejudice may be shaped by whether some forms of bias are experienced as more overtly negative than others. Given that Asians encounter harm, whereas women encounter helpfulness from prejudiced others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211411594">Cuddy et al., 2007</xref>), we predicted that Asian women would react more negatively to racism than sexism. We consider the current research to be a conservative test of whether racism is more impactful than sexism because Asians are regarded as “model minorities” and, despite being disliked for their coldness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430211411594">Fiske et al., 2002</xref>), are respected for their competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430211411594">Cheryan &amp; Bodenhausen, 2000</xref>). The finding that Asian women react negatively to race-based rejection implies that Black women (whose racial group is stereotyped as both incompetent and cold), for example, should react even more negatively to racism as compared to sexism. Therefore, although the current studies cannot rule out the possibility that some populations of female minorities experience racism and sexism in similar ways, the results do implore researchers to be wary of the assumption that all prejudice experiences are equivalent.</p>
<p>As we mentioned previously, the current exploration of differences in how Asian women experience racism and sexism was inspired by research suggesting that people express different forms of prejudice towards Asians and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430211411594">Fiske et al., 2002</xref>). Our findings suggest that Asian women react more negatively to racism than sexism, and this is consistent with the proposition that prejudice towards Asians manifests in overtly negative ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430211411594">Cuddy et al., 2007</xref>). We do not interpret these findings to mean that female minorities experience sexism as innocuous, as the negative consequences of encountering sexism have been well documented in the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430211411594">Davies, Spencer, Quinn, &amp; Gerhardstein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430211411594">Rudman &amp; Borgida, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430211411594">Schmitt et al., 2002</xref>). Instead, we suggest that in some cases female minorities may react more negatively to sexism than racism and that these reactions may be best captured by measures other than those administered in the current studies. Asian women may feel less competent, for example, following a sex-based rejection than a race-based rejection because, in light of stereotypes about women and Asians, sexism (but not racism) calls competence into question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430211411594">Fiske et al., 2002</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368430211411594">Sinclair et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, our argument that racism and sexism are experienced in different ways does not require that an experience of one form of prejudice always be more negative than an experience of the other. As a result, it will be important for researchers to examine alternative populations and situations in which sexism may relate to outcomes that are more negative than those related to racism.</p>
<p>We have suggested that Asian women’s attributions for, emotional reactions to, and perceptions of prejudice vary depending on whether prejudice signals the devaluation of race or gender. Past research has operated under the assumption that different forms of prejudice are experienced in similar ways; however, the current studies provide evidence that female minorities respond to racism and sexism very differently. We examined Asian women’s differential reactions to racism and sexism in terms of three variables (attributions, emotional outcomes, and perceived prejudice) that have been highlighted in the literature as important to understanding the perspectives of stigmatized people. Across three studies, we observed that Asian women internalize the causes of racism more than the causes of sexism, experience more depression in response to racism than sexism, and perceive more racism than sexism in their environments. It is important, therefore, for researchers to consider the unique aspects of race-based and gender-based rejections in order to better understand stigmatized group members’ reactions to prejudice. Future research should also examine whether perceiving some forms of prejudice as more salient and constantly threatening than other forms of prejudice directly relates to negative outcomes for stigmatized group members. The current work represents a starting point for future research, suggesting that for an Asian woman who views race as a literal part of her—as being “in [her] blood”—the experience of racism is quite different from the experience of sexism.</p>
