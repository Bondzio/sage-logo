<p>In this work, the medium containing ionic products of dicalcium silicates (Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>) for culturing MG63 cells was prepared by immersing a titanium alloy plate with the plasma sprayed Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coatings in DMEM solution. The effect of the ionic products on cellular differentiation, collagen production, and local growth factors (prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> [PGE<sub>2</sub>] and transforming growth factor-β [TGF-β1]) of osteoblast-like MG63 cells were investigated. The normal DMEM was also used to culture MG63 cells as the control group. Differentiation of cell was evaluated by detecting alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteocalcin (OC) synthesis as well as their gene expression. Collagen production was analyzed by Sircol assay. The levels of PGE<sub>2</sub> and TGF-β1 in culture medium were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The gene expressions of TGF-β receptors (TGF-β RI and TGF-β RII) were also measured by real-time PCR technology. MG63 cells cultured in DMEM containing ionic products of Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coating showed enhanced differentiation and increased collagen production. The results obtained from ELISA showed that the levels of PGE<sub>2</sub> and TGF-β1 in experimental group were higher than that in control. The gene expression of TGF-β receptors was upregulated, indicating that more TGF-β1 bonded to their receptors which produce more effects on the osteoblastic activity, leading to enhanced differentiation and synthetic activity of osteoblast. It is concluded that ionic products of Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coating may enhance cellular differentiation and collagen production by influencing TGF-β1 pathway.</p>

<p>Bioactive glasses without phosphate were thought to be the more suitable materials for bioactive scaffold due to their beneficial effect on osteoblast differentiation and local growth factors secretion when compared to bioglass (BG) containing phosphate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211416393">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211416393">3</xref></sup> Dicalcium silicate (Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>) consists of calcium, silicon, and oxygen, which is similar to phosphate-free bioglass. Our previous works showed that plasma sprayed Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coating could induce the formation of hydroxyapatite (HA) when soaked in simulated body fluid (SBF) for 2 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211416393">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211416393">6</xref></sup> In addition, plasma sprayed Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coating exhibited higher bonding strength to Ti alloys than plasma sprayed HA coating.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211416393">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211416393">7</xref></sup> Human osteogenetic cells also adhered and differentiated well on the coating surface due to its good biological properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211416393">8</xref></sup> Although the good bioactivity and biocompatibility of dicalcium silicates coating were confirmed, its interaction with osteoblast, in particular its effects on the phenotype and function of human osteoblasts, were not previously explored.</p>
<p>Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family is most abundant in bone matrix compared with other tissues. It is synthesized by osteoblast, stored in its latent form, released from the bone matrix, and activated in the bone microenvironment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211416393">9</xref></sup> Members of this family include the TGF-βs, activins, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP), and other related factors. TGF-β1 is considered the prototype of this large family of cytokines and an important growth factor for bone formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211416393">10</xref></sup> TGF-β1 synthesis enhances proliferation and activity of osteoblast and initiates a cascade of events that regulate osteoblast differentiation and extracellular matrix deposition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211416393">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211416393">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) is considered an important local factor that modulates bone metabolism through its effect on osteoblasts and osteoclasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211416393">12</xref></sup> PGE<sub>2</sub> has been shown to activate osteoclastogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211416393">13</xref></sup> and increase production of interleukin-6,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211416393">14</xref></sup> which can further enhance osteoclastogenesis. In contrast, PGE<sub>2</sub> also has been shown to have bone-forming activity. It enhances osteoblast differentiation and proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211416393">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211416393">16</xref></sup> Treatment of male, female, and ovariectomized mice with PGE<sub>2</sub> increases bone mass in vivo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211416393">17</xref></sup> When given locally or systemically, PGE<sub>2</sub> can stimulate bone formation and prevent bone loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211416393">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211416393">19</xref></sup> It has been demonstrated that PGE<sub>2</sub> can either stimulate or inhibit cellular growth and differentiation of osteoblastic cells depending on PGE<sub>2</sub> concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211416393">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211416393">21</xref></sup> PGE<sub>2</sub> with low concentrations has an anabolic effect on bone mass.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211416393">22</xref></sup> At high concentrations, PGE<sub>2</sub> is catabolic and associated with bone resorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211416393">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Several studies reported that the interaction between osteoblast and biomaterial could induce the production of cytokines, chemokines, and prostaglandins such as PGE<sub>2</sub> and TGF-β1, in turn, they could regulate cell proliferation and differentiation in either autocrine or paracrine manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211416393">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211416393">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211416393">26</xref></sup> Plasma sprayed Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coating was proved to have good biological properties. Therefore, it is possible that besides the direct effects of ionic products from Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coating on osteoblasts, there is a paracrine regulation of prostaglandins and growth factors, which contribute to bone formation by alteration of osteoblast functions. MG63 cells were frequently used to evaluate cell differentiation and cell activity in response to biomaterials because this cell line exhibits many osteoblastic traits that are characteristic of bone-forming cells. In addition, it was demonstrated that this kind of osteoblastic cell could synthesize TGF-β1 and PGE<sub>2</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211416393">27</xref></sup> In this work, we investigated the effect of the ionic products of plasma sprayed Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coating on osteoblast-specific gene expression and collagen production of human osteoblast-like cells MG63 as well as PGE<sub>2</sub> and TGF-β1 secretion. In addition, the gene expressions of TGF-β receptors responding to ionic products of plasma sprayed Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coating were also detected.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0885328211416393"><title>Preparation of the ionic products of Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coating</title>
<p>Dicalcium silicate powders with typical size of 5–30 µm were synthesized in the laboratory of Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. An atmosphere plasma spray (APS) system (Sulzer Metco, Switzerland) was applied to fabricate Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coatings on Ti-6Al-4 V substrate with dimensions of 10 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm. The spray parameters were as follows: argon (40 slpm) and hydrogen (12 slpm) were used as primary and auxiliary plasma forming gases, respectively. The feeding rate of powders was about 20 g/min using argon (3 slpm) as a carrying gas. The plasma arc current and voltage were 600 A and 73 V, respectively. The spraying distance was 90 mm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211416393">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>After ultrasonically washed in acetone and rinsed in deionized water, specimens were soaked in the DMEM medium (Gibco-BRL, NY, USA) at 37°C for 72 h (10 coupons per 200 mL DMEM) without stirring, then specimens were removed and the medium was collected. The medium was named Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>-DMEM in following description. The normal DMEM was used as the control medium. The concentration of silicon (Si), calcium (Ca), and phosphorus (P) in the medium was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis. The Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>-DMEM and control medium were then supplemented, respectively, with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmol <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (Sigma), and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin G, 100 µg/mL streptomycin sulfate). The medium was sterilized by filtering with 0.02 µm millipore filter after the pH value was adjusted to 7.4.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0885328211416393"><title>Cell culture</title>
<p>Human osteoblast-like cell line (MG63), derived from a human osteosarcoma, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mmol <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (Sigma), and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin G, 100 µg/mL streptomycin sulfate; Gibco BRL) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% air at 37°C. Until confluency, cells were passaged at a 1:3 split ratio following trypsinization with 0.05% (w/v) trypsin and 0.02% (w/v) tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid (EDTA). All experiments were performed using cells on second passage. A phase contrast microscope (OLYMPUS, Japan) was used to observe morphological changes.</p>

<sec id="sec5-0885328211416393"><title>Alkaline phosphatase activity</title>
<p>MG63 cells were seeded into 6-wells culture plates at 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well in DMEM with 10% FBS and allowed to attach for 24 h. Then the culture solutions were changed into serum-free medium. After that, cells were cultured in the normal DMEM as control, or in the conditioned DMEM containing ionic products of Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coating at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The cell culture mediums were collected after the cells were cultured for 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was tested as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328211416393">28</xref></sup> Cell supernatant was immediately analyzed using a commercial kit (ALP, JianChen biosystem, NanJing, China).

<sec id="sec6-0885328211416393"><title>Collagen production</title>
<p>The collagen production of osteoblast was analyzed by Sircol assay following the protocol of Tullberg in the fixed cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328211416393">29</xref></sup> The Sircol collagen assay is a quantitative dye-binding method designed for the quantitative analysis of collagen released into cell culture medium by mammalian cells. This method is based on the selective binding property of the Sirius Red dye to the [Gly-X-y] tripeptide end sequence of mammalian collagen. The solubilized collagen was evaluated by optical density analysis at 595 nm. The amount of collagen was calculated using a standard curve representing the relationship between collagen concentration and optical density.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0885328211416393"><title>Real-time polymerase chain reaction (real time-PCR)</title>
<p>MG63 cells were dispensed into 6-wells culture plate at 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well and incubated in Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>-DMEM and normal DMEM, respectively, at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen 1 mL per 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells). First strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 2 µg of total RNA in each sample using an Invitrogen Superscript First-strand Synthesis system, and then was amplified to generate products corresponding to mRNA encoding human gene products. Real-time PCR was carried out using SybrGreen qPCR SuperMix (Applied Biosystems, USA) for assessing the expression of ALP, osteocalcin (OC), TGF-β1 RI, and TGF-β1 RII, the house keeping gene β-actin was used as the internal control. An MJ thermocycler (MJ DNA Engine OPTICON 2, USA) was used for 50 cycles of PCR according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>
<p>Human sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers, designed on the basis of published sequences, are shown as follows: ALP (forward, CCT CCT CGG AAG ACA CTC TGA CC, reverse, CGC CTG GTA GTT GTT GTG AGC ATA G), OC (forward, CCT CAC ACT CCT CGC CCT ATT GG, reverse, GCT CAC ACA CCT CCC TCC TGG), TGF-β RI (forward, ATG GGC TTA GTA TTC TGG GAA ATT GC, reverse, AGA ATG ACG AGA ACA TAA CAC TAG AGA C), TGF-β RII (forward, TCC TGT TGA CTG AGT TGC GAT AAT G, reverse, GGT AGC AGT AGA AGA TGA TGA TGA CAG), β-actin (forward, AGC GAG CAT CCC CCA AAG TT, reverse, GGG CAC GAA GGC TCA TCA TT).</p>
<p>The total volume of 25 µL amplification mixture with an SYBR PCR master per well was performed for 50 cycles for ALP, OC, TGF-β RI and TGF-β RII primer pairs, and β-actin. After an initial step at 95°C for 5 min to activate the polymerase, each cycle consisted of 20 s of denaturation at 95°C, 20 s of annealing at 58°C, and 20 s of extension at 72°C. This was followed by an additional extension step at 72°C for 5 min. To show that there were no false-positive results, PCR reactions were carried out on reaction mixtures to which no cDNA was added. ΔCT calculates the differences between target CT value and the control for each sample: ΔCT = CT (target) – CT (control). The comparative expression level (fold change) was obtained by transforming the logarithmic values to absolute values using 2<sup>−ΔCT</sup>.</p>

<p>In order to mimic the reaction when the coating was implanted into body, the plasma sprayed Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coating was immersed in DMEM for 72 h to prepare conditioned DMEM for culturing osteoblast. After the immersion of Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coating, the concentrations of Ca and P in DMEM decreased slightly, while the concentration of Si increased significantly.

<p>The ALP activity is one of the most common markers of osteogenesis and is assumed to reflect the degree of osteogenic differentiation. It peaks after a certain time, declines again, and is followed by mineralization. The OC is a later marker of osteoblast differentiation. The results obtained from this study showed that not only ALP activity and OC synthesis but also their gene expression were promoted significantly when MG63 cells were cultured in Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>-DMEM, indicating that the ionic products of Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coating had potential to enhance osteoblast differentiation.

Simultaneously, TGF-β1 level of MG63 cell cultured in Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>-DMEM decreased obviously at day 7. Since the final concentration of TGF-β1 presented in the culture medium may depend on the amount of TGF-β1 bonding to TGF-β receptors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0885328211416393">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0885328211416393">48</xref></sup> it is possible that the significantly low concentration of TGF-β1 in Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>-DMEM on day 7 does not result from the reduction of MG63 cell synthesis but more free TGF-β1 bonding to the upregulated TGF-β receptors. Therefore, we suggested that the ionic products of Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coating not only enhanced osteoblasts synthesizing TGF-β1 but also increased TGF-β receptors gene expression, which stimulates a higher binding of TGF-β1 to its receptors and then leads to significantly low concentration of TGF-β1 in the culture medium.</p>
<p>Only TGF-β1 binding to its receptors in osteoblast could produce its effect on osteoblast. From this study, we found clearly that after TGF-β1 binding to its receptors on day 7, ALP activity and OC synthesis, their gene expressions as well as collagen production were enhanced significantly. These findings are in agreement with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211416393">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211416393">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0885328211416393">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885328211416393">42</xref></sup> that the presence of TGF-β1 in vitro could enhance differentiation of osteoblasts and increase collagen synthesis.</p>

Lower concentration of PGE<sub>2</sub> (from 10<sup>−8</sup> to 10<sup>−5</sup>M) can produce a higher effect on the osteoblast, which significantly increases TGF-β1 synthesis and the expression of TGF-β RI, and so, permits more TGF-β1 binding to its receptors. This may produce a positive effect on the osteoblast differentiation and synthetic activity, which leads to more bone deposition. On the other hand, higher concentration of PGE<sub>2</sub> (10<sup>−3</sup> M) does not stimulate TGF-β RI gene expression, which results in that most of the released TGF-β1 free in the extracellular media, and more unbound TGF-β1 promote osteoclast recruitment and differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885328211416393">46</xref></sup> In the present study, PGE<sub>2</sub> concentration in all culture model was very low (10<sup>−8</sup> M), indicating more influence on osteoblast differentiation by increasing TGF-β1 synthesis and TGF-β RI gene expression.</p>
<p>Therefore, the results obtained in this work support the idea that the ionic products of Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coating regulate osteoblast differentiation and collagen production by affecting the TGF-β1 pathway. However, it must be considered that other growth factors, such as bone morphogenetic proteins, NO, and other TGF-β isoforms, may have response to ionic products of Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coating and cooperate/antagonize osteoblast functions. It seemed that the OC synthesis in this work was not modulated by TGF-β1 because it inhibited terminal differentiation of osteoblast by inhibiting OC synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0885328211416393">39</xref></sup> The reason for this might be that the later stage of osteoblast differentiation was regulated by other growth factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211416393">21</xref></sup> Further investigations are necessary to give a better understanding for the mechanism of Ca<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> coating on the bone biology.</p>
