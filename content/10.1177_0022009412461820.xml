<abstract>
<p>In the 1920s, the Soviet Union employed arms exports as a means of attempting to exert influence on its less-developed Asian neighbors, either by intervening in internal struggles or encouraging pro-Soviet and anti-capitalist foreign policy. In Turkey and Iran, Soviet arms aimed to promote friendly governments and head off potential intervention. In Afghanistan, the Soviets attempted unsuccessfully to prop up the regime of Amanullah Khan. In China, the Soviets pursued an unfocused policy of providing weapons to a wide range of factions and warlords in an effort to win favor, only to find their efforts collapsing with Chiang Kai-shek’s betrayal of the Chinese Communist Party in 1927. This led the Soviets to overhaul their management of arms exports, handing authority to Wostwag, a front company for Soviet intelligence.</p>

<p>During the 1920s, the Soviet Union imported military technology from the more advanced West; at the same time, it enjoyed a technological and industrial edge over its Asian neighbors. This allowed the Soviet government to employ the export of weaponry as a tool of political influence in Turkey, Afghanistan, Iran and particularly China. Arms exports were not meant to raise revenue, though Soviet officials were quite careful in managing their financial side. Instead, weapons were a means of swaying the opinion of foreign governments towards the Soviet Union and away from capitalist powers (particularly in the cases of Iran and Turkey), or of tilting the balance of civil conflict towards pro-Soviet factions (Afghanistan and China). Diplomats, party officials, military officers and intelligence agents all cooperated in these efforts to employ armaments as a means of policy, albeit with limited success.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of arms exports in Soviet relations with its eastern neighbors, source problems have prevented exploration of the topic. Soviet military and intelligence documents on arms exports continue to be extremely difficult to find. Some sources are nonetheless available. The highest leadership of the Soviet state regarded arms exports as an inseparable part of foreign policy and so kept close control over the traffic in arms. In November 1930, for example, the Bolshevik party’s ruling Politburo mandated that all sales of military equipment abroad required its express permission.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022009412461820">1</xref></sup> Well before that decree, however, Soviet practice was that the Politburo maintained active oversight, extending to the occasional micromanagement of finance terms for weapons deals. As a result, Politburo protocols (that is, minutes) shed light on matters otherwise locked in inaccessible military or intelligence archives. Occasional more detailed documents on the operational realities of arms exports provide additional insight.</p>
<p>The Politburo documentation, supplemented by other sources, reveals a clear pattern. Soviet arms went to four neighboring states: Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and China. The rest of the world was largely closed to Soviet arms, for European states had access to technology as good or better than the Soviets and were ideologically hostile. As for the colonial world, while the Soviets might have entertained arms shipments to, say, nationalist groups in British India, the reality was that colonial territories generally had sufficiently effective border controls and internal policing to make weapons shipments both practically impossible and politically pointless. The Soviets could and did use the Communist International to support communism in India, but weapons shipments were a non-starter. Africa was likewise locked up by imperial powers; the independent states of Latin America were far beyond the horizon of Soviet foreign policy thinking in the 1920s.</p>
<p>Neither Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, nor China had a government that could be termed socialist in the Soviet understanding of the term, but a clear and well-understood principle of Soviet policy regarded anti-Western or anti-imperialist governments and movements as objective Soviet allies in the struggle against capitalism, regardless of their social make-up.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009412461820">2</xref></sup> In addition, an acute sense of vulnerability to renewed anti-Soviet intervention by the Western powers heightened what George Kennan termed the ‘sheer geopolitical necessity of protecting from foreign penetration and domination those areas of Asia … which lie adjacent to the Russian borders’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009412461820">3</xref></sup> Soviet foreign policy consistently used arms to stave off the presence of hostile states on its vulnerable eastern frontiers.</p>
<p>Within this pattern of engineering friendly regimes, Soviet policy was improvised and reactive to events, rather than consistent. In Afghanistan, for example, the rapid collapse of one regime left the Soviets scrambling to determine how to deal with its successor. Most of all, though, China’s dizzying political complexity in the 1920s left the Soviets trying, with ultimate failure, to steer among contending factions. The problem lay with turbulent politics abroad, not Soviet internal divisions. Guided by policy set in the Politburo, all branches of the Soviet state – diplomats, spies, military officers and party activists – worked together to distribute weapons in furthering the aims of Soviet policy.</p>
<p>While Soviet arms exports occasionally came from the ongoing production of Soviet military industry, typical practice was different. As a rule, arms shipments were taken from Red Army stocks, with resulting deficits made good by later production from Soviet military industry and compensation to the Red Army’s budget. The Red Army, generally speaking, did not determine where and to whom arms went, though it had a significant role in providing the weapons and training clients in their use. While long-term orders could be covered by the production of Soviet military industry, any urgent order could only be filled from the Red Army itself. In addition to tapping into regular Red Army stocks, though, arms shipments provided an opportunity to get rid of odd lots of equipment that had fallen into Soviet hands at one time or another. In April 1925, for example, the Red Army’s Iosif Unshlikht reported that 2000 Japanese and 2000 German rifles had been delivered to China, and in October 1925 the motley proceeds of a Soviet campaign to disarm the population of the North Caucasus (Chechnya, Ingushetia and Ossetia) were redirected to supply Soviet clients in China.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009412461820">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, as a result of artillery purchases abroad and captured trophy artillery pieces from the Russo–Japanese War, the First World War and the Russian Civil War, the Red Army had in addition to its standard complement a mismatched collection of weapons whose varying demands for supply and maintenance made them more trouble than they were worth. Many were disposed of in early 1926, when the Red Army passed on to Turkey 44 6-inch howitzers, 16 4.5-inch British howitzers and 16 107 mm Japanese field guns with ammunition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009412461820">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>By contrast to Russian arms exports after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Soviet sales in the 1920s were not motivated by profit or the need to keep munitions factories in operation, though the Politburo did wish to make exports self-supporting where possible. The exceptions were Afghanistan, which lacked financial resources, and China, evidently regarded as important enough to justify the grant of weaponry with little immediate hope of repayment. For Iran and Turkey, discount or preferred financing was possible, though outright gifts were rare. The purpose of exports was to exert influence and breaking even was a way to make arms sales sustainable, not their reason for being. The remainder of this article will explore the dynamics of those exports in particular places.</p>
<p>Turkey shows how domestic anti-communism was irrelevant for Soviet arms exports so long as a state’s foreign policy remained pro-Soviet, or rather anti-imperialist. The Soviet goal was preventing Turkish dependence on Europe’s capitalist powers while promoting good relations more generally. The initiative in the Soviet–Turkish relationship first lay with the Turks, as the Turkish national movement appealed for Soviet assistance in April 1920 in its ongoing struggle against Greece and the Entente powers. Concrete connections were slow to materialize, but as the Russian Civil War ended in late 1920 and early 1921, the Soviet leaders’ desire to prevent any renewed intervention against their new state led to a March 1921 Treaty of Friendship. From the Turkish point of view, this removed any threat of irredentism in eastern Anatolia from Soviet Armenia and allowed concentration against Greek forces in the west.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009412461820">6</xref></sup> To cement the nascent relationship, Mikhail Frunze, commander of the armed forces of Soviet Ukraine and soon-to-be head of the entire Red Army, visited Turkey in late 1921 and early 1922. His mission, combining both diplomatic and military goals, was to strengthen the connection between the new Soviet state and Mustafa Kemal’s Turkish national movement. Both sides were consciously revisionist, aiming to undermine the post-First World War settlement established by the victorious Entente.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009412461820">7</xref></sup> Their cooperation furthered the gradual end of Soviet diplomatic isolation and supported Kemal in his ongoing struggles to liberate Anatolia. The precise material nature of Soviet support for the new Turkish state remains obscure, but seems to have involved substantial sums of gold from Soviet stores – perhaps as many as 10 m gold rubles. In 1921 and early 1922, military aid included substantial amounts of ammunition and perhaps weapons as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009412461820">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>By March 1922, with Italy and France abandoning efforts to contain the momentum of Kemal’s movement, the Soviet government saw an opportunity to increase its influence by providing aid for Turkey’s final showdown with Greek forces in western Anatolia. Semyon Aralov, a key figure in the creation of Soviet military intelligence and de facto Soviet ambassador to the Kemalists, communicated that the Turks desperately needed Soviet assistance, particularly ammunition and transport, for ‘if the Turks are beaten the West will have Anatolia and all our works will collapse’. The Politburo agreed and ordered the Soviet military’s high command to give immediately as much aid as possible, though the concrete nature of that aid remains unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009412461820">9</xref></sup> After Mustafa Kemal won a complete victory over the Greeks and their Entente backers in August–September 1922, the Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissariat and the Red Army’s high command were charged with determining an appropriate ‘gift to the Turkish officer corps’ to commemorate the victory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009412461820">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the end of the Greco–Turkish War, the Soviet government continued to cultivate the relationship. At the suggestion of Sergo Ordzhonikidze, key Bolshevik official in the Caucasus, the Soviets granted Kemal’s government 50 tons of aviation fuel and 400 tons of automotive fuel at below-market prices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009412461820">11</xref></sup> In June 1925, in a declaration of general policy aimed at both Turkey and Iran, the Soviets described developing trade as a means to ‘paralyze the influence on them of capitalist states, liberating them from the economic and political yoke of imperialism’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009412461820">12</xref></sup> In 1926, a Politburo commission approved a long-term arms deal with Turkey. Turkish purchases of ongoing Soviet military production were acceptable to the Politburo so long as they did not harm fulfilment of the Red Army’s own orders. The Politburo approved an additional immediate purchase from Red Army stocks of 76 artillery pieces (the odd lots mentioned above) with 1800 rounds of ammunition each. Because of the political importance of the sale, Turkey was offered favorable payment terms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009412461820">13</xref></sup> The pattern of favorable financing continued early in 1927, when the Politburo approved a Turkish order for 40 additional heavy howitzers: 10 122 mm, 20 152 mm and 10 massive 203 mm pieces. Soviet terms were 9 m rubles in gold or other hard currency, with 1 m as down payment and the remainder in six installments over three years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009412461820">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another substantial Turkish order was approved in August–September 1927. In this particular case, the sources provide more logistical detail than is typically available. Given assurances by Aleksandr Tolokontsev, head of Soviet military industry, that providing weapons to Turkey would not materially harm Red Army orders, the Politburo approved an order for 19.5 m rubles of equipment, with delivery to the Black Sea coast for transshipment to Turkey. The necessary materials would come out of the Red Army’s annual procurement from military industry. The Red Army would be reimbursed with 8 m rubles in the 1927–8 fiscal year budget and the remainder in 1928–9. Though the Soviets worked internally in rubles, the deal with the Turks was denominated in dollars. Turkey additionally wished to import leather goods (saddles and harnesses for artillery transport) but the price on offer was far below what the Soviets judged acceptable and those items were removed from the arms package.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009412461820">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Soviet exports of military equipment to Turkey continued sporadically at least through the early 1930s. In late December 1930, the Politburo approved the delivery of a military tractor (for purposes of artillery transport) to a competition in Ankara, on top of earlier deliveries of agricultural machinery. Additional sales of arms were possible, though available records do not reveal any actual shipment. Soviet internal discussions continued to stress the need in deals with Turkey to receive something akin to world market prices for weaponry, offering a discount below standard European prices only for payment in cash.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009412461820">16</xref></sup> In May 1932, the Soviets again offered military equipment to Turkey, approving the gift of 5 T-27 Carden-Lloyd tankettes and a pair of T-26 Vickers tanks (all armed with machine guns). These were evidently intended to sweeten an offer of 16 m rubles of long-term credits for Turkey towards the purchase of textile machinery and military equipment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022009412461820">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>After a brief initial period of efforts to destabilize Iran, including support for the short-lived Gilan Republic on the Caspian shore, Soviet policy shifted to nurturing anti-imperial policies through arms exports. A 1919 Anglo–Iranian draft treaty raised the unwelcome specter for the Soviet leadership of an active British presence on the Soviet Caucasus and Central Asian frontiers, as result of which the Soviets backed separatist movements in Iran. A coup d’etat by Reza Khan in February 1921 and the almost simultaneous signing of a Soviet–Iranian treaty began to put relations on a much better footing. British diplomats continued to report Soviet efforts to destabilize Iran with the shipment of weapons to rebel groups, though they do not seem to have persisted past the end of 1922. In September 1922, M. Saunders, British military attaché in Tehran, reported that arms were being shipped to restive Iranian tribesman through Soviet consular officials. In July, a ‘reliable report’ had informed him that 500 rifles with ammunition had reached Shahsevan tribesmen near Arbedil from the Soviet Azerbaijani city of Länkäran. Another Soviet consul in Tabriz had arranged the shipment of rifles and ammunition into the region of Karadagh, south of the border between Iran and Soviet Azerbaijan. Both of those were west of the Caspian Sea, but Saunders also had reports of a shipment of arms to Turkoman tribesmen in Bandar-e-gaz, just east of the Caspian on the Iranian border with Soviet Central Asia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022009412461820">18</xref></sup> Available Soviet records do not confirm these shipments; if they are in fact accurate in describing Soviet arms deliveries to restive Iranian tribes, the Soviet political line had clearly shifted by early 1923 away from destabilizing Iran toward expanding connections. On 1 February 1923, the Politburo endorsed a shipment of 2000 rifles to Iran, on condition that Soviet instructors be introduced to the Iranian army or some other means of control over the weapons be established.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022009412461820">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Through the mid-1920s, if diplomatic reports are accurate, Soviet arms shipments to Iran continued in support of the Iranian government. British officials reported the arrival at Anzali on the Caspian Sea of 800,000 rifle cartridges in December 1924 and another 600,000 cartridges, along with four cartloads of rifles, in September 1925. One million rifle cartridges intended for Reza Khan’s campaign to assert Tehran’s authority over the province of Khuzestan (Arabistan in British sources), arrived in January 1925.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022009412461820">20</xref></sup> Reza Khan’s elevation to shah at the end of 1925 did not affect the Soviet attitude towards Iran; the Politburo determined in the wake of Reza Khan’s deposition of Ahmad Shah Qajar that it would maintain friendly relations with the Iranian government and committed itself to non-interference with the political transition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022009412461820">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>One transaction selling rifle ammunition to Iran includes logistical details which provide some sense of the mechanics of Soviet exports. The deal was negotiated by Venetskii, a representative of the Soviet cartridge, fuse and explosive trust Patrubvzryv. In meeting Iranian officer Mekhdi Guli Mirza Takhremani on 19 February 1927, Venetskii agreed to deliver one million .30 caliber rifle cartridges. The Red Army’s Director of Supply Pavel Dybenko then instructed his subordinate Director of Artillery to use ‘especially trustworthy’ men to deliver one million rounds of 1925–6 manufacture to the port town of Pekhlavi (Enzeli). After handing over the ammunition to the military governor of the port, the soldiers were to return to the USSR with cash. The payment, 86,640 rubles for the cartridges and an additional 2159 rubles for shipping, was to be deposited in the Red Army’s account in Gosbank, the state bank of the Soviet Union.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022009412461820">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Though details are sketchy, Soviet arms sales to Iran continued over the ensuing years. In September 1929, for example, the Politburo approved a cash sale by the Soviet Main Military-Industrial Directorate of 4000–5000 bombs, provided that the Iranians agreed as well to purchase Soviet rifles, bullets and artillery. In August 1932, the Politburo also approved the sale to Iran of military aircraft, cavalry saddles and boots.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022009412461820">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>For the Soviets, Afghanistan’s position as a buffer state between Soviet Central Asia and British India meant that it could present either an opportunity or a threat. If Afghanistan pursued the creation of a Greater Afghanistan by uniting the peoples of Afghanistan proper with their ethnic cousins in Soviet Central Asia, the Soviets faced a clear threat to their territorial integrity. Afghan hostility to Britain, however, would provide a welcome margin of safety. The result, as in Turkey, was the use of arms as a means of influencing events.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022009412461820">24</xref></sup> From the early 1920s, the Soviets supplied weapons in an effort to ensure a friendly government. In this case, though, Soviet arms supplies actively intervened in Afghanistan’s civil conflicts. A cryptic reference in 1920, which might involve weapons but could be something else entirely, mentions Soviet diplomat Lev Karakhan’s efforts with Afghanistan to obtain ‘reduction of the demanded’ and ‘longer term of delivery of the demanded objects and to fix terms of exchange.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0022009412461820">25</xref></sup> The picture is little clearer in 1921, when the February 1921 Soviet-Afghan Treaty of Friendship included provisions for ‘material assistance’ for Afghanistan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0022009412461820">26</xref></sup> Despite this treaty, tensions persisted over Afghanistan’s intentions in Central Asia and in particular its possible support for the <italic>basmachi</italic>, traditionalist Muslim insurgents fighting the imposition of Soviet rule.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0022009412461820">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>In February 1923, the Politburo ordered the Soviet military to stockpile supplies close to the Afghan border as a contingency for the possible decision to supply weapons to one of Afghanistan’s warring factions. A special commission of Ian Rudzutak, a veteran revolutionary with experience in Central Asia affairs; Georgii Chicherin, People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs; and Efraim Sklianskii, deputy to Lev Trotsky, head of the Red Army, was assigned to work out a policy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0022009412461820">28</xref></sup> The Soviet government entrusted Fyodor Raskol’nikov, ambassador to Afghanistan, to discuss potential cooperation against British efforts in Central Asia, but delayed any delivery of arms. The Politburo specified that any arms delivery was contingent on guarantees that the weapons not be used against Soviet interests and on further clarification of any Afghan connections to <italic>basmachi</italic> campaigns on Soviet territory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0022009412461820">29</xref></sup> In late March 1923 the Soviets further underlined that any subsidies to the Afghan government required Afghanistan to maintain good order internally as measured by an end to any raids by Afghans against Soviet territory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0022009412461820">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>After preliminary discussions in 1925, the first clearly-attested shipment of arms and ammunition took place in 1926 though many of its details remain obscure. The Politburo initially agreed to grant Afghanistan six combat aircraft with Soviet crews and to subsidize Afghan arms purchases from Soviet stocks with 500,000 rubles to lower the overall cost. Despite this new resolution, complications threatened to undermine any potential agreement. Politburo discussions record a dispute involving damaged goods: 15,000 rifles and 15 million rounds. The Politburo initially determined that Soviet military industry needed to be compensated for its expenses in repairing the rifles, suggesting perhaps that they were surplus or salvaged weapons. Those same initial determinations held military industry responsible for 15 million substandard rounds of ammunition, suggesting flaws in newly-manufactured cartridges. By April 1926, however, the Politburo had clarified its position, determining that the rifle ammunition was perfectly adequate for short-term use and any problems would only arise with long-term storage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0022009412461820">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Concrete evidence of improved Soviet-Afghan diplomatic relations <italic>followed</italic> rather than preceded this arms deal, suggesting that the overarching Soviet strategy of using arms to promote better relations had achieved some success. On 31 August 1926, the Soviets and Afghans signed a non-aggression treaty in conjunction with settling a border dispute; its third article specified non-interference in internal affairs, reassuring the Soviets that Afghan support would not bolster an ongoing insurgency in Tajikistan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0022009412461820">32</xref></sup> Better relations meant additional arms. In March 1927, the Politburo approved the sale of an additional tranche of weapons from Red Army stocks, paid for by reserve funds under the control of the Council of People’s Commissars. Precise details were handed over to a commission made up of Kliment Voroshilov (head of the Red Army), Anastas Mikoian (People’s Commissar of Trade) and Lev Karakhan (Deputy Commissar of Foreign Affairs, specializing in Asian issues).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0022009412461820">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>This particular deal, probably as a result of Afghanistan’s relative poverty, was marked by an especially high level of subsidy. As of September 1927, the Politburo found that its previous subsidies to Afghanistan included nearly 700,000 rubles of weaponry and almost 600,000 rubles of spare parts not yet paid for. Previous pledges to Afghanistan had included 12 aircraft, the creation of an aviation school, eight anti-aircraft guns and 5000 rifles. Of that, four aircraft and two guns remained to be delivered and the Politburo confirmed its commitment to that. It also promised 4 m rubles of armaments, in return for only 1 m rubles of Afghan payment, with the loss treated by the Soviet government as a price worth paying for political good will. The People Commissariat of Finance paid the Red Army 420,000 rubles in compensation for its expenses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0022009412461820">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>In late 1928 the Soviet Union faced a new and unexpected Afghan problem: the government they had backed with arms and military supplies was in imminent danger of collapse. The modernizing efforts of the reformer king Amanullah Khan had triggered a broad-based popular revolt weaving together many strands of discontent. Peasants burdened by arrogant bureaucrats and land taxes, nobles removed from their traditional sources of prestige and patronage, and ethnic Tajiks resentful of Pushtun domination all joined in an armed uprising against Amanullah’s government. The Soviet observer K.I. Sokolov-Strakhov reported how firearms were widely available in the markets of Kabul and Kandahar, allowing insurgents to obtain weapons easily. Noting the abysmally poor showing of the Afghan army in the initial stages of the fighting, Sokolov-Strakhov refused to place any blame on supply difficulties or insufficient Soviet weaponry. Instead he emphasized the incompetence of the leadership of the Afghan army, which consistently refused to press the rebels to battle, lacked any intelligence on the location of rebel formations, underestimated the threat posed by the revolt, split its forces in the face of the enemy and undertook no political initiatives to gain popular support. Sokolov-Stakhov emphasized that the one bright spot for the Afghan government’s troops was their excellent artillery, at least in part supplied by the Soviets, but that this was negated by Amanullah’s miserly expenditures on ammunition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0022009412461820">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>Over autumn 1928 the increasing rebel threat to Kabul produced panic in the Afghan government. It then appealed to the Soviet Union for more arms, including chemical weapons. Delays in communications produced a disconnect between events on the ground in Afghanistan and decisions in Moscow; on 13 December 1928, the very day that electricity to Kabul was cut off by the rebels, the Politburo agreed to permit the Red Army to sell the Afghan government ‘in the established manner’ 1000 rifles with bullets, 20 machine guns, 1000 chemical rounds and a radio station. Given the ‘straitened circumstances’ of the Afghan government, the Soviets agreed to accept payment in kind of either wool, cotton, or karakul.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0022009412461820">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The very next day rebels attacked and captured an Afghan government arsenal to the north of Kabul while launching a simultaneous attack against the city itself. Only after three days of bitter street fighting were the rebels expelled from Kabul. The Politburo then took a further decision a week later, evidently after receiving further calls from Kabul for material assistance, including chemical bombs for use by the fledgling Afghan air force. The Politburo’s response stressed that the Soviets had no chemical bombs and so could not send any; in their place the Afghans could drop chemical artillery rounds from aircraft. Likewise, the Soviets promised to deliver additional radios, gasoline and aircraft, and offered diplomatic concessions in hopes of strengthening Amanullah’s position. They guaranteed the integrity of Amanullah’s northern border and suggested he send his border troops south to relieve Kabul.</p>
<p>The threat to the Afghan government was so grave, however, that there was little way to get Soviet weapons and ammunition to Amanullah. Much of the countryside was under rebel control and Kabul was almost entirely surrounded. Any armaments and shells consequently had to be transported into Kabul by plane. Chemical rounds were not much problem, as the 1000 shells proposed by the Politburo were a relatively small amount, easily transported by plane. The more conventional materials, however, strained the transportation resources available.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0022009412461820">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>Even as Amanullah’s rule teetered, the Soviet government still maneuvered to maximize its own influence. The Politburo told Leonid Nikolaevich Stark, their representative in Kabul, that the entire uprising was the handiwork of British imperialism, increasing the importance of keeping the king on the throne. Despite this fear of outside agents at work, and despite the imminent collapse of Amanullah’s regime, the Soviets demanded concessions, telling Amanullah that further Soviet assistance with arms and training could only be put into place upon completion of a new Anglo–Soviet treaty. In addition, the Soviets strongly recommended that Amanullah create a unit from among Afghanistan’s northern tribes (Uzbeks and Tajiks) which could then easily be supplied and trained by the Soviets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0022009412461820">38</xref></sup> Given the ethnic links between those peoples and Soviet Central Asia, this may have been an effort at creating a Soviet stalking horse inside Afghanistan.</p>
<p>All such possibilities were rendered moot, however, by Amanullah’s abdication at the beginning of 1929. He surrendered the throne to his brother Inayatullah Khan, who in turn gave up power in a matter of days to the warlord Habibullah Kalakani (also known as <italic>Bacha-i-Saqao</italic>). In the atmosphere of general uncertainty and the antipathy of Kalakani’s supporters towards Amanullah’s Soviet friends, the Soviet ambassador Stark evidently lost his nerve and the Politburo instructed his deputy Ring to take over. With no prospect of political stability, Moscow mandated a policy of watching and waiting, specifying ‘biding time, neutrality, and non-interference in internal affairs’. A later Soviet summary of its policy towards Afghanistan in 1929 stressed its avoidance of entanglements in the civil war.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0022009412461820">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite these good intentions, Soviet policy rapidly abandoned non-interference and instead shifted to full-fledged opposition to Kalakani’s new regime. Amanullah had fled from Kabul to Kandahar in the hope of resuming his resistance to the new master in Kabul. Amanullah sought an alliance with the Afghan general Nadir Khan, who had crossed into Afghanistan from British India on 8 March 1929 in order to rejoin the hornet’s nest of Afghan politics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0022009412461820">40</xref></sup> In late March, the Soviets decided to send arms to Amanullah in Kandahar via Herat, close to the Soviet border in north-western Afghanistan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0022009412461820">41</xref></sup> The Soviets feared the possibility of Iranian intervention in Afghanistan to seize Herat and pressed Amanullah to improve its defenses. The Soviet government issued a stern warning to Iran in mid-April 1929 to desist from any moves on Herat, while Iran denied any such intention. There is no evidence whether this particular March 1929 shipment of weapons ever made it to Amanullah; in the immediate aftermath of the Politburo agreement to provide him with additional weaponry, Amanullah began an ultimately unsuccessful push on Kabul to regain the throne, but finally fled into exile in British India. One Russian scholar claims (albeit without documentary evidence) that Stalin actually engineered a failed intervention by Soviet troops on behalf of the feckless Amanullah in April–May 1929 before his ultimate flight into exile.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0022009412461820">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>With Amanullah out of the picture, Nadir Khan conquered Kabul and ousted Habibullah in October 1929 to became Afghanistan’s de facto ruler. Despite deep misgivings over Nadir Khan’s anti-Soviet sentiments, the Soviet Union recognized his government on 19 October 1929,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0022009412461820">43</xref></sup> and Nadir Khan formally took power as king in October 1930. The Soviet relationship with him appears, based on the record of arms sales, to have been substantially more distant than with the unfortunate Amanullah. In March 1930, the Politburo permitted the transit of 5000 rifles and 5,000,000 bullets from Germany.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0022009412461820">44</xref></sup> This may have been a sale brokered through the German-based Soviet front company Wostwag (discussed below); available sources are silent.</p>
<p>By September 1930, however, the Soviet leadership had grown skeptical of sending arms to Afghanistan. It resolved to consider unwise any further sales of arms or military aircraft to Nadir Khan, though that decision included no specific reasons for the decision. Payment problems may have played a role, since the possibility of Afghan payment-in-kind (that is, raw materials) at the moment of arms delivery reopened the question briefly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0022009412461820">45</xref></sup> Regardless, by the end of October the Politburo decided to refrain from any arms sales, claiming that the problem was a lack of available Soviet aircraft.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0022009412461820">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>Owing to the inherent importance of Soviet involvement in China, both to contemporaries and today, arms exports to China are much better documented. Soviet weapons are intimately tied to the tangled history of Soviet relations with China in general and to bitter recriminations between Stalin and his defeated rival Lev Trotsky after the total collapse of Soviet China policy. While China was split among contending factions, the Soviets were closely connected to the Guomindang (GMD, or National People’s Party) based in the southern Chinese province of Guangzhou (Canton),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0022009412461820">47</xref></sup> as well as the GMD’s warlord allies in northern China. At the same time, the Soviet Union pursued formal diplomatic relations with China’s nominal government in Beijing. Finally, the Soviets cultivated the nascent Chinese Communist Party, formed in 1921. Until Chiang Kai-shek’s Guomindang violently broke with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1927, the Soviet line was to support the GMD and left-leaning warlords while simultaneously supporting CCP infiltration and radicalization of those groups. Chinese politics in this period were exceedingly complex and Soviet policy faced extreme difficulty in managing numerous and occasionally conflicting commitments.</p>
<p>By 1919, China’s ongoing turmoil had resulted in an international arms embargo. Consensus of diplomatic representatives in China determined that further arms would only worsen chaos and bloodshed and that the flow of arms from outside China had to be ended. This agreement was not aimed at actively intercepting shipments of arms to China; instead the powers concerned agreed to restrain their own citizens and subjects from exporting arms to China. The Soviet Union did not consider itself necessarily bound by this international consensus and provided the Guomindang with diplomatic support and limited military assistance. In January 1923, the GMD’s founder Sun Yat-sen declared jointly with Soviet diplomat Adolph Joffe that it would cooperate with the Soviet Union, while the Soviet Union would not attempt to impose a Soviet model on China. The Chinese Communist Party fell into line behind the Soviet policy of cooperation with the GMD.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0022009412461820">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1923, the Soviet government regarded the Guomindang’s chief tasks as political. Though the Soviets did provide military advisors and training, the Red Army and Soviet policymakers alike were skeptical of military adventures by Sun and the GMD until they had broader political support. A Politburo meeting in March 1923 that approved granting Sun $2 m Mexican expressed disapproval of the GMD’s overemphasis on military measures at the expense of political agitation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0022009412461820">49</xref></sup> The Soviet Union’s push for a more political line was even clearer during a September 1923 visit to Moscow by a GMD delegation led by Chiang Kai-shek. On 9 September, Chiang met with Sergei Kamenev, the tsarist officer who was now the Red Army’s supreme field commander and Efraim Sklianskii, Deputy People’s Commissar for War. Chiang requested Red Army advisors to train Chinese troops. Chiang also underlined the GMD’s terrible shortage of weaponry: one functional arsenal in the city of Guangdong, a destroyed powder factory and active British efforts to keep arms out of south China. Things were bad enough that the GMD was considering shifting its operations to north-western China simply to enable better access to Soviet support.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0022009412461820">50</xref></sup> When Chiang managed to meet with Trotsky himself (incapacitated by illness during the earlier meeting) in late November, Trotsky stressed the dangers of an exclusively military approach on the part of Sun and the GMD, telling Chiang ‘a good newspaper is better than a bad division.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0022009412461820">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>Though Soviet sympathies lay with the left-leaning Guomindang, the Soviet government hedged its bets by dealing with other power centers as well. In May 1924, Lev Karakhan signed a treaty with Wellington Koo, Foreign Minister of China’s internationally-recognized government, establishing diplomatic relations. This did not stop ongoing assistance to the GMD in southern China, including the establishment of the Whampoa Military Academy. In March 1924, Karakhan engineered a deal to provide money, rifles and artillery to the GMD. In May 1925, the Politburo approved 200 military instructors, 500,000 rubles, 20,000 rifles and 100 machine guns for dispatch to Guangzhou under strictest secrecy. A substantial portion of those weapons came from the Red Army’s own stockpiles, compensated by additional orders to Soviet military industry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0022009412461820">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to the GMD and to China’s recognized government, the Soviets also established an ongoing relationship with northern warlords who were sympathetic to the GMD, friendly to the Soviet Union and at least nominally inclined towards progressive political views. In March 1925, the Soviets approved the establishment of northern military schools, along the lines of Whampoa, at Luoyang and Zhangjiakou (Kalgan).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0022009412461820">53</xref></sup> In early 1925, they were also exploring military aid to the northern Christian warlord Feng Yuxiang (Feng Yü-hsiang), but only on strictly commercial terms which included transport, payment and particularly economic concessions in Mongolia as part of a broader alliance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0022009412461820">54</xref></sup> In May, the Politburo’s China commission outlined a substantial shipment of arms to Feng, including a number of light tanks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0022009412461820">55</xref></sup> By September 1925, this had extended to establishing and equipping a 3000-man cavalry unit for Feng at a cost of over 12 m rubles and the possibility of providing him with chemical weapons and an air force. Five experienced cavalrymen were approved for dispatch to Feng in October.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0022009412461820">56</xref></sup> A detailed breakdown of deliveries included almost 3.5 m rubles of artillery.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0022009412461820">57</xref></sup> Feng’s subordinate ally Zhang Zhijiang, warlord of Chahar (Inner Mongolia), was scheduled for 976,000 rubles of equipment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0022009412461820">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>In September 1925, the circle of beneficiaries of Soviet military assistance extended still further. The Politburo’s China commission agreed to dispatch 12 aircraft immediately to Guomindang forces in Guangzhou, along with an additional tranche of weapons shipped from Vladivostok. Feng Yuxiang was also scheduled to receive a dozen aircraft. Additional planes would follow to the Guomindang (15), to Feng (10) and to Yue Weijun (10), another ally of Feng’s in the loose coalition of pro-GMD warlords called the National-Revolutionary Army (Guominjun).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0022009412461820">59</xref></sup> Yue was slated, in the words of a report to Stalin, ‘if only for the strengthening of our influence’ for just over 700,000 rubles of equipment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0022009412461820">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the same time that the Soviets were establishing diplomatic relations with China’s legal government and providing assistance to the GMD and its northern warlord allies, they provided arms to the right-wing warlord of Manchuria Zhang Zuolin (Chang Tso-lin) in a short-lived relationship highlighting the particular problems the Soviets faced in attempting to navigate the complexities of Chinese politics. As of November 1924, Karakhan was deeply engaged in talks with Zhang over arms shipments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0022009412461820">61</xref></sup> In April 1925, the Politburo gave further approval to negotiations with Zhang over the purchase of Soviet weapons, but only on a number of conditions. The Politburo was concerned that Zhang might intend to use the weapons to boost his own power at the expense of the GMD (which he almost certainly did). The Soviets also hoped arms sales might produce concessions and compensation for the Soviet stake in the contested Chinese Eastern Railway running through Zhang-controlled territory in Manchuria.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0022009412461820">62</xref></sup> Relatively quickly, the Soviets determined that Zhang was too power-hungry and unreliable to deal with. In October 1925, the Red Army’s head Mikhail Frunze declared flatly that ‘the main enemy of the national-revolutionary movement in China at present is Zhang Zuolin’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0022009412461820">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>This maze of arms deals and scatter-shot approach to diplomacy in 1925 suggests that Soviet policy lacked clear guiding principles. While the Soviets evidently were interested in finding friends wherever possible, even if their leanings could not in any way be described as socialist, Zhang Zuolin proved to be a man the Soviets simply could not stomach. They looked elsewhere for friends. If Zhang Zuolin could not be trusted, weapons went instead to pro-Guomindang and pro-Soviet forces in northern China. As of late 1925, the Soviets were under some time pressure, for their previous assumptions had been that large-scale conflict between the fervently anti-communist Zhang Zuolin and the Soviets’ ally Feng Yuxiang would wait until after the winter of 1925–6. Political developments over the course of 1925, however, suggested that the clash would come sooner, but it was not easy to rush weapons to northern China. Arms could reach the GMD in Guangzhou by sea from Vladivostok; the pro-Guomindang northern armies, however, lacked sea access, and weapons went by a more difficult overland passage from Ulan Bator in Outer Mongolia through Zhangjiakou. Nonetheless, Feng’s desperate need meant he was scheduled to receive 30,000 rifles, 160–172 machine guns with ammunition, 54 artillery pieces and an additional four heavy artillery pieces, 15,000 poison gas shells and 10 aircraft. Alleviating Feng’s material disadvantage in comparison with Zhang Zuolin, Soviet arms would suffice to equip an army of 15 divisions, totaling 100,000 infantry and an additional 5000 cavalry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0022009412461820">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>Smaller but still substantial amounts of weaponry were earmarked for other Guomindang-affiliated northern warlords. Yue Weijun was granted 4500 rifles, 10 machine guns, 5,000,000 rounds of ammunition and 10 aircraft. This was not primarily to increase his military capacity. As one Soviet observer put it, the aid ‘had a more political character’ and was intended to ease the work of Soviet advisors. Zhang Zhijiang (Chang Chih-chiang),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0022009412461820">65</xref></sup> a subordinate of Feng’s with jurisdiction over Zhangjiakou and Chahar province (inner Mongolia), was allocated either 3000 or 8000 rifles (sources differ), 50 machine guns, 12 artillery pieces and 18 mortars. Finally, the Soviets planned a reserve cache of weapons and ammunition (possibly in Ulan Bator) intended for the northern Chinese warlords and amounting to 15,000 rifles, 100 machine guns, 20 million cartridges, 24 artillery pieces, 50 mortars and 15 aircraft. Total value of that weaponry was calculated to be 18,834,147 rubles, with an allowance of an additional 10 per cent of the weapons’ value allowed for transport expenses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0022009412461820">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>This sum was quite large, totaling roughly a tenth of the Red Army’s own yearly procurement and the Politburo’s China Commission decided in October 1925 to reduce those figures. Feng’s rifles were cut to 25,000, machine guns to 140, artillery pieces to 42 and aircraft to 6. Yue’s rifles were reduced to 3500 and his machine guns to 10. The total reduction in arms to China was approximately one-fourth of the initial allocation, from an expenditure of approximately 20 m rubles to 15 m. This was not as a result of the reduced need; the same decision to cut supplies noted that the ‘developing events in China demand rapid dispatch of the indicated arms.’ The likely inference is that actual material shortage of weapons in Soviet hands required the cutbacks. The Politburo, in confirming the reduction, specifically ordered that weapons confiscated from the population of the Soviet North Caucasus go towards meeting Chinese demand.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0022009412461820">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>All those Soviet weapons did Feng no good in his struggle against Zhang Zuolin. Despairing of victory, he resigned his positions in 1926, handing authority to Zhang Zhijiang, and fled to exile in the Soviet Union.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0022009412461820">68</xref></sup> This solidified Zhang Zuolin’s position as the dominant player in northern China and forced the Soviets to provide additional weaponry to their puppet state in outer Mongolia in the event Zhang decided to attack.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0022009412461820">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>The total amount of weapons going to China over the period 1924–6 was quite substantial, though figures are contradictory and cannot be fully rectified given currently available documentation. A pair of documents, one a report from I.S. Unshlikht and B.B. Bortnovskii to Joseph Stalin dated 30 September 1925 and the second a report by P.I. Smolentsev, give a sense of the total volume of Soviet weaponry headed to China, and the distribution among Moscow’s allies there. Guomindang forces in the south, geographically separated from their allies in the north, were treated separately. As of autumn 1925, troops associated with the Soviet-sponsored Whampoa Military Academy totaled 6000 and Red Army assistance was intended to raise that total to 25,000 in order to consolidate control over Guangzhou and extend that control to neighboring provinces. Doing so required 15,000 rifles, 100 machine guns, 20 million rifle cartridges, 24 artillery pieces with ammunition, 50 mortars and 15 aircraft. One Soviet count gives higher figures for southern China alone, counting from October 1924 through October 1926, 24 aircraft, 157 field guns, 48 mountain artillery pieces, 128 mortars, 295 medium machine guns and nearly 74,000 rifles went from the Soviet Union to Guangzhou for the GMD.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0022009412461820">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Soviets found to their chagrin that weapons did not bring influence. Zhang Zuolin had easily defeated Feng Yuxiang, but worse was yet to come. Chiang Kai-shek had consolidated his authority within the Guomindang by a March 1926 coup and felt ready to expand his control from limited territory in southern China to central and northern China as well. In July 1926, Chiang launched his ‘Northern Expedition’ in an effort to reunify China under his authority. This proved remarkably successful, in part due to the Soviet advisor Vasilii Bliukher’s providing technical advice to Chiang and his forces. Despite increasing disquiet over Chiang’s hostility to left-wing elements in the GMD, the Soviets continued to back his efforts, approving an order in October 1926 for nearly 3 m rubles of artillery and aircraft to Guangzhou.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0022009412461820">71</xref></sup> In March 1927, the Politburo approved an additional 100,000 rubles to cover arms and ammunition already relayed to the GMD’s National-Revolutionary Army.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0022009412461820">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>At this point, the Soviet Union’s China policy crumbled into ruin. In April 1927 Chiang Kai-shek, having achieved his goals, turned against his communist allies by massacring thousands of communists and their sympathizers, first in Shanghai and then throughout areas under GMD control. Zhang Zuolin raided the Soviet embassy in Beijing, killing a number of Chinese Communists while seizing embarrassing Soviet documents. Faced with this twin betrayal, Soviet advisors, surviving Chinese Communists and leftist members of the GMD based in the industrial city of Wuhan broke with Chiang. This newly-created ‘Left GMD’ quickly collapsed, as warlords and troops loyal to Chiang crushed the movement in its cradle. Futile attempts at communist-led peasant uprisings were mercilessly repressed by 1928.</p>
<p>The Soviet policy of supporting the GMD as a national-revolutionary force while directing the CCP to ally with and infiltrate the GMD was a manifest disaster. With Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Zuolin now revealed as openly hostile, the Soviets in desperation turned back to Feng Yuxiang, who had spent much of 1926 in Soviet-dominated Mongolia or in the Soviet Union itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0022009412461820">73</xref></sup> At the beginning of June 1927, the Politburo approved a request from the Central Committee of the Mongolian Revolutionary Party for 1000 rifles, five heavy machine guns, 500 hand grenades, 1,000,000 rifle cartridges and 50,000 machine gun bullets, stressing the importance of absolute secrecy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0022009412461820">74</xref></sup> Later in the month, the Soviets transferred 3000 rifles, 5,000,000 bullets, 5000 76 mm artillery rounds and four artillery pieces from stocks in Ulan-Bator to Feng.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0022009412461820">75</xref></sup> Feng repaid the Soviets by immediately breaking with the Chinese Communists, throwing his support towards Chiang Kai-shek, and purging Soviet advisors and Chinese communists from his army and government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0022009412461820">76</xref></sup></p>
<p>Total collapse of Soviet China policy provided further impetus for an overhaul of Soviet arms exports, since Soviet rifles had been used most effectively against Chinese communists. Until 1927, arms traffic had been conducted on an ad hoc basis, with deals looked at individually, devoid of any coordination or systematic policy. Even in China, arms exports responded to the press of events rather than coherent policy. In February, well before the April 1927 crisis, the Politburo had begun to rethink this, ‘considering it expedient and timely to convert from the chaotic distribution of arms to Eastern states to the planned and systematic introduction of Soviet arms to Eastern armies.’ Aleksandr Egorov, a high-ranking Red Army officer temporarily seconded to military industry, Pavel Dybenko, the Red Army’s Director of Supply and Anastas Mikoian, People’s Commissar of Trade, were detailed to produce a concrete proposal within two weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0022009412461820">77</xref></sup> Given that the goal was maximizing consumption of arms abroad, the Politburo decided prices could be set no higher than world market levels, which in fact only confirmed typical Soviet practice. Subsequent discussions in the Politburo made the bigger problem deciding on responsibility for the losses that came from selling arms below cost.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0022009412461820">78</xref></sup></p>
<p>As things went from bad to abysmal in China, the Soviet leadership resolved on a new approach to arms exports. As early as April 1927, the Politburo had decided on the rough outlines of a new approach. No arms were to go to China under any circumstances without the express consent of the Politburo. Arms exports more generally would be carried out through a private company: Wostwag (in Russian, <italic>Vostvag</italic>):<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0022009412461820">79</xref></sup> the West-Osteuropäische Warenaustausch A.G., a German–Soviet trading company with its headquarters on Friedrichstrasse in Berlin.</p>
<p>The choice of Wostwag seems at first glance a strange one. The Soviets routinely used commercial firms for diplomatic purposes, such as Arcos in the United Kingdom or Amtorg in the United States, but the difference between Wostwag and those companies was profound. Arcos and Amtorg served as official representatives of the Soviet state and in the case of Amtorg carried out pseudo-diplomatic tasks in the absence of formal relations between the US and the USSR. Wostwag, by contrast, was in legal terms a concession; that is, a foreign firm working by permission in the Soviet Union. With representatives scattered throughout the Soviet Union, Wostwag did not produce anything on its own, but instead served as a clearing house for exports and imports. Wostwag’s profile matched in microcosm all Soviet foreign trade, exchanging Soviet agricultural products for Western manufactures.</p>
<p>Wostwag had begun its operations in 1923. A representative of the People’s Commissariat of Foreign Trade served in Wostwag to defend Soviet interests and to ensure that the Soviet share of the take – 50 per cent of profits – was properly accounted for. At least until 1927, Wostwag’s catalog was mundane. Its specialty was poultry products: eggs, meat, feathers and down. It also exported oil cake, gut, horse hair, furs and pelts, metals and ores, even mushrooms. The one category of goods conspicuously absent was manufactured articles. In return, Wostwag imported manufactured products for resale on the Soviet internal market. These were primarily chemicals and metal powders, particularly medications. As long as the Soviet economy persisted in the half-market, half-socialist system established by the 1921 New Economic Policy, Wostwag found a large portion of its customers among private individuals and firms, but with a growing share of its trade taken up by state medical supply distributors. Wostwag was not particularly exclusive – it shipped bicycles to the Soviet Union as well: anything that could turn a profit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0022009412461820">80</xref></sup></p>
<p>Wostwag’s real nature was quite distinct from its appearance and makes clear the reasons for choosing it to manage arms exports. Wostwag had been founded by two brothers who worked for the Red Army Main Intelligence Directorate: the Glavnoe razvedyvatel'noye upravlenie or GRU. Intelligence veterans Bronislav Boleslavovich Ianovskii (born Abram Lazarevich Erenlub) and Sigismund Boleslavovich Ianovskii (born Aaron Lazarevich Erenlub) created Wostwag to serve as a front company for operations abroad.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0022009412461820">81</xref></sup> Trading chickens and bicycles was designed to conceal intelligence work and, ideally, generate profits to subsidize less lucrative but more sensitive activities.</p>
<p>In giving Wostwag control over arms exports, the Politburo left the precise relationship between Wostwag and the Soviet military to be worked out between Trade Commissar Anastas Mikoian and Deputy People’s Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs Iosif Unshlikht. The final recommendations approved by the Politburo stipulated that selling below cost was acceptable for political purposes, but for a loss no greater than 50 per cent of the weapons' value. Purchasers had to make a down payment of at least 25 per cent, with balances to be paid within two to three years. Wostwag, in keeping with the pattern of Soviet intelligence, was intended to be commercially viable, so 75 per cent of losses on arms exports were to be made up by the firm’s own operations and only 25 per cent from a special export bonus fund.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0022009412461820">82</xref></sup></p>
<p>Handing the management of arms exports to Wostwag did not resolve all questions; the Politburo exempted an already-established deal with Turkey from its jurisdiction.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0022009412461820">83</xref></sup> By June 1927, the Politburo approved procedures to regulate Wostwag. While it had previously focused on European trade, as its name suggested, it gained the right to trade with Asia as well – the chief market for Soviet arms – as well as access to trade credits from the People’s Commissariat of Finance. All trading was to take place solely in the name of Wostwag, not the Soviet government’s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0022009412461820">84</xref></sup></p>
<p>This shift in responsibility towards commercial and economic channels and away from military authority was confirmed in 1928. In February, the Soviet Council of People’s Commissars approved a general transfer of arms sales with eastern states away from the Red Army to Vesenkha, the Supreme Council of the National Economy – the de facto Soviet Ministry of Industry. By April 1928, further regulations required that talks over arms sales abroad were to be conducted by Soviet trade representatives, assisted by military attaches.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0022009412461820">85</xref></sup></p>
<p>Limitations on available sources mean this article can say little about Soviet arms exports in the 1930s. It seems likely, however, that their role changed. The Soviets placed less emphasis on them as a lever of foreign policy in their less-developed neighbors, in part because of their limited success. <italic>Wostwag</italic>’s takeover of arms exports was likely a response to the collapse of Soviet efforts in China; Afghanistan had proved little more successful. Arms exports thus achieved few of the goals the Soviets intended for them. In addition, Soviet efforts around its semi-colonial periphery had been driven by anxiety about their vulnerability to capitalist intervention. While that fear might have been realistic in the 1920s, the successes of Soviet industrialization created a different atmosphere by the 1930s. The Soviets were no longer a backward military power; by the early 1930s, they possessed the largest tank force in the world. The world remained for the Soviet leadership a dangerous place, but one presenting as much opportunity as peril. Arms exports to stave off intervention were no longer necessary.</p>
