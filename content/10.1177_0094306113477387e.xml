<p>In <italic>Rape in Chicago: Race, Myth, and the Courts</italic>, Dawn Rae Flood analyzes the intersection of two highly controversial and extremely sensitive topics that often, unfortunately and uncomfortably, overlap—rape and racism. In reviewing over ninety rape trials in Chicago from the period of 1936 to 1976, Flood reconstructs individual narratives from trial proceedings, medical history, and news coverage in order to examine how both plaintiffs and defendants dually challenged, and were challenged by, a judicial system historically prejudiced against women and blacks. Notably, in this analysis she seeks to explore the “how” and “why” of individual behaviors, rather than evaluate the truthfulness of claims. In doing so, she highlights the struggles of three less privileged groups—women, African American men, and African American women—whose desire for justice and rights were often in competition.</p>
<p>Beginning with the narrative of Anna Brasy, the victim of a violent and highly publicized rape, Chapter One covers the years leading up to the 1960s with a focus on the experiences of women. This important re-analysis finds that prosecutors were more responsive and protective of victims’ personal histories and circumstances than previous literature has asserted. Chapters Two and Three both examine the racial myths that African American men and women respectively struggled against in modern Chicago; Chapter Two focuses on defense efforts to combat perceptions of black men as sexually dangerous; and Chapter Three illuminates the hardship of black women and the dependence of defense attorneys on sexist, racist, and classist attitudes in order to defend clients.</p>
<p>Transitioning to the post-1960s, Chapter Four weaves the influence of federal decisions into the local narratives of rape and shows how improvements in defendants’ rights made courtrooms more hostile for women, with their actions and sexual reputations suddenly under more significant scrutiny. Finally, Chapter Five evaluates the activism of second wave feminists on external support structures and reforms within the court. This last chapter notes the importance of such changes, but also presents the racial limitations of such gendered activism. Although Flood concludes with modern anecdotes of rape that show the persistence of rape myths, these examples also demonstrate positive change—a product of the past bravery of ordinary victims and defendants. With its holistic focus, and thorough analysis, this book has an insightful and novel historic perspective, and is a beneficial read for anyone attempting to understand the modern underpinnings of rape myths and the potential for the power of individual agency to create change.</p>
