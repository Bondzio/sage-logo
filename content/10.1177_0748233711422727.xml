<abstract>
<p>Indoor volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have posed significant risks to human health since people have both shifted to a life spent, for the most part, indoors. Further, changes in materials used in the construction of buildings, furnishings, and tools either leak or encourage the production of VOCs. Whether these enclosed areas are residences, hospitals or workplaces (specifically composting facilities or closed farm buildings for raising livestock), VOCs can rise to levels that threaten people’s health. VOCs can either originate from phenolic and benzene-like compounds in building materials and office furniture or from molds (fungi) growing inside improperly ventilated or sealed buildings. Regardless of the source, exposure to VOCs could lead to significant health concerns from sick-building syndrome, ‘leukemia houses,’ in-hospital fungemia cases or occupation-associated cancer epidemics due to aflatoxicosis. Innovative 21st-century building materials could offer solutions to these challenges. We propose that volcanic materials, clays and minerals (volcanic tuff, modified clay montmorillonite and mineral clinoptilolite), in their original or chemically modified form, could act like synthetic lungs in building walls, breathing and filtering VOCs, and thus limiting human exposure to disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Humans spend much of their time indoors in buildings that contain and process the air they breathe. For example, Americans spend about 90% of their time indoors, with 65% of that time spent in their homes. Whether a building is a residence or a workplace, proper design is crucial for the health of its occupants. As we discuss in detail below, fungi constitutes a considerable health hazard in all structures. Therefore, walls of the home, workplace and hospitals of the 21st century should contain specific building materials that hinder the growth and/or absorb toxins produced by fungi. The walls of the 21st century hospital should also be bacteria blocking. We propose that volcanic clays and minerals (volcanic tuff, modified clay montmorillonite and mineral clinoptilolite) constitute a proper choice in covering wall surfaces that would provide both antibacterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748233711422727">Brunet de Courrsou, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748233711422727">Haydel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0748233711422727">Nováková, 1977</xref>) and antifungal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748233711422727">Lavie and Stotzky, 1986a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0748233711422727">b</xref>) protection to the building’s occupants.</p>

<title>Occurrence and activity of mycotoxins in bioaerosols</title>
<p>There are two routes for mycotoxins to become airborne. First, that dust may be contaminated by mycotoxins excreted by the fungi. Second, the conidia (and spores fragments) contain toxic metabolites which become airborne by propagation (Fischer and Dott,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233711422727"> 2003</xref>). Major toxins detected in airborne dusts and bioaerosols have for the most part been trichothecenes of <italic>Stachybotrys chartarum</italic>, aflatoxins of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> <italic>flavus</italic> and metabolites of <italic>A. Fumigatus</italic> (Fischer and Dott,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748233711422727"> 2003</xref>). However, recent investigations in the potential of distinct species producing mycotoxins on seminatural substrates indicates that compounds in addition to those already found in native bioaerosols may occur.</p>
<p>Farm work has been especially hazardous. During the harvesting and handling of maize, dust concentrations of up to 107 ng of aflatoxin per m<sup>3</sup> of air were reached, whereas granulated shells from peanuts contained 250–400 ng of aflatoxin per gram of shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0748233711422727">Sorenson et al., 1984</xref>). Grain handling was even more toxic, with aflatoxin B1 found in concentrations of up to 4849 ng/m<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0748233711422727">Sorenson et al., 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar or even higher levels of exposure to microfungi compounds can be found in waste-handling facilities; and strains of <italic>A. flavus</italic>isolated in situ proved to be at least partly toxigenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748233711422727">Déportes et al., 1997</xref>). However, there have been clinical reports on human cases of toxicosis due to <italic>Stachybotrys</italic> <italic>chartarum</italic>. Symptoms observed in patients stricken by <italic>Stachybotrys</italic> spp. include coughing, rhinitis, sore throat, nose bleeds, moderate fever, diarrhea, headaches, dermatitis, fatigue and general malaise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0748233711422727">Schiefer, 1994</xref>). Inhalation exposure to mycotoxins has been suggested to cause acute kidney failure (ochratoxin), damage to both the central nervous system (tremorgenic mycotoxins), and the upper respiratory tract (<italic>Stachybotrys chartarum</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0748233711422727">Miller, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Aerosolized fungal spores and volatile mycotoxins as potential health hazards: (a) residential indoor environments, (b) hospitals and (c) waste-handling industry and closed agricultural workplaces (e.g. composting facilities of farms) residential indoor environments—i: the concept of sick-building syndrome (SBS).</p>
<p>There is general agreement among scientists that both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs) are contaminants that lead to SBS. In experiments with humans exposed to VOC mixtures, exposure caused irritation of the eyes and upper respiratory tract, and inflammatory reactions, among other symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0748233711422727">Wiesmüller, 1998</xref>). In buildings with visible fungal growth, compounds such as dimethyldisulfide, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 1-octen-3-ol, and isobutyl ether have been found in concentrations of 10–100 ng/m<sup>3</sup> of air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0748233711422727">Sorenson et al., 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>There is general consensus that concentrations of ≥50 ng/m<sup>3</sup> of air indicate indoor mould contamination, with outdoor concentrations being normally ≤10 ng/m<sup>3</sup> of air (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748233711422727">Keller et al., 1998</xref>). In Germany, 0.3 ng/m<sup>3</sup> of air has been set as the maximum tolerable level for indoor air. In the last few years, a general trend has been observed concerning different types of VOC and the levels of tolerance to VOCs in humans. A report of ochratoxin in house dust was published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0748233711422727">Richard et al. (1999</xref>) where samples of dust collected from heating ducts yielded up to 1500 ppb of ochratoxin A.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0748233711422727">Shoemaker and House (2006</xref>) analyzed patients complaining of indoor VOC exposure symptoms, who also reported water intrusion in the home or workplace and where there was visual identification of microbial amplification in the areas of intrusion. Acremonium, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Chaetomium, Monodictys, Penicillium, Stachybotrys, Taeniolella and Trichoderma species were isolated from samples taken at visual microbial amplification sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0748233711422727">Shoemaker and House, 2006</xref>). They analyzed the biochemical parameters in these patients during both ‘suspected’ indoor excerbation of their symptoms and treatment with the toxin-removing compound cholestyramine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0748233711422727">Shoemaker and House, 2006</xref>). They found that levels of leptin and melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) increased during sick-building exposure, indicating contribution of inflammatory pathways and hypothalamic circuits. Treatment with cholestyramine reduced the levels of leptin, MSH and matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9) in those infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0748233711422727">Shoemaker and House, 2006</xref>). It was observed that airborne fungal spores carried only a fraction of the mycotoxins and other biologically active components that people occupying water-damaged buildings were exposed to. Concentrations of small fungal fragments carrying mycotoxins, antigens and other biologically active components exceeded spore concentrations by up to 320-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748233711422727">Górny et al., 2002</xref>). For example, concentrations of airborne trichothecenes carried on fungal fragments (smaller than intact conidia) were reported to exceed 1300 pg/m<sup>3</sup> in water-damaged buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748233711422727">Brasel et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0748233711422727">Van Lancker et al. (2008</xref>) evaluated and compared the <italic>in vitro</italic> production of MVOCs on malt extract agar, plasterboard and wallpaper. They isolated and identified five fungal strains from the walls of water-damaged houses. Some molds produced specific compounds independently of substrate, such as trichodiene from <italic>Fusarium sporotrichioides</italic> and aristolochene from <italic>Penicillium roqueforti</italic> (Van Lancker et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0748233711422727">2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748233711422727">Polizzi et al. (2009</xref>) investigated the presence of fungi and mycotoxins in 99 samples (air, dust, wallpaper, mycelium or silicone) collected in the mouldy interiors of seven water-damaged buildings, while sampling for VOCs at the same time. They found the mycotoxins were mainly roquefortine C, chaetoglobosin A and sterigmatocystin but roridin E, ochratoxin A, aflatoxin B1 and aflatoxin B2 were also detected (Polizzi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0748233711422727"> et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Residential indoor environments-II: fungi, mycotoxins, and ‘leukemia houses’</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233711422727">Blank et al. (1968</xref>) prepared sequential extracts of <italic>Candida parapsilosis</italic> with different organic solvents. A sodium carbonate wash of the methanol extract showed carcinogenic activity in mice demonstrated by the appearance of six sarcomas at the injection sites of six animals. Carcinogenic activities in the lipid extracts of species of the genera <italic>Microsporum</italic>, <italic>Tricophyton</italic>, <italic>Epidermophyton</italic> and <italic>Scopulariopsis</italic> were observed to increase the appearance of sarcomas, and frequency of leukemias and lung tumors (Blank<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748233711422727"> et al., 1968</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1970 and 1971, the pioneering studies of Aleksandrowicz and Smyk involved identifying abundance of indoor fungi, particularly <italic>A. flavus</italic>, in the so-called ‘leukaemia houses’ (Aleksandrowicz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748233711422727">1970a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748233711422727">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748233711422727">Aleksandrowicz and Smyk, 1971</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748233711422727">1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0748233711422727">Ochmański and Barabasz, 2000</xref>). Wray et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0748233711422727">1975</xref>) published a series of studies documenting the importance of the relation between indoor fungal growth and residential clusters of leukemia. At the time, multiple cases of leukemia in unrelated individuals in the same house was an extremely rare phenomenon, which demanded further investigation. Such an event occurred in Southern Georgia, where 4 victims, 3 occupants and a daily visitor over a 2-year period were diagnosed with the disease (Wray et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0748233711422727">1975</xref>). A 36-year-old woman with the disease was the aunt of the 5-year-old boy, who was also effected, but none of the known genetic diseases predisposing them to leukemia were present, and there were no other kinship ties between the 2 other patients. Measurement of radiation levels in the home were deemed normal. Wray et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0748233711422727">1975</xref>) isolated fungi from this ‘leukemia house’ believing that mycotoxin-producing strains might be present. They identified 110 strains of 21 common genera in samples taken from the house and its surroundings (Wray et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0748233711422727">1975</xref>). Aflatoxin-producing <italic>Aspergillus parasiticus</italic> was also isolated from the samples. Similar genera were isolated from houses not associated with leukemia clusters at the similar rates as infected homes with the exception of Trichoderma, Verticillium and Monotospora, which were found in fewer of the control houses (less than 4 found in an indoor survey of 157 homes) (Wray et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0748233711422727">1975</xref>). From these only Trichoderma was isolated in several sites in and around the ‘leukemia’ house but was not found in any of the control houses. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0748233711422727">Wray et al. (1979)</xref> then returned focus on the home of a husband and wife who had both developed acute myelomonocytic leukemia. The husband a 69-year-old white, retired textile worker developed acute myelomonocytic leukemia first, while his wife received medical attention 5 months after his diagnosis, receiving a diagnosis of acute undifferentiated leukemia. During her final relapse, it was discovered that her peripheral and bone marrow blasts had developed myelomonocytic morphology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0748233711422727">Wray et al. (1979</xref>) collected fungus from the couple’s house and assayed for the isolated fungi effects on the <italic>in vivo</italic> response to phytohemagglutinin in guinea pigs. Skin responses to intradermal phytohemagglutinin were measured following injections of sterile fungal extracts. <italic>Penicillium canescens</italic>, Curvularia, <italic>Fusarium sambucinum</italic>, <italic>Fusarium equiseti</italic> and <italic>Trichoderma koningii</italic> were isolated and their isolates depressed the response to phytohemagglutinin, but the fungal isolates obtained from a nearby control house had failed to do so (Wray et al., 1975).</p>
<p>In 1976, a 42-year-old biochemist and his 28-year-old graduate student who had been working with purified aflatoxins for over a year, both developed adenocarcinoma of the colon within 3 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748233711422727">Deger, 1976</xref>). Van Nieuwenhuize, et al. analyzed the frequency of neoplasia over 11 years in factory workers exposed to chronic low levels of aflatoxin during production of peanut and flaxseed oils (Wray et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0748233711422727">1979</xref>). The exposed group, receiving an estimated dose of 165–195 μg of aflatoxins, showed a significant increase in several types of cancer when compared to a control group of the same age. Workers exposed to aerosols from Stachybotrys-infected substrate absorbed enough toxin via the respiratory route to develop blood dyscrasias (Wray et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0748233711422727">1979</xref>).</p>

<title>Fungal spores in hospital buildings and in hospital outbreaks’ of fungal infection</title>
<p>In hospital operating theaters, patient rooms, and the corridors of wards, intensive measures are undertaken to maintain air hygiene, attempting to reduce airborne fungal spores to almost zero. Outbreaks of nosocomial aspergillosis in hospitals are often associated with activities such as, new construction, renovation and site excavation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748233711422727">Aisner et al. (1976</xref>) described aspergillus infections in cancer patients associated with the installation of new fireproofing materials in the hospital. An association between concentrations of <italic>A. Fumigatus</italic>and <italic>A. flavus</italic>exceeding 1 colony-forming unit (CFU) per m<sup>3</sup> in oncology wards and an increased incidence of aspergillosis has also been discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711422727">Arnow et al., 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1983, when a new hospital opened in Chicago, Illinois, environmental culturing of Aspergillus and surveillance for nosocomial aspergillosis cases illustrated the relationship between environmental contamination and infection. Monthly air sampling demonstrated increasing concentrations of <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> to mean levels greater than 1 CFU/m<sup>3</sup> during 1986–1987. This was accompanied by a progressive increase in the incidence of aspergillosis in 1.2% of immunocompromised patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711422727">Arnow et al., 1991</xref>). This prompted an inspection revealing heavy growth of Aspergillus organisms on air filters in the hospital. Removal of the contaminated filters and improved environmental maintenance resulted in a reduction in <italic>A. flavus</italic> and <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> to 0.01 CFU/m<sup>3</sup> and a fourfold decline in aspergillosis incidence over the next 2 years. In immunocompromised patients, even numbers below 10 CFU/m<sup>3</sup> thermotolerant aspergilli have been discussed as health hazards, since aspergillosis is fatal in more than 50% of cases despite appropriate treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748233711422727">Arnow et al., 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233711422727">Brincker et al. (1991</xref>) reported a nosocomial epidemic of pulmonary aspergillosis occurred in a hematological ward during renovations to the interior of the building (Brincker<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748233711422727"> et al., 1991</xref>). In an investigation carried out in the wards of a hospital in the United Arab Emirates, spore numbers of up to 25 CFU/m<sup>3</sup> of air for <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>were classified as low. Such high levels are questionable, even if thermotolerant species are more likely to be present in desert countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748233711422727">Jaffal et al., 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0748233711422727">Thuler et al.

<title>Workplace associated risk of fungal volatile toxins: waste-handling industrial places and composting facilities of farms</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233711422727">Fischer et al. (2000</xref>) conducted a study to assess differentiated exposure of both airborne fungi and fungal secondary metabolites on different work areas in a compost facility. They investigated the potential for production of mycotoxins and nonvolatile secondary metabolites in approximately 250 freshly isolated strains. Among the 11 most relevant species, viz. <italic>A. flavus</italic>, <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, <italic>A. niger</italic>, <italic>A. parasiticus</italic>, <italic>A. versicolor</italic>, <italic>Emericella</italic> <italic>nidulans</italic>, <italic>Paecilomyces variotii</italic>, <italic>Penicillium brevicompactum</italic>, <italic>P. clavigerum</italic>, <italic>P. crustosum</italic> and <italic>P. cyclopium</italic> as well, 37 other metabolites of partially toxicological relevance were identified (Fischer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233711422727"> et al., 2000</xref>). In an extract of dust and bioaerosols from the compost pile hall, they encountered tryptoquivaline and trypacidin, which were produced by all strains of <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>when investigated in pure cultures. 2-Methylfurane, α-pinene, camphene and limonene were also among the volatiles that occurred during each season and at every sampling site (Fischer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748233711422727"> et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The level of opportunistic thermotolerant fungi in the breathe of air workers has become a matter of discussion, as the number of workplaces in the waste-handling industry increases and emissions of microorganisms from these facilities are being critically evaluated.

<title>General descriptions of volcanic tuff and tuff minerals, zeolite clinoptilolite and clay montmorillonite</title>
<p>Volcanic tuff, from the Italian <italic>tufo</italic>, is a type of rock consisting of consolidated volcanic ash ejected from vents during eruption. The crystal structure and characteristics of clays and zeolites are well established. As a general comment, both mineral groups are crystalline aluminosilicates formed by SiO<sub>4</sub> and AlO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra- and octahedra-sharing oxygen atoms to form three-dimensional structural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233711422727">Chávez et al., 2010</xref>). In zeolite minerals, the structural arrangements develop channels through which ions pass, are adsorbed, retained, or exchanged, according to the characteristics and dimensions of channels and ions. This process defines the suitability of zeolite for specific adsorptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233711422727">Chávez et al., 2010</xref>). In the clay minerals, rings of SiO<sub>4</sub> and AlO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra share oxygen atoms with Al(OH)O<sub>4</sub> octahedra, developing layered structures with internal active surfaces and edges on which the ions are adsorbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748233711422727">Chávez et al., 2010</xref>). The interlayer spaces in clays could be more suitable to separate larger and more complex ones than the internal channels of the zeolites.</p>
<p>Clinoptilolite is a natural zeolite/volcanic tuff mineral comprising a microporous arrangement of silica and alumina tetrahedral. It consists of a complex formula: (Na, K, Ca)<sub>2-3</sub>Al<sub>3</sub>(Al,Si)<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>13</sub>O<sub>36</sub>·12(H<sub>2</sub>O) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748233711422727">Oguz et al., 2000</xref>). Natural zeolites are microporous, aluminosilicate minerals, which form via the reaction of volcanic rocks, ash layers and alkaline groundwater. They are in the family of tektoalumosilicates since they possess an infinite three-dimensional cage-like structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0748233711422727">Oguz et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Montmorillonite is a very soft phyllosilicate group of minerals that typically form in microscopic crystals, forming a clay. It is named after Montmorillon in France. Montmorillonite is the main constituent of the volcanic ash weathering product, bentonite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748233711422727">Senturk et al., 2009</xref>). Montmorillonite is also a member of the smectite family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748233711422727">Senturk et al., 2009</xref>). The main product’s bentonite surface is hydrophilic in nature because inorganic cations, such as Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, are strongly hydrated in the presence of water. As a result, the adsorption efficiency of natural bentonite for organic molecules is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748233711422727">Senturk et al., 2009</xref>). The adsorption properties of bentonite can be improved by the modification of the clay mineral surface with a cationic surfactant.</p>
<p>The cationic surfactants, also known as quaternary amine salts, take the form of (CH3)3NR+, where R is an alkyl hydrocarbon chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748233711422727">Senturk et al., 2009</xref>). Replacement of inorganic exchangeable cations with cationic surfactants, converts the hydrophilic silicate surface of clay minerals to a hydrophobic surface and the complex obtained from this process is given the name organoclay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748233711422727">Senturk et al., 2009</xref>). As a result, an organoclay complex is an excellent adsorbent material for the removal of phenolic compounds, other organic contaminants and heavy metals from aqueous solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0748233711422727">Senturk et al., 2009</xref>). Due to the small particle size (&lt;2.0 μm), these natural geological products have a vast surface area (hundreds of square meters per gram of clay) with high concentrations of ions and compounds located on the surfaces to aid in the absorption process.</p>

On attempting to desorb cetylpyridinium from the modified clays by washing in sterile physiological saline for 24 h, the resulting wash solutions failed to produce any significant reduction in bacterial colony counts, while the washed clays retained their full antimicrobial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233711422727">Herrera et al., 2000</xref>). Their findings suggest that the antibacterial effect of modified montmorillonite clays is localized on the clay’s surface and is not due to cetylpyridinium dissociating from the clay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233711422727">Herrera et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, their electron microscopical analysis revealed that the bacteria adhered to the surface of the cetylpyridinium-exchanged montmorillonites but not the parent clays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233711422727">Herrera et al., 2000</xref>). The investigators concluded that the mechanism by which the bacterial counts were reduced involved the enhanced hydrophobicity and affinity of the cetylpyridinium-exchanged montmorillonite for Salmonella, as well as the direct antibacterial activity of cetylpyridinium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748233711422727">Herrera et al., 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Suggestions about how and where to use the volcanic materials, tuff, clinoptilolite and montmorillonite in internal architecture</title>
<p>At this point, we would like to illustrate some examples of how and where volcanic minerals could be used in the construction of the interior spaces of buildings. One possibility is to use them in exterior cladding (as concrete panels), to maintain water impermeability, since volcanic minerals are rich in silicium and would increase water resistance in the concrete. However, it is important to remember the above mentioned physical properties of montmorillonite. Natural montmorillonite is rich in sodium and calcium, which strongly hydrates in the presence of water. This would require the removal of inorganic exchangable cations with cationic surfactants which would convert the hydrophilic surface of the clay to a hydrophobic surface. In order to use montmorillonite to effectively block water permeability, only cationic surfactant-modified montmorillonite could be used. By blocking water permeability, the risk of mold production at the interior sides of the walls is lowered.</p>
<p>A second possibility would employ these minerals in suture mortars between wall tiles. Since tile is often used in wet and humid environments (such as bathrooms), the mortar in the grout constitutes a suitable place for mold growth. By mixing volcanic minerals with this mortar, the mold growth may be blocked.</p>
<p>Volcanic minerals could also be mixed directly into the slab concrete between underfloor heating and parquet. With steam pressure coming from the ground, wetness and heat provide a proper environment for the mold growth on the slab concrete under the parquet. Such a mixture may make the slab an unsuitable surface for mold growth. This process already occurs to some extent with montmorillonite/bentonite being mixed with some concrete types at ratios between 3% and 5% to increase the processability but not for its antifungal properties.</p>
<p>The use of these minerals in ventilation ducts as filters is also possible. Since some of these volcanic minerals bear inherent antibacterial activity, and others could be easily chemically modified to bear strong antibacterial potentials, they may block bacterial growth in ventilation channels. It may be possible that volcanic minerals could block the growth of the deadly bacteria Legionella which lives in air conditioning and ventilation systems. However, an immediate use of volcanic minerals would be to limit the spread of infection through hospital ventilation systems. As outlined above, hospital ventilation systems are a significant source of hospital fungemias. For example, as explained above, Aspergillus infections in immunocompromised patients may stem from hospital ventilation systems. Volcanic tuff, montmorillonite and clinoptilolite all possess strong antifungal activity when modified; and with montmorillonite’s inherent antifungal potential, it could be considered a perfect substituent for us in hospital ventilation channels.</p>
<p>Beyond ventilation systems (the antibacterial activities of modified tuff and montmorillonite and direct antibacterial activity of some close-montmorillonite relative smectite clays), these materials could be directly mixed into the concrete used to build hospital walls, possibly aiding in the creation of inherently antibacterial hospital environments.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>VOCs, especially mycotoxins in bioaerosols constitute a significant health problem. They could pose health hazards in residential indoor environments (for instance, SBS and leukemia houses). The danger lies not only in their toxins, as whole fungi can also cause in-hospital fungemia. Fungi can also be the cause of occupation-associated cancer epidemics, especially in the waste handling industry and in closed agricultural workplaces. As explained above, workers involved in the production of peanut and flaxseed oils could be exposed to significant levels of aflatoxins.</p>
<p>It is possible to employ volcanic minerals and clays, volcanic tuff, clinoptilolite and montmorillonite as a protection against these hazards via mixing these materials with building concrete or mortar, while benefiting from their fungal toxin neutralizing efficacy, and in the case of montmorillonite from their direct antifungal action. Modified tuff and montmorillonite (as well as some smectites, montmorillonite’s close relative) also possesses strong antibacterial efficacy. Mixing these volcanic clays with hospital wall concrete may help to create an antibacterial environment in hospital buildings.</p>
