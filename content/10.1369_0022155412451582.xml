<abstract>
<p>Proper balance between self-renewal and differentiation of lung-specific progenitors is absolutely required for normal lung morphogenesis/regeneration. Therefore, understanding the behavior of lung epithelial stem/progenitor cells could identify innovative solutions for restoring normal lung morphogenesis and/or regeneration. The Notch inhibitor Numb is a key determinant of asymmetric or symmetric cell division and hence cell fate. Yet Numb proximal-distal expression pattern and symmetric versus asymmetric division are uncharacterized during lung epithelial development. Herein, the authors find that the cell fate determinant Numb is highly expressed and asymmetrically distributed at the apical side of distal epithelial progenitors and segregated to one daughter cell in most mitotic cells. Knocking down <italic>Numb</italic> in MLE15 epithelial cells significantly increased the number of cells expressing the progenitor cell markers Sox9/Id2. Furthermore, cadherin hole analysis revealed that most distal epithelial stem/progenitor cells in embryonic lungs divide asymmetrically; with their cleavage, planes are predicted to bypass the cadherin hole, resulting in asymmetric distribution of the cadherin hole to the daughter cells. These novel findings provide evidence for asymmetric cell division in distal epithelial stem/progenitor cells of embryonic lungs and a framework for future translationally oriented studies in this area.</p>

<p>Control of epithelial progenitor cells is critical for correct development of the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022155412451582">Warburton et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022155412451582">Warburton 2008</xref>). Lethal defects of gas diffusion capacity such as the common congenital forms of lung hypoplasia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia as well as the limited capacity of the lung to recover from them could be explained by a significant deficiency of stem/progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022155412451582">Warburton et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022155412451582">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022155412451582">Shi and Warburton 2009</xref>). Therefore, understanding how to achieve a proper balance between self-renewal and differentiation of lung-specific progenitors could provide innovative solutions to restoring normal lung morphogenesis and possibly regeneration of the gas diffusion surface. Asymmetric cell division (ACD) during development is indeed crucial for balancing self-renewal and differentiation as well as correct spatial and temporal specification of cell lineages in epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022155412451582">Knoblich 2001</xref>). Yet, ACD has not been analyzed before in embryonic lung epithelial progenitor cells.</p>
<p>The cell fate determinant Numb is a key determinant of asymmetric versus symmetric cell division (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022155412451582">Knoblich 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022155412451582">2010</xref>). Both ACD and Numb expression as well as function during development have been comparatively well studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and the mammalian nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155412451582">Betschinger and Knoblich 2004</xref>), but they are entirely uncharacterized in the lung.</p>
<p>Herein we report on the proximal-distal Numb expression pattern and ACD in stem/progenitor cells at the distal epithelial tips of murine lungs at E14.5, which was chosen as the most informative developmental stage to analyze ACD behavior of distal embryonic lung epithelium because of intense Numb expression and relatively high cell proliferation at that time in gestation.</p>

Antibody staining was performed in triplicate and analyzed using a Leica confocal or fluorescence microscope (Leica Mikrosysteme Vertrieb GmbH; Wetzlar, Germany). DAPI (4,′6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) was used for nuclear staining.

<title>Cell Culture and Transfection</title>
<p>Lung epithelial cells MLE15, a gift from Jeffrey Whitsett (Cincinnati University), were grown in culture and treated as well as processed for transfection as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155412451582">Tefft et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022155412451582">El-Hashash et al. 2011</xref>). Briefly for transfection, MLE15 cells were seeded in eight chamber slides (BD Biosciences; San Jose, CA) at 50% confluency. The next day, they were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences targeted to Numb or control siRNA (Operon Biotechnologies; Huntsville, AL) at a final concentration of 80 nM using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA). Fresh medium was added 6 hr later. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde 3 days after transfection. The knockdown efficiency was analyzed by immunostaining of targeted protein. Also, we used an expression vector encoding a VP16 fusion protein, and the transfection efficiency was further monitored by fluorescence staining using anti-VP16 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian epithelial cells, ACD is mediated by preferential segregation of intrinsic cell fate determinants (CFDs) (e.g., Numb) into one of two sibling daughter cells. CFDs are asymmetrically localized in dividing cells and define the axis of polarity that will determine the orientation of the apical-basal cell division plane. This allows a rapid switch from proliferation, wherein two similar daughter cells are born, to diversification, wherein different-shaped daughter cells are generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155412451582">Betschinger and Knoblich 2004</xref>). Numb protein, a Notch signaling inhibitor, is expressed uniformly in the cytoplasm in interphase but is localized asymmetrically in dividing cells. Hence, Numb is segregated to only one daughter cell, enabling this cell to adopt a different fate from that of its sibling. The cell receiving high levels of Numb suppresses extrinsic Notch signaling and differentiates, whereas the cell with low Numb levels maintains high Notch activity and thus has a stem cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155412451582">Frise et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022155412451582">Guo et al. 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Herein, we detected very weak, if any, Numb expression in the distal lung epithelial tips, which contain the epithelial progenitor pool that expresses Sox9, Id2, and N-myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022155412451582">Liu and Hogan 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155412451582">Okubo et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022155412451582">Rawlins 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022155412451582">Rawlins et al. 2009</xref>) at E11.5–12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412451582">Fig. 1A</xref>), whereas at E14.5, strong Numb signals were observed in the distal rather than proximal lung epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412451582">Fig. 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412451582">C</xref>). Closer inspection revealed that Numb was asymmetrically distributed and highly concentrated at the apical side of distal epithelial progenitor cells, which also expressed epithelial progenitor markers Id2/Sox9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412451582">Fig. 1E</xref>, and data not shown for Id2), with little or no staining at the basal pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412451582">Fig. 1D</xref>). A similar expression pattern was found at the apical cell side for the Numb-associated signal α-adaptin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412451582">Fig. 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412451582">G</xref>), which is an endocytic protein that is required for Numb-mediated ACD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022155412451582">Berdnik et al. 2002</xref>).

<p>Next, to test the function of Numb in lung epithelium, we performed siRNA-mediated <italic>Numb</italic> knockdown in MLE15 epithelial cells, which showed intense expression of asymmetrically localized Numb in addition to the expression of both epithelial progenitor cell markers Id2/Sox9 and differentiation marker SP-C similar to lung distal epithelium at E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155412451582">Figs. 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155412451582">2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022155412451582">El-Hashash el al. 2011</xref>).

<p>In many different organs, epithelial cells characteristically show apical-basal polarity. They also have a distinct shape, such that only a subtle deviation in cleavage plane from the normal orientation suffices to result in an asymmetric rather than a symmetric distribution of their apical plasma membrane and adjacent adherent junctions to the daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022155412451582">Nelson 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022155412451582">Kosodo et al. 2004</xref>).

<p>To determine the distribution of the cadherin hole upon division of progenitor cells of distal lung epithelial tips at E14.5, we deduced the orientation of the cleavage plane in mitotic cells in anaphase/telophase, at which time the final orientation of the mitotic spindle and the cleavage plane is set in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155412451582">Gonczy and Hyman 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412451582">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412451582">B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412451582">D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412451582">E</xref>). Cadherin hole analysis then revealed that the alteration in cleavage plane orientation in distal epithelium progenitors correlated well with the distribution of the cell membrane/cadherin hole during cell division. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412451582">Figure 3A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412451582">E</xref>, in distal epithelial progenitors, 94% of the cleavage planes were predicted to bypass the cadherin hole, resulting in asymmetric distribution of the cadherin hole to the daughter cells, whereas 6% of the cleavage plane orientations were predicted to bisect the cadherin hole, resulting in a symmetric distribution to both daughter cells (<italic>n</italic>=48 mitotic cells). These data suggest that most progenitors in distal embryonic lung epithelial tips divide asymmetrically.</p>
<p>We recently reported that most cell divisions occur perpendicular to the basement membrane in the distal lung epithelial progenitors at E14–14.5, as judged by pericentrin-stained centrosome orientation relative to the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022155412451582">El-Hashash and Warburton 2011</xref>). Perpen-dicular cell division is strictly correlated with ACD in different mammalian epithelial cells because they undergo asymmetric division by shifting the spindle orientation from parallel to perpendicular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022155412451582">Lechler and Fuchs 2005</xref>). To further confirm this in distal lung epithelial progenitors, we evaluated the orientation of the cleavage plane to better assess cell division in distal epithelial tips of the lung. To do this, we used LGN (kindly provided by J. Blumer, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC) and mouse Inscuteable (mInsc; kindly provided by J. Knoblich, Institute of Molecular Biotechnology, Vienna, Austria) proteins, which localize to the apical cell side only during apical-basal division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022155412451582">Lechler and Fuchs 2005</xref>), as markers of perpendicularly dividing cells. We found that most cleavage planes were horizontal or nearly horizontal (i.e., oblique) to the basement membrane in mitotic epithelial progenitors (91%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412451582">Fig. 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412451582">G</xref>; <italic>n</italic>=48, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022155412451582">El-Hashash and Warburton 2011</xref> for LGN/mInsc expression pattern). This further suggests that most progenitor cells at distal epithelial tips divide perpendicularly and asymmetrically. No staining was evident with the irrelevant primary antibody (data not shown).</p>
<p>During ACD, the Notch signaling inhibitor Numb is localized asymmetrically in the nucleus or cytoplasm (depending on the mitotic phase) in dividing cells. Hence, Numb is segregated to only one daughter cell, enabling this cell to adopt a different fate from that of its sibling. The cell receiving high Numb levels suppresses extrinsic Notch signaling and differentiates, whereas the cell with low Numb levels maintains high Notch1 activity and thus has a stem cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155412451582">Frise et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022155412451582">Guo et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022155412451582">Juven-Gershon et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022155412451582">Yan et al. 2008</xref>). Therefore, to further confirm that most cell divisions occur asymmetrically in the lung epithelium and that Numb is preferentially expressed by one daughter cell in mitotic lung epithelial progenitors, we tracked Numb versus Sox9 expression as markers of cells acquiring a differentiated cell fate versus stem/progenitor cell fate, respectively, in daughter cells of mitotic distal lung epithelial cells at the mitotic (M) phase of the cell cycle. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412451582">Figure 3K</xref>, Numb was asymmetrically expressed in the nucleus of one daughter of dividing cells at M phase of the cell cycle, in agreement with reports in other cell types that show nuclear Numb expression in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022155412451582">Juven-Gershon et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022155412451582">Yan et al. 2008</xref>). In some mitotic cells, Numb was not detected in the nuclei of both daughter cells, which showed intensive expression of the progenitor cell marker Sox9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412451582">Fig. 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412451582">L</xref>). Quantification of these data strongly suggest ACD occurs in the lung epithelium, as evident by asymmetric expression of Numb in one daughter of most dividing cells at M phase of the cell cycle (92%), whereas about 8% of mitotic cells (<italic>n</italic>=42) had no detectable expression of Numb in both daughter cells that will together acquire a progenitor cell fate, as indicated by Sox9 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412451582">Fig. 3J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412451582">L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412451582">M</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, we conclude that the more perpendicular/asymmetric cell division is, the more likely it is to segregate Numb preferentially to one daughter cell in mitotic lung epithelial progenitors. These results, to our knowledge, provide the first evidence for ACD in distal epithelial stem/progenitor cells of embryonic lungs.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Most recently, we have reported that distal lung epithelial progenitors are polarized, using Numb as a polarity marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022155412451582">El-Hashash and Warburton 2011</xref>). However, no specific or detailed report on the temporospatial and proximal-distal expression pattern of Numb during lung development has appeared yet to our knowledge. Identifying the temporospatial and proximal-distal expression pattern of Numb is significant for the understanding of asymmetric cell division in both proximal and distal lung epithelial progenitor cells. We have also reported that lung distal epithelial progenitors are polarized with perpendicular rather than parallel divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022155412451582">El-Hashash and Warburton 2011</xref>). However, perpendicular cell division is not a direct evidence for asymmetric division because some parallel-dividing cells also divide asymmetrically. Thus, without the cleavage plane and cadherin hole analyses described herein, one could not conclude that distal epithelial progenitors cells divide asymmetrically in the embryonic lung. In this work, we describe a proximal-distal expression pattern of Numb and analyze, for the first time, cleavage plan orientation and asymmetric cell division in embryonic lung distal epithelial progenitor cells.</p>
<p>Several recent reports suggest that undifferentiated epithelial progenitors undergo multiple division-linked cell fate decisions (symmetric and asymmetric) in the lung, which lead to an apparently homogeneous expansion of the progenitor cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022155412451582">Lu et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022155412451582">Rawlins 2008</xref>). No reports about ACD in the embryonic lung have appeared as yet to our knowledge. Our current and recently published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022155412451582">El-Hashash and Warburton 2011</xref>) studies provide several lines of evidence that suggest that asymmetric cell divisions are common in embryonic distal lung epithelial cell populations, which contain progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155412451582">Okubo et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022155412451582">Rawlins et al. 2009</xref>). For instance, the cleavage plane orientations are predicted to bypass the cadherin hole, resulting in asymmetric distribution of the cadherin hole to the daughter cells in most distal epithelial progenitor cells (this study; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155412451582">Fig. 3</xref>). Moreover, our report that most of the distal epithelial cells have apically localized Par, LGN, NuMA, and mInsc polarity proteins, with mitotic spindles aligned perpendicular to the basement membrane and a characteristic asymmetric segregation/inheritance of Numb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022155412451582">El-Hashash and Warburton 2011</xref>), provides further evidence that they are dividing asymmetrically. Indeed, a strict correlation exists between ACD and the apical localization of polarity proteins Par/LGN/NuMA/mInsc, which control spindle orientation in mammalian epithelial mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022155412451582">Lechler and Fuchs 2005</xref>), perpendicular alignment of mitotic spindles, and asymmetric Numb segregation in different <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian epithelial cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022155412451582">Cayouette and Raff 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022155412451582">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022155412451582">Haydar et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022155412451582">Noctor et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022155412451582">Lechler and Fuchs 2005</xref>). Further studies are needed to determine asymmetric versus symmetric division in embryonic lung distal epithelial progenitors.</p>
<p>During embryonic development, multipotent epithelial stem/progenitor cells localize within the distal lung epithelial buds/airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022155412451582">Rawlins and Hogan 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022155412451582">Rawlins 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022155412451582">Rawlins et al. 2009</xref>). ACD likely mediates the balance between lung epithelial stem/progenitor cell maintenance and differentiating cell populations at distal epithelial tips. This ACD-mediated balance is critical for the long-term maintenance of tissue self-renewal during development and in diseases. For instance, congenital lung hypoplasia and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, wherein a significant deficiency of stem/progenitor cells probably occurs, are common features of human prematurity and/or lung injury and are thus major public health problems in human infancy. Therefore, proper balance between self-renewal and differentiation of lung-specific progenitors, which is mediated by ACD, is absolutely required for normal lung morphogenesis and regeneration. Thus, controlled outgrowth and branching of the epithelial tubes generate a sufficiently large gas diffusion surface to sustain life. Developmental defects in this smooth progression lead to defective differentiation and postnatal respiratory distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022155412451582">Warburton et al. 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022155412451582">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, understanding the behavior of lung epithelial progenitors, as described herein, could identify innovative solutions to restoring normal lung morphogenesis. Moreover, characterizing ACD (as in this study) and identifying novel factors/mechanisms regulating ACD and behavior of lung epithelial progenitors, as key mechanisms that regulate the balance between lung progenitor cell self-renewal and differentiation, can help to identify novel targets for the prevention and rescue therapy of fatal lung disease in infancy and childhood and for lung regeneration after injury. In addition, identification of the molecular programs regulating the balance between the proliferation and differentiation of endogenous lung-specific progenitor cells is critical for developing techniques that harness the ability of these cells to regenerate diseased and damaged lungs. Our data provide a conceptual framework for future translationally orientated and mechanistic studies in this area.</p>
