<p>Lateral epicondylitis is a common condition, but relatively little is known about its aetiology and associated risk factors. We have undertaken a large case-control study using The Health Improvement Network database to assess and quantify the relative contributions of some constitutional and environmental risk factors for lateral epicondylitis in the community. Our dataset included 4998 patients with lateral epicondylitis who were individually matched with a single control by age, sex, and general practice. The median age at diagnosis was 49 (interquartile range 42–56) years . Multivariate analysis showed that the risk factors associated with lateral epicondylitis were rotator cuff pathology (OR 4.95), De Quervain’s disease (OR 2.48), carpal tunnel syndrome (OR 1.50), oral corticosteroid therapy (OR 1.68), and previous smoking history (OR 1.20). Diabetes mellitus, current smoking, trigger finger, rheumatoid arthritis, alcohol intake, and obesity were not found to be associated with lateral epicondylitis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lateral epicondylitis is a common condition, but relatively little is known about its aetiology and associated risk factors. Nirschl suggested a ‘mesenchymal syndrome’ to be involved in the aetiology of lateral epicondylitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412442464">Nirschl 1969</xref>) via a predisposition to tendinosis at multiple sites. These conditions included medial epicondylitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, De Quervain’s disease, trigger finger, and rotator cuff tendinosis. Many of these conditions have since been associated with lateral epicondylitis in other studies including rotator cuff pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412442464">Chard et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193412442464">Walker-Bone et al., 2004</xref>), carpal tunnel syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412442464">Murray-Leslie and Wright, 1976</xref>), and De Quervain’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193412442464">Walker-Bone et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Microvascular damage has been histologically identified in lateral epicondylitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412442464">Bales et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412442464">Ljung B-O et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753193412442464">Smith et al., 1994</xref>), and hence, conditions that cause damage such as diabetes mellitus and tobacco smoking may be associated factors. Diabetes mellitus has been associated with upper limb musculoskeletal disorders in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412442464">Roquelaure et al., 2009</xref>). Other conditions such as obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412442464">Roquelaure et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412442464">Shiri et al., 2006</xref>) and rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412442464">Malmivaara et al., 1995</xref>) have been independently linked with lateral epicondylitis.</p>
<p>Previous studies have generally assessed workers in particular occupational groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412442464">Gold et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753193412442464">van Rijn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753193412442464">Walker-Bone and Cooper, 2005</xref>) or limited population studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412442464">Roquelaure et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412442464">Shiri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753193412442464">Walker-Bone et al., 2004</xref>). In light of these limitations, we have undertaken a large case-control study using The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database to quantify the relative contributions of these risk factors to lateral epicondylitis in the community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1753193412442464" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>THIN database was used in this study. The data represent the computerized recordings of routine patient care in 479 UK general practices. The total number of patient records is 9.15 million, with 3.36 million current active patients comprising approximately 5.7% of the UK population.</p>
<sec id="section3-1753193412442464">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>We randomly selected 5000 patients from approximately 50 000 who had a recorded diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis in THIN database since 2000, with greater than 6 months of follow-up data. Controls were individually matched to each patient by age (+/– 3 years), sex, and general practice. In total, 4998 controls were matched; for two cases suitable controls could not be identified.</p>
<p>Each case was assigned a date of diagnosis defined as the date of first recording of lateral epicondylitis and matched controls were assigned an identical pseudo date of diagnosis. Each matched case and control were assigned a common registration date for data collection, defined as the date on which the practice started to contribute data to THIN or that the case or control registered with the practice after 2000, whichever was later.</p>
<p>Data were extracted using Read codes, which is a National Health Service (NHS) patient data coding system used by UK general practices. These map other coding systems including the International Classification of Diseases ninth revision (ICD-9) and Classification of Surgical Operations &amp; Procedures fourth revision (OPCS-4). Read codes used were specific for the conditions studied.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1753193412442464">
<title>Data</title>
<p>Demographic data were extracted for all patients in the study, including body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, deprivation, and smoking habits, before the date of first diagnosis with lateral epicondylitis. Deprivation was based on the Townsend score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753193412442464">Townsend, 1998</xref>), an index of deprivation from 1 to 5, with high scores indicating higher deprivation.</p>
<p>BMI was coded according to the World Health Organization classification for obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753193412442464">World Health Organization, 1997</xref>): underweight, BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; normal weight, BMI 18.5–25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; mildly obese, BMI 25.1–30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; moderately obese, BMI 30.1–40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; and severely obese, BMI &gt; 40.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Data were extracted on all recorded medications and diagnoses of diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, rotator cuff pathology, De Quervain’s disease, carpal tunnel syndrome, oral steroid intake, and trigger finger. Both the Additional Health Data (AHD) records and Read codes were used for cross-checking extracted data about alcohol habits and consumption, smoking habits, and BMI. All potential risk factors for lateral epicondylitis were recorded between the registration date and date of first event.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1753193412442464">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using STATA (Version 11). The association between lateral epicondylitis and each exposure was analyzed using conditional logistic regression. We adjusted for mean annual consulting rates to assess the impact of ascertainment bias. The mean consultation rate was estimated as the mean number of general practice consultations per year over the total registration period. The missing values for each variable were grouped together and included in the analysis. We fitted a multivariate model including multiplicative interaction terms as appropriate looking for effect modification with a <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.05. The results are presented as odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) unadjusted and adjusted for mean annual consultation rates.</p>

<sec id="section7-1753193412442464">
<title>Demographics</title>
<p>Our dataset included 4998 cases of lateral epicondylitis and 4998 controls. There were 5022 women and 4974 men. Median age at diagnosis was 49 (interquartile range 42–56) years. The age distribution was similar for women and men with lateral epicondylitis and skewed towards older age (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753193412442464">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412442464">Figure 1</xref>). Deprivation score was not different between cases and controls (median [IQR] = 3 [1–4] for both groups, Mann–Whitney U test <italic>p</italic> value = 0.382). Townsend score is postcode based, and as patients matched for general practice were likely to share postcodes, the deprivation score was excluded from further analyses.</p>

<p>Data were available to calculate BMI in 69% of cases and 61% of controls. Obesity was identified as a significant risk factor for lateral epicondylitis. Patients with a BMI over 40 were at higher risk of having lateral epicondylitis than those with normal BMI [OR 1.41(1.01–1.97)]. However, this effect disappeared when BMI was adjusted for consultation rate using multivariate conditional logistic regression.</p>
<p>Smoking data were available for 79% of cases and 71% of controls. Current or previous use of tobacco was associated with a diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis. The risk of ex-smokers remained significant after adjusting for consultation rates (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.06–1.36).</p>
<p>Data were available to calculate the alcohol consumption in 45% of cases and 41% of controls. Alcohol consumption of any level was not significantly associated with lateral epicondylitis.</p>
<p>Diabetes mellitus was associated with lateral epicondylitis (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.02–1.47), but this effect disappeared after adjusting for consultation rate (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58–0.87). After extracting medication data for diabetic patients, those taking insulin were no more likely to have lateral epicondylitis than control patients. Those taking oral antidiabetic drugs showed a weak association (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.04–1.56), but this effect disappeared after adjusting for consultation rates (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58–0.90).</p>
<p>Rotator cuff pathology showed a significant association with lateral epicondylitis. This effect diminished slightly after adjusting for consultation rate (OR 4.95, 95% CI 3.64–6.71). A diagnosis of De Quervain’s (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.14–5.37) and carpal tunnel syndrome (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.14–1.98) were significantly associated with lateral epicondylitis. This association remained after adjusting for consultation rates.</p>
<p>Univariate analysis demonstrated a significant association between trigger finger and lateral epicondylitis (OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.06–2.89). However, this effect disappeared after adjusting for consultation rate (OR 1.43, 95% CI 0.84–2.43).</p>
<p>Patients taking oral steroids were at risk for being diagnosed with lateral epicondylitis. The effect was reduced after adjusting for consultation rates, but remained significant (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.47–1.92). Rheumatoid arthritis was not associated with lateral epicondylitis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have investigated a number of risk factors believed to be important in the aetiology of lateral epicondylitis using THIN database. Our study represents the largest case-control study of lateral epicondylitis reported to date. We found that rotator cuff pathology, De Quervain’s disease, carpal tunnel syndrome, oral steroid use, and history of smoking were risk factors for lateral epicondylitis. The effect of these risk factors remained significant after adjusting for the annual consultation rates. Obesity, current tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, and trigger finger were all identified using univariate analysis to be associated with lateral epicondylitis; however, the effect disappeared when taking consultation rate into account. Neither rheumatoid arthritis nor alcohol consumption were found to be associated with lateral epicondylitis.</p>
<p>The data in our study were acquired from computerized general practice records used in routine clinical care. This has the advantage of reflecting real-life experience rather than the research setting and being a prospective, continuous data collection, which avoids recall bias. A disadvantage, however, is that general practitioners are likely to have made the diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis on varying strengths of clinical suspicion and without referral to a musculoskeletal specialist.</p>
<p>Specific diagnostic criteria are not supplied for any of the conditions reported by participating doctors. However, data from practices are routinely validated using internal checks, and there are specific audits of the data supplied by individual practices. Only data meeting the minimum standards are added to the research database.</p>
<p>Consensus on diagnostic criteria for upper limb disorders in a work setting was reached in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412442464">Harrington et al., 1998</xref>). Consensus was hard to reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412442464">Davis, 1998</xref>), and it is likely that general practitioners have a heterogeneous set of criteria, regardless of the accepted standards. It is probable, however, that a diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis has good specificity but low sensitivity, which is important for a case-control study.</p>
<p>Other studies using general practice computerized records to examine musculoskeletal conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412442464">Geoghegan et al., 2004b</xref>) and Dupuytren’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412442464">Geoghegan et al., 2004a</xref>) found the data to be valid when examining the database for cases that had undergone surgical intervention. This type of analysis was not appropriate for lateral epicondylitis, which is surgically treated in a minority of cases.</p>
<p>Adjusting for consultation rate was particularly important, in order to prevent ascertainment bias in those patients who attend visit their general practitioner for other pathologies. Mean annual consultation rate was a strong predictor for lateral epicondylitis, and hence, it seems likely that ascertainment bias explains the weak association identified with obesity, diabetes mellitus, and current tobacco use, which disappeared after adjusting for consulting behaviour. Diabetes mellitus was associated with a reduced risk of being diagnosed with lateral epicondylitis after adjusting for consultation behaviour; this may, however, reflect an over compensation in patients with chronic conditions who frequently attend general practice.</p>
<p>Rotator cuff pathology was particularly strongly associated with lateral epicondylitis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412442464">Laban et al. (2005)</xref> postulated that rotator cuff dysfunction could encourage eccentric movements of the hand and forearm resulting in tennis elbow. It is therefore possible that rotator cuff pathology and lateral epicondylitis may be directly associated via biomechanical stresses. Equally, the theory of a common microvascular or degenerative cellular process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412442464">Chard et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412442464">Kraushaar and Nirschl, 1999</xref>) is attractive. This study highlights a definite association, but further work is required to elucidate and quantify the contribution of the suggested pathological mechanisms.</p>
<p>The use of oral corticosteroids was found to be associated with lateral epicondylitis in this study. It is unfortunate that it is not possible to identify the indication for such medications using the databases available for a study of this size. One possible explanation is that the therapy was intended to treat conditions such as synovitis or inflammatory arthropathies, which were beyond the scope of our study.</p>
<p>Obesity has been associated with lateral epicondylitis in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412442464">Roquelaure et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412442464">Shiri et al., 2006</xref>), but we found no association in this study following adjustment for consultation rate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753193412442464">Shiri et al. (2006)</xref> also found current and former smoking to be associated with lateral epicondylitis, but our study found significant association only for the ex-smokers group. It may be that there is a time lag between the pathological insult and clinical presentation at the end point of the pathological process.</p>
<p>In this study, we have identified some potentially important associations with lateral epicondylitis, which should guide future research into the aetiology of this condition.</p>
