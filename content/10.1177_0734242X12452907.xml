<abstract>
<p>In many Southeast Asian countries, significant challenges persist with regard to the proper management and disposal of healthcare waste. The amount of healthcare waste in these countries is continuously increasing as a result of the expansion of healthcare systems and services. In the past, healthcare waste, if it was treated at all, was mainly incinerated. In the last decade more comprehensive waste management systems were developed for Southeast Asian countries and implementation started. This also included the establishment of alternative healthcare waste treatment systems. The developments in the lower–middle-income countries are of special interest, as major investments are planned. Based upon sample projects, a short overview of the current development trends in the healthcare waste sector in Laos, Indonesia and Vietnam is provided. The projects presented include: (i) Lao Peoples Democratic Republic (development of the national environmental health training system to support the introduction of environmental health standards and improvement of healthcare waste treatment in seven main hospitals by introducing steam-based treatment technologies); (ii) Indonesia (development of a provincial-level healthcare waste-management strategy for Province Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam (NAD) and introduction of an advanced waste treatment system in a tertiary level hospital in Makassar); and (iii) Vietnam (development of a healthcare waste strategy for five provinces in Vietnam and a World Bank-financed project on healthcare waste in Vietnam).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Southeast Asia comprises the countries Brunei, Cambodia, Christmas Island, East Timor, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. With its population of about 620 million people and a gross domestic product (GDP) of US$1486 trillion, Southeast Asia is one of the most important regions of Asia and one of the fastest growing areas in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12452907">Wikipedia, 2012</xref>). The GDP per capita, however, differs from more than 50,000 US$/year in Singapore to less than 1000 US$/year in Myanmar, Cambodia and East Timor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12452907">International Monetary Fund, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>With the exception of the richer countries, the management of waste from the healthcare sector received little attention in Southeast Asia until the end of the last millennium. With the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in November 2002 this changed and the potential impact of improper healthcare waste-management was recognized. During this period, more and more countries reviewed their existing healthcare waste-management and treatment systems and identified shortcomings. The need to establish proper healthcare waste-management systems in the region was further driven by the avian flu (H5N1 influenza) outbreak.</p>
<p>Based upon the description of sample projects, healthcare waste-management development in three lower–middle-income countries is described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0734242X12452907">
<title>Healthcare waste management in Lao People’s Democratic Republic</title>
<p>Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR) has about 6.6 million inhabitants. Healthcare services are provided by three central teaching and referral hospitals, and four regional hospitals, including one teaching hospital, 17 provincial hospitals, more than 100 district hospitals and about 700 health centres. There are about 0.9 beds per 1000 inhabitants in Lao PDR (Ministry of Health, Lao PDR, 2010).</p>
<p>With the support of the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2004 the Department of Hygiene and Disease Prevention of the Ministry of Health issued the ‘Regulation on Waste Management in Health Care Facilities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12452907">Ministry of Health, Lao PDR, 2004</xref>). The purpose of this regulation is to ensure the proper management of healthcare waste, including segregation, collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of wastes. To strengthen this regulation, in 2010 the final draft of the ‘National Healthcare Waste Policy’ and the ‘National Integrated Healthcare Waste Management Plan’ were developed. Based on this draft legal framework, two major projects were started in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12452907">2011</xref>.</p>
<p>Laos is piloting the introduction of environmental health standards in healthcare facilities. To support the implementation of this standard, it was decided to include waste management as an integrated sector in the national training strategy on environmental health for healthcare facilities (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12452907">Figure 1</xref>). The capacity building concept is based on the national referral healthcare service delivery system. It includes general basic training on healthcare waste for all healthcare facilities, as well as adapted training for primary, secondary and tertiary level hospitals. Within a project on maternal, neonatal and child health, funded by the Korean Foundation for International Healthcare and implemented by WHO, this training concept was tested successfully for the first time in 2011 in the provinces Xieng Khoung and Huaphan, and expansion to the whole country is planned for 2012.</p>

</fig>
<p>In the past, the experiences of the treatment of bio-hazardous waste by incineration have not always been positive in Laos, for example the high fuel consumption of the onsite incinerators of about 0.5 litres per kg of waste created financial problems. A survey showed that most incinerators in the country were beyond repair. To ensure the adequate treatment of bio-hazardous waste generated (infectious waste, sharps waste, minor pathological waste), it was first decided to re-equip the seven main hospitals in Lao (three on a national level and four on a regional level) with adequate treatment equipment. During a workshop at the end of 2010, stakeholders decided that, owing to the expected lower operational costs and estimated lower environmental impact, steam treatment technology should be used in future. Within the ‘Lao Avian and Human Influenza Control and Preparedness Project’, 11 autoclave systems were procured in 2011 (with a size ranging from 150 litres to 450 litres) and will be put into operation in 2012. After obtaining operational experience, it is planned to expand the treatment system to the other secondary level hospitals. For smaller hospitals, the use of biomass-fuelled incinerators is currently being piloted.</p>
<sec id="section3-0734242X12452907">
<title>Outlook</title>
<p>From 2010 to 2012 Lao PDR is taking important steps in improving the healthcare waste situation. In the future the financing of the recurrent maintenance costs of the new systems and the financing of investment costs for enlarging the system will be the main problems. An efficient, risk-based inspection system for healthcare waste is so far missing and further technical support in the set-up and operation of the new system will be needed.</p>

<sec id="section4-0734242X12452907">
<title>Healthcare waste-management in Indonesia</title>
<p>With a population of nearly 250 million, Indonesia is the largest country in Southeast Asia and, after the USA, the fourth largest country worldwide. With a life expectancy at birth of 71.62 years it is ranked 135 in the world.</p>
<p>Healthcare expenditure is 5.5% of the GDP (2009) and there are only about 0.288 physicians per 1000 population. Hospital bed density is only about 0.6 beds per 1000 population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12452907">CIA, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Specific laws and regulations on healthcare waste-management do not exist; however, a guideline on how to manage the waste can be found in the Decree of the Minister of Health RI (No. 1204; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12452907">2004</xref>) on ‘Requirements of Hospital Healthy Environment’ (Second Dictum) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12452907">Ministry of Health, Indonesia, 2004</xref>). On 7 May 2008 the Solid Waste Management Act 18/2008 was announced, which also covers healthcare waste but does not provide specific guidance. Decree No. KEP-04/BAPEDAL/09/1995 on ‘Procedures and Requirements for Disposal of treated hazardous and toxic waste and former waste treatment and landfill sites’ states that all hospitals using incinerators have to adhere to air-emission limits for major air pollutants.</p>
<p>At 00:58:53 on 26 December 2004 an earthquake occurred with an epicentre off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, followed by the world’s single worst tsunami in recent history. The tsunami hit Indonesia’s most northern province, Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam (NAD), with a disastrous effect. The reconstruction of the province included the set-up of several dozens of new healthcare facilities, as well as the rehabilitation of healthcare facilities not hit by the tsunami. With support from the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development through the German Bank for Reconstruction (KfW) and the German Aid Agency, GIZ, and in coordination with other aid organizations, the provincial health department developed a provincial level healthcare waste strategy based on the existing legal framework (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12452907">Figure 2</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig2-0734242X12452907" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0734242X12452907-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The cornerstone of this strategy was a new provincial level guideline ‘Safe Management of Healthcare Waste in NAD’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12452907">Provincial Health Office, NAD Indonesia, 2008</xref>) . Based on this, a comprehensive strategy for the future treatment of hazardous healthcare waste was developed. The strategy took into consideration the different needs of smaller and larger healthcare facilities, and the operational, maintenance and financial needs of healthcare facilities in urban and rural areas. The strategy that was developed included centralized treatment and sharing of treatment plants, as well as onsite treatment depending on the existing infrastructure. Selected treatment technologies included high temperature incineration for centralized treatment of more complex waste (by the provincial referral hospital located in the capital Banda Aceh), steam decontamination (autoclave) for larger (district) facilities and the usage of biomass-fuelled (wood, coconut shells) incinerators for primary healthcare facilities in more rural areas (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X12452907">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Nearly all healthcare facilities in the areas of the province covered by donor activities were reached during 2010.</p>
<p>A positive example of an integrated healthcare waste-management system for tertiary level hospitals was created in the 600-bed hospital ‘Dr. Wahidin Sudirohusodo’(RSWS) in Makassar (South Sulawesi), financed by the German government through KfW. The comprehensive solution included the introduction of an environmental health-management system, the improvement of internal waste logistics and the creation of a steam-based treatment system for bio-hazardous waste (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12452907">Figure 4</xref>), as well as an incinerator for the treatment of chemical waste, pharmaceuticals, and pathological and anatomical waste. In 2011 the hospital also introduced its own recycling system for non-hazardous waste. It also started to treat waste from other hospitals in the city and applied for ISO 14000 certification.</p>

</fig>
<p>The additional income from the recycling and the waste treatment services for other hospitals is used to cross-finance the operational and maintenance costs of the environmental system, and will help to sustain it.</p>
<sec id="section5-0734242X12452907">
<title>Outlook</title>
<p>Healthcare waste-management is one of the major future challenges for Indonesia’s healthcare system and will need strong support from all stakeholders involved. Experience obtained from the development of the provincial level solution in NAD, as well as from the tertiary level hospital RSWS in Makassar, is important to further develop the national system. To maintain the provincial level solution, strong commitment and support by the political leaders, and monitoring by the Department of Health, will be required. A development plan for healthcare waste- management at a national level would be beneficial.</p>

<sec id="section6-0734242X12452907">
<title>Healthcare waste management in Vietnam</title>
<p>Vietnam is a coastal country (coastal border 3444 km) bordering the Gulf of Thailand, Gulf of Tonkin and the South China Sea, as well as China, Laos and Cambodia. The life expectancy at birth of more than 91 million Vietnamese is 72.41 years. About 7.2% of the GDP is spent on health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12452907">CIA, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the millennium, Vietnam has slowly started to improve the healthcare waste system. At that time, it was driven mainly by donor-financed projects. In 2005 a decision was taken by the government to improve the waste- management situation in the 84 most polluting hospitals in the country, followed by an update of the existing order on medical waste which was issued in 2007 (Decision No.43/2007/QD-BYT dated 30 November 2007 of Ministry of Health promulgating Regulation on Health Care Waste Management) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12452907">Ministry of Health, Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2007</xref>). After a scandal on the illegal recycling of potentially hazardous healthcare waste in the summer of 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12452907">Viêt Nam News, 2007</xref>), the government have put more effort into solving the healthcare waste problem and introduced strict inspections to enforce the implementation of the new regulation. The regular inspections have raised awareness and demonstrated the strong will of the government to improve the system. During the period 2008–2010 the country collected valuable experience on the comprehensive management of healthcare waste. On 25 May 2011, the ‘Prime Minister Decision No: 798/QĐ-TTg on the approval of the solid waste treatment investment program for the period 2011 to 2020’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12452907">Prime Minister Decision, Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 2011</xref>) was issued. The target for the first phase (2011–2015) is the safe management and treatment of 85% of the total healthcare waste and within the second phase (2016–2020), 100% of the total non-hazardous and hazardous healthcare waste will be collected and treated according to the existing standards.</p>
<p>The German–Vietnamese cooperation strategy requires that all healthcare projects have to contain an environmental component. Training on healthcare waste-management took place as early as 2005. Also, the current health projects (support to decentralized health systems in Vietnam) in the five provinces—Yen Bai, Phu Yen, Thanh Hoa, Thai Binh and Nghe An—include an environmental health component, mainly targeting the support to develop provincial and hospital level waste-management plans, as well as capacity-building for healthcare waste and wastewater. During the implementation of the project it became clear that further investments in the hospital waste and wastewater sector would be needed to ensure full compliance with the new environmental standards. Therefore, it was decided that through bilateral financial cooperation a separate programme would be created to support the five provinces, as well as the Viet Duc Hospital in Hanoi. In total, €10 million will be allocated to establish a comprehensive environmental infrastructure for the selected project hospitals in the five provinces. The project is planned to begin in 2012 and will include a strong programme of skills transfer to allow the provinces and the hospitals to maintain the systems after beginning operations.</p>
<p>In parallel, and in coordination with the bilateral aid activities financed by Germany, the World Bank agreed to finance the largest healthcare waste and wastewater project ever. The project ‘Hospital Waste Management Support Project Vietnam’ began at the end of 2011, will last until August 2017 and has a total budget of US$150 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12452907">Word Bank, 2011</xref>). The project has three main components:</p>

<sec id="section7-0734242X12452907">
<title>Outlook</title>
<p>The two projects together will completely change the solid and liquid healthcare waste system in Vietnam. Both projects are well designed and follow an integrated approach. It can be estimated that at the end of the projects, a major part of the current environmental problems of the healthcare sector will be solved. As the local capacity for environmental health for the healthcare sector still is limited, strong technical assistance during the coming year is, however, required to avoid repetition of mistakes made in other projects and countries.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The short description of the sample projects shows that in all three countries strong efforts were made or are being made to improve healthcare waste-management systems. In all countries a trend away from ‘end-of-pipe’ toward more integrated solutions is visible. The example of Vietnam demonstrates the need and benefits of implementing an inspection system to be able to enforce the implementation of regulations. Typical strategies and lessons learned from these countries include the following:</p>
<list id="list5-0734242X12452907" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>the need to set up a national policy and development strategy for healthcare waste-management;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the development, adoption and/or revision of regulations regarding healthcare waste-management;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a trend away from treatment technologies with high operational costs and environmental polluting emissions, such as small-scale, onsite incineration, toward more cost-effective and environmentally-sound technologies, such as steam treatment;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the creation of provincial or regional healthcare waste treatment strategies to cover all healthcare facilities and all waste streams rather than onsite treatment for selected waste streams in selected healthcare facilities;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the importance of introducing an institutionalized training and capacity-building system for healthcare waste, including vocational training;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the availability of a separate budget at the macro- as well as micro-level for environmental health activities in healthcare facilities;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the need to include a strict monitoring and risk-based inspection system to ensure compliance with exiting regulations.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The lessons learned that are outlined above should be considered during the planning and implementation of new projects and be followed up on systems already implemented in order to enable the countries to develop self-supporting systems that can be permanently sustained.</p>
<p>A key to success will be the successful cooperation between the infection control and environmental health sectors. The further improvement of healthcare waste-management systems, and also the safe water supply, wastewater treatment, and the provision of adequate cleaning, laundry and sterilization services, must be one of the top priorities of the healthcare facilities in Southeast Asia to be able to deal with outbreaks of new diseases and, for example, the antibiotic resistance of bacteria such as multidrug-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>.</p>
