<abstract>
<p>Recognition of the treatment gap in patients with heart failure (HF) led to the development of a set of process-of-care measures to improve the quality of care. To assess the association of established and emerging process-of-care measures with 1-year postdischarge survival, 496 patients with acute decompensated HF were studied. After adjustment for established prognostic factors, the relative risk (RR) for mortality in patients eligible for treatment was as follows: 0.49 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) for discharge prescription of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS-Is), 0.59 (<italic>P</italic> = .015) for β-blockers, 0.44 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) for combination therapy (ie, a β-blocker and a RAS-I), 0.87 (<italic>P</italic> nonsignificant) for aldosterone antagonists, and 0.49 (<italic>P</italic> nonsignificant) for planned cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. After adjustment for propensity scores, the RR was 0.49 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) for RAS-Is, 0.67 (<italic>P</italic> = .04) for β-blockers, and 0.57 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) for combination therapy. The data suggest that performance measures for RAS-Is, β-blockers, and combination therapy are strongly associated with improved 1-year survival.</p>

<body>
<p>Recognition of the treatment gap in patients with heart failure (HF) led the Joint Commission to develop a set of disease-specific, evidence-based standardized measures to induce favorable practice changes and increased hospital performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612451049">1</xref></sup> In 2005, the performance measures were endorsed by the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612451049">2</xref></sup> An expanded measure set also was defined in the Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612451049">3</xref></sup> and Registry to Improve the Use of Evidence-based Heart Failure Therapies in the Outpatient setting (IMPROVE-HF).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612451049">4</xref></sup> Some potential limitations of the process-of-care measures should be acknowledged. Updating performance measures with the rapidly expanding scientific evidence may be difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612451049">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612451049">6</xref></sup> The definition of the denominator (ie, the target population that is eligible for the assessment of each measure) may be complex or even ambiguous.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612451049">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612451049">7</xref></sup> Moreover, process-of-care measures cannot be considered surrogates for outcomes; linking processes of care to outcomes is mandatory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612451049">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612451049">8</xref></sup> In acute HF, time frames longer than the first 30 to 90 days after discharge may be required to realize the impact of some interventions. Although early postdischarge outcomes remain a priority, late (6-12 months) postdischarge mortality is the major unmet medical need and the primary target for therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612451049">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Currently, only the prescription of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS-Is) at discharge is recognized as a HF accountability measure (ie, most closely linked to positive patient outcomes).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612451049">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612451049">10</xref></sup> However, it is unlikely that conformity with a single performance measure may translate into improved outcomes. Thus, programs have been started to enhance adherence to other evidence-based process-of-care measures such as the use of β-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, warfarin, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in eligible patients hospitalized for HF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612451049">3</xref></sup> Several studies have been performed to evaluate whether and to what degree conformity with measures of process of care for patients hospitalized with HF influences short- and long-term clinical outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612451049">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612451049"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612451049"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612451049"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612451049"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612451049">16</xref></sup> Nonetheless, the effectiveness of performance measures in a real-world setting still remains relatively elusive,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612451049">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1062860612451049">17</xref></sup> especially when the outcome measure is 1-year survival. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between conformity with established and emerging process-of-care measures and 12-month postdischarge mortality in patients hospitalized for acute decompensated systolic heart failure (ADHF).</p>
<sec id="section1-1062860612451049" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This was a retrospective study. A total of 895 patients who had been hospitalized in the authors’ institution for ADHF between January 1, 2003, and March 30, 2011, were identified using a computer-generated list obtained from the institution’s administrative database. All patients underwent 2-dimensional echocardiography on admission. Patients eligible for enrollment included those aged 18 years or older who had been hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of ADHF with left-ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), defined by a left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤0.40. The authors excluded patients listed for urgent heart transplantation; those with cardiogenic shock, isolated right HF, LVEF &gt;0.40, a clinical diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome or angina pectoris, myocarditis, valvular or congenital heart disease, and obstructive, hypertrophic, or restrictive cardiomyopathy; and those who had undergone cardiac surgical procedures or percutaneous interventions in the prior 6 months or had been transferred to another hospital. Of the 895 patients identified, 496 (55.4%) fulfilled the selection criteria. Reasons for exclusion were as follows: LVEF &gt;0.40 (19.9%), valvular heart disease (8.3%), right HF (5.5%), transfer to another hospital (1.2%), other reasons (9.7%). The study was approved by the local institutional review board.</p>
<sec id="section2-1062860612451049">
<title>Data Collection and Definitions</title>
<p>Baseline variables, contraindications, and reasons for no prescription at discharge were assessed by reviewing electronic and paper medical records. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was diagnosed on the basis of a history of COPD with documentation of airflow obstruction (forced expiratory volume to forced vital capacity ratio [FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC] &lt;0.70) at spirometry, assessed before or during hospitalization, or with signs and symptoms of exacerbation at admission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612451049">18</xref></sup> Severe COPD was defined as FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &lt;70% and FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;30% predicted or respiratory failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612451049">18</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1062860612451049">
<title>Outcome Measure</title>
<p>The outcome measure was all-cause postdischarge mortality at 12 months. Vital status was ascertained by linking with the regional health information systems or by telephone follow-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1062860612451049">
<title>Process-of-Care Measures</title>
<p>The following process-of-care measures were evaluated: prescription of RAS-Is or β-blockers for eligible patients, prescription of oral anticoagulants for eligible patients with atrial fibrillation, prescription of aldosterone antagonists for eligible patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III to IV symptoms and LVEF ≤0.35, and planned ICD implantation for primary prevention for eligible patients with NYHA class II to III symptoms and LVEF ≤0.35. Performance measures were constructed using the numerator and denominator definitions defined by the Joint Commission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612451049">1</xref></sup> and AHA/ACC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612451049">2</xref></sup> and by assessing prescription rates among patients without contraindications or documented reasons for no prescription at discharge. One additional measure of interest, the use of combination medical therapy (ie, both a β-blocker and a RAS-I) for eligible patients discharged with either a RAS-I or a β-blocker was assessed. To enhance denominator transparency, the authors assessed contraindications according to the definitions in the clinical practice guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1062860612451049">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1062860612451049"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1062860612451049">21</xref></sup> Contraindications to RAS-Is included systolic blood pressure &lt;80 mm Hg, serum creatinine (SCr) level ≥3.0 mg/dL, known bilateral renal artery stenosis, history of angioneurotic edema, and serum potassium level &gt;5.5 mmol/L.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1062860612451049">21</xref></sup> Contraindications to β-blockers included the following: asthma, second- or third-degree heart block, sick sinus syndrome (in the absence of a permanent pacemaker), sinus bradycardia (&lt;50 bpm), and systolic blood pressure &lt;80 mm Hg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1062860612451049">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1062860612451049"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1062860612451049">21</xref></sup> Contraindications to potassium-sparing diuretics included the following: serum potassium concentration &gt;5.0 mmol/L, SCr ≥2.5 mg/dL, and concomitant use of a potassium-sparing diuretic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1062860612451049">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1062860612451049"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1062860612451049">21</xref></sup> The aldosterone antagonist used in this study was potassium canrenoate, an active metabolite of spironolactone widely prescribed in Italy.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Data are reported as mean ± standard deviation for continuous variables or number (percentages) of patients for categorical variables. Unadjusted and adjusted relative risks (RRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Univariate association between each performance measure and 12-month mortality was assessed using univariable Cox proportional hazard regression models. The univariable models included only conformity with performance measure as a predictor. To adjust for baseline risk disparities, multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed. The models include established prognostic factors: age, sex, COPD,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1062860612451049">22</xref></sup> ischemic etiology,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1062860612451049">22</xref></sup> NYHA class IV at admission,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1062860612451049">22</xref></sup> use of intravenous inotropes during the index hospitalization,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1062860612451049">23</xref></sup> LVEF &lt;0.30,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1062860612451049">24</xref></sup> systolic blood pressure ≤100 mm Hg at admission,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1062860612451049">25</xref></sup> and estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> at admission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1062860612451049">26</xref></sup> in addition to conformity with each performance measure. No variable incorporated into the model was missed. Adjusted survival curves were generated with the Cox proportional hazard model. Because treatments were not assigned randomly, a propensity score analysis also was performed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1062860612451049">27</xref></sup> For each performance measure, the propensity score was constructed with the use of a nonparsimonious multivariable logistic regression model that included all baseline characteristics as covariates. The impact of conformity with each process-of-care measure was then adjusted for propensity score by inclusion in the multivariable Cox model as a covariate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1062860612451049">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1062860612451049">29</xref></sup> Only eligible patients were included in each of these analyses. In survival analyses, the patients who underwent heart transplantation were censored at the time of the event. Statistical software package SPSS 8.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) was used to perform the analyses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As stated in the Heart Failure Society of America guidelines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1062860612451049">20</xref></sup> hospitalization for ADHF may present an excellent opportunity to restructure the patient’s medical treatment, especially in circumstances that make initiation of therapy and dose adjustment problematic in an outpatient setting.</p>
<p>In this study, we found a process-outcome link for β-blockers, currently still not a performance measure, and RAS-I process-of-care measures and also demonstrated a significant association between process and 1-year survival for discharge prescription of combination therapy, after adjustment for either propensity score or established powerful prognostic factors. These findings suggest that the process-outcome link was independent of either selection bias or risk profile.</p>
<p>Conformity with RAS-I, β-blocker, and planned ICD implantation measures at discharge was 85.7%, 80%, and 48.3%, respectively. These treatment rates are comparable to treatment rates achieved in dedicated programs to improve the quality of care in hospitalized HF patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1062860612451049">30</xref></sup> After adjustment for prognostic factors, a discharge prescription for either a RAS-I or a β-blocker was associated with a significant 51% and 41% reduction in 1-year postdischarge mortality risk, respectively. The improvement in survival with RAS-Is and β-blockers is comparable to that achieved in the large IMPROVE-HF study that included outpatients with chronic HF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1062860612451049">31</xref></sup> In that study, RAS-I use and β-blocker use were associated with adjusted odds ratios of 0.51 and 0.45, respectively, for 24-month mortality. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the effect of the prescribed treatments on survival in our study should be interpreted in light of the width of the CIs. The combination therapy was prescribed for 69.9% of eligible patients. The novelty of this study is that the adjusted RR for mortality among the patients discharged on combination therapy was substantially lower (RR = 0.44) compared with that for those who took only a RAS-I or a β-blocker. From 2003-2007 to 2008-2011, the penetrance of the combination therapy significantly increased from 65.2% to 75.1% as a result of an increased use of β-blockers. Intriguingly, a significant decline in the adjusted mortality risk from 2003-2007 to 2008-2011 was observed. The measure for combination medical therapy was included and subsequently removed from the measure set for HF based on the consideration that pairing (ie, concurrently measuring) the RAS-I and β-blocker measures would allow access to the data while still preserving the individual measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612451049">1</xref></sup> However, this approach disregards the synergistic effects of the combination therapy on outcomes. Because nearly all patients enrolled in the major β-blocker trials had a background RAS-I therapy, the process-outcome link for the combination therapy measure more closely mirrors the results of those clinical trials on which guideline recommendations are based than the individual measures. Moreover, conformity with the combination therapy measure depends on the degree of overlap of the 2 treatments in patients who are eligible for both. For example, with an adherence of 90% to RAS-I and 86% to β-blocker measures in patients eligible for both treatments, conformity with the combination therapy measure could range from 76% to 86%, which is a remarkable difference. Given the wide variation in adherence to emerging performance measures across hospitals, such as in β-blocker prescription,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612451049">16</xref></sup> this may have implications for assessing hospital-level quality of care.</p>
<p>The results from the prognostic covariate-adjusted Cox regression model analysis were verified by applying propensity score analysis, a statistical method used to reduce the impact of selection bias in nonrandomized, observational studies. The mortality risk reduction associated with discharge prescription of RAS-Is and β-blockers or their association persisted after adjustment for propensity score. The fact that the 2 independent statistical methods—namely, prognostic covariate-adjusted Cox analysis and propensity score—produced analogous results provides credence to our findings.</p>
<p>Potassium canrenoate was prescribed to 75.8% of the eligible patients, usually in combination with furosemide at high doses (&gt;80 mg daily). The prolonged LOS (median = 11 days) afforded us the opportunity to monitor renal function and electrolytes, potentially contributing to the high level of adherence. In Europe, a median LOS of 9 days has been observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1062860612451049">32</xref></sup> Prescription of aldosterone antagonists was not significantly associated with improved survival. Planned ICD implantation trended toward an improved survival. However, this finding should be interpreted in light of the low prevalence of eligible patients. The most common reasons for ineligibility for planned ICD implantation were comorbidities and age ≥85 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612451049">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612451049">8</xref></sup></p>

<title>Previous Studies and Clinical Implications</title>
<p>Luthi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612451049">11</xref></sup> studied 621 patients hospitalized for HF with LVSD; only 3.4% of the patients had contraindications to RAS-I therapy, and a graded 1-year survival benefit with increasing doses of RAS-Is was observed. Compared with patients discharged at a recommended angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) dose, patients not prescribed an ACE-I at discharge had an adjusted hazard ratio for 1-year death of 1.63; patients prescribed an ACE-I at a less-than-recommended dose had a hazard ratio of 1.30.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612451049">11</xref></sup> In the OPTIMIZE-HF study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612451049">12</xref></sup> ineligibility for RAS-I and β-blocker therapy was 28% and 22.1% among patients with LVSD in the overall registry and 19.8% and 14.2% among patients in the follow-up cohort, respectively. Discharge prescription of a RAS-I or a β-blocker was associated with a 39% and 52% mortality risk reduction at 60 to 90 days, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612451049">12</xref></sup> However, in a separate analysis from the same study, only prescription of β-blockers at discharge remained significantly associated with lower mortality at 1 year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612451049">13</xref></sup> In another analysis of the OPTIMIZE-HF database, a 12.8% ineligibility for β-blocker therapy was documented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612451049">14</xref></sup> Kfoury et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612451049">15</xref></sup> studied 2958 hospitalized patients with HF related to LVSD, 12% of whom were ineligible for RAS-I therapy; a 1-year postdischarge survival benefit of 31% was observed with adherence to the RAS-I measure. Finally, in the study by Hernandez et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612451049">16</xref></sup> 10% increases in hospital-level adherence to β-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, and ICD performance measures were each associated with decreased 1-year mortality.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned studies, the ineligibility rate for RAS-I therapy varied widely, from 3.6%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612451049">11</xref></sup> to 28%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612451049">12</xref></sup> Possible reasons for this variability may include differences in hospital and population characteristics, different rates of left-ventricular systolic function assessment, heterogeneously perceived reasons of caution, accuracy of the documentation, and transparency of contraindications. Monitoring the completeness of data and assessing whether all eligible patients are included in performance measurement is a critical challenge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612451049">6</xref></sup> Contraindications and reasons for not prescribing therapy have rarely been ascertained or described in previous studies, potentially leading to misclassification of the eligible population and overestimation of adherence to performance measures. Because guidelines provide the benchmark for indications to treatments, it is reasonable to assume that they also could provide the benchmark for contraindications. In the present study, the application of established contraindications to pharmacotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1062860612451049">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1062860612451049"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1062860612451049">21</xref></sup> resulted in a 5.9% ineligibility for RAS-I and a 9.5% ineligibility for β-blocker therapy. In the study by Peterson et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1062860612451049">33</xref></sup> 13% of the patients with LVSD surviving hospitalization for HF had a documented contraindication to RAS-Is, and 7% had a contraindication to β-blockers. Decreased renal function was the most common contraindication to RAS-I treatment. Among the patients with decreased renal function as a documented contraindication, the median SCr level was 2.2 mg/dL. Similarly, an inverse relationship between the degree of renal dysfunction and conformity with HF performance and quality measures was documented by Patel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1062860612451049">34</xref></sup> Although enalapril has been studied in patients with severe HF with SCr levels as high as 3.4 mg/dL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1062860612451049">35</xref></sup> and the guidelines recommend that RAS-Is should be used with caution in those with markedly increased SCr levels (&gt;3.0 mg/dL),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1062860612451049">21</xref></sup> lower levels of renal insufficiency have become a major barrier to the use of RAS-Is in routine clinical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1062860612451049">33</xref></sup> Observational studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1062860612451049">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1062860612451049">37</xref></sup> indicate that patients with renal insufficiency may have the most to gain, in terms of survival, from treatment with ACE-I therapy. Masoudi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1062860612451049">36</xref></sup> studied elderly patients with LVSD who had survived hospitalization for HF. A trend toward a stronger relationship between ACE-I prescription and 1-year survival benefit was observed for patients with higher (&gt;2.5 mg/dL) SCr when compared with those with normal values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1062860612451049">36</xref></sup> In the Minnesota Heart Survey, a discharge prescription of RAS-Is was associated with a significant reduction in adjusted 1-year mortality among HF patients with severely impaired renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;15 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>) compared with patients with preserved renal function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1062860612451049">37</xref></sup> Thus, considering patients with relative or questionable contraindications as ineligible for treatment may lead to somewhat illusory high levels of quality of care and, as discussed by Peterson et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1062860612451049">33</xref></sup> deprive high-risk HF patients (ie, those who have the most to gain in terms of survival) of the potential benefits of therapy. Clearly, underrepresentation of renal dysfunction in clinical trials and the fear of potential adverse drug events early after discharge may deter physicians from prescribing such therapy, suggesting that targeted interventions in the transition from the hospital setting to outpatient care may be a key factor in achieving high-quality care.</p>

<sec id="section13-1062860612451049">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This was a single-center study, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Nonetheless, the results were derived from an ideal cohort for therapy (ie, patients with LVSD caused by ischemic or nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy). Despite multivariable adjustment for established prognostic factors and propensity score, biases might exist because of the influence of hidden unmeasured confounders of mortality risk such as socioeconomic status levels. Possible underreporting of reasons for not prescribing treatments may have led to an overestimation of the denominator for the performance measures. We did not address patient adherence to prescribed pharmacotherapy, which is clearly associated with outcomes. However, decreasing postdischarge adherence to prescribed therapies throughout the 1-year follow-up as well as initiation of evidence-based therapies after discharge for patients who were not prescribed such treatments would have resulted in an attenuation of the effect of prescribed evidence-based therapies on survival.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our data suggest that the performance measures for RAS-Is and β-blockers are strongly associated with improved 1-year survival. Among patients discharged on either a RAS-I or a β-blocker, prescription of combination medical therapy confers a substantial survival benefit.</p>
