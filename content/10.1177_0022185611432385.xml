<abstract>
<p>This article examines how managers grant employees access to family-friendly work conditions and the institutional, organization and individual-level factors affecting their decision-making processes. This research question is addressed by comparing family-friendly conditions in collective agreements in the Australian retail and public service sectors. An analysis of interviews with management staff in the two sectors then explores how access to these family-friendly conditions works in practice. We found that at an institutional level, the different collective agreement conditions in each sector enabled or constrained managers’ ability to create family-friendly working arrangements for employees. Industry-specific pressures and workplace ‘cultures’ also shaped the ease with which managers could grant employees access to conditions. Most importantly, managers’ discretion operated on the basis of a cost–benefit analysis, where managers weighed up the benefits of retaining an employee’s skills and knowledge against the costs of implementing a particular family-friendly arrangement. The article concludes by considering managerial discretion in relation to recent reforms to Australia’s industrial relations laws.</p>

<p>What happens when employees ask their managers for time off to take care of a sick child or for a children’s birthday party? What kinds of factors influence a manager’s decision to say yes or no to such requests? This article attempts to answer these questions by examining how managers use their discretion to grant employees access to family-friendly work conditions. Questions relating to managers’ decision-making processes are particularly important in light of recent social, economic and demographic changes in Australia, including the increased paid work hours of mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022185611432385">Gray et al., 2003</xref>) and the rising proportion of parents working long or non-standard hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022185611432385">Campbell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022185611432385">Pocock et al., 2001</xref>). While the total paid work hours of families has risen, the amount of time parents spend caring for children has not decreased proportionately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022185611432385">Bittman et al., 2004</xref>), contributing to increasing feelings of time pressure among parents, and a ‘collision’ between work and family demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185611432385">Bittman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022185611432385">Bittman and Wajcman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022185611432385">Morehead et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022185611432385">Pocock, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185611432385">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022185611432385">Pocock et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to manage the competing demands of paid work and unpaid care, Australian parents use family-friendly work conditions, including parental and carers’ leave, working from home, working hours flexibility and part-time work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022185611432385">Whitehouse and Zetlin, 1999</xref>). However, studies suggest that Australia’s changing industrial relations environment has had significant effects on parents’ ability to access such provisions. The Howard government’s policy of deregulation (manifested first in the Workplace Relations Act 1996, and later in the Workplace Relations Amendment (WorkChoices) Act 2006) was promoted as being family-friendly, with decentralized workplace relations enabling employers and employees to tailor work arrangements to suit their particular needs, including the management of employee care responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022185611432385">Owens, 2005</xref>). However, the regime also narrowed employee rights, enhancing managerial discretion over workplace flexibility arrangements, and reducing employees’ access to family-friendly work arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185611432385">Bray and Waring, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022185611432385">McCallum, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022185611432385">Owens, 2005</xref>). Changes under the Labor Federal Government have ostensibly improved the situation, including the announcement of a paid parental leave scheme (to commence in 2011), providing 18 weeks’ paid parental leave to the primary carer at federal minimum wages. The Federal Government also introduced the Fair Work Act in 2009, which contains new modern awards and 10 National Employment Standards, including a right to request flexible working arrangements and extended unpaid parental leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185611432385">Baird and Williamson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022185611432385">Cooper, 2010</xref>). However, there is concern that ‘the reverberations of WorkChoices are likely to take some time to fade’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185611432385">Pocock et al., 2008</xref>: 476), and that rights to family-friendly working conditions under the new regime are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022185611432385">Baird and Williamson, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185611432385">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185611432385">Charlesworth and Campbell, 2008</xref>; Waterhouse and Colley, 2010). Thus, managerial control over workplace conditions remains a contentious issue, and one deserving of further analysis.</p>
<p>Most Australian research focuses on the formal availability of different family-friendly conditions (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022185611432385">Buchanan and Thornthwaite, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022185611432385">Pocock, 2003</xref>); however, there is growing interest in the factors that determine employee access to conditions already in place at worksites. It is clear that managers play a crucial role not only in the introduction of family-friendly policies, but also in determining whether their implementation is effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185611432385">Bardoel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185611432385">Dex and Scheibl, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185611432385">Kelly and Kalev, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185611432385">Morehead, 2003</xref>). Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185611432385">Pocock and colleagues (2008)</xref> suggests that as well as extending managerial control over the setting of workplace conditions, the WorkChoices regime increased managerial power over employee access to conditions already in place at the worksite. The regime created a workplace environment where many employers felt able to act without consideration of workers’ rights, and employees were reluctant to question management decisions because of fears of instant dismissal and concerns for job security (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185611432385">Pocock et al., 2008</xref>). This research indicates that particular regulatory regimes can enhance the role of managerial discretion in determining access to pre-existing family-friendly work conditions; however, there is significantly less research on this issue compared to the question of how Australia’s industrial relations regime affects the setting of such conditions.</p>
<p>Prior studies may have investigated whether (and why) organizations implement family-friendly conditions, but most researchers are unclear on the sources of these provisions. Researchers do not explain whether conditions are contained in written policies or access is granted informally, what written policies may say, or how they actually work in practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185611432385">Kelly and Kalev, 2006</xref>). This article examines how managers grant employees access to family-friendly conditions in the public service and retail sector in Australia. Our research differs from previous studies by examining work conditions set out in legal instruments, that is, public sector and retail certified agreements. Through an analysis of interviews with public service and retail managers, we then examine how these provisions actually work in practice, including their interaction with the informal rules created by individual managers and workplace policies. Drawing upon neo-institutional theory, we conceptualize industrial regulation (or law) as a social institution shaping the behaviours of social actors, although actors also respond proactively to such pressures, interpreting or constructing the law to further their own purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022185611432385">DiMaggio and Powell, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185611432385">Edelman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022185611432385">Oliver, 1991</xref>). Thus, the overall aim of our article is an analysis of the individual, organizational and institutional factors influencing managers’ decisions to grant access to family-friendly work conditions.</p>
<p>The public and retail sectors have very different histories in the provision of family-friendly work conditions; given the relatively high incidence of regulated conditions in the Australian Public Service, it is thought of as the ‘gold standard’ in terms of family-friendliness. In contrast, the comparatively deregulated working conditions found in the retail sector establish it as a ‘poor performer’ in relation to employee access to provisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185611432385">Earle, 2002</xref>). The choice of these two sectors allows for a comparison of the operation of managerial discretion in one highly regulated and one relatively deregulated work environment.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0022185611432385"><title>Research Methods</title>
<p>Data for this article came from a multidisciplinary project that used in-depth interviews, surveys, document analysis and biological data to examine the interconnections between parental work and family well-being. The retail and public service sectors were targeted for the study, with research participants drawn from a total of 15 large retail stores (owned by two companies) and various locations in two public service departments.</p>
<p>Data for the comparison of formal provisions came from the certified agreements of the retail companies and the public service agencies. These agreements were established under the legislative framework contained in the Workplace Relations Act 1996, which was operating at the time of the research. Agreements were negotiated between the employer and the sector’s relevant union, and then certified by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Although unions played a role in determining the terms of the agreements, their influence on the use of managerial discretion is not discussed in this article. The research did not explicitly analyse union involvement in the implementation of family-friendly work conditions and managers tended not to volunteer information on union involvement in the interviews. This is one possible limitation of the study in light of research linking unionization to the availability of family-friendly work conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022185611432385">Bardoel et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Each certified agreement was examined for any provisions it contained that related to family-friendliness, including the availability of different types of leave, part-time work and additional family-friendly conditions such as childcare. We also analysed provisions covering control over work hours such as the span of ordinary hours of work and overtime. In order to examine the role of managerial discretion in determining access to family-friendly conditions, we analysed transcripts of interviews conducted from 2001 to 2005 (before the introduction of the WorkChoices scheme or the election of the Labor Federal Government). Interviews were undertaken with 36 middle and senior managers of the retail companies and public service agencies studied. Managers were asked to discuss their understanding of ‘family-friendliness’ within their industry, their organization, their department and their own job. They were encouraged to comment on changes over time and a number volunteered personal stories from their own family experiences. Interview transcripts were de-identified and placed in the Atlas Ti Scientific software for management of qualitative data, where they were coded thematically.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec4-0022185611432385"><title>Formal Provisions</title>
<p>Both the retail and public service sectors involved in the study were covered by an industry-level award. The terms of this award could be varied by a certified agreement, so long as this did not result in an overall reduction in employees’ working conditions. Each of the 15 retail stores and two public service departments in the study had their own certified agreement, which covered all (non-management) employees at each worksite. Casual employees had restricted access to some family-friendly conditions in both sectors, and different provisions relating to overtime and rostering in the retail sector. This article is limited to the consideration of the formal provisions for permanent full-time and part-time employees in each sector. In relation to these employees, the retail certified agreements had very similar provisions, while the public sector agreements were identical in their terms and conditions. The tables below provide a summary of the formal family-friendly conditions found in the worksites that participated in the study. These tables are representative of the conditions that would be found in a typical retail or public sector agreement at the time of the research.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022185611432385">Table 1</xref> compares the provisions for family and parental leave and part-time work after parental leave contained in the certified agreements of each sector. It also describes any additional family-friendly provisions such as home-based work, job sharing and family care costs. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022185611432385">Table 1</xref>, retail employees had significantly less access to parental leave than public service employees, who were guaranteed 14 weeks’ paid parental leave, as compared to the unpaid parental leave found in the retail sector. Employees in both sectors had similar access to part-time work, with most worksites offering part-time work for two years after the birth of a child. The certified agreements from the retail sector did not mention any additional family-friendly provisions; however, the public service agreements included conditions such as payments towards vacation childcare programmes, job-sharing arrangements and home-based work.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022185611432385">Table 2</xref> outlines provisions relating to the scheduling and control of work hours, including overtime, the ordinary span of hours and rostering principles. The retail agreements contained a wide band of ordinary hours and the ability to roster employees to work during the weekend and public holidays (largely on a voluntary basis). The public service agreements contained a narrower band of ordinary hours, excluding weekend work and restricting the number of non-standard hours employees could work. Public service agreements explicitly required the agency concerned to give consideration to the family responsibilities of employees when determining hours of work, and contained ‘flextime’ clauses allowing employees to vary their pattern of attendance at work. In summary, as reported in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185611432385">Evans, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185611432385">Kelly and Kalev, 2006</xref>), the agreements outlined above show that public servants had more formalized family-friendly work conditions than retail workers.

<sec id="sec5-0022185611432385"><title>The Institutional Context for Managerial Decision-Making</title>
<p>One institutional-level factor shaping managerial decision-making was the regulatory framework operating in each sector. One example of this was in relation to employees’ working hours arrangements. As described earlier, the retail agreements contained a very wide spread of ordinary hours, with few restrictions on when employees could be required to work, giving managers a broad discretion in rostering employee work hours.</p>
<p>While the use of discretion was linked to the certified agreement provisions, the distinctive business pressures operating in each sector also shaped managerial decision-making. Retail managers worked in an environment dominated by business needs and customer demand; managers in our study were predominantly describing the work arrangements of sales staff, and a certain number of employees were required to be on the shop floor to serve customers at any one time. Each of the retail worksites were large stores that were part of retail chains; however, managers still faced challenges in deploying a sufficient number of sales staff while also meeting employees’ family needs. To remain competitive in an economy of deregulated retail trading, managers were obliged to roster employees during non-standard or undesirable hours, many of which were family-unfriendly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022185611432385">Strazdins et al., 2006</xref>). Retail managers faced the particular problem that parents wanted leave from work at Christmas and during other school holiday periods to spend time with their children, but these were also the busiest times of the year for retail trading. Graeme, a store manager, discussed how the terms of the agreement (particularly clauses relating to reasonable overtime) enabled managers to increase employee hours over Christmas:<disp-quote>
<p>Of course at Christmas time … we do need to ask people to do extra and face extra and within our [Enterprise Bargaining Agreement] there’s clauses that do allow us to ask folk to do extra at Christmas or to change rosters at Christmas.</p></disp-quote>Graeme also said that senior managers had communicated to him their expectation that he would ‘maximise and leverage those … clauses at Christmas time’.</p>
<p>Rostering to cover extensive trading hours seemed to restrict the type of hours arrangements managers could offer employees. While managers were willing to grant leave in one-off emergency situations, they did not typically consider long-term restricted rostering arrangements to be viable. For Samantha, the business needs of retail work meant that individuals who could not work a wide range of hours on a regular basis were not considered suitable employees:<disp-quote>
<p>we have a business to run. … And if people can’t … work the hours then we try to work around it, but then I think at the end of the day they might not be the suitable people … if you came to me and you said no, I can only work 10 to 2, I would think well, we’d want people that were a bit more flexible than that.</p></disp-quote>In sum, retail managers apparently felt constrained in creating family-friendly arrangements because of the competitive pressures of the sector, as well as the regulatory environment.</p>
<p>The competitive dynamic in the public sector differs from that found in the retail sector, with a greater emphasis on operational requirements and the need to increase productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022185611432385">Earle, 2002</xref>). Under these conditions, public service managers apparently felt less constrained to consider the cost-effectiveness of offering family-friendly arrangements to their employees. Managers such as Matthew discussed the flexibility found in their role within the public service:<disp-quote>
<p>I am grateful that I have the capacity and the freedom to work the way I choose. I don’t flout rules and I’m sure that in terms of accountability and getting the work done that I’m required to do, they are getting reasonable value for the public’s money that goes to pay the staff salaries. But the way I do that is pretty flexible.</p></disp-quote>The public service agreements also restricted the ability of supervisors to create family-unfriendly working hours arrangements, and rostering appeared less frequently as a contentious issue in interviews. However, the departments participating in the study provided a range of services, including those where employees were dealing directly with clients, as with the retail sector. In these departments, public service managers also faced difficulties with rostering staff and deciding when employees could take leave. For example, Stuart, a public service manager in a unit with a client service focus, discussed the challenge of ensuring a sufficient level of staffing over the Christmas period:<disp-quote>
<p>they had about 12 staff … [in the unit] and [the previous manager] let eight of them go off at Christmas time for a month and when I came I said you can’t do that. We’ve still got to provide functions. And I would only let two people go off at any one time without my express approval and then it might go up a little bit from that … . I think we’ve got to be aware that we run a … service and you can’t just close down for a month, but people would see that as perhaps not being family-friendly.</p></disp-quote>On the other hand, the more extensive family-friendly provisions in the public service agreements enhanced the ability of managers to create family-friendly arrangements, and particularly to create arrangements falling outside the specific conditions of the agreement. Nicholas, a public service branch manager, discussed how flextime could be used to help employees take time off when they had run out of leave:<disp-quote>
<p>Another thing that you can do … as managers we’re given a fair amount of discretion, using flex leave … and we can use that to accommodate special things. So people have accumulated this entitlement to some time off. You can be generous in the way that you let them use that. Particularly if they’ve exhausted their leave you can help them.</p></disp-quote>However, budgetary constraints sometimes prevented employees from making use of family-friendly provisions. For instance, Nicholas discussed how employees had been unable to use these provisions in previous cases because there was insufficient funding:<disp-quote>
<p>I know that there are other parts of the department where people [are] … denied the time off or the financial support. Financial support is usually denied on the basis that there is no money for it so I think that gets traced back in this instance to me and the managers of the teams sitting down at the beginning of every financial or before the beginning of each financial year and saying the training and support needs for our staff are X and that’s going to require this much money, and we create a budget for it.</p></disp-quote>As occurred in the retail sector, public sector managers needed to weigh up performance and operating requirements to decide when employees could take leave, although that leave was an entitlement under the certified agreement.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0022185611432385"><title>Organizational Influences: The Role of Workplace Culture in Managerial Discretion</title>
<p>In both sectors, managers reported that their workplace’s culture determined how comfortable they felt in granting employee access to provisions. Organization culture can be defined as ‘the shared assumptions, beliefs and values regarding the extent to which an organisation supports and values the integration of employees’ work and family lives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022185611432385">Thompson et al., 1999</xref>: 394). In our study, ‘culture’ was defined in various ways by different managers, but, in general, was equated with the values of senior managers and those found in particular policy documents. Graeme explained the influence of senior retail staff on his decision- making processes: ‘the managers who I’ve reported to have always encouraged that there is an absolute need to make sure that work-life and particularly home-life commitments are factored into a lot of management decisions that we do make’.</p>
<p>Participants from one retail company described a cultural change in the organization that gave greater weight to family-friendliness, which was linked to a ‘changing of the guard’ in senior management. New executive managers had recently been hired to replace those who had been promoted up through the organization and were perceived to be rigid and hierarchical in their management style. In contrast, the new senior managers placed emphasis on diversity and ‘difference’ (in relation to work arrangements and the types of employees hired), and these values were conveyed to line managers. One retail manager, James, said that since senior executives started basing their appraisal of employees on their performance at work rather than the number of hours worked, he had started to do the same thing, giving him greater flexibility in dealing with staff. He confirmed that ‘as [senior management] changed, yes, I’m changing with it as well’. It would seem that this revaluing of family-friendliness in turn affected line managers’ weighting of the benefits associated with family-friendly policies.</p>
<p>Participants in both sectors discussed the role of executive managers, organizational policies and culture in influencing their decision-making in relation to family-friendliness. However, in some instances, there was a tension between the organizations’ valuing of family-friendliness and the business pressures faced by managers in each sector. As described earlier, retail managers had to balance employees’ leave requests against the need to have a sufficient number of staff to cover extensive trading hours. In public sector interviews, a strong theme was a ‘long hours’ culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022185611432385">Pocock, 2005</xref>), often modelled in the practices of senior managers. One public service manager, Philip, described the culture of his unit in these terms: ‘So the higher up you get I think there is an attitude that you are living to work, not you’re working to live, and certainly it’s demonstrated at the highest levels in this organisation. Workaholic attitudes prevail.’</p>
<p>Although public service policy documents stressed family-friendliness, these formal provisions seemed to be in conflict with the long hours culture prevalent in some departments. Other research suggests that a workplace culture equating long work hours with productivity can be a barrier to the effective implementation of family-friendly policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185611432385">Lewis, 1997</xref>). However, our study cannot make a direct link between organizational culture, line managers’ decision-making processes and the likelihood that they would approve employee requests for access to family-friendly conditions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185611432385">Bond, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022185611432385">Lewis, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185611432385">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022185611432385">Milliken et al., 2002</xref>). This is because our research is based on what managers said influenced their decision-making, rather than an analysis of what actually occurred in practice.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0022185611432385"><title>Individual Managers Determining Access to Family-Friendly Provisions</title>
<p>In both sectors, the use of formal family-friendly entitlements was subject to managerial approval; thus, managers played a crucial role in determining access to provisions, or at least in determining when employees could use them. For instance, although public servants were granted flextime provisions, Jacob, a manager at one of the public service agencies, described how he still controlled which days an employee could take off using this system:<disp-quote>
<p>the person wanted Thursday–Friday and Tuesday and I said no. They said but in the EBA [Enterprise Bargaining Agreement] you are allowed to have 5 days flex and … I said at the discretion of the manager, but I won’t give 3 days flex. Not on a long weekend, because someone will get sick on Tuesday or something … my team out here knows my rules, and I won’t pass more than 2 days because it’s not fair to the other workers.</p></disp-quote>Similarly, John, a human resource manager in the public service, described the role of managerial discretion in granting access to additional carers’ leave:<disp-quote>
<p>you’ve got the ability to utilise up to 5 days’ … carers’ leave. You also have the ability for 4 days’ special leave, on top of that, per year. … It’s discretionary, between you and your manager, if you can get those 4 days. But generally … we’re pretty flexible about that sort of stuff. People use it for moving days, or their child going to school first day, or the hot water system bursts so they have to go home day.</p></disp-quote>Although public service participants had broad formal family-friendly provisions, the operation of these entitlements still had to be approved by the manager. Public service managers acted as gatekeepers to conditions, and this was also the case in the retail sector. The clearest example of this was where management at a number of worksites within one retail brand had established a blanket rule prohibiting staff from taking leave during holidays and stocktaking periods, although no such rule was mentioned in the certified agreements. One store manager, Terry, outlined these arrangements as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>Even as a staff member there are blackout periods when you can’t take annual leave … we don’t like our staff to take annual leave at our stocktake because it’s an important time of year for the business and we don’t like our staff taking annual leave Christmas week because it’s a very important time for the business.</p></disp-quote>In both sectors, managerial discretion sometimes operated as a set of informal and unwritten rules overlaying legal provisions, determining when and how employees could access entitlements.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0022185611432385"><title>Making Exceptions to the Rule</title>
<p>Both public service and retail managers indicated that they were willing to make exceptions to their own informal rules, create informal arrangements or stretch the boundaries or formal provisions in particular cases. The interview data suggested that most managers were keen to support family-friendliness as best they could. However, implementing family-friendly arrangements required managers and other employees to work harder, potentially creating a strain on the workplace as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185611432385">Kelly and Kalev, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185611432385">Morehead, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022185611432385">Whittard and Burgess, 2007</xref>). For retail managers (and managers in some public service sectors), family-friendly arrangements meant extra time and effort juggling rosters to ensure sufficient staff coverage during hours of opening, and perhaps working on the till if the store was short-staffed. Patricia, a retail store manager, discussed the inconvenience that was sometimes associated with accommodating employees’ requests for time off:<disp-quote>
<p>Obviously we’ve got a limited amount of team members that we can call at the drop of a hat and they’ve got to be available too and they might have something on as well where they can’t come. So yes, it does make it difficult. … Yesterday we had a problem with one of the guys … being sick and everybody else was unavailable so the managers had to sit down at the … counter because there was no one else.</p></disp-quote>Public service managers also discussed the difficulties of ensuring that operational requirements were met when a number of employees were on leave, and managers in both sectors referred to the financial costs of employees using paid leave, hiring extra staff to cover employees who were away and providing equipment for working-at-home arrangements. Because of these costs, for many managers, a preliminary criterion for access was employees providing a good reason for wanting to access arrangements. There is little research on this issue, but one study establishes that organizations are more likely to grant requests for part-time work based on childcare responsibilities than for lifestyle reasons such as writing a novel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022185611432385">Klein et al., 2000</xref>). However, our research showed that a number of managers provided access for some care commitments but not others. In retail, family emergencies or significant life events (such as a wedding) immediately qualified employees to take leave at any time of the year. However, Christopher, a retail manager, described how he weighed up the importance of other family events against the needs of the business:</p><disp-quote>
<p>rosters are always a source of contention … it’s that fine line between … well no, you need to be here at our busiest times regardless, whether it’s … your kid’s birthday or Fathers’ Day … but I think where it really counts is when you need to be there. When children are sick … or the family is having problems. … So I feel personally that there’s things I’d say to someone, yes just go and there’s others I would say, well I can appreciate it’s a birthday party, but it’s a busy time for us.</p></disp-quote></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0022185611432385"><title>The Business Case for Access</title>
<p>Like managers in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185611432385">Bardoel, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185611432385">Dex and Scheibl, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022185611432385">Wise and Bond, 2003</xref>), both retail and public service managers were aware of the ‘business case’ for family-friendliness. Family-friendly work arrangements were thought to impact on the calibre of staff at the worksite as they operated as a tool to help recruit and retain high-quality workers. Staff quality was in turn linked to sales and company profitability, with good staff driving better sales figures. Managers in both sectors also thought that family-friendliness improved morale and meant that staff were focused on their work, leading to an increase in productivity. Tony, a retail manager, explained how it could benefit other staff members if an employee was granted family leave:<disp-quote>
<p>I would much rather have someone absent from the workplace if they have a legitimate reason for being absent … than have them here and not doing anything because then they become sort of the emotional sponge that everyone else is distracted and wants to be supporting and helping them.</p></disp-quote>This informal analysis of the costs and benefits of allowing access underpinned managerial discretion in both sectors. Managers were much more willing to grant access to employees who were seen as particularly valuable to the company, because the benefits of retaining these staff outweighed the costs to the organization. Frequently, an employee’s value to the organization was linked to their position or length of tenure in the company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022185611432385">Gray and Tudball, 2003</xref>), which in the retail sector was indicative of a higher degree of product knowledge or skills.</p>
<p>Many managers discussed the importance of ‘give and take’ relationships described in pre-existing research. Where employees were productive, worked overtime or were flexible about changed work hours, managers were more likely to grant them time off for care responsibilities at a later date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022185611432385">Dex and Scheibl, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022185611432385">Wise and Bond, 2003</xref>). It was apparent that managers in both sectors used family-friendly arrangements as a reward for good behaviour. One retail manager, Phillip, explicitly said that he allowed access to conditions for productive employees in order to show that they were valued. Managers also used family-friendliness as an inducement to encourage employees to work harder, as managers felt that if they treated employees ‘the right way’, they would get something extra back in return. Phillip thought that employees who were allowed to work part time in fact worked harder than many full-time employees and ‘delivered in spades’. By accommodating family-friendly requests, managers created employee loyalty to the organization and employees were more likely to ‘go the extra mile’ in future, because they valued the ability to access flexible work provisions.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-0022185611432385" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Differences in legal provisions and operational/economic forces influencing public service and retail managers created differences in how discretion operated in the public and retail sectors. In the public service sector, the base of comparatively regulated conditions assisted managers in creating family-friendly arrangements while, at the same time, constraining their ability to require employees to work during family-unfriendly times. On the other hand, the broad work hours provisions in the retail sector fostered family-unfriendly work conditions, especially with regard to non-standard work hours arrangements, or work during holiday periods. Additionally, the retail certified agreement lacked the additional family-friendly conditions found in the public service agreement, including provisions for childcare costs and vacation care programmes. In lieu of formal provisions, it would be difficult or impossible for retail managers to grant employees access to such arrangements because they lie outside of the scope of managers’ discretion. Our article is limited in that our methodology does not allow us to quantify the relative influence of factors such as regulation, workplace culture or industry pressures on managerial discretion; however, our research does suggest that regulation plays a significant role in the operation of managerial decision-making in relation to family-friendliness.</p>
<p>Managers in both sectors were keen to assist employees in balancing work and family commitments, and workplace culture and policy documents often stressed the importance of family-friendliness. However, managers also had to balance family-friendliness against the demands created by the particular operational requirements to be met in each sector. Retail managers were subject to pressures relating to business profit and loss, meaning that they had to create rostering arrangements covering non-standard (and therefore family-unfriendly) work hours. Public service managers were similarly influenced by budgetary constraints and the need to have a sufficient level of staff at their worksite; however, these pressures seemed less acute than those faced by retail managers. This was partly due to the nature of the work performed by the public servants in our study; most were not in roles involving direct interaction with clients. However, our findings also point to the importance of working-time regulations for ensuring family-friendly work environments; while deregulation of work hours is promoted as enabling flexible work arrangements, it may also constrain managers’ ability to create family-friendly work arrangements, particularly in relation to rostering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022185611432385">Strachan and Burgess, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022185611432385">Whittard and Burgess, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The certified agreements in our study left significant room for the operation of managerial discretion. In order to balance the competing demands of employee needs, business pressures and workplace cultural values, managers in both sectors created informal rules for determining employee access to family-friendly conditions. Like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022185611432385">Kelly and Kalev (2006)</xref>, we found that family-friendliness was used as a business tool linked to employee performance. Managers were willing to make exceptions to their informal rules (or create informal arrangements) for employees who were highly valued because of their skills, knowledge, productivity or ability to give a bit extra to the organization. Our analysis builds on previous studies by showing that this phenomenon occurs even when managers are implementing conditions that employees are legally entitled to access, not just managing unwritten conditions or those contained in workplace policies.</p>
<p>Managers in our study carefully considered how they granted employees access to family-friendly conditions and tried to achieve consistency between employees through the use of rules they devised. However, given the arguably increasingly dominance of employers in industrial relations (despite recent reforms), managers have significant scope to interpret values such as employee worth according to their own criteria and on a case-by-case basis. Particularly in the retail sector, what is considered a legitimate reason to take time off will be decided by managers, meaning that employees must disclose what may be very personal reasons for requesting time away from work, and have their reasons subject to evaluation by managers. There are certain safeguards in place for employee privacy; for example, when employees provide a medical certificate to access sick leave, such documents do not necessarily state what medical condition the employee has. Given that managers must balance the needs of the requesting employee against those of the business and other staff members, it is vital that employees provide reasons for accessing leave or altering their work schedule. However, it is also important that employees are treated consistently and fairly when asking managers for access to family-friendly conditions.</p>
<p>Australia is moving towards a more centralized industrial relations system under the Gillard Labor government. Our results show the important role of labour market regulation in ensuring access to family-friendly conditions, and have significant implications for ‘right to request’ regulations, as is found in the new National Employment Standards. Although the right to request flexible working arrangements is a positive step for family-friendliness in Australia, in light of our findings it is troubling that it leaves the criteria for management refusal (‘reasonable business grounds’) undefined and provides little guidance on how managers should assess employee requests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022185611432385">Sutherland, 2008</xref>). Our findings suggest that managers will grant requests on the basis of an employee’s worth to the organization, potentially creating inequalities in access between workers. Therefore, it will be critical for businesses and/or government to provide managers with guidance on how to implement the standard in order to ensure equality of access.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-0022185611432385" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Drawing on an analysis of legal documents and interview data with retail and public service managers, this article has analysed the relationship between regulation, managerial discretion and employee access to the family-friendly working conditions that they are legally entitled to. We found that regulation was one of a range of factors determining the operation of managerial discretion, including organizational culture, senior managers’ beliefs and philosophies, business needs and operational imperatives. Most importantly, managerial decisions about granting access to conditions were based on a cost–benefit analysis of an employee’s merit and worth to the organization, linking access to family-friendly working conditions to an employee’s ability to make a business case for access. It is apparent that in lieu of regulation or guidelines, managers will devise their own criteria for access to (legally provided) family-friendly conditions, with the potential to create inequalities in access between employees. In light of the introduction of ‘right to request’ legislation in Australia, it is important that managers are provided with guidance on how to determine employee requests for access to family-friendly work conditions.</p></sec>
