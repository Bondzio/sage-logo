<p>More than two-thirds of the world economy and more than 20 per cent of world trade comprises of services. Yet though international trade in goods is an integral part of any undergraduate or graduate course in economics anywhere in the world, international trade in services is rarely considered to be good enough to be included. There are two reasons for this. First, unlike goods trade (that gifted to the economic community a beautiful idea called ‘comparative advantage’), service trade does not appear to offer new theoretical insights that are profound enough to make them fundamental to the understanding of the subject. Second, data on service trade is still so scant, sporadic and noisy that it is hard to do much beyond merely describing it. This book is one of those rare ones that easily shrugs off these arguments of the doubters and assembles together a rigorous representation of trade in services—theoretical as well as empirical.</p>
<p>The book begins with a series of theoretical models of trade in services. The point that emerges is that trade in services can and should be considered in tandem with trade in goods. In the modern era of production networking, offshoring and outsourcing, goods and service trade complement each other. The complementarily in relationship even stretches beyond the obvious. The theoretical literature on trade in services benefits from the immense wisdom of the theoretical literature on trade in goods. This wisdom provides a solid platform for modelling trade in services. This is exploited thoroughly by the models presented in the book and interesting conclusions emerge on the interaction between the two types of trade and their policies.</p>
<p>The rest of the book is a collection of empirical work on different aspects of services trade. Given the title of the book, India expectedly hogs much of the lime light. Though there is no separate categorization for this part, it is possible to classify the chapters into three categories. The first of these consists of a series of chapters on different types of service trade. These chapters mostly consist of descriptive analysis of secondary data. However, primary data (on health services in India) is also used. Along with health, trade in higher education and transportation services in India are considered and analyzed. There are also chapters on overall trends in India as well as in the rest of the world. Major findings include the high growth of communication services both in terms of volume and capability to attract foreign direct investment. In terms of exports, financial services have progressed quickly. Over time exports of travel services have come down, whereas that of computer and information services as well as financial services and personal cultural and recreational services have gained importance over the years. This change is also reflected in the competitiveness figures.</p>
<p>The second category of chapters is on trade policy (especially trade barriers) and its impact on trade in services. Here the authors construct an index which they name ‘The Service Trade Facilitation Index’ (STFI) mainly on the basis of measures that proxy for infrastructure availability. Of the 33 countries considered, Scandinavian countries are ranked high in terms of this Index. India is ranked last but one (before Bangladesh). The authors therefore conclude that like many other sectors of the Indian economy, reform in trade facilitation is the need of the day.</p>
<p>The third category of chapters—those on the role of service sector in the economic development of the nation is the most interesting. Two questions are posed and answered: Does service export reduce poverty? And how can service export be made to work for the poor? The answers are instructive for policy purposes: Being mainly skilled labour intensive the role of the service exports in reducing poverty has been marginal and its role in reducing inequality has been negative. Given the preponderance of the service sector in India, this is a cause for concern to policy-makers. Service sector-led growth in India appears to be perpetuating India’s inequality. Policy-makers, please take note.</p>
<p>Combining all three types of chapters, one can say that the book captures a wide range of aspects related to service trade. Given this width, it is expected to appeal to a wide range of readers from policy-makers and researchers to general readers. This would go a long way in making this important area more accessible than it currently is.</p>
<p>The book however suffers from poor copy-editing. Reading the book one gets the impression that compiling it was a hurried exercise—a collection of studies that lack an integrated approach. For instance, there is no link between the theories laid out in Chapter 2 and the later empirical analysis. Also cross references among chapters is relatively rare, except in the introductory paragraphs of the chapters. Finally, important service sectors in India like IT and business services have been left out. Data availability is possibly the main reason for their absence. However, after reading the book one has the feeling that they could still have been included—just for the sake of completeness.</p>
<p>But these are minor problems in an otherwise worthy endeavour. Collecting and collating services trade data is immensely difficult. To initiate a book length discussion on service trade is thus a huge challenge. The authors should be congratulated for successfully undertaking this difficult task. Over and above what has been written in the introductory part of this review on the absence of trade in services in economics classes, a further reason for the relative neglect of service trade in international economics courses is a distinct lack of analytically rigorous books on the subject and the topic’s usual absence in the standard texts on international economics. This book bridges this gap eminently in the Indian context. The book can be used by instructors both at the advanced undergraduate and graduate levels. Hopefully, the book will bring services trade into the mainstream of international economics education.</p>
