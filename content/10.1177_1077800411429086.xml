<abstract>
<p>In this article, the authors provide a context for, and an introduction to, the contributions in this special issue on sons and fathers. After alluding to the rich heritage of literature on sons and fathers, the authors propose three themes that run
through this collection: the continuing significance of son-father relationships, the act of writing such relationships into being, and the “clunky intimacy” conveyed. They follow this with an outline of the lines of inquiry contained within each of the subsequent articles, and conclude by drawing attention to the absences left within and by this issue.</p>

<p>There is something about sons and fathers. We live and write surrounded by a rich classical, literary, and academic tradition of sons writing about fathers—Aeschylus’s <italic>Oresteia</italic> and <italic>Odysseus</italic> and <italic>Telemachus</italic>; Dickens’ <italic>Dombey and Son</italic>, Gosse’s <italic>Father and Son</italic>, Butler’s <italic>The Way of All Flesh</italic>, Mortimer’s <italic>A Voyage Round My Father</italic>, Morrison’s <italic>And When Did You Last See Your Father</italic>, Turgenev’s <italic>Fathers and Sons</italic>, Roth’s <italic>Patrimony</italic>, Cooper’s <italic>The Bill From My Father</italic>, Goodall’s <italic>A Need to Know</italic>—and more. The essays in this collection seek further to contribute to our understanding of the dynamics between sons and fathers. The authors variously attend to the ways in which fathers accompany us through our lives—in person, memory, and print; in interpersonal distance and intimacy; in love and hate, respect and fear, doubt and (mis)understanding, certainty and flux; and in life and death. They consider, whether implicitly or explicitly, the role of this relationship in their lives and in their construction of themselves as—among other roles—men, sons, lovers, partners, teachers, scholars, and, for some, fathers themselves.</p>
<p>While one joy of the collection lies in the unique textures and contours of each essay, three interrelated themes emerge across all of the contributions. First, it strikes us, perhaps obviously, how father–son relationships remain meaningful, both through and beyond life. The relationships here are never presented as easy but rather as ones that are complicated and painful, and that matter. From here-and-now, everyday, momentary encounters until after death, the father–son relationship is offered as one that grows, scars, inspires, and informs. Even in absence, the father remains present, embodied in ideas about how to be a man, by desires about wishing to have said or done differently and by changing conceptualizations of the father over time. One might infer that there is a reluctance, or an inability, to give up on the relationship, whatever distress attends its continuing experience.</p>
<p>Second, we notice how stories write sons, fathers, and son–father relationships into being. There is a sense in these pieces of the <italic>act</italic> of writing. Stories constitute the relationships, as new framings, apologies, confusions, and uncertainties about what we want(ed) from fathers emerge through the process of writing.</p>
<p>A third theme is how, in some of the essays, we see remnants of a “clunky intimacy,” with sons approaching fathers but fathers pushing sons away and fathers reaching out to sons but sons seeking distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077800411429086">Pelias, 2002</xref>). This clunky intimacy may emerge through death, disregard, or avoidance or might stem from conflicting ideas of masculinity and heterosexuality, dominance and control, strength and abuse, intimacy and memory.</p>
<p>While these general themes move in and through the essays, we wish to draw readers’ attention to each contribution.</p>
<p>In a flow across nations, races, religions, and cultures, Alexander, Moreira, and Kumar provide, edgy, direct, unsentimental co-respondence concerning their fathers and fathering. Berry documents his continuing relationship with his father, particularly his father’s addiction and the impact of the addiction upon Berry and his mother, and Berry’s sense of himself as a “son in recovery.”</p>
<p>Pelias offers an account of the everyday reminders, and their attendant, contrasting associations, of his (deceased) father and his (estranged) son. In reengaging with a photograph of his father, first seen only after his father had died, Gale examines shifting subjectivity, encountering the changing father and the fluid self as he reflects on seeing his father in an image. Patti uses the myths of the hero and the trickster to frame a series of stories and reflections on the father he lost as a boy. Wyatt’s counseling work with a man who recently lost his father prompts the author to reflect upon his own father and the gaps in his previous writing about him. He weaves the two together, his client and his father, working at the longing.</p>
<p>Bochner offers a compelling and emotionally charged essay that illustrates how a father can still be present more than two decades after death, and Sparkes structures his essay around the material, physical “bits and pieces” of his father’s and his son’s lives. Collins takes us on a recent journey with his disabled photographer father, a journey that draws him—and us—into their bodies and into questions of ownership and appropriation. A box of books given by the author to his father provides the thread of Denzin’s essay, a thread between homes, between years, and between Denzin, his father, and his mother.</p>
<p>Adams describes a myriad of tender, raw episodes of he and his father failing to connect; however, something propels them, despite the evidence, to keep trying. Poulos offers a poignant, hopeful tale of how writing about his father provides promise of a different way of relating, one characterized by hesitancy and faltering, and Goodall reenters the museum of his (deceased) father’s (secret) lives, looking for the significance in the artifacts he (re-)discovers and reflecting on the gain and the cost of such a search.</p>
<p>Before we conclude, we want to mention three gaps in this collection. First, the collection focuses only on sons and fathers. There is much that could be written within the autoethnographic, critical traditions about a range of other parent–child relationships, for example, sons and mothers, fathers and daughters, daughters and mothers, and the like. There is a rich seam of writing and exploration that could inquire into, elucidate, and disrupt the cultural ideas about such relationships. Second, we do not include any writings from sons who do not know their fathers or who do not want or perceive any connection to their fathers. Third, we are missing, from our original set of authors, a contribution from the late John T. Warren, who passed away in April 2011. We hold him in mind as we write, and we dedicate this collection to our respected friend and colleague.</p>
<p>The two of us, Tony and Jonathan, found each other in 2007 at the International Congress of Qualitative Inquiry each of us having written and presented about our fathers, Tony about his relationship with his then-estranged father, Jonathan about his relationship with his late, becoming-absent father. Correspondence and further Congresses followed, where we developed the idea for gathering others’ writing about sons and fathers, the most recent manifestation being this collection, which we are delighted and privileged to introduce. We hope that you find the essays enjoyable and provocative.</p>
