<title>Lactic Acidosis</title>
<p>A 70-year-old male developed vomiting, agitation, confusion, and abdominal pain 3 hours after ingesting an unknown amount of metformin in a suicide attempt. No concurrent medications were reported. Heart rate was 100 beats per minute, blood pressure 150/80 mm Hg, and respiratory rate 20. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed profound lactic acidosis with pH 6.93, P<sc>co</sc><sub>2</sub> 2.1 kPa, P<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> 30.4 kPa mmol/L, bicarbonate 3 mmol/L, base excess −27.7 mmol/L, and lactate 20.0 mmol/L. Acute kidney injury (serum creatinine 215 µmol/L) and anuria was also present. Treatment included admission to the intensive care unit and initiation of continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration with 8.4% sodium bicarbonate. On initiation of hemofiltration, atrial fibrillation with cardiovascular compromise developed and was treated with amiodarone and vasopressor support. Lactic acidosis responded to hemofiltration and after 48 hours, laboratory values improved to pH 7.37, Pco<sub>2</sub> 4.8 kPa, P<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub> 12.4 kPa, bicarbonate 21 mmol/L, base excess −3.9 mmol/L, creatinine 138 µmol/L, and lactate 4.0 mmol/L. The patient refused further renal support, subsequently developed a hospital-acquired pneumonia and expired after refusing active treatment.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the patient’s lactic acidosis was induced by metformin with no other contributing factors. They determined that renal replacement therapy with 8.4% sodium bicarbonate quickly reversed the lactic acidosis. The proposed mechanism for reversal of metformin-induced lactic acidosis with high lactate and low pH was removal of metformin, which impairs hepatocyte mitochondrial function.</p>

<title>Buspirone, Linezolid No. 255</title>
<sec id="section4-0069477012465251">
<title>Drug Interaction: Serotonin Syndrome</title>
<p>A 28-year-old male developed hyperthermia, hypertension, and tachycardia after receiving linezolid for methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and buspirone for shivering as part of a traumatic brain injury protocol. There was no significant past medical history, and no medications were being taken prior to admission. Initial admission occurred due to motor vehicle accident with traumatic brain injury. The traumatic brain injury protocol, which included therapeutic cooling, was implemented, and on day 6 of admission, urine and blood cultures were positive. Initial therapy with vancomycin was switched to linezolid due to apparent acute renal failure (serum creatinine increase from 0.79 to 2.74 mg/dL). On hospital day 12 (day 5 of linezolid therapy), bladder temperature began to rise (from 36°C to 37°C) at which time 1 dose of meperidine was given to reduce shivering and was followed by high-dose buspirone for maintenance. By hospital day 14, bladder temperature reached a maximum of 40.7°C, heart rate reached more than 135 beats per minute, and systolic blood pressure reached more than 180 mm Hg. At this time, linezolid was changed to daptomycin and buspirone was subsequently discontinued. Within 24 hours of buspirone discontinuation, hyperthermia, tachycardia, and hypertension resolved. On hospital day 22, care was withdrawn and the patient expired.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that there was a probable relationship between the patient’s symptoms and coadministration of buspirone and linezolid. They claimed that some symptoms of serotonin syndrome may have been masked by critical condition and therapeutic cooling. The proposed mechanism of interaction was linezolid’s action as a reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor with buspirone’s serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and moderate dopamine agonistic effects, leading to increased endogenous serotonin and dopamine.</p>

<title>Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477012465251">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 78-year-old male patient developed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage approximately 2 months after starting dabigatran therapy (220 mg daily) for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial flutter and fibrillation. No other medications, including other anticoagulants, were detailed. The patient was hospitalized with hemoptysis and dyspnea. A chest x-ray and computed tomography revealed bilateral aveolar infiltration. Coagulation tests demonstrated a prothrombin time of 97.5 seconds and an international normalized ratio of 1.42. Treatment included fresh frozen plasma and mechanical ventilation. Repeat chest studies demonstrated improvement of the bilateral aveolar infiltration after 35 days.</p>
<p>The authors noted that this is the first case report of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage associated with dabigatran therapy without any additional anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy.</p>

<title>Spontaneous Ejaculation</title>
<p>Three cases of spontaneous ejaculation associated with the administration of noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors are described. These reports were received by the spontaneous adverse drug reaction reporting system in the Netherlands (The Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb) between January 1996 and December 2011.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 1</italic>. A 40-year-old male patient developed spontaneous ejaculations within 3 weeks after staring atomoxetine therapy. The episodes occurred after micturition urgency up to 8 times a day without sexual arousal. Concurrent medications were not detailed. Similar symptoms occurred with the administration of dexamphetamine but reversed when the drug was discontinued. Treatment in this case, withdrawal of atomoxetine therapy, resulted in reversal of symptoms. A time frame for recovery was not provided.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 2</italic>. A 25-year-old male patient developed spontaneous ejaculations within an unidentified time period after staring methylphenidate therapy. The episodes occurred after micturition without sexual arousal and were accompanied by testicular pain. Concurrent medications were not detailed. Similar symptoms occurred with the administration of atomoxetine but reversed when the drug was discontinued. After 2 years, the patient continues to use methylphenidate in the long-acting and shorter-acting formulations, which are still associated with spontaneous ejaculations, but at a less frequent incidence.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 3</italic>. A 60-year-old male patient developed spontaneous ejaculations within a day after staring venlafaxine therapy. The episodes occurred 1 to 2 times a week without sexual arousal and increased in frequency when the dose of the drug was increased (from 225 to 375 mg). Reports on treatment and outcome were not described.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that these patients experienced spontaneous ejaculations related to noradrenergic therapy. An exact mechanism of action is not known, but the authors proposed that the effect may be mediated by the reuptake inhibition of norepinephrine. They cautioned clinicians to be aware of this potential effect.</p>

<title>FDA Safety Alert: Increased Risk of Heart Failure</title>
<p>On September 19, 2012, the US FDA announced the possible increased risk of heart failure associated with the use of pramipexole based on data from a recent pooled analysis of randomized clinical trials. In addition, the FDA also evaluated 2 epidemiologic studies that suggested new onset heart failure with the drug. Study limitations make it difficult to determine causality, and the FDA will continue to work with the manufacturer to clarify further data.</p>

<title>Influenza Vaccination, Warfarin No. 259</title>
<sec id="section12-0069477012465251">
<title>Drug Interaction: Effect on International Normalized Ratio</title>
<p>A systematic literature evaluation was performed to assess the validity and clinical significance of an association between receipt of the seasonal influenza vaccination and effect of warfarin anticoagulation response. Seven studies evaluating patients considered stable on warfarin therapy were reviewed. In 5 studies, no significant change in international normalized ratio was observed after vaccination. In 1 prospective case-controlled study with 90 subjects, the group receiving influenza vaccine experienced a mean increase in international normalized ratio of 0.56 from baseline (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .00005). The final study, a prospective case-controlled trial, found no difference in mean international normalized ratio prior to or following vaccination. However, in a subgroup analysis of subjects aged 70 years and older, the international normalized ratio remained below therapeutic range for a significantly longer time period following immunization. No adverse bleeding events were reported in 3 of the 7 studies. The events that were reported were considered minor and not always associated with an elevated international normalized ratio. Heterogeneity existed with regard to route of vaccine administration and time to follow-up.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that their review did not indicate a consistent, clinically relevant effect of influenza vaccination on international normalized ratio of patients on chronic warfarin therapy. They claimed that variations in international normalized ratio following vaccination were likely attributable to other factors.</p>

<title>Drug Interaction: Augmentation of Fluvoxamine in Skin Picking Disorder</title>
<p>A 59-year-old female experienced improvement in symptoms of skin picking disorder after switching therapy from fluvoxamine (300 mg/d) plus oxcarbazepine (600 mg/d) to fluvoxamine plus haloperidol (0.7 mg/d). Skin picking associated with strong urges and relief following picking was present for 3 years. Mental status exam did not reveal mood, psychotic, or other axis I disorders. Therapy was initiated with fluvoxamine (300 mg daily) and oxcarbazepine (600 mg daily). This combination resulted in decreased urges to skin pick and improved extent of lesions; however, it did not completely eliminate symptoms and considerable drowsiness occurred. Oxcarbazepine therapy was then replaced with haloperidol (0.7 mg daily). At a 10-week follow-up appointment, symptoms were completely relieved and the tendency to skin pick was overcome.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the patient experienced an almost complete recovery of symptoms after oxcarbazepine was discontinued and haloperidol was added to fluvoxamine therapy for skin picking disorder. The proposed mechanism of efficacy was antidopaminergic action of haloperidol.</p>

<title>Review of Reported Incidents Over 6 Years</title>
<p>A review of all medication incidents reported to the National Reporting and Learning System, developed by the National Health System in England, was performed to summarize medication practice activities and provide information for promoting the safe use of medications. Of 5 437 999 total Patient Safety Incidents reported from 2005 to 2012, 526 186 were medication incidents (9.68%). There was a significant increase, approximately 0.5% each year, of medication incidents reported relative to total Patient Safety Incidents (<italic>r<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.98, β = 0.55 [0.44-0.66]). The acute sector reported the majority of medication incidents (75%). An extraction of data from May 2011 indicated that 86 821 (16%) of the reported incidents had outcomes of actual patient harm and only 822 (0.15%) resulted in serious harm or death. The stages of the medicine use process at which errors occurred most frequently included administration incidents (50%) and prescribing incidents (18%). The most common categories of error reported included omissions or delays in medication (16%) and wrong dose (15%). The unsafe use of 13 medications made up 46% of all incident reports associated with death and severe harm and included opioids (10.83%), antibiotics (5.84%), warfarin (5.6%), low-molecular-weight heparin (5.6%), and insulin (5.6%).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that a national reporting system can be used to identify medications most frequently associated with clinical outcomes of death and severe harm and that this information can be used to minimize preventable harms from medication incidents.</p>

<title>Pulmonary Toxicity</title>
<p>A 56-year-old male patient developed progressive dyspnea on exertion, chest tightness, and palpitations after receiving 5 cycles of gemcitabine (cumulative dose = 32.300 mg) for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. The regimen consisted of gemcitabine or placebo on days 1 through 21 out of a 28-day cycle, which were repeated every 4 weeks. On physical examination, the oxygen saturation on room air by pulse oximetry was 82% to 84%. A computed tomography of the chest revealed mild to moderate emphysema (previously identified on baseline), and the new appearance of diffuse groundglass opacities in the bilateral lower lobes. Screenings for infectious etiologies were negative. Treatment included high-dose corticosteroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics (eg, azithromycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, vancomycin, tobramycin, and oseltamivir). Antimicrobials were discontinued as infectious etiologies were ruled out. During the first 5 days of hospitalization, the patient required increasing oxygen supplementation, which was continued n home discharge (4 L supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula). At 6 weeks postdischarge, the patient completed a slow steroid taper and no longer required supplemental oxygen.</p>

<title>Increased Risk in Elderly Taking Polypharmacy</title>
<p>In a retrospective review of patient hospital records, data from 2412 inpatients (University of Tokyo Hospital) aged 65 years and older between 1995 and 2010 were reviewed for the incidence and factors relating to adverse drug reactions. Adverse drug reactions were defined as unintended or undesired harmful effects presumably caused by drugs. The mean age of the patient group was 78.7 years, and males comprised 51.3% of the group. The number of prescribed medications per patient was 6.6, with adverse drug reactions observed in 10.5% of the patients. Patients with adverse drug reactions were taking significantly more medications than those without adverse drug reactions (7.6 vs 6.5; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). When adverse drug reactions were analyzed by the number of drugs taken, the odds ratio was significantly higher in the groups taking 6 medications or more. The odds ratio for developing an adverse drug reaction in patients taking 6 to 7, 8 to 9, and more than 10 medications was 2.41, 2.07, and 2.59, respectively.</p>
<p>In this retrospective study of elderly inpatients, the authors identified the cutoff number of drugs for screening geriatric patients at high risk for adverse drug reactions. They concluded that inpatients taking 6 or more medications were at risk of experiencing an adverse drug reaction.</p>

<title>Opioid Overdose, Coma, Severe Sunburn Wounds</title>
<p>A 77-year-old female patient developed signs of opioid overdose while using a fentanyl transdermal patch (50 µg/h), which received sun exposure. Approximately 6 hours after sunning herself, she was found unconscious and was hospitalized with respiratory depression, miosis, and a Glasgow Coma Score of 3/15. At the time of admission, her core body temperature was 41°C. Treatment included 2 doses of naloxone (dose not specified), which improved the Glasgow Coma Score to 5/15. Additional treatment included intravenous acetaminophen. Supportive care in the intensive care unit included intubation and mechanical ventilation. Additional symptoms included widespread erythema over the body with blistering on the abdomen and lower limbs. Additional supportive care included intravenous fluids. The patient made a gradual recovery and was discharged 7 days later with no further sequelae. Further management of the burn wounds occurred postdischarge via a burn specialist, who noted that there were mixed-depth burns, including full-thickness areas on her abdomen, thighs, and lower legs. Treatment included silver sulfadiazone cream and surgical debridement of necrotic areas. All wounds eventually healed.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient experienced serious burns and became comatose after sun exposure while receiving treatment with a fentanyl patch. They proposed that heat increased the skin permeability, which increased the rate of drug delivery from the patch. The authors suggested that patients should be counseled on appropriate care and management of patch therapy, including instructions on heat application and sun exposure.</p>

<title>Risk of Fractures (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477012465251">*</xref>)</title>
<p>In a Danish national cohort study, 77 503 patients who were prescribed clopidogrel during 1996 to 2008 were matched to 3 controls (n = 232 510) who were not prescribed the drug. The study end-point was the incidence of any fracture. The mean age was 65.7 years in both groups. On analysis, clopidogrel was associated with both an increased overall risk of fractures and an increased risk of osteoporotic fractures, especially in individuals receiving treatment more than 1 year. In patients receiving lower doses, there was a lower risk than the nonusers. There was a small but significant difference in the occurrence of previous fractures between the groups (21.6% vs 20.6%; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). When the analysis was adjusted for this difference, the risk for fractures remained. For those taking low doses, less than 0.10 of the defined daily dose, the hazard ratio was 0.97 for any fracture, 0.86 for a hip fracture, 0.95 for a forearm fracture, and 1.13 for a spine fracture. For those taking 0.10 to 0.39 defined daily dose of clopidgrel, the hazard ratio was 1.02, 1.00, 0.93, and 0.96, respectively. For those taking 0.4 to 0.99 defined daily dose of clopidgrel, the hazard ratio was 1.33, 1.41, 1.28, and 1.52, respectively. For those taking at least 1 defined daily dose of clopidgrel, the hazard ratio was 1.38, 1.63, 1.30, and 1.46, respectively. When the data were stratified by gender, the fracture risk was increased by clopidogrel from low doses (0.10 to 0.39 defined daily dose) in women for all fractures, but increased in men at higher doses. The hazard ratio was also increased in users of aspirin and dipyridamole.</p>
<p>The authors concluded, based on the study data, that clopidogrel is associated with an increased risk of all fractures when compared with control data. The authors noted that this is the first report that demonstrates the risk of fractures with the use of clopidogrel. The exact mechanism of this side effect is not established but may be related to the P2Y receptor inhibition.</p>

<title>Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Patients</title>
<p>In an observational study of 123 pediatric intensive care unit inpatients between May and June 2009, the incidence and characteristics of adverse drug reactions was determined. Of the study patients, a total of 25 patients experienced at least 1 adverse drug reaction with a total of 45 adverse drug reactions reported. The mean age was 34 months, and 14 of these patients were male. The mean adverse drug reaction rate/child was 1.8, and the incidence rate per 100 children/day was 10.4. A total of 12 reactions were considered serious, and 1 death resulted. Although 66 drugs were involved, the most common frequent drug classes involved included anticonvulsants and diuretics. The drug reactions most frequently affected included the hematological and metabolic systems. Of the reactions noted, 61% were considered preventable.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that adverse drug reactions are a frequent complication of care for intensive care unit pediatric patients. They recommend the development of preventive strategies to influence quality of care.</p>

<title>Anaphylaxis</title>
<p>Two cases of anaphylaxis related to fentanyl are described.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 1</italic>. A 31-year-old female inpatient developed brief episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (5-10 beats per episode) within 10 minutes after induction of anesthesia for an appendectomy. Medications infused preoperatively included intravenous propofol (80 mg), preservative-free lidocaine (40 mg), fentanyl citrate (100 µg), and midazolam (0.5 mg). After mask ventilation was confirmed, vercuronium (6 mg) was also administered intravenously. Antiemetics were also administered, including intravenous metoclopramide (10 mg) and ondansetron (4 mg). A single dose of intravenous antibiotic was administered 30 minutes before arriving in the operating room. Esmolol (20 mg) was administered and the tachycardia became sinus tachycardia. However, at this time, a total body rash was noticed and the patient’s blood pressure dropped to 60/30 mm Hg. Anaphylaxis reaction was suspected. Treatment included intravenous fluids, ephedrine (2-6 mg doses), which did not result in response. A dose of phenylephrine (200 µg) was administered, which slightly improved her blood pressure. Epinephrine (20 µg) was administered in intermittent incremental doses. The patient was eventually transferred to intensive care treatment, where an epinephrine infusion was initiated to maintain a systolic blood pressure more than 90 mm Hg. Additional intravenous medications in this area included hydrocortisone (200 mg), diphenhydramine (50 mg), and ranitidine (20 mg). A chest x-ray revealed bilateral infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema. The patient eventually recovered and was discharged. Postdischarge, an allergic screening, including scratch and intradermal testing, was performed, which resulted in negative tests for midazolam, propofol, rocuronium, and cisatracurium. Positive reactions were observed for fentanyl and succinylcholine. She was advised to avoid fentanyl and all paralytic agents. During another surgery approximately 1 month later, the patient received intravenous premedication with midazolam (1 mg), hyperbaric bupivacaine with clonidine (15 µg), and cefuroxime (1 g) without incident. Additional medications included dexmedetomidine (0.2 µg/kg/h), dexamethasone (4 mg), metoclopramide (10 mg), and ondansetron (4 mg). The patient had an uneventful course postoperatively and was discharged without event on the second postoperative day.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 2</italic>. A 26-year-old male patient developed desaturated oxygen parameters accompanied by an increase in heart rate and blood pressure approximately 5 minutes after the administration of intraoperative intravenous medications, including midazolam (1 mg) and fentanyl citrate (50 µg). Anesthesia included 5% hyperbaric bupivacaine with clonidine (15 µg) as adjuvant. Additional symptoms included generalized body pruritus, agitation, restlessness, tachypnea (40 breaths/minute), and cyanotic discoloration of the lips and face. The surgery to repair a fractured leg was canceled and treatment was initiated with diphenhydramine (20 mg), dexamethasone (8 mg), hydrocortisone (100 mg), and betaprolol (5 mg) every 10 minutes in incremental doses. After 30 minutes of conservative management, the patient began to stabilize and was transferred to the intensive care unit. The same surgery was performed the next day without fentanyl, resulting in no adverse events. The patient was premedicated with intravenous ranitidine (50 mg) and glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg), morphine (5 mg), propofol (100 mg), and vecuronium (6 mg).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that these patients experienced anaphylactic reactions related to fentanyl administration. They noted that the administration of multiple medications during surgery make it difficult to assess for causality.</p>
