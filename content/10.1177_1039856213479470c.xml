<p>With the passing of Isla Lonie in November last year the College has lost one of its pioneers.</p>
<p>Of Irish heritage, Isla Ellen Frew was born and grew up in Christchurch, New Zealand. When she decided to study medicine, Isla met with considerable parental resistance: young ladies of that generation, if they ursued any career at all, usually chose either nursing or teaching. With characteristic determination, Isla prevailed and in 1953 she was one of just 10 women accepted into medicine at the University of Otago, Dunedin.</p>
<p>As an undergraduate, Isla relished the academic challenges of medicine but she and class mate, David Lonie, also found time for romance and for weekend adventures on his Vespa. Theirs was a meeting of kindred spirits and led to a remarkable and enduring partnership, one in which the challenges of work, study and family life were always shared equally.</p>
<p>Graduating in 1960, and already intent on careers in psychiatry, Isla and David worked first in Gisborne and then moved to New South Wales where they had been offered a rural posting at Morisset, a large mental hospital, typical of that era. With a young family, this suited them very well. The College had recently introduced a DPM and Isla was always very proud that she was one of the earliest successful candidates. The College DPM became a collectors’ item when it was replaced a few years later by the College Membership.</p>
<p>Although David moved on to child and adolescent psychiatry and Isla focused more on adult psychotherapy, they sustained a remarkable harmony in their professional lives. Both were inspired by Winnicott and the object relations theorists, and over time this interest evolved easily into the burgeoning field of attachment theory and led to their efforts to form an Australian branch of the World Association of Infant Psychiatry and Allied Disciplines. With a group of colleagues they then developed this into an Australian Association for Infant Mental Health; Isla served as Chair of the NSW Branch and then as President of that Association from 1997–1999.</p>
<p>In 1976 the Lonies were part of a small multidisciplinary group that established the NSW Institute of Psychotherapy, later to become the Institute of Psychodynamic Psychotherapy. During the eighties, Isla served as President for six years and worked to develop the curriculum and the training program and to bring together various state organisations to form a national and then a bi-national Psychotherapy Association, in which she also served as President from 1988–1990.</p>
<p>Both Isla and David played prominent roles in the development of the College and, particularly, in establishing training. Through the nineties, Isla served on the NSW Branch Committee, as a Federal Councillor, and on both the Clinical Practice Advisory Committee and the Workforce Committee, but her major contribution was in psychotherapy training. Isla was passionately committed to ensuring the place of psychotherapy in mainstream psychiatry; she was one of the driving forces in establishing the Section of Psychotherapy and served as Chair during 1998–2000. She was greatly disappointed when the Section was not awarded faculty status. With the advent of a new model of training, Isla almost single-handedly developed the program of Advanced Training in the Psychotherapies in NSW and was the first Director of Training from 1999–2003.</p>
<p>As supervisor, lecturer and mentor, Isla inspired several generations of College trainees. She was a regular presenter and participant at College Congresses and contributed a number of publications to the College Journal and elsewhere. Without doubt she was one of the shining lights in psychiatric psychotherapy, particularly during the seventies and eighties, when psychotherapy was enjoying its golden age in psychiatry. For all of this contribution Isla was duly recognised in 2003 with a College citation; fittingly this was awarded to her in Christchurch.</p>
<p>The depth and breadth of Isla’s mastery of psychoanalytic theory was matched by a similar compass in literature, music and the arts. Her unique talent was in bringing the arts into psychotherapy; her many publications and conference presentations were rich with metaphors referring to the arts. Her talents and interests were as diverse as they were remarkable, from playwriting to a flair for mathematics; thus, beginning in the 1980s, Isla published a number of articles that explored borderline personality disorder from an object relations and a self-psychology perspective, later in terms of trauma and attachment, and by the early nineties she was working on expanding that view to include insights she was gaining from her study of chaos theory.</p>
<p>Isla was active within the College in every sense; her home was always open to interstate or overseas colleagues and she regularly hosted collegial social events. These would involve catering herself, of course. But Isla was also likely to decide – on the day – that she would run up some new curtains, paint the dining room or lay bricks in the garden. This same vigour and creativity infused her family life and she maintained a prodigious output of exquisite handcrafts for her children and grandchildren. Her talents and energies did indeed seem boundless.</p>
<p>Always the political activist, Isla was just as dedicated and passionate about safeguarding the future of the environment as she was about ensuring the future of psychotherapy in psychiatry. This was generativity and integrity in the true Eriksonian sense; Isla cared for and guided several generations; she was deeply concerned with the future of the environment and what kind of world we will pass on; her life was indeed one of productivity and accomplishment.</p>
