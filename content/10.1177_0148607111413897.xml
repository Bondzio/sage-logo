<abstract>
<p><italic>Background:</italic> The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) has published recommendations in regards to anticoagulant (AC) and antiplatelet (AP) therapy management during endoscopic procedures. So far, no study has assessed either ASGE recommendation compliance during percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement or procedure-associated complication rates as related to the observance of these recommendations. The aims of this study were to compare the incidence and type of complications during PEG placement in patients receiving or not receiving AC and/or AP therapy and to determine the compliance with ASGE’s AC and AP management guidelines. <italic>Methods</italic>: Medical files of patients who underwent PEG placement from January 2004 to December 2008 were reviewed. Clinical and procedure-related data were recorded. Patients were separated into 1 of 2 groups: patients under AP and/or AC therapy prior to PEG placement (n = 51) and a control group of patients (n = 40) not receiving any AP and/or AC treatment at least 6 months prior to the procedure. <italic>Results:</italic> A total of 91 patients (51 cases) were included. Groups were comparable in demographics and clinical characteristics. No differences in the frequency and type of complications were found between groups. ASGE’s recommendations were not followed in any of these patients. <italic>Conclusions</italic>: Overall PEG placement complication rate was 13.7%. AP therapy may be safely discontinued closer to the time of endoscopic procedure than the time currently recommended by the ASGE guidelines.</p>

<title>Clinical Relevancy Statement</title>
<p>This is the first study to assess and compare the complication rate during percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement in patients receiving or not antithrombotic treatment according to compliance with the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines for the management of antithrombotic therapy during endoscopic procedures.</p>
<p>According to our results, antiplatelet therapy could be safely discontinued at least 3 days before PEG placement instead of the 7–10 days suggested by the ASGE guidelines. Such modification would shorten the waiting time to perform the procedure and resume enteral feeding and will also benefit those patients with high thromboembolic risk who cannot afford to be off medications for long periods.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0148607111413897">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Gastrostomy tubes are used to supply enteral nutrition (EN) to patients with a fully functional gastrointestinal tract who are unable to feed by mouth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0148607111413897">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607111413897">3</xref></sup> These tubes can be placed surgically, under radiology guidance, or during endoscopy. When these techniques are compared to each other, the endoscopic method is associated with significantly less overall complication rates (10%–24%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0148607111413897">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0148607111413897">7</xref></sup> and has been considered as the procedure of choice by some authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0148607111413897">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0148607111413897">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Endoscopic procedures are classified as low or high risk in regards to their potential for causing severe bleeding. Severe bleeding is considered to be any hemorrhage that requires blood transfusion, admission to the hospital, or endoscopic or surgical treatment. A high-risk endoscopic procedure is defined as any procedure with a risk of severe bleeding &gt;1%. These high-risk endoscopic procedures include polypectomy (risk 1%–10%),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0148607111413897">10</xref></sup> endoscopic mucosal resection (risk 22%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0148607111413897">11</xref></sup> and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG; risk 2.5%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0148607111413897">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most patients undergoing PEG placement are elderly and may have numerous comorbidities. Many are under antithrombotic therapy, receiving either anticoagulant (AC) and/or antiplatelet (AP) medications. These factors may increase the risk of endoscopic procedure–related bleeding.</p>
<p>To reduce risks and complications during and after endoscopic procedures in patients receiving antithrombotic therapy, different international gastroenterology and endoscopy societies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607111413897">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0148607111413897">15</xref></sup> including the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE), have formulated a series of recommendations in regards to the management of antithrombotic therapy during endoscopic procedures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607111413897">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0148607111413897">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0148607111413897">17</xref></sup> However, such recommendations are based only on expert opinions and small case series. So far, the risk of bleeding during PEG placement in patients receiving antithrombotic therapy has yet to be elucidated. Information about compliance with ASGE’s recommendations and the effect of observing or not these recommendations on PEG placement complication rates is still unknown.</p>

<p>The aims of our study were to compare the incidence and type of complications during PEG placement in patients receiving AP and/or AC treatment compared to controls and to determine the compliance with the ASGE antithrombotic therapy management recommendations in a tertiary medical center (ABC Medical Center) in Mexico City.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0148607111413897" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Clinical charts from patients undergoing PEG tube placement between January 2004 and December 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients’ clinical data, demographics, PEG tube placement indications, use and dose of AC and AP medications, postprocedure complications, and compliance with ASGE’s guidelines were recorded. Minor complications included bleeding not requiring transfusion and superficial wound infection. Major complications included bleeding requiring transfusion, tube dislodgment, significant wound infection, need for debridement or reoperation, and death.</p>
<sec id="section4-0148607111413897">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>Patients were separated into 1 of 2 groups: those patients receiving AC (warfarin, acenocoumarol, heparin, or low molecular weight heparin) and/or AP (aspirin or clopidogrel) prior to PEG placement (cases group) and a control group of patients who either had never received or had discontinued AC/AP therapy at least 6 months before the procedure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0148607111413897">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>PEG tubes were placed using the standard “pull-through” technique described by Ponsky and Gauderer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0148607111413897">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>All procedures were performed in the endoscopy suite. All patients underwent sedation with propofol under strict monitoring by an anesthesiologist. PEG tubes were placed by certified and trained endoscopists with different degrees of expertise.</p>
<p>In all cases, a 24 French PEG tube kit manufactured either by Boston Scientific (Natik, MA) or Wilson Cook (Winston-Salem, NC) was used. Kits were selected based on stock availability at the time the procedure was performed. After the procedure, patients were returned to their hospital room, and tube feedings were started the following day.</p>

<sec id="section6-0148607111413897">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using the statistics program SPSS v.11.0 (SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, IL). Results are presented as mean and standard deviation. For comparison between groups, we used Student <italic>t</italic> test, Fisher’s test, and χ<sup>2</sup> tests according to each variable. A <italic>P</italic> value ≤.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<p>AP therapy should be withdrawn at least 7–10 days prior to any high-risk endoscopic procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0148607111413897">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0148607111413897">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Interestingly, although none of our studied cases followed the ASGE guidelines for the management of antithrombotic therapy, no major bleeding events occurred. We did not find any significant differences in the frequency and type of PEG placement-related complications between groups.</p>
<p>The absence of major bleeding events in either study groups could be related to the fact that these patients were off antithrombotic therapy before the procedure, even if it was for a short period. The absence of major bleeding in patients who had only been off thrombotic therapy for short periods before the procedure suggests that these medications (especially antiplatelet treatment) can be safely withheld only a few days before PEG placement as opposed to the longer periods recommended in the ASGE guidelines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0148607111413897">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>The decision to withhold or continue antithrombotic therapy is based on the type of procedure (elective, urgent, low or high risk) and on each patient’s risk of developing thromboembolic events. PEG is an elective, high-risk endoscopic procedure with several factors responsible for its bleeding risk and outcomes. These factors include individual endosocopist’s experience, factors related to the patient (old age, cholangitis, cirrhosis, clotting disorders, renal failure), and those factors related to the procedure itself (PEG tube placement carries a 2.5% risk of severe bleeding).</p>
<p>Considering that the procedures in our study were performed by physicians with different levels of expertise and skills and that our study was based on chart review, which yielded limited quantity and quality data, it is unclear if endoscopist-dependent factors could have affected our results.</p>
<p>It is possible that individual experience might have played a role in our observations. More experienced endoscopists may have felt more comfortable performing the most difficult cases or those cases in which ASGE guidelines could not have been followed. Less experienced endoscopists may have declined those cases that did not meet ASGE recommendations and performed procedures only on patients not taking antithrombotic medications. If these assumptions are correct, they may explain the similar complication rate observed between groups.</p>
<p>Because no differences were observed between the studied groups, patient-related factors might have played no role in our results.</p>
<p>Antithrombotic therapy management deserves further consideration. Regarding AC therapy, this was stopped 48 hours before the procedure, and all the patients were bridged using LMWH. However, LMWH was withdrawn long before the procedure and not in accordance to ASGE recommendations. This could have decreased the risk of bleeding in this group. AP medications were stopped only 1–3 days before the procedure instead of 7–10 days as stated by the ASGE guidelines. Interestingly, although an increased bleeding risk due to platelet dysfunction could have been anticipated, the frequency and type of complications were similar in this group as compared to the control group, and no major bleedings were reported.</p>
<p>Aspirin and thienopyridines decrease platelet aggregation by either irreversibly inhibiting platelets’ cyclooxygenase or blocking the adenosine biphosphate receptor, respectively, disabling the platelets through their life span of about 7–10 days. Each drug has different effects on the gastrointestinal tract and is associated with different bleeding risks. Aspirin seems to increase intestinal mucosa bleeding time,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0148607111413897">19</xref></sup> especially in the colonic mucosa. Clopidogrel has less risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared to aspirin (2% vs 2.7%, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0148607111413897">20</xref></sup> However, these numbers and observations should be interpreted cautiously because they refer to the risk of spontaneous gastrointestinal bleeding and not to that related to invasive procedures. Clinicians should keep in mind that when both drugs are given simultaneously, the risk of bleeding increases significantly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0148607111413897">21</xref></sup> Although an increased frequency of bleeding complications would have been expected in the patients being treated with these drugs, our study shows no difference between these patients and the control group.</p>
<p>Thanks to a fine balance between bone marrow production and peripheral destruction, blood platelet counts are maintained almost constant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0148607111413897">22</xref></sup> It is estimated that about 10%–15% of blood platelets are cleared daily.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0148607111413897">23</xref></sup> Theoretically, the bone marrow will produce the same or a similar number of platelets to replace the number of platelets that are destroyed. In individuals with both a normal platelet count and bone marrow function and receiving AP therapy, it could be expected that 3 days after AP medication is withdrawn, about 30% of drug-disabled blood platelets would be destroyed. These platelets would then be replaced by new, fully functioning platelets from the bone marrow, allowing invasive endoscopic procedures to be performed with less bleeding risk as compared to procedures performed in patients actively receiving AP therapy.</p>
<p>Individual embolism and thrombotic risks may have played a major role during decision making about when to stop antithrombotic therapy, explaining why ASGE recommendations were not followed in any case. Conditions such as atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, arterial hypertension, age older than 75 years, diabetes mellitus, history of stroke, recent coronary stent, and recent deep venous thrombosis, among others, are considered high-risk thromboembolic factors, many of which were present in our population (some patients presented with more than one condition).</p>
<p>Because of the study design, we cannot establish a certain association between individual thromboembolic risks and antithrombotic medication withdrawal time prior to the endoscopic procedure. We think that AP therapy can be safely discontinued closer to the time of the endoscopic procedure (at least 3 days before) as opposed to the 7–10 days suggested by ASGE guidelines. Such a modification would benefit not only the endoscopists, by shortening the waiting time to perform the procedure, but also the patients, especially those with high thromboembolic risk who cannot afford to be off medications for long periods.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize and compare the incidence and type of complications, including presence of major bleeding, during PEG placement in patients receiving or not receiving antithrombotic treatment and to assess the compliance rate with the ASGE AC and AP management recommendations. However, it has some limitations (retrospective chart review and small sample), and these results need to be validated in other similar or larger controlled clinical trials.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The overall PEG tube placement complication rate was 13.7%, and no differences were found between studied groups. No major bleeding was reported. ASGE recommendations were not followed in any of the cases in our retrospective review. Based on our data, AP therapy probably can be safely discontinued closer to the time of the endoscopic procedure (at least 3 days before) instead of 7–10 days, as suggested by the ASGE guidelines.</p>
