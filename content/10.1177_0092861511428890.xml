            <p>Pharmacovigilance regulations and guidelines state that literature databases should be searched at least monthly to detect safety signals from the published literature. In addition, periodic safety update reports (PSURs) should contain a summary and references from reports in the literature containing important safety findings.

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Pharmaceutical companies are required to adhere to pharmacovigilance regulations and guidelines. Specific to detecting safety signals from the published literature, these guidelines state that at least 2 internationally recognized literature databases should be searched at least monthly.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0092861511428890">1</xref>
            </sup> In addition, periodic safety update reports (PSURs) should contain a summary and references from reports in the scientific and medical literature, including relevant published abstracts from meetings, containing important positive or negative safety findings.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0092861511428890">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0092861511428890">3</xref>
            </sup>
         </p>
         <p>The AstraZeneca process for detecting safety signals from the published literature complies with these pharmacovigilance guidelines. The process requires that the published scientific and medical literature must be assessed on a regular basis. For this purpose, a product safety search strategy is developed and used to guide the creation of a literature database query. This query is automatically executed on a regular basis, and surveillance teams receive an e-mail containing relevant article lists (bulletins) that they are responsible for reviewing. If an abstract indicates a potential safety signal, the full text of the article is reviewed and appropriate action is taken, such as a full evaluation of the safety topic using data from other sources. The volume of literature that needs to be reviewed for marketed products is high (ranging from 10 to more than 200 articles per month), making manual review of the abstracts a resource-intensive process. The requirement to review this volume of abstracts may introduce the risk of missing important publications because of “volume overload.” In addition, it is important that surveillance teams are able to document and track articles that they have identified as requiring inclusion in PSURs. In the past, various methods for documenting and tracking articles have been used, including spreadsheets, meeting minutes, and an in-house signal management system.</p>
         <p>Natural language processing (NLP) is a computerized approach to analyzing textual information, such as that contained within published documents. The goal is usually to automate parts of the text processing that ordinarily would be performed by a human. When the overarching goal is to transform text into data that can be subjected to analytical methods, the term <italic>text analytics</italic> is often used. The techniques and tools associated with NLP and text analytics have been successfully used in a number of varied business applications, including sentiment analysis around products,<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0092861511428890">4</xref>

               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0092861511428890">5</xref>
            </sup> and scientific discovery within the life sciences.<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0092861511428890">6</xref>
            </sup> Natural language processing has also been used for pharmacovigilance purposes.<sup>

         <p>To improve the efficiency and consistency of the routine literature evaluation, tracking, and documentation processes within a regulated pharmaceutical environment, the application of NLP and text analytics technologies was investigated. The results of that investigation and a detailed description of the system design and implementation are presented below.</p>

         <title>System Description</title>
         <p>Text Analytics for Surveillance (TAS) was developed to be a unifying system for product safety literature review in a global pharmaceutical company. It is a software tool that is accessible to specific users via the company intranet and creates a collaborative work environment for a large group of scientists. In addition, the system provides a novel application of text analytics to assist with identifying the most relevant articles in the process of scheduled surveillance of published literature.</p>
         <sec id="section3-0092861511428890">
            <title>Links Between TAS and Other Systems</title>
            <p>The safety database provides a feed of the latest product-specific adverse event terms for each product on which surveillance is being conducted. Text Analytics for Surveillance updates its own copies of these lists via the safety database, once per week. The updates occur via a scheduled task, run over the weekend when TAS usage is at a minimum.</p>
            <p>The vocabulary server is used by TAS as a dictionary service for disease and drug terms. It uses the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) for the disease terms. For instance, when a MedDRA preferred term (PT) is received from the safety database, the vocabulary server is queried to retrieve all the related lowest level terms (LLTs) for that PT. This ensures that TAS has a complete description of the term. Similarly, when a new drug is added to TAS, the vocabulary server is queried to retrieve all alternative names for the drug, such as a list of generic and brand names.</p>
            <p>The literature abstracts are imported into TAS on request. A query for a particular product is sent to the external medical literature database, and a feed of literature abstracts is returned to TAS for processing. Conference and meeting abstracts are added semi-automatically to TAS. To import an individual abstract, the user pastes the link into TAS. To import multiple abstracts, the user navigates to the meeting abstracts Web site and uses a special TAS plug-in to select and import the meeting abstracts he or she requires.</p>

            <title>Profile Analysis</title>
            <p>The article categorization provided by TAS is used to explore trends in the profile of a product over time. The 1D profile analysis feature is displayed as a bar chart, where each bar represents a category. The height of the bars is proportional to the number of articles within that category, for the chosen product, within a user-specified period. To facilitate further investigation, links allow the user to view all the articles contributing to a particular bar in the chart.</p>
            <p>The 2D profile analysis feature is visualized as a matrix-style heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0092861511428890">Figure 3</xref>). The full set of TAS categories is represented on both the horizontal and the vertical axes of the matrix. The number in each matrix cell is the number of articles that fall into both categories to which that cell belongs. The heat of each cell represents the statistical significance of each finding. The closer the color is to red (and furthest away from gray), the more statistically significant is this particular number of category co-occurrences. The measure chosen here to calculate the co-occurrence significance is the pointwise mutual information (PMI) score, which is used widely in information retrieval theory to establish the statistical significance of a pair of outcomes<sup>

            <p>There are 3 classes of users: super users, product-specific users, and read-only users. The super users, or administrators, manage other users, products, and term lists. In the TAS tool, safety surveillance teams are assigned to the products that they are responsible for and are then able to view all references and load, tag, and sign off references for their own products. Surveillance teams have read-only access to references for all products that they are not assigned to in the tool.</p>

            <title>Feedback and Tuning</title>
            <p>Text Analytics for Surveillance includes the facility for users to log feedback when they observe an issue with the term matching for a given article—usually this will be a false positive or a false negative. In this context, a false positive is an identified match when there should have been none. For instance, <italic>renal insufficiency </italic>causes a match to occur because it is a substring of <italic>adrenal insufficiency</italic>. A false negative, on the other hand, is the absence of a match when one was expected. For instance, one may have expected the text <italic>9-year-old girl</italic> to have caused the article to be categorized as “Children.” However, this match would be missed if <italic>girl</italic> was not included in the TAS dictionaries as a synonym for <italic>children</italic>. The TAS interface allows both types of issues to be reported.</p>
            <p>These feedback mechanisms are critical for system evolution. They allow TAS to be continuously tuned to become ever more accurate at term matching and therefore article categorization. An administrator’s interface displays user-reported issues that are pending. A TAS administrator can handle each issue via a number of options:</p>
            <list list-type="bullet">
               <list-item>
                  <p>Consult with other administrators, as well as the user who reported the issue.</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>Disable a particular term synonym, so that it is never matched again.</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>Add a new synonym for a term.</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>Add a “stop-word” so that a specific match is forbidden. For instance, <italic>itching </italic>is a perfectly valid term to match, but there needs to be a way to prevent a match when it is recognized purely because it is a substring of <italic>switching</italic>. Therefore, a rule that forbids only this combination can be added.</p>
               </list-item>
               <list-item>
                  <p>Dismiss the issue if no action is to be taken.</p>
               </list-item>
            </list>
            <p>The inclusion of user feedback mechanisms in the system reflects the recognized importance of building a flexible system capable of continuous improvement. This philosophy was embedded early in the project and is carried forward through the above-mentioned features. In addition, as a formal measure of the realized system benefits, quantitative and qualitative data have been collected and evaluated at various times during the project. During the system development phase, the performance of article categorization with TAS was evaluated using a set of manually categorized gold-standard articles. Following the rollout of TAS, system usage statistics and user feedback were collected and evaluated with the aim of gaining insight into the uptake and perception of the tool. Because use of TAS is voluntary, these data are considered indicative of the value added by the tool. The findings of these evaluations are presented below.</p>

            <title>Baseline Accuracy Testing</title>
            <p>Clearly, the power of an informatics approach such as TAS relies on the accuracy with which it can match terms within article abstracts and keywords and thus apply categorization to articles. However, in this case, it is difficult to determine such metrics because initial benchmarking of “accuracy” must be relative to some absolute measure—that is, a baseline for what is the “perfect” categorization for an article or set of articles. We find that in reality, there is no such ideal categorization. Thus, the best we can do is benchmark the TAS approach against human categorizers, even though we know that intercategorizer concordance is not 100%.</p>
            <p>The benchmarking approach involved manual categorization of 300 articles. For each article, the title, abstract, and keywords were available. There were 100 articles from each of 3 marketed products, and each product was categorized by a different human curator. The same articles were then passed through the TAS automated categorization process, and the 2 sets of categorizations were compared. After the first round of comparisons, updates were made to the TAS dictionaries and matching rules to improve the false-positive and false-negative rates. Then the TAS categorization was rerun and the comparison was repeated. The results from this process are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0092861511428890">Table 3</xref>, where the precision and recall are reported at the category level. The most important single performance measure for TAS is recall because the goal is to help minimize the risk of overlooking relevant publications. In this context, recall refers to the percentage of human-assigned categorizations that were also assigned by TAS. Note that no articles are excluded from review if they are not recalled, but rather they lack 1 or more of the categorization annotations that the human reviewers expected. As the results show, the initial tuning of TAS was performed primarily in favor of recall. Note that resource constraints limited the volume of hand-curated literature available during the TAS testing phase, and consequently it was decided not to split that data into separate training and validation sets in this instance. However, this was not a critical limitation for TAS accuracy because the comparison with human-curated literature was only a guide for baseline accuracy tuning, and we subsequently relied on the continuous improvement capabilities of TAS for further incremental improvements in categorization accuracy (see Feedback and Tuning section).</p>

         </list>
         <p>Text Analytics for Surveillance was designed, developed, and deployed as a fit-for-purpose tool and approach, aimed at a specific business process. This targeted design and controlled scope lend the tool its unique impact and value while also identifying areas where complementary requirements exist. For instance, it should be noted that TAS yields the greatest benefits when a single product has 10s or 100s of articles per month and therefore where the volume of articles to review can be an issue. For lower numbers of articles, an alternative, more manual solution may be perfectly acceptable. Moreover, TAS does not replace the type of literature review or text-mining activities, which are flexibly deployed in response to specific scientific or business questions around a pharmaceutical product.</p>
         <p>Furthermore, the approach described here appears to build on and complement recent published work on the application of NLP and text analytics to pharmacovigilance. The overall TAS approach is similar to that used in an example of the burgeoning field of NLP applied to electronic health records<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0092861511428890">7</xref>
            </sup> but is applied to a different textual source: published literature and meeting abstracts. This is key, as textual analysis often calls for different technologies, algorithms, and tuning, depending on the ultimate source of the data. The use of hierarchical term-based literature search can improve recall<sup>
               <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0092861511428890">8</xref>
            </sup> via individual searches on PubMed. This is an important result, and TAS extends the concept by developing an automated, online environment for performing such literature classification and review on a continuous basis.</p>
         <p>Finally, there are clearly opportunities to reuse the TAS approach within other scientific and business areas where regular literature evaluation is important:</p>
         <list list-type="order">
            <list-item>
               <p>
                  <italic>Internal documentation</italic>. In large organizations, such as global pharmaceutical companies, huge volumes of scientific reports and related outputs are generated and archived on a continuous basis. Often it can be difficult or impossible to mine the text within these documents. Text analytics opens up the possibility to recognize high-level trends or otherwise form new hypotheses based on latent information contained in the text.</p>

            <list-item>
               <p>
                  <italic>Commercial intelligence</italic>. To keep abreast of the latest developments in the pharmaceutical sector, it is necessary to regularly scan external textual information sources such as online press releases, blogs, and newsgroups. The need to react quickly to new information on competitors is often not adequately met by only using manual scanning or curation techniques. Text analytics can provide automation to parts of this process, thus permitting a more rapid assimilation of the online information.</p>
            </list-item>
         </list>
         <p>In conclusion, semi-automation of the routine literature surveillance process using NLP and text analytics can enhance categorized review, introduce consistency of approach, ensure rigorous recording of activities, and aid profile analysis.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>Text Analytics for Surveillance was developed as a software tool to improve the efficiency and consistency of the routine literature evaluation, tracking, and documentation process within a regulated pharmaceutical environment. It uses natural language processing and text analytics to enhance categorized review, introduce consistency of approach, ensure rigorous recording of activities, and aid profile analysis. Text Analytics for Surveillance yields the greatest benefits when a single product has 10s or 100s of articles per month and therefore where the volume of articles to review can be an issue. There are clear opportunities to reuse the TAS approach within other scientific and business areas where regular literature evaluation is important.</p>
