<p>In his essay ‘Idee zu einer allgemeinen Geschichte in weltbürgerlicher Absicht’ (1784) Kant remarked that although marriages, births, and deaths resulted from individual actions, the annual statistical tables showed them also to be law-bound and predictable. Adolphe Quételet’s <italic>Physique sociale</italic> (1835) used statistical data to construct an ‘average man’ who, empirically, did not exist. This split between the statistical construct and the empirical individual underlies the techniques of risk assessment developed by actuaries, insurance companies and the ‘insurance state’ which offered its workers insurance against accidents. Kafka’s work for a state-run accident insurance firm required him to study statistics, calculate the chances of industrial accidents, and recommend safety precautions. While professionally committed to impersonal calculations, however, he privately shared Nietzsche’s conviction that the individual must be preserved amid modern herd society. The most striking and original parts of this book argue that this division between the individual and the statistic is fundamental to Kafka’s fiction – think of the unremarkable bureaucrat Josef K. finding himself interpellated as an individual – and is one of the principal ways in which Kafka’s writing absorbs the materials and discourses of his culture.</p>
<p>These arguments are based throughout on texts which were certainly or very probably known to Kafka. The authors draw, for example, on the work of Heinrich Rauchberg, professor of statistics at Prague University, whose lectures on ‘General and Austrian Statistics’ Kafka attended in 1905; on articles in the <italic>Zeitschrift für die gesamte Versicherungswissenschaft</italic>, which Kafka read as a professional duty; and on related articles in the <italic>Neue Rundschau</italic>, to which he subscribed. Particularly intriguing is a review published there in 1916 of a book by the Swedish geographer Rudolf Kjellén about the formation of military and ethnic fronts in wartime, which is intriguingly related to the inadequately fortified frontier in Kafka’s Chinese tales. Not all suggestions are equally convincing. I am not persuaded that Herman Hollerith’s electrical tabulating machine should be added to the long list of possible models for the punishment machine of <italic>In der Strafkolonie</italic>, neat though it would be to find ‘the bloody reunion of pre-modern torture and ultramodern data processing’ (p. 91). However, there are many ingenious and intriguing connections here which Kafka scholarship will need to evaluate and absorb.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this material is not presented as compellingly as it might have been. The book is ‘a sequence of interlinked essays’ (p. xv) resulting from prolonged collaboration between the authors. The essays focused on technology are principally Wagner’s work, those more focused on writing principally Corngold’s, and their style is fairly homogeneous. Their findings, however, would have been better presented as a coherent monograph, shortened, streamlined and freed from extraneous material that belongs in another book. It is surprising too that the authors do not seem to know the histories of statistical thinking by Ian Hacking (<italic>The Emergence of Probability</italic>, 1975; <italic>The Taming of Chance</italic>, 1990). Nevertheless, this book offers the most original approach to Kafka that has appeared since John Zilcosky’s <italic>Kafka’s Travels</italic> (2003).</p>
