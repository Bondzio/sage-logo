<p>Few historical events have been studied in such depth as the Holocaust, the Nazi extermination of European Jewry during the Second World War. Nobody can hope to have read all of the several thousand books, articles and other publications on the subject. In fact, the steady stream of publications is so large that the library of Yad Vashem, Israel’s memorial to the Holocaust, receives around 4000 books per year on the subject (6). Many academics who study the Holocaust, particularly those connected to ‘Holocaust Studies’, treat it in isolation from other events and insist that the Holocaust was unique, thereby avoiding debates on comparisons to other mass atrocities and manifestations of genocide. Yet, many scholars and historians rightly argue that one can only begin to understand the Holocaust if one puts it into a broader historical perspective and the wider context of the Third Reich’s plans for the racial and spatial reordering of Europe (3). Amongst these scholars is Dan Stone, one of Britain’s leading historians of the Holocaust. Stone integrates the history of the Holocaust with wider trends in German and European history in what is a stellar critical synthesis of the recent literature on the Holocaust. Stone does not deliver an indiscriminating overview of the most recent historiography, for such an endeavour would be unachievable. Instead, he picks a few key themes which have recently come to the fore of historians’ attention. If there is a key argument in this wide-ranging book, it is Stone’s insistence that there is no history of the Holocaust, but only histories of the event, hence the title.</p>
<p>Stone is particularly keen to introduce readers to the recent scholarship on Holocaust perpetrators, a field of study that has latterly elucidated in great detail and with sophistication, the motives and ideologies that prompted people and institutions to participate in the events that we now know as the Holocaust. For Stone, the Holocaust, while directed by the Nazis, was a European phenomenon that saw the collaboration of indigenous populations in Poland and elsewhere in Eastern and Central Europe in getting rid of the Jews. Stone, displaying an impressive familiarity with the literature, also discusses the Holocaust in comparison to other genocides, an endeavour that has recently preoccupied a number of scholars. Comparing the Holocaust to other mass atrocities does not trivialize the Holocaust; in fact, it highlights its specificity, and the ruthless hunting down of Jews everywhere in Nazi-occupied Europe, even more sharply (242–4). In the final chapter (245–83), Stone is perhaps on less firm ground as he discusses ‘the Holocaust as an expression of Nazi culture’. He delivers a reliable summary of recent, but rather inconclusive approaches that interpret Nazism as a political religion, a term that gives too much coherence to a rather loose set of ideas. Related to the political religion approach is the recent attempt to interpret Nazi Germany as a <italic>Volksgemeinschaft</italic>, a people’s community based upon racial ideas. But both concepts are highly problematical as they run the risk of taking too literally Nazi propaganda about Nazism as a coherent movement, allegedly supported by all Germans. More clarification is required of whether ‘political religion’ and <italic>Volksgemeinschaft</italic> are to be understood as descriptive terms or analytical concepts. But this criticism is minor, as Stone has written an intelligent, wide-ranging and thought-provoking textbook on the Holocaust which will be indispensable reading for scholars and students alike.</p>
