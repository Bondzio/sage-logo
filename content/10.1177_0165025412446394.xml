<abstract>
<p>Relationships exist between language ability, emotion regulation, and social competence in preschool children. This study examines how these relationships function in elementary school children, and explores whether language ability partially mediates the relationship between emotion regulation and social competence. Second-grade students (<italic>N</italic> = 67) completed an assessment of receptive vocabulary, and teachers rated emotional and social skills. Results show relationships between emotion regulation and social competence, and between language and aspects of social competence. There were compelling sex differences in the strength of the relationships between these variables. However, language did not act as a mediator. Future research should further investigate the role of language skills in social competence as children mature, and further investigate sex differences in these constructs.</p>

<p>Social competence has important implications for child development. Children with good social skills are better prepared for school, have higher attendance rates, report increased enjoyment of school, and achieve at higher levels than their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0165025412446394">Ladd, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0165025412446394">Ladd, Kochenderfer, &amp; Coleman, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165025412446394">Cavell (1990</xref>) proposed a three-tiered model of social competence that includes social adjustment (reaching age-appropriate landmarks), social performance (demonstrating characteristics in social situations that adults judge as appropriate), and social skills (characteristics that enable a child to act appropriately). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165025412446394">Cavell (1990</xref>) also identified peer acceptance as a product of social competence. Among the processes involved in the development of social skills, language ability and emotion regulation may be especially important in children’s ability to successfully interact with others. The present study investigates these concepts in second-grade children.</p>
<p>Language ability is essential for social competence because children must understand others and communicate effectively in order to demonstrate their social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0165025412446394">Gallagher, 1993</xref>). Through interaction with peers, children learn to ask questions, to listen, and to identify with another person’s perspective. For example, children must be able to recognize when to employ appropriate prosocial behaviors, such as sympathizing with a distressed peer rather than making a joke. Language may facilitate the ability to choose appropriate behaviors by allowing children to develop emotion expression knowledge, the ability to identify emotional expressions, as well as emotion situation knowledge, the ability to match emotional labels with context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0165025412446394">Schultz, Izard, &amp; Ackerman, 2001</xref>). These skills allow children to develop friendships and enhance their ability to act in a socially competent manner across different contexts. Research suggests that receptive vocabulary, or the ability to comprehend language, is more important in nominations of peer status than age or intelligence, and that children prefer to interact with peers with typical or above-average receptive vocabulary skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165025412446394">Gertner, Rice, &amp; Hadley, 1994</xref>). Among language-impaired children, those with better receptive vocabulary abilities score higher on peer preference tests than children who are more severely language-impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165025412446394">Gertner et al., 1994</xref>). Receptive language ability has also been linked to higher teacher ratings of social competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0165025412446394">Longoria, Page, Hubbs-Tait, &amp; Kennison, 2009</xref>) and several prosocial behaviors, such as comforting or sympathizing with others, cooperating, and helping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165025412446394">Cassidy, Werner, Rourke, &amp; Zubernis, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Just as research suggests that advanced language ability is related to positive behavior, there is evidence that children with language deficits are not as socially skilled as their typically developing peers. Children who are language-delayed demonstrate poorer control of their emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165025412446394">Fujiki, Brinton, &amp; Clarke, 2002</xref>) and have more behavioral problems than their typically developing and advanced peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165025412446394">Beitchman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165025412446394">Camarata, Hughes, &amp; Ruhl, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0165025412446394">Gallagher, 1999</xref>) and teachers view language-delayed children as less socially mature and less intellectual than their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0165025412446394">Rice, Hadley, &amp; Alexander, 1993</xref>). Language delays also lead to impaired social interactions because children with language deficits experience difficulty introducing and maintaining conversation topics, as well as in adjusting verbal output to a listener’s needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0165025412446394">Gallagher, 1999</xref>). These deficiencies in comprehension ability lead to a lack of responsiveness when others initiate play, and as a result other children spend less time attempting to engage language-delayed peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165025412446394">Cohen &amp; Mendez, 2009</xref>). This decrease in peer interaction further reduces opportunities for children to develop social skills, initiating a cycle of rejection that could lead to emotional maladjustment and juvenile delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165025412446394">Denham &amp; Holt, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Like social competence, emotion regulation is a multifaceted construct, defined as initiating, avoiding, inhibiting, maintaining, or adjusting any part of an internal-feeling state, physiological process related to emotion, or emotion-related goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165025412446394">Eisenberg, 2004</xref>). In short, emotion regulation involves tailoring behavior to accommodate a feeling or a desire to have a feeling. This includes effortful control, which is the ability to inhibit one response in favor of another, as well as the ability to identify others’ emotions, which is one aspect of the broader concept of social cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165025412446394">Eisenberg, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165025412446394">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0165025412446394">Spinrad et al., 2006</xref>). Emotion regulation refers to adaptive emotional behavior and is distinct from emotional lability, which pertains to the volatility and intensity of negative emotions. Internal state language, a form of self-awareness, contributes to emotion regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165025412446394">Cole, Armstrong, &amp; Pemberton, 2010</xref>) by allowing children to discuss their experiences and tailor their behavior to the prevailing social environment. This enables them to regulate their emotions effectively.</p>
<p>Successful emotion regulation relies on two main coping strategies: problem-focused coping, or modifying the source of stress, and emotion-focused coping, or reducing emotional distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165025412446394">Eisenberg &amp; Fabes, 1992</xref>). Children who employ these strategies and regulate their emotions well generally have more positive social interactions with their peers and are more likely to be classified as socially competent. Teacher ratings of increased social status are positively related to attentional control, constructive coping, prosocial behavior, and the ability to understand social situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165025412446394">Denham, McKinley, Couchoud, &amp; Holt, 1990</xref>; Eisenberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0165025412446394">1993</xref>); lower social status has been linked to negative affect, emotional intensity and acting-out coping styles, as well as to withdrawal (Eisenberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0165025412446394">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165025412446394">Fujiki, Spackman, Brinton, &amp; Hall, 2004</xref>). This means that children who utilized effective coping strategies and understood that their actions had implications for the prevailing social context were more socially competent than their peers.</p>
<p>There is strong support for the nexus between language ability and social competence, and between emotion regulation and social competence, but previous research has not investigated the possibility that language ability partially mediates the relationship between emotion regulation and social competence. Children’s vocabulary affords them the ability to discuss their own experiences while understanding others’ experiences and feelings. This leads to meaningful interactions that develop into friendships. In addition, children with the ability to adjust their internal state can cope with stress effectively through the use of internal state language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165025412446394">Cole et al., 2010</xref>). Testing the hypothesis that language ability acts as a mechanism through which emotion regulation and social competence are related could have implications for prevention of and intervention in behavioral issues in early elementary school. If language ability mediates this relationship, intervention programs may wish to focus on improving children’s language skills.</p>
<p>Much of the research regarding verbal ability and emotional and social skills is limited to preschool children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165025412446394">Cassidy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165025412446394">Cohen &amp; Mendez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165025412446394">Denham et al., 1990</xref>; Eisenberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0165025412446394">1993</xref>) and uses ratings of peer play trajectories as a measure of social competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165025412446394">Cohen &amp; Mendez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0165025412446394">Mendez, Fantuzzo, &amp; Cicchetti, 2002</xref>). Other work in this area has investigated language-impaired samples in elementary school and followed up in adolescence or adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0165025412446394">Johnson, Beitchman, &amp; Brownlie, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0165025412446394">Young et al., 2002</xref>). The present study further contributes to the literature on social skills by utilizing teacher reports on the global functioning of typically-developing children, and by focusing exclusively on 7- and 8-year-old children. As children enter elementary school, the relationships between affect, behavior, and language grow more complex, and the cognition involved in understanding others as well as expressing oneself becomes more important than in preschool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0165025412446394">White, 1965</xref>). Between the ages of 5 and 7, children’s cognitive functioning matures and they are able to perceive interactions through different perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0165025412446394">Greenberg, Kusche, Cook, &amp; Quamma, 1995</xref>). These maturational factors may result in changes in the mechanisms by which social competence develops. Given the developmental changes that occur between preschool and elementary school, it is reasonable to investigate the relationships between language and emotional and social skills in an elementary school sample.</p>
<p>Based on previous literature that linked language ability with peer status and teacher ratings of social competence, and research that tied emotion regulation with social skills, the present study hypothesized that both language ability and emotion regulation skills would predict social competence. This study also hypothesized that language ability would partially mediate the relationship between emotion regulation and social competence, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0165025412446394">Figure 1</xref>. The relationship between emotion regulation and social competence should weaken when language ability is taken into account, suggesting that language is one mechanism through which emotion regulation is achieved. This study also considered these relationships separately for boys and girls to examine sex-based differences. No predictions were made regarding the direction or strength of the relationships by sex.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were second-grade students (<italic>N</italic> = 67) at a public elementary school in a university town in rural Pennsylvania, USA; two students were excluded due to incomplete data. Most were European-American (78.8%), with the remainder of the sample multiracial (7.5%), African-American (1.5%), Asian/Pacific-Islander (1.5%), or other (7.6%). Three percent had missing data on race/ethnicity. There were 35 girls (53.8%) and 30 boys (46.2%) in the sample. The mean age of the children was 7 years and 6 months (<italic>SD</italic> = .51 months, range = 6 years, 11 months–8 years, 11 months). Data on students’ family income was not collected. However, 39% of the school’s students were designated as “low-income” by the state. The state of Pennsylvania considers sources such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families cases, receipt of Medicaid, children’s residence in institutions for the neglected, and eligibility for free or reduced-price lunch in determining this status.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>All second-grade students in the school were eligible to participate. Students were recruited for the study through consent forms which they took home to a parent or guardian. To increase incentive for students to return the consent forms, a pizza party was provided for the class with the highest rate of returns regardless of parental decision. Out of the total 104 second-grade students, 89 (85.6%) returned the forms, and response rates per class ranged from 20 out of 21 (95.2%) to 16 out of 20 (80%). Of the students who returned the forms, 67 (75.2%) received permission from a parent or guardian to participate, resulting in an overall response rate of 64.4%.</p>
<p>The PPVT was administered to students by the first author in an empty classroom during the school day. Each student’s primary teacher completed the ERC and BASC, and received $10.00 per child rated.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The first hypothesis that emotion regulation and language ability would predict social competence was partially supported. Strong relationships were found between emotion regulation and all measures of social skills, and language ability was strongly related to school problems and adaptive skills. This supports previous research that linked emotion regulation to social competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165025412446394">Cohen &amp; Mendez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165025412446394">Eisenberg &amp; Fabes, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0165025412446394">Spinrad et al., 2006</xref>) and emotional problems to deficits in social skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165025412446394">Cohen &amp; Mendez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165025412446394">Cole &amp; Hall, 2008</xref>). The result regarding language ability’s relationship with social skills aligns with prior research in some respects but differs in other ways. Although our hypothesis that language ability would partially mediate the relationship between emotion regulation and social competence was not supported, regression analyses revealed several sex differences that warrant further investigation.</p>
<p>Our finding that emotion regulation predicted social skills extends theory from previous research to a slightly older population. Based on prior work that implicated coping strategies and comprehension of social cues in teacher-rated social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165025412446394">Denham et al., 1990</xref>; Eisenberg et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0165025412446394">1993</xref>) it appears that effectively appraising social context and acting accordingly are key influences on teacher ratings of social competence at any young age. In addition, the finding that emotional lability predicted internalizing and externalizing problems supports prior research that found that emotion dysregulation distinguished preschool children’s play patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165025412446394">Cohen &amp; Mendez, 2009</xref>). The present study extends this work by utilizing a different measure of social skills for an older age group.</p>
<p>Two relationships within the emotion regulation/social competence paradigm appear to be due in part to the similarity of those constructs. The first was the relationship between scores on the emotion regulation subscale of the ERC and the adaptive skills composite of the BASC. The ERC includes items such as “responds positively to neutral or friendly overtures from adults” and “is empathic toward others,” which indicate good social and communication skills. Both of those constructs are subscales on the BASC’s adaptability composite. The second relationship, between emotional lability and externalizing problems, appears due to similarities between the lability/negativity subscale and the hyperactivity aspect of the BASC’s externalizing composite. For instance, the ERC includes items such as “is impulsive” and “is overly exuberant when engaging others in play;” these are similar to the BASC items “acts without thinking” and “is overly active.”</p>
<p>The present study found strong relationships between receptive language ability and school problems, as well as adaptive skills. These associations are not surprising. The measure of school problems used in the current study assesses attention and learning problems, and because children learn at least some vocabulary in school, it seems logical that their performance might suffer if they experienced trouble focusing in class. More broadly, it is likely that language ability contributes to children’s understanding of academic assignments across the curriculum, increasing their ability to successfully participate in a classroom environment.</p>
<p>Regarding the relationship between language ability and adaptive skills, it appears that language might be especially important for aspects of adaptive skills measured in the current study. The first, functional communication, assesses both expressive and receptive communication abilities, and includes items such as “responds appropriately when asked a question.” The ability to correctly respond to a question requires adequate comprehension. The second, study skills, appears to be inherently related to language ability. Items included in the measure of study skills include “reads” and “completes homework.” Presumably, knowledge of vocabulary is directly related to the ability to engage in these tasks. Previous research has found a relationship between language ability and adaptive skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165025412446394">Gertner et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0165025412446394">Longoria et al., 2009</xref>), and the current study provides a new perspective regarding social competence as a whole.</p>
<p>The first hypothesis that emotion regulation and language ability would predict social competence was only partially supported because language ability did not predict socio-emotional problems in this sample. There could be two reasons for this. First, prior research typically measured social competence through popularity or social status, and children who ranked low in those categories may not have had serious behavioral issues. Second, the relationship between language delay and behavioral problems may be exclusive to older children and children with clinical issues. Second-grade students may be too young to demonstrate noticeable internalizing problems, and although language delay has been linked to externalizing issues, much of that work pertains to children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165025412446394">Beitchman, 1985</xref>; Cohen, Davine, &amp; Meloche-Kelly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165025412446394">1988</xref>). The relationship may have been diminished in the current sample of typically developing children.</p>
<p>Our findings regarding sex differences in the strength of the predictions of social competence are quite interesting and warrant continued research. Three relationships were significant only for girls: (1) lability/negativity and internalizing; (2) emotion regulation and internalizing; and (3) language ability and externalizing. Moreover, the relationships between almost all of the variables were stronger in girls than in boys. These results contradict Eisenberg et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0165025412446394">1993</xref>) finding that attentional control, or the ability to effectively allocate attention, predicted social competence only in boys. That study also found a correlation between constructive coping and social skills only in boys. Although Eisenberg and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0165025412446394">1993</xref>) addressed these constructs in preschool children, the SES and racial makeup of their sample was similar to the present study’s. Other than Eisenberg et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0165025412446394">1993</xref>) study, previous literature does not appear to have addressed sex differences in the processes involved in the development of social competence.</p>
<p>Prior studies have also had mixed results on sex differences in the display of social competence. Kaiser, Xinsheng, Hancock, and Foster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0165025412446394">2002</xref>) found that boys in Head Start demonstrated more externalizing and internalizing behavioral issues than girls. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0165025412446394">Eisenberg et al. (2001)</xref> reported that there were no sex differences in teacher and mother reports of these behaviors in 6-year-old children, although fathers rated girls as having more internalizing problems and boys as having more externalizing problems. Future research may wish to investigate sex differences in social competence in preschool and elementary school, and evaluate if emotion regulation and language ability operates in a similar fashion among boys and girls.</p>
<p>Regarding the present finding that scores on the emotion regulation subscale and the lability/negativity subscale predicted internalizing problems only in girls, it is possible that girls with below-average emotion regulation skills are at greater risk for internalizing issues than boys. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165025412446394">Carter et al. (2010</xref>) found that girls demonstrated higher levels of general anxiety than boys throughout toddlerhood, and suggested that future research explores whether girls are actually at more risk for internalizing issues as they enter childhood. It is possible that emotion regulation contributes more to girls’ internalizing problems than boys.</p>
<p> The third significant sex difference was language ability’s prediction of externalizing issues only in girls. This supports Kaiser et al.’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0165025412446394">2002</xref>) finding that girls with language deficits were significantly more likely to demonstrate lower social competence than boys with language deficits. However, Kaiser et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0165025412446394">2002</xref>) also reported that girls with language deficits were no more likely than boys to show externalizing as opposed to internalizing behavior. The current study’s findings suggest that receptive vocabulary may be more important in the development of girls’ externalizing patterns than in boys. Perhaps a girl with externalizing issues is too hyperactive, for example, to practice listening in social situations and enhance receptive vocabulary. If receptive vocabulary is more important for girls’ social interactions than boys, this deficit may disproportionately affect girls. The present finding reinforces the need for future research to investigate the overlap between language ability and social competence, and how it may differ by sex and age.     </p>
<p>Present findings failed to support the partial mediation model, as emotion regulation did not predict language skills. This contradicts previous research that found that PPVT scores significantly correlated with both subscales of the ERC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165025412446394">Cohen &amp; Mendez, 2009</xref>). Past work has also demonstrated that receptive vocabulary is related to emotion expression and emotion situation knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0165025412446394">Schultz et al., 2001</xref>), meaning that children with greater verbal capacities had a better understanding of emotions than their peers. This enabled them to discuss their feelings, interpret others’ emotional states, and solve interpersonal problems (Dunn, Brown, &amp; Simons &amp; Beardsall, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165025412446394">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0165025412446394">Greenberg et al., 1995</xref>). Considering this research on the role of language and discourse in emotion regulation and development, the lack of a relationship in the present study is surprising.</p>
<p>One possibility that may account for the non-significant relationship between language ability and emotion regulation is the distinction in types of language. Expressive vocabulary refers to one’s ability to articulate meaningful words and phrases; receptive vocabulary is rooted in the ability to understand others. Although receptive and expressive vocabulary are highly correlated (Sideridis &amp; Simons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0165025412446394">2010</xref>), expressive ability may be more important for emotion regulation. Expressive ability may also be more critical for using constructive coping and the strategies for dealing with stress discussed by Eisenberg et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0165025412446394">1993</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165025412446394">Eisenberg and Fabes (1992</xref>). In using Cole et al.’s (2010) internal state language to think about their own experiences and frame them according to social context, articulating emotions with expressive language could be more important than understanding them with receptive language.</p>
<p>A lack of participants with poorer language ability and emotion regulation skills also could have contributed to the non-significant relationship between language ability and emotion regulation. Specifically, there was a noticeable lack of variance in score distribution on the language and emotion regulation measures. Scores on the PPVT were very negatively skewed at −.68. With an average standard score of 100 for each age group, this sample’s mean of 111 is nearly one full standard deviation away from the standardized mean. Only 13 children, or about 20% of the sample, scored lower than the standardized average. Scores on the emotion regulation subscale of the ERC were also negatively skewed at −.38, and scores on the lability/negativity subscale were positively skewed at .84. These results suggest that children possessed above-average receptive language ability, regulated their emotions well in general, and did not show many negative emotions. It is possible that, in highly competent samples, the relationships between language and emotion regulation as well as socio-emotional problems diminish.</p>
<p>Another explanation is that the relationship between language ability and emotion regulation is not linear. Prior research has focused on preschool children, and it is conceivable that language’s role in emotion regulation and social competence diminishes by the time children reach second grade. Perhaps children must reach a minimum level of language ability to regulate effectively, and the differences in ability between children who have surpassed that minimum are unremarkable. However, children who have failed to reach the baseline level would still experience difficulty in regulating emotions and would be at risk for behavioral problems or antisocial behavior.</p>
<p>There were a few limitations of this study worth noting. First, we relied on a measure of receptive vocabulary to reflect language ability. This limited the results to not just the receptive vocabulary domain, but to vocabulary in general. In attempting to measure the construct of language in elementary school children, a more comprehensive assessment of language ability may be more appropriate. If the importance of vocabulary knowledge or expression diminishes with age, studies might find that the processes involved in expression or comprehension might be more associated with social competence as children grow older. Children who perform well on vocabulary measures may still have deficits in syntactical and morphological areas, which can be more subtle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0165025412446394">Nation, Clarke, Marshall, &amp; Durand, 2004</xref>). Research in these more specific language areas has addressed reading comprehension, cognitive functions, and lexical learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0165025412446394">Nation et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0165025412446394">van der Lely, 2005</xref>), but has not examined their relationship to emotion regulation or social competence. This unexplored domain reinforces the importance of assessing multiple areas of language, especially in older children.</p>
<p>A second limitation pertains to relying on teacher ratings for the assessment of emotion regulation and social competence. Future studies should consider a more comprehensive approach in this area, as integrating information from different informants is ideal for gaining a complete picture of a child’s functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165025412446394">Achenbach, McConaughy, &amp; Howell, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Other limitations pertain to the sample: European-Americans represented an overwhelming majority of participants, and as a result this study differs from prior research that focused on Head Start programs, which are more racially diverse. Future research should align sample characteristics and demographics with those of prior studies. Finally, relatively few children performed poorly on each measure. This means that, in general, children in this study had good verbal skills, regulated their emotions well, and displayed adequate social skills. The current study sample’s high competence means that the results may only apply to high-performing children.</p>
<p>Several findings suggest the need for further investigation. Although only three of the regressions were significantly different by sex, research should evaluate the finding that these relationships were generally stronger in girls. Research has not attempted to delineate whether there are different predictors of social competence for boys and girls, and future studies should look to clarify this area. Studies might explore the developmental differences between the sexes and isolate unique experiences for each. Differences in socialization processes and expectations regarding boys’ and girls’ behavior and social interactions may have implications for who might demonstrate socio-emotional problems.</p>
<p>In research concerning externalizing and internalizing issues, investigators should further evaluate the role of language and establish a threshold at which children could be at risk for problems. Research has shown that language delay is related to externalizing issues in clinical samples, but it is possible that this relationship diminishes in typically developing children. Future studies should also strive to obtain a sample that represents the entire spectrum of language and social skills, and investigate the relationships for high-performing and low-performing children. Doing so would enable investigators to take a more comprehensive perspective on how these relationships work. A large, longitudinal design might ensure that children of all abilities are captured, and would allow breakdown of the relationships by ability, age, and sex. Previous research has not investigated how the role of language in emotion regulation and social skills development differs between early and middle childhood, and in adolescence. </p>
<p>The present study sought to determine the mechanisms by which children develop good social skills. If the importance of receptive vocabulary diminishes as children grow older, prevention strategies that emphasize emotional development and appropriate social behavior may be advantageous. Questions remain regarding the role of expressive vocabulary, the function of language itself, and how the relationships between emotion, language, and social skills change with age and differ by sex. The present study offers strong support for the positive relationship between emotion regulation and social skills, and for language’s role in adaptive behavior.</p>
