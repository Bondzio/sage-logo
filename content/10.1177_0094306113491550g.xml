<p>Working from a Marxist perspective, Georgios Papanicolaou writes in a way that scholars and graduate students interested in the processes and consequences of globalization, capitalism, and state-perpetuated power dynamics, as well as readers with a substantive interest in human trafficking, migration, exploitation, and policing will find insightful. First and foremost a study of transnational policing, using sex-trafficking as a exemplar case, <italic>Transnational Policing and Sex Trafficking in Southeast Europe</italic> includes theoretical and document reviews and interviews to make the case that transnational policing operations, such as Mirage enacted in Southeast Europe against sex-trafficking, not only further entrench power relations in capitalist societies, but begin to erode democracy and freedom. The author argues that previous theoretical understandings of transnational policing have failed to recognize its role in the political, ideological, and economic struggle in society, and have largely ignored the hierarchical nature of international regulation, international organization, and national police activities. The author asserts that policing is not a power that is exercised under conditions of rationality and neutrality, but is, rather, an apparatus utilized in class struggle, pre-determined by the state’s place in globalized processes, and one that actively participates in the social organization that produces crime. As such, the operation, and eventual demise, of transnational policing endeavors such as Mirage must be understood as an imperialist project in the post-Communist region of Southeast Europe, carried out under the guise of anti-trafficking advocacy. Operation Mirage, Papanicolaou concludes, ultimately completed its imperialist objectives by incorporating that region into the global capitalist regime, and dictated labor strategies—transforming questions of migrant labor exploitation into those of sex-trafficking and organized crime, marginalizing the exploitation of economic immigrants and reifying their position as the subordinate under-class.</p>
<p>Papanicolaou makes the bulk of these arguments in Chapters Two–Six, which can be separated into two general sections: theory and practice. The second and third chapters of this book cover the theoretical development of transnational policing, as well as a critique of theories of international relations, globalization, and sociology that are traditionally used to explain transnational policing. These chapters also begin to outline Papanicolaou’s arguments using state and imperialist theories. Chapters Four and Five move the reader into a discussion of international sex-trafficking policy, and the basis for Operation Mirage in Southeast Europe, whereas Chapter Six concludes the analysis with a specific focus on transnational policing of sex-trafficking in Greece.</p>
