<p>Early in his study of the German-Danish border region of Sleswig, Peter Thaler quotes Lord Palmerston’s famous characterization of the ‘Schleswig-Holstein question’, which preoccupied European statesmen in the mid-nineteenth century, as ‘so complicated that only three men in Europe have ever understood it. One was Prince Albert, who is dead. The second was a German professor, and he became mad. I am the third, and I have forgotten all about it’ (27). For historians, as for nineteenth-century diplomats, contested national borderlands have tended to be compartmentalized as impenetrably obscure curiosities. Thaler’s lean book (about 160 pages of text) aims to overcome such marginalization, harnessing analysis of Sleswig’s historical dynamics to a broader inquiry into the nature of national identity.</p>
<p>Inevitably, however, a book on Sleswig (Thaler deliberately uses an older designation for the province to avoid the current German or Danish labels) needs to provide readers with substantial background information. Thaler provides this orientation through a kind of double-narrative: Chapter Two recounts the region’s political history, while Chapter Three traces linguistic and cultural developments. In the former, we see that the notorious intractability of the Schleswig-Holstein question was but one example of the interplay of Europe’s late medieval and early modern composite monarchies. Sleswig’s rulers fatefully linked it both to the kingdom of Denmark to the north and to the duchy of Holstein to the south, the former outside of the Holy Roman Empire, the latter within it. This political ambiguity was paralleled by mixed and fluid patterns of linguistic usage. A German vernacular tended to predominate in the south, a Danish vernacular in the north, but in the late medieval and early modern periods, German often served as an administrative and church language even in areas that were largely Danish-speaking. Such overlaps, in both political sovereignty and linguistic orientation, were increasingly seen as untenable in the nineteenth century, as governments and national activists sought to clarify geographic frontiers and individuals’ national belonging.</p>
<p>Chapter Three offers a more in-depth analysis of the region from the late nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century. Thaler looks first at Danish minority organizations prior to the First World War, when all of Sleswig was under Prussian rule, then at the German minority organizations that emerged in the portion of Sleswig transferred to Danish rule after a 1920 plebiscite. In each case, activists’ goals oscillated between minimalist aims of cultural maintenance and aspirations for frontier revision that would win/restore their majority status. But the most fascinating part of this chapter is Thaler’s discussion of the Danish minority in southern Sleswig. When the Danish cause failed to win a majority in this part of the region in 1920, ensuring that it remained under German rule, the Danish cultural minority seemed increasingly beleaguered, with support eroding through the interwar period. After 1945, however, Danish minority organizations witnessed an extraordinary revival, especially at the party-political level. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, this surge seems to have had a strong regionalist/nativist thrust, differentiating locals from the influx of German refugees entering the region from the East. In later decades, enrolment in Danish minority schools seems to have become fashionable among many residents with little or no Danish cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Thaler’s fifth chapter brings a shift in methodological gears. Here he traces a number of individual biographies, investigating how borderland dynamics shaped individual self-identification. His first two case studies involve political figures from the early nineteenth century, one of whom (Nicolaus Falk) clung to a concilationist approach that attempted to preserve Sleswig’s hybrid status, while the other (Christian Paulsen) eventually moved towards a more explicitly Danish-national orientation. A third biography from the early twentieth century examines a figure (Cornelius Petersen) with roots in the Frisian linguistic community who combined a centrist straddling of the German-Danish divide with a decidedly <italic>völkisch</italic>-nativist streak, leading to flirtation with the National Socialists later in life. Thaler then discusses a collection of testimonies by Sleswigers who became associated, to varying degrees, with Danish nationality during the late twentieth century. He further complicates this picture by concluding with the case of Siegfried Matlok, who went from writing for a Danish-language minority paper in Germany to writing for a German-language minority paper in Denmark. In summing up these disparate life stories, Thaler sensibly emphasizes the importance of individual agency, even wilfulness, but also the constraints of structural cultural factors, such as opportunities for language acquisition. Sleswigers and other borderlanders might make their own nationality, but not just as they pleased.</p>
<p>Bracketing these chapters on Sleswig are an introductory chapter discussing recent theoretical literature on nationalism and a comparative chapter briefly discussing various East-European borderlands: Poznania, Mauria, Upper Silesia, Memel, Styria. The last of these chapters is a rather fascinating collection of mini-case studies, and there is a plausible overarching argument here: that local cultural and demographic peculiarities limited the impact of state-driven nationalization in the modern era, but that these peculiarities are themselves amenable to systematic comparative analysis. Nonetheless, this section covers too much ground too quickly and thus remains intriguingly suggestive rather than satisfyingly convincing.</p>
<p>Indeed, the book as a whole could have benefited from more careful knitting together of its component bits and pieces and greater integration of its lines of argument. But this is nonetheless a very rich and perceptive study, one that will not only enlighten readers eager to understand the fabled complexities of Sleswig, but also provide food for thought for all students of nationalism.</p>
