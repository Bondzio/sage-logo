<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the last decade, the field of laparoscopy has revolved around 2 issues: increasing the number of conditions that can be resolved laparoscopically and minimizing trauma to the abdominal wall. It was this second notion that led to the development of “minilaparoscopy,” to natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), and to single-incision laparoscopy.</p>
<p>NOTES can be looked upon as a paradigmatic development, but although its feasibility and safety have been amply demonstrated in clinical settings, it has not been fully implemented or deployed to date because some questions regarding its safety and certain technological limitations remain unanswered. However, innovations resulting from research surrounding NOTES have made it possible to introduce several “transitional technologies” aimed at bringing minimally invasive surgery up to necessary effectiveness and safety standards, with single-incision surgery being at present the most attractive approach.</p>
<p>Drawing on the latest strides in endoscopic surgery, we have developed a type of “fusion” surgery based on previous experience with the use of the flexible endoscope for NOTES<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612451355">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612451355"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612451355">3</xref></sup> and with the new umbilical approaches in single-incision surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612451355">4</xref></sup> This novel approach represents a fusion between NOTES and single-incision surgery, as the procedure is performed through a single umbilical incision using a flexible endoscope. This technique, known as flexible single-incision surgery (FSIS) because of the use of a single incision and of a flexible endoscope, has several concrete advantages over single-incision laparoscopy and NOTES.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1553350612451355" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We examine a prospective series of 30 consecutive patients with cholelithiasis who underwent single-incision cholecystectomy using a flexible endoscope (FSIS). Surgery was performed on a total of 30 patients (16 men and 14 women) over the period from January through May 2010.</p>
<p>We applied the following inclusion criteria: patients between 18 and 65 years of age with surgical risk at the ASA 1-2 level, those with uncomplicated cholelithiasis and no abdominal wall hernias, and those who gave signed informed consent as recommended by the local research ethics committee. Exclusion criteria were a history of prior surgery, the presence of chronic debilitating or immunosuppressive disease, or failure to commit to postoperative follow-up.</p>
<p>The surgery was performed under general anesthesia with patients placed in the modified Lloyd-Davies position, and prophylaxis with antibiotics was administered in the form of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid at a dose of 2 g intravenously. The technique consists of a single upper periumbilical incision measuring 25 mm in length through which 3 ports are introduced: 1 port measuring 11 mm for inserting the flexible endoscope without a trocar and 2 parallel accessory ports composed of 2 trocars, one 3 mm and the other 5 mm in length, or both measuring 5 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612451355">Figure 1</xref>). The surgery begins with the creation of pneumoperitoneum with a Veress needle, and the cavity is then accessed with the 11-mm trocar, which is subsequently replaced with the flexible, double-channel endoscope (video gastroscope 13806 PKS, Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). The abdominal cavity is explored to rule out cholecystitis or unexpected findings, whereupon 2 trocars are placed parallel to the endoscope and oriented toward the abdominal quadrant to be operated on (bladeless low profile trocar, Versaport; Covidien, Norwalk, CT). Conventional nonarticulated laparoscopic equipment is used: gripping forceps, dissector, dissecting hook, and scissors. The flexible endoscope allows for different angles of vision and does not interfere with the movement of the various instruments, since it is located in a different plane. It also allows for the use of gripping forceps and for performing dissection maneuvers using the electrocoagulation electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612451355">Figure 2</xref>). Pneumoperitoneum is maintained with the 5-mm trocar valve, although it can also be maintained through the channel of the endoscope. The cystic duct and cystic artery are clipped with a conventional surgical clip.</p>

</fig>
<p>On completion of the cholecystectomy, the gallbladder is picked up with foreign body forceps introduced through one of the channels of the flexible endoscope and withdrawn through the umbilical port. If necessary, the larger aponeurotic incision can be joined with one or both of the parallel incisions to make extraction easier.</p>
<p>The aponeurosis is closed by simple suturing with interrupted stitches using polydioxanone coated with Triclosan antiseptic (PDS Plus, Ethicon Inc, Somerville, NJ), and the skin is closed with intradermal reabsorbable poliglecaprone monofilament suture material (Monocryl Plus, Ethicon Inc).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The prescribed procedure was performed in the entire series of 30 patients. The percentage needing conversion to laparoscopic surgery or another surgical approach was zero (0%). The average hospital stay was 0.8 days, with 6 patients having been discharged from the major ambulatory surgical care unit less than 12 hours after surgery.</p>
<p>The mean patient follow-up was 7.3 months (range = 6-10), and only a single abdominal wall complication (3.33%) was noted. It was a superficial infection of the umbilical area with non-methicillin-resistant staphylococci that was easily resolved. No umbilical hernias have occurred.</p>
<p>Mean surgical time, from the beginning of the first incision to skin closure, was 54 minutes (range = 38-75). Surgery lasted more than 50 minutes in patients with omental adhesions and with fatty livers and an enlarged left lobe that made it difficult to correctly expose the hepatic pedicle.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1553350612451355" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The cholecystectomy technique described herein, known as flexible single-incision surgery (FSIS), was designed in training boxes with a simulator, as well as in experimental animals, drawing on prior experience with transvaginal NOTES and with single-port surgery, both in animals and humans. We succeeded in using the technique to perform cholecystectomy on 100% of the cases in whom the procedure was indicated, with a rate of infection (3.33%) compatible with clean surgery. While follow-up has been admittedly short, no general problems or abdominal wall hernias have occurred.</p>
<p>The surgical time involved in FSIS is much shorter than for transvaginal NOTES cholecystectomy and very similar to the time involved in single-incision cholecystectomy using articulated laparoscopic instruments: 56.5 minutes in the series by Ji<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612451355">5</xref></sup> and 66.5 minutes in the series by Duron et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612451355">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The supraumbilical incision is as long as or shorter than the incision required for surgery involving a single-port device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350612451355">Figure 3A</xref>). The procedure’s safety is never compromised and is even improved, since the instruments never bump into the optical device, and no unforeseen jumping of the instruments results from movement difficulties caused by space constraints. It should be borne in mind that when the endoscope enters the cavity, it drops and settles on the mesentery while searching for the gallbladder with its flexible point raised. This prevents it from restricting the mobility of the laparoscopic ports, which can move about quite freely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350612451355">Figure 3B</xref>). Owing to the fact that the 2 entry ports are independent of each other (there is no single-port device) and of the optical device (flexible endoscope), the use of conventional, nonarticulated and non-preshaped laparoscopic instruments poses no problems. Ports and instruments measuring 5 mm, or 3 mm in one case and 5 mm in the other, can be used depending on availability, prior experience with minilaparoscopy, and the size and consistency of the target organ. The gallbladder can be removed through the orifice in which the endoscope is introduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350612451355">Figure 3C</xref>), or alternatively, the various incisions can be joined if necessary.</p>

<p>A, The incision required for FSIS is shorter than that required for single-incision surgery using an entry device. B, For laparoscopic instruments the working channels are completely separate from the optical device, making triangulation maneuvers possible. C, The organ is removed through the larger aponeurotic incision, which is the one corresponding to the endoscope, making it possible to view the surgical field at all times.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1553350612451355-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Use of the flexible endoscope adds 2 additional working channels to single-incision surgery, which is thus transformed into surgery with 4 potential arms. At this time we are only using these channels separately for traction, endoscopic dissection, or organ removal: in the future, however, when articulated channels become available, using them as genuine working ports will become possible.</p>
<p>The absence of an additional single-port device and of articulated instruments makes this approach extremely economical, since the entire technique can be performed with inventory materials, except for the clip dispenser and the 2 entry trocars. This is a reproducible technique that incorporates the benefits of single-incision surgery at a very low cost. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350612451355">Table 1</xref> shows the differences between transvaginal NOTES, single-port surgery, and FSIS. In our hospital center, more than 30 FSIS procedures have been performed with 100% feasibility and reproducibility and with minimal complications in connection with either the procedure or the surgical approach. This is a promising avenue within the context of minimally invasive surgery that will allow for further development of natural-orifice endoscopic surgery.</p>
