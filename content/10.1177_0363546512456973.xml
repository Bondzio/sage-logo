<sec id="section1-0363546512456973">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>In the past 3 years, 6 volleyball players with ischemic digits and small microemboli in the digital arteries of the dominant hand presented themselves in our hospital. These complaints were caused by an aneurysmatic dilation of the posterior circumflex humeral artery (PCHA) with distal occlusion and digital emboli in the isolateral limb. All were elite male volleyball players active in the national top league. Little is known about the exact symptoms associated with PCHA pathological lesions with digital emboli (PCHAP with DE) and its prevalence in elite volleyball players. If vascular injury can be identified at an early stage, thromboembolic complications and irreversible damage to the digits might be prevented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512456973">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To assess the prevalence of symptoms that are consistent with digital ischemia and may be caused by PCHAP with DE in elite male volleyball players in the Netherlands.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512456973">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512456973">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A questionnaire survey was performed among elite volleyball players in the Dutch national top league and the Dutch beach volleyball team. The questionnaire was constructed using literature-based data on symptoms associated with PCHAP with DE, together with data retrieved from medical files.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512456973">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>A total of 99 of the 107 athletes participated, with a response rate of 93%. The most frequently reported symptoms associated with PCHAP with DE were cold, blue, or pale digits in the dominant hand during or immediately after practice or competition. The prevalence of these symptoms ranged from 11% to 27%. The prevalence of cold digits during practice and competition was 27%. The prevalence of cold, blue, and pale digits during or immediately after practice and competition was 12%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512456973">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>An unexpectedly high percentage of elite volleyball players reported symptoms that are associated with PCHAP with DE in the dominant hand. Because these athletes are considered potentially at risk for developing critical digital ischemia, further analysis of the presence of digital ischemia and PCHA injury is warranted.</p>

<p>In the past 3 years, we have seen increased numbers of volleyball players with ischemic digits of the dominant hand. Following angiography of the hand and forearm, some of these players showed small microemboli in the digital arteries and were given thrombolytic therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512456973">Figure 1</xref>). Within weeks after return to play, these players returned with identical complaints. Further evaluations, including angiography of the shoulder, showed an aneurysmatic dilation of the posterior circumflex humeral artery (PCHA) with thrombus formation and emboli in the digital arteries of the isolateral limb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512456973">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363546512456973">2</xref>). These players were treated by ligation of the PCHA to prevent further embolization and after rehabilitation returned to play at the highest level of competition after several weeks. All were elite male volleyball players playing in the national top league and were between 21 and 31 years of age.</p>

<p>In the Netherlands, with a total population of about 17 million, volleyball is 1 of the top 3 team sports and is played by more than 125,000 athletes on different levels. Of these athletes, some 110 elite volleyball players are active in the Dutch national top league. The presence of an aneurysm of the PCHA is a rare entity found in elite volleyball players<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512456973">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512456973">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512456973">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512456973">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512456973">26</xref></sup> and often occurs at the origin of the PCHA but can also involve the axillary artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512456973">8</xref></sup> Besides volleyball players, PCHA pathological lesions with digital emboli (PCHAP with DE) have also been described in the literature in baseball pitchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512456973">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512456973">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512456973">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512456973">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512456973">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512456973">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512456973">25</xref></sup> During the spiking or serving motion in volleyball, when the humeral head acts to compress the aneurysmal PCHA and the intraluminal thrombus like a tube of toothpaste, thrombi can be extruded from the aneurysmal artery branch into the axillary artery and embolize to the circulation of the forearm, hand, and digits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512456973">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512456973">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512456973">10</xref></sup> The embolic complications of the affected extremity, in combination with pain and ischemia, can lead to the manifestation of this entity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512456973">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512456973">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512456973">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aneurysm is occult as long as the player is free of symptoms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512456973">26</xref></sup> and collateral flow is so abundant that symptoms may not occur except at the highest levels of exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512456973">8</xref></sup> It is therefore recommended that these athletes be kept under periodic surveillance to detect an arterial injury or abnormality to prevent irreversible damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512456973">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512456973">21</xref></sup> However, little is known about the exact symptoms associated with PCHAP with DE in elite volleyball players or the exact prevalence of these symptoms in these players. Many players would presumably have some degree of compression of the PCHA in an abducted and externally rotated position but will never develop any clinical abnormality requiring treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512456973">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512456973">21</xref></sup> Therefore, active surveillance of elite volleyball players with these symptoms could clarify the prevalence of these symptoms associated with PCHAP with DE. This type of surveillance has not been performed to date. Also, no screening or surveillance is currently available for this diagnosis. If a vascular injury can be identified at an early stage in these volleyball players who experience apparently innocuous symptoms, thromboembolic complications and irreversible damage to the digits might be prevented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512456973">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512456973">21</xref></sup> The aim of the present study was (1) to assess which symptoms are most likely associated with PCHAP with DE and (2) to assess the prevalence of these symptoms in the dominant limb among elite male volleyball players in the Dutch national top league and in the Dutch beach volleyball team.</p>

<title>Study Design</title>
<p>A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was completed among elite volleyball players in the Dutch national top league and the Dutch beach volleyball team.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363546512456973">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>In cooperation with the Dutch Volleyball Association (Nevobo), all team managers of the Dutch national top league teams and the Dutch beach volleyball team were contacted and asked to participate in the study. After permission had been granted by the coaches, a researcher (D.v.d.P.) visited the team, explained the aim of the study and the type of injury that they were potentially exposed to, and requested that the questionnaire be filled in right after a practice session during the competitive season. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. Questionnaires and return envelopes were left behind for players absent at the time of the visit. This survey was administered once during the 2010-2011 season. After 1 and 3 weeks, a polite reminder was sent by e-mail, requesting that the questionnaire be returned within 1 month after the initial group session. No official approval of the Medical Ethics Review Committee at our academic hospital was needed for this questionnaire survey to be conducted.</p>

<title>Questionnaire Content</title>
<p>After a literature review, a questionnaire was developed to detect ischemic symptoms using reports of the same patients with confirmed abnormalities of the PCHA. The focus of the study was to detect ischemic symptoms known to be associated with DE from an abnormal PCHA and to determine the frequency of these symptoms. The symptoms are usually temporary and resolve after volleyball participation. This preliminary survey was evaluated by 4 members of the Dutch beach volleyball team to improve its readability. The questionnaire comprised 2 general domains: those regarding the individual player and those regarding specific symptoms associated with digital ischemia. The questions used in this study are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512456973">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Symptoms From Medical Literature</title>
<p>A search in PubMed and SPORTDiscus was performed to identify studies that reported on cases of PCHAP with DE. The search was carried out from the earliest date possible to July 7, 2011, using a combination of the following keywords (MeSH and/or text words): “aneurysm” AND “posterior circumflex humeral artery” AND “volleyball.” This resulted in 4 references in PubMed and 1 reference in SPORTDiscus. Studies were included if they reported on at least 1 case of PCHAP with DE in elite volleyball players and if symptoms of the disease were reported. After checking for duplicates, this resulted in the inclusion of 3 studies. Furthermore, checking the reference list of the included studies resulted in 1 additional study. Finally, an expert at our academic hospital suggested 1 more study, resulting in 5 studies being included: 5 case reports on a total of 9 elite volleyball players with PCHAP with DE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512456973">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512456973">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512456973">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512456973">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546512456973">26</xref></sup></p>

<p>An expert on sports radiology (M.M.) provided a list of elite volleyball players who visited our academic hospital with complaints suspected of being a vascular injury. These medical files were analyzed, and patient reports were included if they involved volleyball players at a national or regional level diagnosed with PCHAP with DE without another comorbidity and if they received treatment at our hospital for the injury.

<title>Selection of Symptoms Associated With PCHAP With DE</title>
<p>To specify which symptoms are most likely associated with PCHAP with DE, the symptoms mentioned in the medical literature and medical files were reviewed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546512456973">Table 2</xref>). We decided that symptoms suggesting an association should be reported as present in at least 50% of the patients from the medical literature and/or medical files and should not be reported as absent in these patients. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546512456973">Table 2</xref>, only complaints of cold digits in general, cold digits during or immediately after practice or competition, and discolored digits (all in the dominant hand) met this criterion. General pain was excluded because 1 patient reported the absence of this symptom. In addition, it is hard to distinguish ischemic pain from pain resulting from trauma, and as a result, a positive answer on this question could potentially lead to high false-positive rates because of this symptom. Finally, this decision was supported by Jackson,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512456973">8</xref></sup> who stated that the signs of ischemia that typically distinguish arterial injuries from musculoskeletal injuries are those of changes in temperature and color.</p>
<p>Additionally, these symptoms had to occur during or immediately after practice or competition because symptoms are most likely to occur at high levels of exercise,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512456973">8</xref></sup> when during the spiking motion in volleyball, thrombi can be extruded from the aneurysmal PCHA into the axillary artery and embolize to the circulation of the forearm, hand, and digits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512456973">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512456973">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512456973">10</xref></sup> This is supported by the high percentage of patients who reported cold digits specifically during or after practice or competition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546512456973">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512456973">Table 1</xref> shows the formulated questions based on these symptoms labeled as associated with PCHAP with DE, as asked in the questionnaire.</p>

<p>The data from the returned questionnaires were entered in SPSS (version 16.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). The questionnaires were randomly checked for correct data entry by a second researcher (P.F.M.K.). The mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum of age, body height, body weight, total years playing volleyball, years playing professional volleyball, and weekly hours playing volleyball in practice or competition were reported for the group as a whole. Also, the percentages of volleyball players who reported a family history of cardiovascular disease and (had) smoked were reported.</p>
<p>The prevalence of symptoms associated with PCHAP with DE was calculated in the following manner: the percentage of all volleyball players who sometimes or more often reported having cold or blue or pale digits in the dominant hand during or directly after practice or competition. The prevalence of a combination of these symptoms associated with PCHAP with DE was calculated in the following manner: the percentage of all volleyball players who sometimes or more often reported having cold and blue and pale digits in the dominant hand during or directly after practice or competition.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main finding of this questionnaire survey among 99 elite volleyball players is that 27% of respondents reported that they sometimes or more often suffered from cold digits in the dominant hand during practice or competition, with 17% reporting this complaint immediately after practice or competition. Moreover, 12% suffered from a combination of cold and pale and blue digits in the dominant hand during or immediately after practice or competition. One would not expect such high rates of complaints, highly related to digital ischemia and potentially caused by vascular disease, among young, healthy, and fit elite athletes with a mean age of 24 years.</p>
<sec id="section19-0363546512456973">
<title>Strengths and Weaknesses of the Study</title>
<p>A total of about 110 elite volleyball players across 10 teams are active in the Dutch national top league. Nine of these teams participated in the study, and 91 of the 99 players from these teams completed the questionnaire as well as 8 of 8 elite volleyball players from the Dutch beach volleyball team. As a result, 99 of 107 players completed the survey, with a response rate of 93%. Because of this high percentage, the obtained results are representative of the actual prevalence of reported complaints associated with digital ischemia and potentially because of PCHAP with DE among male elite volleyball players in the Netherlands in the 2010-2011 season.</p>
<p>Because the surveyed symptoms were derived from data from the medical literature, together with data retrieved from medical files, these symptoms are related to digital ischemia and potentially caused by vascular disease. This contributes to the content validity of our questionnaire. Moreover, the symptoms were surveyed in a clear and understandable language and are easily recognized by the players, ensuring the reliability of the answers. The sensitivity and specificity of the surveyed symptoms for digital ischemia and PCHAP with DE in our study population have yet to be determined. The presence of these symptoms in elite volleyball players can also be explained by a wide variety of vascular lesions including cardiac embolism, atherosclerosis, vasculitides, arterial thoracic outlet syndrome, hypothenar hammer syndrome, quadrilateral space syndrome, and vasomotor disorders such as Raynaud phenomenon. Given the young age of these athletes, and their high levels of fitness, the presence of cardiac embolism, atherosclerosis, and vasculitides seems unlikely to be the cause of the complaints. Of the other disorders, Raynaud phenomenon is the most common, with a prevalence of 8% in white men in the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512456973">24</xref></sup> and 1% to 10% in Dutch men depending on the definition used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512456973">2</xref></sup> In contrast, the median age at onset of primary Raynaud phenomenon is 14 years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512456973">27</xref></sup> while secondary Raynaud phenomenon often arises after the age of 40 years with the underlying disease frequently evident at the time of disease onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512456973">3</xref></sup> Furthermore, Raynaud phenomenon spreads symmetrically to all fingers of both hands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546512456973">27</xref></sup> The other disorders are even less common in this demographic. Therefore, other potential causes are considered less likely. Because the symptoms of the above-mentioned lesions overlap that of digital ischemia and PCHAP with DE, sports medicine specialists should remain alert to the possibility of vascular injury in elite athletes using repetitive overhead arm motions and complaining of ischemia-related symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512456973">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512456973">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512456973">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512456973">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512456973">21</xref></sup> When an athlete presents with these symptoms, further investigation should demonstrate which exact condition is the cause. It is important to realize that all these diseases should be taken seriously and, if not diagnosed in time, can lead to significant functional impairment and a worsened prognosis.</p>
<p>To verify whether the symptoms described in the study population are actually associated with digital ischemia and PCHAP with DE, additional research is required. Contrast arteriography is the gold standard for visualizing the upper limb arterial system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512456973">7</xref></sup> with computed tomography angiography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512456973">7</xref></sup> and magnetic resonance angiography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512456973">4</xref></sup> as alternatives. However, these methods are time consuming, expensive, and invasive. An alternative might be noninvasive vascular laboratory testing like the measurement of finger pressures and waveforms. Although these studies can confirm or rule out digital ischemia, they cannot identify the source of injury in the face of an abnormal test result.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512456973">8</xref></sup> Additional imaging like ultrasound with Doppler is an easy, quick, and reliable way to assess the axillary artery and its branches, like the PCHA, and thus identify any incipient compression, thrombosis, or aneurysm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512456973">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512456973">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512456973"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512456973">20</xref></sup> These methods provide a noninvasive and quick way to assess the sensitivity and specificity of our questionnaire regarding the prediction of digital ischemia and PCHAP with DE.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0363546512456973">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>The high prevalence of suspicious complaints among healthy volleyball players suggests that the number of volleyball players seen with symptoms of digital ischemia potentially as a result of PCHAP with DE represents only a fraction of the number of volleyball players who suffer from less innocuous symptoms of ischemic digits. This may be the result of an early stage of this disease, stressing the importance of active surveillance and a better insight into modifiable risk factors to achieve effective prevention.</p>
<p>Active surveillance should make it possible to identify a vascular injury at an early stage in those volleyball players who experience apparently innocuous symptoms. In this way, thromboembolic complications and irreversible damage to the digits might be prevented,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512456973">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512456973">21</xref></sup> thereby possibly making surgical ligation of the PCHA unnecessary. This type of surveillance among elite volleyball players to identify those with PCHA compression, thrombosis, or aneurysm has not been performed to date because this type of screening could potentially lead to many false-positive results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512456973">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512456973">21</xref></sup> However, the team physician could offer a short screening questionnaire, for example, twice a year, to his or her team to identify those players with inducing or exacerbating complaints of cold or discolored digits. Because symptoms mostly occur during practice or competition, surveillance might be most relevant after periods with increased physical activity, such as a few weeks after the start of the training season and a few weeks after the winter recess. Players might be more vulnerable in these periods. In this way, players with suspicious symptoms can be selected, and after history taking and a physical examination, a referral for the appropriate vascular tests can be made. Moreover, by completing the questionnaire, the volleyball player himself hopefully becomes more aware that the apparently innocuous symptoms can ultimately lead to a serious injury. The characteristics of this condition meet most of the criteria of Wilson and Jungner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546512456973">28</xref></sup> and would therefore be suitable for surveillance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, given the high prevalence of complaints suspicious to digital ischemia in this young population of healthy athletes, modifiable risk factors should be identified to achieve effective prevention. Potential risk factors include personal, sports-related, and work-related risk factors. An example of a personal risk factor is an anatomic variance of the origin of the arteria circumflexa humeri,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512456973">25</xref></sup> possibly resulting in a predisposition for vascular injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512456973">17</xref></sup> This anatomic variation has not been described in our included medical files and case reports. Examples of sports-related risk factors are the number of hours playing volleyball in a week, the number of spikes in a practice session, position in the field, and number of hours performing strength training above shoulder height. McIntosh et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512456973">11</xref></sup> suggested that guidelines need to be developed for practice time and/or number of hits per day. Finally, the influence of physical strain during daily working activities could be a contributing factor. Examples might be working with vibrating tools and performing repetitive work with the arms above shoulder height.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512456973">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512456973">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512456973">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0363546512456973">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, symptoms of cold, blue, or pale digits in the dominant hand during or immediately after practice or competition are related to digital ischemia and seem to be associated with PCHAP with DE. An unexpectedly high percentage of interviewed elite male volleyball players in the Netherlands reported these symptoms: depending on these symptoms (or a combination of them), the prevalence varied between 27% and 11%. Because these athletes are considered potentially at risk for developing critical digital ischemia, further analysis of the presence of digital ischemia and lesions of the PCHA is warranted. In addition, more attention should be given to periodic surveillance and prevention.</p>
