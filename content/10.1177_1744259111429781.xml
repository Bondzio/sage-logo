<abstract>
<p>Effect of two kinds of fly ash collected from the thermal power plants on the green properties and sintering behavior of clay ceramic tile bodies was investigated. Flow time, unit weight, color difference, water absorption, flexural strength, and linear shrinkage of the ceramic samples with four different fly ash percentages of replacement with feldspath varying between 0% and 20% by weight were determined. Furthermore, thermal characterization and morphology of phases of selected ceramic compositions were studied. This work proves the possibility of using fly ashes with appropriate physicochemical properties in manufacturing porous clay ceramic tiles with satisfactory features suitable for construction industry. Comparison of the properties of the resulting tile bodies with varying proportions of different fly ashes indicated that tiles with acceptable properties can be obtained by introducing up to 10% of fly ash by weight into the clay ceramic mixes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fly ash leads to problems of disposal in landfills and storage lagoons as well as environmental damage by causing air and water pollution on a large scale. Approximately, 15 million tonnes of fly ash is being produced annually in Turkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744259111429781">Degirmenci et al., 2007</xref>) while a very small amount of it is being used in the construction industry.</p>
<p>Due to the shortages of raw materials and high energy consumptions, construction companies are in search of alternative cheaper materials such as waste materials. However, the sintering of clay–fly ash compositions and their effects on the properties of the ceramic tiles cannot be predicted without special research.</p>
<p>There are numerous applications in which it is necessary or useful to create a porous volume into a ceramic material. The presence of pores is beneficial to reduce the thermal conductivity, which is important in refractory and thermal insulation materials. Porous ceramics are often attractive in applications that involve high temperature and corrosive environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744259111429781">Mortensen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>An effective method for controlling the microstructure and properties of ceramics consists of introducing various additives into mixture compositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744259111429781">Abdurakhmanov et al., 2000</xref>). These additives are used in production of clay brick, lightweight refractories, and other products. Furthermore, various fluxes (substances to molten powders at low temperatures to provide bonding together) and mineralizers are added in order to change the sintering process and the formation of ceramic structure in a positive way in firing. One of the main problems in the development of ceramic mixtures for accelerated firing is the selection of flux additives, preferably from local sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744259111429781">Shiltseva and Vereshchagin, 1999</xref>). The main items in the production of ceramic tiles are raw materials and electricity and fuel costs. It is generally acknowledged that the largest decrease of energy consumption for production can be attained by adopting a technology that permits one-time firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744259111429781">Zubekhin et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of two different coal fly ashes as a raw material in the production of clay ceramic tiles with desirable properties suitable for utilization in the construction sector. To predict the role of fly ash in the mixture is difficult due to the different physicochemical factors in the manufacturing process of ceramic tiles considering the viscosity of green mixtures and sintering process. Thus, two different types of fly ash owing different chemical and mineralogical compositions were used in production of ceramic tiles to investigate their behavior during mixing, milling, and sintering. For this purpose, ceramic bodies were prepared by progressive incorporation of fly ashes in place of feldspar in different amounts ranging from 0% to 20% by weight.</p>

<p>Fly ashes used in this study were provided from Tuncbilek (TFA) and Seyitomer (SFA) Power Plants, Kutahya, Turkey. The chemical compositions of fly ashes as received are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744259111429781">Table 1</xref>. These fly ashes are classified according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744259111429781">ASTM C 618 (1998)</xref> as Class F accounting the low content of calcium oxide and high content of SiO<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Standard powder of a commercial tile composition (coded as STN in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744259111429781">Table 1</xref>) containing clay, feldspar, and silica sand was also collected from one of the tile manufacturers and tested under same experimental conditions to compare them with the present compositions. Feldspar was replaced with increasing amounts of fly ashes. The other ingredients were maintained under constant composition: silica sand 5%, clay A (illitic clay) 49%, and clay B (magnesium-rich clay) 3%. The compositions of the experimental mixes, containing two differently originated fly ashes from Tuncbilek (TFA) and Seyitomer (SFA) thermal power plants in order to determine their effects on the properties of ceramic tiles, are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1744259111429781">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the production of the ceramic bodies, sodium silicate Na<sub>2</sub>O·<italic>n</italic>SiO<sub>2</sub> (water glass) was used as deffloculant and electrolyte for ceramics instead of sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP), however obtained proper viscosity could not be maintained its consistency same with time. In the trial batches mentioned in this study, TPP was more efficient than water glass. The thinning effect was achieved by introducing TPP, whereas the introduction of water glass led to the thickening (coagulation) of the solid material–water system. Fly ashes used in tile production differ in their mineralogical and chemical compositions, degree of dispersion, and content of impurities which had an effect on the liquescence. Therefore, TPP was used and its content was kept constant as 1.7% by weight of the total dry mixture in all the compositions in order to eliminate its influence on properties of green and fired ceramic tile samples and to provide sufficient viscosity and suitable amount of residue of particles on 0.063 mm sieve. It is known that the granulometry plays a very important role in the sintering process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744259111429781">Couchman and Jesser, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744259111429781">Mondal et al., 2010</xref>). The melting temperature of very fine particles decreases with the size of the particles. In the case of fine powders, the grain boundary sliding, dislocation motion, grain rotation, and viscous flow can significantly contribute to the enhanced sintering kinetics. In trial batches, different TPP contents were added into the compositions with TFA for constant 32 min-milling time and the results of viscosity, unit weight, and residue on 63 µm sieve are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1744259111429781">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<title>Production of ceramic tiles</title>
<p>Ceramic bodies were prepared by wet ground in porcelain drums in a laboratory mill using combined milling of all components, to a residue of 4.5%–5.5% on mesh no. 0063 with a water content of 50%. The residue on a no. 0063 sieve was used to check the fineness and duration of grinding. Thus, milling durations for 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% fly ash content were 28, 27, 26, 25, and 24 min, respectively. The reason of decreasing duration of milling was decrease in feldspar contents in the batches. The mixture was dehydrated at temperature 150°C. Tiles with the dimensions 100.4 × 100.4 × 6 mm<sup>3</sup> were compacted in a laboratory hydraulic press with 5.5% moisture content under pressure 40 MPa for 10 s. The humidified mixture was sieved once again to avoid agglomeration due to the moisture. The mixture was thus prepared and left in a plastic bag for 12 h. Prior to the sintering process, the pressed body was dried at 110°C until at a constant mass in two successive measurements at an interval of 2 h. The sintering process of the tiles was performed in industrial roller furnace. The sintering proceeded as follows: time passed up to peak temperature was 20 min and duration of cooling was 10 min. The green bodies were then sintered at temperature of 1210°C with 6 min holding period at the final temperature.</p>

<sec id="section5-1744259111429781">
<title>Tests and analysis performed on ceramic bodies</title>
<p>The flow time, unit weight of mixtures, and the granulometry of the green powder according to residue in weight percentages on a sieve with a mesh opening of 63 µm were determined after milling in the laboratory ball mill as mentioned in section ‘Production of ceramic tiles’. The time needed for a certain amount of material to flow out of the cone was recorded as flow time. This flow time is linked with the material fluidity. The longer the flow time is, the lower the fluidity is.</p>
<p>The flexural strength of the green and sintered specimens was evaluated using a three-point flexural strength test on a universal testing machine (Gabrielli, Italy). The water absorption of the produced materials was determined by boiling water method using the procedure outlined in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744259111429781">ASTM C 20 (2000)</xref>. Sample shrinkage was determined from the differences in green and fired sample sizes. The tests were performed on three samples of each batch. The color measurements of sintered bodies were done using Minolta Chroma Meter (CR-300, Japan). The values are expressed as L (lightness factor) and chromaticity coordinates a (red) and b (yellow). The color difference (ΔE) was calculated as below:</p>

<title>Green properties of ceramic bodies</title>
<p>Flow time, residue, unit weight, and green flexural strength are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1744259111429781">Table 4</xref>. Addition of fly ashes into clay ceramic tile composition (TFA and SFA) showed different influence on suspension rheological behavior owing to the different amount of organic matters. In contrast to mixtures containing TFA, mixtures with SFA exhibited an increase in flow time. This increase in flow time can be solved with slightly changing the amount of electrolyte in order to decrease the viscosity as mentioned above in the trial mixtures performed on mixtures containing TFA. However, in the present study, electrolyte content was constant for all mixtures to eliminate the content effect of TPP on the properties of ceramic bodies. Electrolytes liquefy the mixtures by changing their rheological properties. They decrease the flow time and viscosity when proper amount of electrolytes are chosen. It is also observed that higher amounts of fly ashes in place of the feldspar caused slightly decrease in the unit weight and green strength values. Mixtures with SFA exhibited lower unit weight values than those with TFA. However, generally, ceramic bodies containing TFA showed better green properties than those containing SFA. The presence of the silanol groups (Si–OH) and increase in pH make the ceramic powders easy to disperse in aqueous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744259111429781">Myhre, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744259111429781">Prabhakaran et al., 2001</xref>). Depending on the pH, a fraction of the silanol groups dissociates resulting into a negatively charged surface. In the pH range of 10–11, the major components of fly ash such as alumina and silica acquire negative surface charge by deprotonation of the surface hydroxyl groups. Therefore, chemical composition of TFA was more suitable than of SFA to provide a proper dispersion.</p>

<title>Fired properties of ceramic bodies</title>
<p>Linear shrinkage, water absorption, and fired flexural strength are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1744259111429781">Table 5</xref>. Partial replacement of feldspar by fly ash significantly reduced the shrinkage values. Incorporation of fly ash in an amount of 15%–20% due to the formation of the pores promoted a decrease in the shrinkage of the specimens to zero values. It can be seen that specimens with fly ash content up to 10% showed almost similar shrinkage. Beyond this content, dissimilar trend was observed among the properties, namely shrinkage, absorption, and strength. Although bodies with SFA had lower strength and higher absorption, they showed higher shrinkage compared to those with TFA due to the presence of higher amounts of fluxing materials such as alkaline and alkaline–earth elements (K<sub>2</sub>O, Na<sub>2</sub>O, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MgO, and CaO). As the content increased further, the specimens swelled resulting from the evolved gases during the thermal decomposition reactions which is also detected in other researches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744259111429781">Ersoy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744259111429781">Kockal and Ozturan, 2011</xref>). The results indicated that the water absorption of bodies increased due to increase in the amount of fly ash. The variation in absorption was in agreement with strength data of all fly ash contents. The flexural strength of all the specimens decreased with increase in ash content. This may be attributed to the formation of more glassy phases at higher contents as observed by other researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744259111429781">Cheng and Chen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744259111429781">Karamberi and Moutsatsou, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744259111429781">Monteiro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744259111429781">Segadães et al., 2005</xref>). Also, higher ash content could enhance the grain growth, which was responsible for lowering the flexural strength from 48.08 to 19.72 MPa. Bodies with fly ash containing higher flux agents showed the development of the porous structure of the sintered body which is proven by the SEM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744259111429781">Figure 1</xref>). This body can be used to make facade and wall tiles. Firing these bodies with ash concentrations of more than 10% led to more bloating and deterioration in the physical properties of the tiles. Therefore, the body containing more than 10% fly ash may turn out to be promising for the production of isolation materials. Some researchers also obtained similar findings when they investigated porous ceramic bodies as isolation materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744259111429781">Carmeliet and Roels, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744259111429781">Fazio and Low, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744259111429781">Svoboda and Kubr, 2011</xref>). Together with traditional types of clay raw materials it is possible to use fly ashes in order to obtain porous and thermal insulation ceramics. The results enable us to recommend the optimum body containing not more than 10% of the fly ash.</p>

The ceramic tile with SFA showed larger color differences with sintering temperature than those with TFA, which means more sensibility to sintering conditions. The determination of the color difference of the sintered samples showed that the color varied from off-white (STN) to dark brown with increase in darkness as the amount of incorporated fly ashes, especially SFA, increased at pronounced sintering temperature. Ceramic tiles containing SFA had lower L values than tiles with TFA due to having higher amount of iron oxide and unburned impurities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744259111429781">Table 1</xref>).

<p>Low sintering temperatures should be present on bodies with fly ash to avoid reducing strength and increasing absorption. This effect may be partly eliminated by adding more silica sand and/or extracting magnesium-rich clay. Thus, silica sand will react as a filler in the framework of the sintered ceramic body resulting in restrained effect. Addition of fly ash as a low-cost raw material for the commercial production of ceramic tiles permits sintering at lower temperatures representing significant energy savings, equipment cost, and an additional economic advantage due to the fewer raw material demand. To conclude, it can be said that at low firing temperatures the water absorption will decrease and strength will increase with an increase in the amount of silica sand in the mixture composition which is accounted for the low flux content. That is why, these prescribed methods were chosen for subsequent investigation, which is not mentioned in detail here.</p>

<title>SEM observations and EDS analysis</title>
<p>SFA showed lower strength than TFA did due to the larger pores occurred after sintering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744259111429781">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, all samples sintered at 1210°C showed reduction in strength with increase in ash content. Some researchers indicated similar behavior that the incorporation of waste materials in the body clay increased the number of open pores, as indicated by the water absorption data and the SEM micrographs, thus decreasing the compressive strength and slightly increasing the thermal insulation properties of the bricks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744259111429781">Eliche-Quesada et al., 2011</xref>). Samples made with 20% TFA and SFA sintered at high temperatures were not tested because of defects on the surface of the samples that occurred. Reformulating several tiles to make them better suited to firing using lower schedules. Instead of magnesium-rich clay, more silica sand could be added into ceramic composition to prevent excessive defects on the surface at high temperature. Low temperatures can also be applied.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the presence of elements in ceramic tile bodies, EDS analysis coupled to the SEM was carried out. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744259111429781">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1744259111429781">Table 7</xref> illustrate the elemental composition of these bodies. EDS studies of the bodies showed that during sintering similar minerals were formed disregarding the composition. The reason of this similarity was due to the substitution of raw materials (feldspath and fly ashes) having nearly same oxide components. The observation of the EDS plot shows the presence of mainly silicon, aluminum, potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, and oxygen elements. However, it was also detected that there was no indication of the presence of CaO in standard tiles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1744259111429781">Table 7</xref>). Major chemical constituents of fly ash are CaO, SiO<sub>2</sub>, and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, registering a CaO–SiO<sub>2</sub>–Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744259111429781">Haiying et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, the fly ash can be used as a blending of ceramic tile whose raw materials feature a SiO<sub>2</sub>–Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>–CaO–Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> system. These findings presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1744259111429781">Table 7</xref> are related to the chemical compositions of the raw materials shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744259111429781">Table 1</xref>. In other words, the content of these phases depends upon the oxide components of fly ashes and feldspath. For instance; in the case of ceramic tiles with SFA, the SiO<sub>2</sub> decreased while CaO, MgO, and K<sub>2</sub>O increased compared to the other tiles. The presence of these elements obtained in EDS studies could also be evidences for crystallizations and their quantities emerged after sintering such as quartz and cristobalite (SiO<sub>2</sub>), albite (NaAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>), anorthite (CaAl<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>), mullite (3Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>·2SiO<sub>2</sub>) and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744259111429781">Chandra et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744259111429781">Das et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744259111429781">Little et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744259111429781">Zimmer and Bergmann, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Thermal behavior of ceramic bodies</title>
<p>Differential thermal gravimetry, differential thermal analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis (DTG, DTA, and TGA, respectively) data of selected samples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744259111429781">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1744259111429781">4</xref>. Three endothermic peaks were identified. The first endothermic peak ranging between 75°C and 80°C was due to hygroscopic moisture with a weight loss of about 0.80%–1.32%. The second and third endothermic peaks at about 510°C and 560°C, respectively, were due to the dehydroxylation of clayey components (kaolinite, illite, montmorillonite, etc.). The effect was accompanied by substantial mass losses, equal to 4.06%–4.34%. An exothermic peak due to the mullite nucleation was detected at about 960°C. Addition of ash into the ceramic body lowered endothermic peaks due to existence of fluxing agents. It is obviously detected that fly ash had great reactivity and improved sintering properties of tiles. From the chemical compositions of the raw materials, it can be seen that they differed in ratio of the oxides most strongly governing the sintering operation. The fluxing action of the fly ash attributed to the higher content of alkaline elements acting as sintering promoters compared to the other raw materials. Thus, in silicate systems containing fly ash, the sintering process started much earlier than in the same system without fly ash. The mass loss graph clearly shows in which temperature ranges the mass loss occurred. A mass loss up to 200°C resulted from the expulsion of remaining water and gasification of organic component. At a temperature between 200°C and 400°C there was a weight loss of about 0.44%–0.58% due to the decomposition of organic matter, which was followed by a broad exothermic band. A significant weight loss occurred between 400°C and 800°C that was attributed to the dehydroxylation of clayey components.</p>

<list-item><p>It is found that the specimens with fly ash manufactured had increased porosity and thus, they can be used as insulation materials owing to higher porosity possessed.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It can be concluded on the basis of the results obtained in the present work that facade and wall tiles with good physical–chemical properties can be obtained with significant economic advantage by introducing about 10% fly ash into the ceramic mixes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In addition, further studies should be carried out considering the operational aspects in order to provide similar results. After additional investigations are carried out, the optimum mixture composition can be recommended for production of floor tiles. The use of fly ash will reduce the floor tile production cost and will contribute to partial solution of the environmental problems of the region.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The uniformity and having desired properties of tiles by the development of ceramic mix based on local raw materials for one-time firing using fly ash containing highly efficient fluxes make this material very promising.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fly ash has stable chemical and particle size distribution and requires less electric energy for grinding. This will make it possible in the future to expand the raw material resources for the production of ceramic bodies containing fly ash compatible with clay components.</p></list-item>
