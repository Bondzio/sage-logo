<body>
<p>In the first of this trio of <italic>Rounds</italic>, we discussed the importance of setting priorities in order to achieve your primary professional and social goals, explained why this necessitates saying ‘no’ to many ‘dys-opportunities’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1740774512467238">*</xref></sup> in a firm but courteous fashion (nicely) and offered some generic strategies for saying ‘no’ (nicely) to unsolicited email [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512467238">1</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, in Part 2, we tabulate 40 specific ‘dys-opportunities’ that have befallen us and over 30 of our colleagues world-wide, and suggest why you usually should say ‘no’ to them. They are summarized in the accompanying tables, grouped into conferences, administration, grant applications and other people’s research, other people’s papers, teaching and supervising, clinical work, working with other people, and reading.</p>
<p>Before you go there, a trio of caveats: First, your pursuit of happiness – especially as it results from fulfilling your sense of professional, social, family, and global responsibilities – will sometimes conflict with your pursuit of success as a researcher. For example, the time and energy you devote to front-line patient-care in refugee camps must be subtracted from the time and energy available for designing, executing, and publishing your research. Both endeavours are worthy, and only you can decide whether and how to apportion your time and energy between them.</p>
<p>Second, every ‘dys-opportunity’ in the tables has the potential to become a positive experience and significant contribution, not just for others but for yourself, and not just locally but internationally. Accordingly, each table has a third column that suggests when you might want to say ‘yes’.</p>
<p>Which leads to our third caveat, directed toward clinician-trialists (and other researchers) at the start of your careers, when saying ‘yes’ too often delays getting your research launched, conducted, and published, stresses your social and family life, and pushes you toward ‘burn-out’. This is where your mentor plays a vital role in helping you distinguish opportunities from ‘dys-opportunities’.</p>
<p>Once you’ve achieved your initial successes, you may want to begin to say ‘yes’ more often. Nonetheless, there are some ‘dys-opportunities’ that never become worthwhile, and we’ll point those out along the way.</p>
<p>Many of the table entries will appear anti-authoritarian or even rebellious, but such attitudes have played important roles in the advance of science [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774512467238">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512467238">3</xref>]. Indeed, the lead author of a previous pair of <italic>Rounds</italic> on resurrecting rejected grant applications, Peter Szatmari, has written elsewhere:<disp-quote>
<p>There are certain personal characteristics associated with being a successful clinician-scientist investigator. One must be intensely curious about [the subject], profoundly dissatisfied with the current state of knowledge, and carry a profound desire to know more as a way of helping one’s patients. Having personality characteristics associated with <italic>oppositional-defiant disorder</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1740774512467238">†</xref></sup> can also be quite helpful. (Szatmari P, September 2012, personal communication)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>And Sharon Straus, who led our quartet of <italic>Rounds</italic> on mentoring, responded to Peter’s statement with: ‘This is excellent! And much better to have than the narcissistic personality disorders, which I think many academics have’.</p>
<sec id="section1-1740774512467238" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Some might consider the content of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774512467238">Tables 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1740774512467238">8</xref> unbalanced, pessimistic and cynical. It is not hard to see how it might be perceived in that way. Occasionally saying ‘yes’ to something that is not a priority can turn out to be an unexpected, wonderful experience. To paraphrase Milan Kundera: Was it better to say no or to say yes? ‘There is no means of testing which decision is better, because there is no basis for comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512467238">4</xref>]’. That is what sometimes makes life unbearably light; it is not a randomized trial where you have the opportunity to say both ‘no’ and ‘yes’ and compare the consequences.</p>

<p>‘Generally, a clinical reader would need to read in the range of 13–14 articles from [the] top 20 journals to obtain one that is directly clinically important in any health-care area, although the range is substantial (1.1–36.9). We call this number the “number of articles needed to be read” or NNR’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774512467238">10</xref>].</p>

<p>However, as one colleague noted: ‘I have never regretted that I said no to something, but I have often regretted that I said yes’. And in the words of Josh Billings: ‘Half of the troubles of this life can be traced to saying yes too quickly and not saying no soon enough’. The problem is that for many, the default is to say ‘yes’. We suggest the default should be to say ‘no’ and when you say ‘yes’, say it more slowly.</p>
<p>What do you think? Rounders who have other or contrary thoughts about this, or have questions or comments about the ‘dys-opportunities’ presented here, are encouraged to send them to the Editors, with a copy to Dave at <email>sackett@bmts.com</email>. He’ll summarize them in a later round.</p>
<p>Many thanks to our colleagues around the world for their nominations of the ‘dys-opportunities’ that appear in this <italic>Round</italic>. The third and final session in this series will present some suggestions from us all about HOW to say no ‘nicely’.</p>
