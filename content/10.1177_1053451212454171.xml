<p>Providing a free, appropriate public education (FAPE) to qualified students with disabilities under the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454171">Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (IDEIA)</xref> continues to be a challenging endeavor for school districts. Over the years, courts have relied on a two-step inquiry to determine if a student received FAPE. This process was established by the landmark Supreme Court decision in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212454171"><italic>Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley</italic> (1982)</xref>. The first step examines whether the procedural mandates of IDEIA were followed. The second step examines whether the student received individualized educational services designed to confer some educational benefit. What constitutes “some educational benefit,” however, remains an elusive challenge given the pressure for increased accountability and the need for meaningful programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053451212454171">Yell, Katsiyannis, &amp; Hazelkorn, 2007</xref>). Specifically, IDEIA mandates that in the event a student’s behavior impedes the student’s learning or the learning of others, school districts are required to “consider the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports, and other strategies, to address that behavior” (see IEP special factors; §1414(d)(3)(B)(i)). Furthermore, under the mandated discipline procedures, if a student’s behavior is determined to be a manifestation of that student’s disability, school districts must “conduct a functional behavioral assessment, and implement a behavioral intervention plan for such child” (see discipline procedures; §1415(k)(1)(F)(ii)). These requirements regarding functional behavior assessment (FBA) and the development of a behavior intervention plan (BIP) apply to placements in an interim alternative education setting for offenses involving drugs, weapons, or serious bodily injury (§1415(k)(1)(F)).</p>
<p>These provisions provide guidance to school districts regarding the implementation of mandated services that school districts have to undertake under specific circumstances involving students who exhibit problem behaviors. What is open to interpretation, however, is whether districts, to ensure FAPE, are required to have individualized education program (IEP) goals and an intervention plan for students whose behavior impedes learning. In addition, can a student receive FAPE with services and supports to address his or her behavioral needs without the benefit of behavioral goals and a behavioral intervention plan?</p>
<p>This column examines the ruling in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212454171"><italic>Lathrop R-II School District v. Gray</italic> (2010)</xref> and its implications for school districts. First, the facts of the case and the reasoning behind the court’s decision are summarized. Second, the implications for practice are discussed.</p>

<title>Facts of the Case</title>
<p>This case illustrates the complexities of providing FAPE according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454171">IDEIA (2004)</xref> when significant behavioral concerns are present. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212454171"><italic>Lathrop R-II School District v. Gray</italic> (2010)</xref>, the parents of a student with autism alleged that the district failed to provide a FAPE for their child. Specifically, when in the general education classroom, the fourth grade student would engage in maladaptive behaviors such as biting his finger, reciting from movies, exhibiting loud outbursts, and engaging in inappropriate behaviors. Eventually, with the help of an autism and behavioral specialist, a BIP was devised and implemented to address these behavioral concerns.</p>
<p>Subsequent IEPs for this student included participation in activities requiring gross- and fine-motor skills such as art and physical education classes, implementation of a BIP to address disruptive behaviors, and participation in sensory diet activities (e.g., a “fidget box”) to curb improper behaviors. The student’s 2003 IEP, for example, noted the student’s progress in both academic and nonacademic areas and included a revised behavior plan with specific strategies and a modified diet. This IEP also included academic goals and objectives and a separate list of occupational therapy goals and provided for daily 30-minute, one-on-one speech therapy sessions.</p>
<p>The student’s parents challenged reports regarding the student’s improvement in the area of behavior by alleging that the district failed to develop appropriate IEPs for the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 academic years, failed to provide adequate prior written notice, and limited the parents’ participation in the development of these IEPs. The parents sought reimbursement for services they allegedly solicited, requested compensatory education and related services, and asked that the student be placed at a private facility.</p>

<sec id="section3-1053451212454171">
<title>Due Process Hearing</title>
<p>A three-member administrative panel held an 18-day hearing over the course of several months. This panel ruled that the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 IEPs were deficient because they lacked baseline data and inadequately addressed the student’s difficulties in the areas of behavior and social skills. Based on these findings, the panel ordered the student be placed in a state-approved facility for students with autism. In response, the district challenged the panel’s decision in federal court, asserting that the decision was legally erroneous and unsupported by the evidence presented.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1053451212454171">
<title>District Court Decision</title>
<p>The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri ruled in favor of the school district, concluding that FAPE requirements under <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454171">IDEIA (2004)</xref> do not mandate the acquisition of specific knowledge or “strict equality of opportunity or services” per the <italic>Rowley</italic> ruling. This decision was also rendered because of the panel’s reliance on “incorrect legal standards.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454171">IDEIA (2004)</xref> does not require the inclusion of baseline data in the present levels of performance or within goals and objectives, nor does it require specific goals with regard to behavior. The court observed, however, that the IEPs in question contained detailed present levels of performance statements and measurable goals. In fact, the present level of performance section of the IEP written in 2002 was 12 pages long and did contain baseline data. This section also included a description of how the student’s disability affected his ability to access the general curriculum and information pertaining to his health, motor skills, sensory processing abilities, cognitive skills, adaptive behaviors, academic abilities, communication skills, and social skills. The data contained within the present levels were used in the writing of 27 distinct goals (each with specific objectives), most of which included internal benchmarks and the student’s present ability relative to the goal.</p>
<p>In 2002, the school district hired an autism and behavior specialist who conducted an FBA and developed a BIP to address the inappropriate behaviors of the student. Goals related to the FBA and BIP were included in the 2002 and 2003 IEPs. The student’s IEPs described the disruptive behaviors and included a description of several strategies to address the behaviors. Specifically, the IEP provided for a sensory diet, which included the availability of a “fidget box,” the opportunity to jump on a trampoline between activities, and accommodations such as special lighting, a private bathroom, weighted lap and shoulder pads, and frequent breaks. As a result of these provisions, the student’s 2002 IEP stated that he had made progress in communication and social skills during speech and language therapy sessions and that he was able to greet people pleasantly and with basic information with minimal prompting.</p>

<sec id="section5-1053451212454171">
<title>The Circuit Court Decision</title>
<p>In an appeal by the parents, the circuit court upheld the decision of the lower court and further concluded that the district did not violate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454171">IDEIA 2004</xref> provisions regarding parental participation as parents attended, or were afforded the opportunity to attend, meetings regarding their son. The court also declined to address additional allegations by the parents (e.g., proper assessments, timely delivery of speech and occupational therapy) as they either were not brought before the original due process panel or fell outside the 2-year statute of limitations under <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454171">IDEIA (2004)</xref>.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454171">IDEIA (2004)</xref> regulations do not expressly mandate the development of BIPs or the inclusion of behavior goals in the IEP, when considering a student who exhibits problem behaviors, it may be in the best interest of the school to take a proactive approach. In the case of <italic>Lathrop</italic>, the school district took such an approach, particularly regarding the student’s behavioral concerns, by conducting an FBA, developing behavioral goals, and implementing a BIP, which resulted in improved behavioral outcomes for the student. Indeed, it is because of these efforts that the court determined that the student received substantive benefits that satisfied the district’s FAPE obligations. Behavioral goals, the development of BIPs based on FBA, and ongoing monitoring of student progress are essential elements to maximize the success of behavioral interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451212454171">Etscheidt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451212454171">Maag &amp; Katsiyannis, 2006</xref>). Three proactive approaches follow.</p>
<sec id="section7-1053451212454171">
<title>Present Levels of Performance</title>
<p>Writing substantive <italic>present levels of performance</italic> is critical in the development of a legally binding and effective IEP. If a student with a disability is exhibiting behaviors that are interfering with his or her learning or the learning of others, teachers should begin to look at ways that those behaviors could be addressed. The inclusion of specific measured performance on behaviors of concern is a first step in providing students the supports they may need. As noted in the <italic>Lathrop</italic> case, the inclusion of those baseline measures in the present levels of performance was a deciding factor in the court’s determination in the case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1053451212454171">
<title>Develop and Monitor Behavioral Goals</title>
<p>Utilizing the information reported in the present levels of performance is another key step in ensuring that the school is providing students with a substantive education. Although it is not mandated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454171">IDEIA 2004</xref>, the development of goals addressing maladaptive behavior within the IEP process allows educators and parents to become partners in managing the student’s behavior. In addition, setting up an effective monitoring system for these behaviors allows the student, school, and families to make data-based instructional decisions when evaluating the student’s progress. Finally, if behavioral goals are included in the IEP, the methods of measuring and reporting the progress toward meeting those goals must, in accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454171">IDEIA (2004)</xref>, be described to the parents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1053451212454171">
<title>Implement Behavior Intervention Plans</title>
<p>School districts should design a BIP that is based on an FBA any time a student with a disability has a history of maladaptive behaviors. The BIP, like the behavior goals in the IEP, is developed by the IEP team with input from the school, parents, and the student. This provides another opportunity for the school and families to come together in a proactive manner to address behavioral concerns. The BIP should address the function of the behavior (determined by an FBA) and facilitate the student’s engagement in replacement behaviors.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1053451212454171">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>As a matter of law, behavioral goals, BIPs, and specific progress in the area of behavior are not required under <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212454171">IDEIA (2004)</xref>, and the courts are not likely to superimpose mandates not found in IDEIA (BIPs are required only under certain circumstances in disciplinary actions). In this case, the court ruled that the student was afforded FAPE because the student received substantive educational benefit and the district had followed relevant procedural requirements in developing the student’s IEP. It should also be noted that despite the district’s extensive proactive efforts, the district was still involved in lengthy and costly legal proceedings. Consequently, although litigation may, on occasion, be unavoidable, proactive efforts focusing on substantive benefits for students will likely reduce legal involvement and increase a district’s chances of favorable rulings.</p>
