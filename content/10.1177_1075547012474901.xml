<p>Despite the wealth of applied research books on social marketing techniques, community action campaigns and programs, and the like, surprisingly few are devoted to environmental or sustainable behavior changes. McKenzie-Mohr’s <italic>Fostering Sustainable Behavior: An Introduction to Community-Based Social Marketing</italic> has ably helped fill that gap, and the third edition adds even more depth. Primarily aimed at practitioners and policy makers, the book uses a “how-to” conversational style conveying a wealth of examples and author anecdotes (some perhaps too detailed) related to how to research, plan, and execute community-level action programs aimed at carbon and energy reduction, recycling, and other more sustainable behaviors.</p>
<p>The approaches chosen are largely evidence based, and throughout the text are primers on the mostly psychology-based hypotheses underlying the recommendations. McKenzie-Mohr rightly emphasizes formative research techniques in program preplanning, use of pilot studies, and broad-based summative evaluation. Importantly, actual behavior change is the criterion variable here, as opposed to less powerful changes in knowledge and attitudes emphasized in some other texts. Actual program strategies follow recognized social marketing principles, with engaging discussions of how to select appropriate behaviors, identifying barriers and benefits, seeking commitment to action, using social norms to advantage, social reinforcement, message selection, and inducements to action. Attention to social diffusion of change is a welcome addition to this edition.</p>
<p>Surprising to me, however, is the lack of expansion in this edition into social media uses. An e-mail example is given, but the interactive media revolution among likely the demographic groups most amenable to sustainability issues, and the likeliest change agents, appears overlooked. Program websites, social networks, and mobile media are now almost routinely used for social change, and they deserve more emphasis here. Moreover, influential community news channels can provide credible publicity, whether in print, over the airwaves, or via the Internet.</p>
<p>There is also some ambiguity here over what is meant by “community-based” social marketing. Many if not most community-based environmental and health information/action programs include study of relevant community-level variables, such as governmental structure, laws, and policies; existing local formal and informal action organizations and networks; demographic considerations; and the like. These factors are noted in passing at best in this book, which focuses on individual-level psychology-based social marketing techniques, largely independent of community context variables.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many recent community-based change programs focus more on citizen participation in program formative evaluation, design, and execution, which can increase citizen buy-in and success. McKenzie-Mohr’s approach appears more hierarchical in the sense that problems and solutions often appear predefined for the community rather than cooperatively developed with the community. He rightly moves beyond the cookie-cutter mass media–programmed campaign approaches, but he might move further toward community involvement in program planning.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this book is a key read for anyone involved in environmental action program development, and for those in public health and safety advocacy for that matter.</p>
