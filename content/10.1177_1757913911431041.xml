<abstract>
<p>Through a combination of Personal, social, health and economic education (PSHE), Science, Healthy Schools and a range of other initiatives, we are increasingly preparing our children to understand key topics in health education. However, to what extent are we equipping them with a picture of a healthy, happy future and giving them the tools to access this? In June, The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) hosted a workshop entitled “Charting a Health Literacy Journey” to examine this.</p>
<p>The workshop brought together a broad group of over 20 stakeholders from the health and education sectors. The aims of the day were to address the following six questions:<list id="list1-1757913911431041" list-type="bullet">

<title>What is health literacy?</title>
<p>Considerable ambiguity exists in the meaning of “health literacy” and there are many competing definitions. Kickbusch, Wait and Maag argue that health literacy can provide a “<italic>map and a compass on what may be a difficult and unpredictable journey”</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913911431041">1</xref></sup> The rationale behind the workshop was the belief that such a map and compass would provide children and young people with the “skills and confidence to write their own life story”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913911431041">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The first aim of the workshop was to see how different stakeholders interpreted the concept of health literacy and to identify its most important characteristics. Discussion was grounded in what were described as the “Three Tiers of Health Literacy”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913911431041">3</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Tier one</italic> is the narrowest interpretation of health literacy. Nutbeam describes this as “functional health literacy (ibid).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913911431041">3</xref></sup> It focuses on reading and decoding health information and is popular in the United States. For example, the American Medical Association has referred to <italic>“The relationship between patient literacy levels and their ability to comply with prescribed therapeutic regimen.”</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913911431041">4</xref></sup> Instructions on medicines are therefore judged according to how well they match with patients’ “health literacy” levels.</p>
<p><italic>Tier two</italic> goes beyond this interpretation and considers knowledge and understanding of health and the ability this gives to make judgements. Nutbeam<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913911431041">3</xref></sup> calls this “interactive” health literacy. Sihota and Lennard reflect this interpretation in their definition: <italic>“The skills to be able to acquire and read health information and successfully apply it to one’s own situation”</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913911431041">5</xref></sup> In practice this might involve pupils learning different food groups and their functions.</p>
<p><italic>Tier three</italic> is Nutbeam’s preferred view. He calls it “critical literacy”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913911431041">3</xref></sup> Tier Three is focused on translating understanding into behaviour. In his definition Nutbeam describes <italic>“the cognitive and social skills which determine the motivation and ability of individuals to gain access to, understand and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health.”</italic> In practice, this might involve giving pupils the confidence to resist peer pressure.</p>
<p>Participants each came to the workshop with different ideas of what should be part of Health Literacy but there was an emphasis in most participants’ comments on notions of empowerment and confidence. This suggested that Tier Three had the greatest resonance for them. Terms used to express this included “choice”, “processing” and “resilience.”</p>
<p>Discussion also revealed a second dimension in the meaning of Health Literacy: that of scope or breadth. Participants began to discuss “values” and emotional and mental health. These were viewed as critical in living a healthy happy life.</p>
<p>Understandings of health literacy are represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1757913911431041">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Detailed discussion revealed that C3 was the most popular location for a definition of health literacy. It was not generally felt that health education as it currently stands reflects this view of health literacy. Furthermore, participants emphasised the notion of “lifelong learning,” “cohesiveness” and linking provision to families and communities.</p>
<p>These views suggest that there is considerable appetite for the concept of a Health Literacy Journey recognising the full range of factors which contribute to a healthy life and the ability to lead it.</p>

<sec id="section2-1757913911431041">
<title>What does health literacy look like in action?</title>
<p><bold>Case study 1</bold>: Andrew Carter OBE, Head Teacher at the award winning South Farnham Junior School provided an insight into what this approach might look like in practice:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>In essence health literacy is learning that starts with an understanding of where the child is in terms of their social, intellectual and personal development. It is not necessary to give the child what they want, but instead what they need. This understanding of ‘need’ should be based on identifying what will enable them to become healthy, social beings. As a result, South Farnham has developed into a school which does not simply respond to deficits by combatting bullying or teaching sex education and healthy eating. Instead, the school ensures that individual children and the whole school community feel supported, nurtured and prepared to take measured risks. Discussions explore the impact of choices on future life and the achievement of physical and emotional wellbeing. This is also the starting point for decisions on curriculum and teaching. For example, Mr Carter explained that very few adults participate in competitive sports, yet they are the focus of most PE teaching. This leaves children with little to turn to once competitive sports are no longer organised for them in later life. He has therefore decided to offer activities which are more likely to be pursued in later life because he is guided by a long term view of children’s journeys towards healthy adulthood. He believes that because the school combines this with an education that fosters resilience and confidence, children leave the school’s care with the knowledge, understanding and capacity to make healthy choices in the future.</p></disp-quote>
</p>

<sec id="section3-1757913911431041">
<title>Why does health literacy matter?</title>
<p>With this broad understanding of health literacy established participants explored the potential benefits of Health Literacy.</p>
<p>Health inequality continues to be a huge problem. The 2011 Marmot Review reported a gap of over 10 years in disability free life expectancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913911431041">6</xref></sup> between the poorest and richest areas in around half of the Local Authorities in England. Participants believed that health inequality could be reduced if children learned to recognise the impact of their choices and were equipped to make healthier choices. Health literacy was described as providing “immunisation for better health.” Whilst such health benefits were obvious, participants were quick to go beyond these and to describe societal, economic and educational benefits.</p>
<p>Particpants speculate that public health improvements could lead to economic benefits through savings on healthcare and that Tier Three health literacy could also improve resilience, choice making and therefore employability. This might yield further economic benefits. On an educational front, a whole school approach like that described by Andrew Carter would place learning in the context of a journey towards lifelong fulfilment and hence has the potential to bring educational benefits through increased relevance and therefore engagement.</p>
<p>Participants recognised that the four way categorisation of health, societal, economic and educational benefits was somewhat arbitrary, and that all four are interrelated. Their overwhelming view was that an early start along a health literacy journey would have long term impact and be a valuable strategic step. Following preliminary identification of potential benefits it now becomes important to gather an evidence base to test whether these hypotheses are justified. The relative strength of the different types of benefit also needs to be assessed. This is where the RSPH will focus its attention over the coming year.</p>

<title>How is health literacy reflected on the ground at present?</title>
<p>There is no lack in the volume of health education available at the moment. Our concern is therefore qualitative rather than quantitative. Elements of health education can be found in the Science, PE and PSHE curricula. These are complimented by initiatives like Healthy Schools and Health Matters as well as programs provided by organizations with interests in particular areas of health.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the Department for Education’s current internal review of the PSHE curriculum and the decision not to make PSHE a statutory requirement could jeopardise curriculum provision for health education. On top of that, changes to the Healthy Schools program and the slimming down of the Ofsted inspection framework could place further pressures on provision.</p>
<p>Currently, some schools cleverly dovetail different elements of the curriculum together and map coverage throughout the school. This provides a well-rounded program for pupils. An example of this approach is Cherry Orchard School in Birmingham, in which Ofsted describe a <italic>“very good programme for personal, social and health education (which) ensures that pupils are exceptionally well informed about how to keep healthy and safe”</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757913911431041">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>This approach comes very close to providing the type of journey we have described. It is clear that there is a strong emphasis on active decision making around themes such as “making choices”, “responsibility” and “resolving conflict”. Cherry Orchard Primary School makes it clear that developmental and health aims go well beyond just being an aspect of the PSHE curriculum. For this school as with South Farnham Junior School, health and development is at the heart of curriculum, culture and ethos.</p>
<p>How widespread this approach is in other schools is not clear and this would be worthy of further study. It will therefore form part of the RSPH’s focus over the coming year. Preliminary indications are provided by the 2010 Ofsted report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757913911431041">8</xref></sup> on PSHE which argues that: “in just under one in four of the schools visited, the quality of teaching (in PSHE) was variable and teachers’ subject knowledge and expertise were not good enough.” So long as this is the case, a quarter of young people potentially risk leaving school ill-equipped to make the confident healthy choices that participants at our workshop believed they needed. This is unacceptable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1757913911431041">
<title>How does health literacy fit with the current policy context?</title>
<p>Our proposed approach to health literacy would lead to a pedagogy that is not a deficit model and would not simply focus on particular problems. This fits closely with the aims described in 11b of the Executive Summary of the White Paper “Healthy Lives, Healthy People.” This argues for a “<italic>coherent approach to different stages of life and key transitions instead of tackling individual risk factors in isolation</italic>”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757913911431041">9</xref></sup> This emphasis on life-long learning and a proactive approach chimes with our intentions. Our Tier Three approach emphasises capacity and competency. It therefore also fits well with arguments made in the Education White Paper “The Importance of Teaching”. Section 4.30 of the White Paper argues that: <italic>“Good PSHE supports individual young people to make safe and informed choices”</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913911431041">10</xref></sup> Such an approach would be at the heart of a Health Literacy Journey.</p>
<p>A review of the school curriculum is currently under way and its aim is to produce a slimmed down curriculum. This might initially be seen as conflicting with our argument but this need not be the case. We are not arguing for an increase in content but instead for a change of approach, one that would be guided by schools and teachers who are equipped to do so. This fits very well with moves towards school and teacher autonomy and the drive towards increased teacher quality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1757913911431041">
<title>How should we move forward?</title>
<p>As argued above, encouraging schools to take their pupils on a Health Literacy Journey is unlikely to take place as a result of curriculum changes and prescription. Instead it should take place by providing teachers and leaders with the skills and tools to do so. We therefore believe that priorities should be to:</p>
