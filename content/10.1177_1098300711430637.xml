<title>Schoolwide PBS “Hi-Fi”</title>
<p>High fidelity (“Hi-fi”) is becoming an important goal and an area of intense research interest in many applied disciplines and especially as it relates to schoolwide positive behavior support (SWPBS). Early efforts to improve programs would follow the model of “train and hope”—providing initial education and skills to teachers and administrators and then stepping back and hoping that they continued the plans. However, the field is beginning to investigate how well schools implement SWPBS and how this affects social and academic outcomes in students.</p>
<p>A team of researchers (Brandi Simonsen and George Sugai, University of Connecticut; Lucille Eber and Holly Lewandowski, Illinois PBIS Network; Anne C. Black, Yale University; Barbara Sims, Illinois State Board of Education; and Diane Myers, Assumption College) looked closely at a sample of 428 Illinois schools implementing SWPBS. The good news was that most of the schools continued to use SWPBS with high fidelity over time and, in turn, those schools also witnessed better social outcomes and improved math scores (but not reading scores) in their students.</p>
<p>According to lead author Brandi Simonsen, “We were excited to see the enhanced effects achieved by schools implementing SWPBS with fidelity. We hope these results will encourage schools, districts, states, and regions to (a) develop systems to promote sustained implementation fidelity (e.g., training, coaching, and evaluation structures), (b) systematically assess implementation fidelity using reliable and valid measures, and (c) use the assessment data to monitor, adjust, and enhance the systems developed.”</p>

<title>Identifying Risk Factors Among Kindergarteners</title>
<p>The prevention of behavior problems among school children remains the Holy Grail of educational programs. It is generally agreed that if students can be helped before problems become unmanageable, more intensive approaches might not be needed. However, because of scarce resources in schools, this type of help cannot routinely be given to all children. Knowing who might be at risk for these later problems would help target these students and redirect the energy of teachers where it is most needed.</p>
<p>Kent McIntosh and Jacqueline Brown from the University of British Columbia and their colleague Carol Sadler from the Tigard-Tualatin School District in Oregon looked at 473 kindergarten students whose schools went through Schoolwide Positive Behavior Support. The researchers looked at the prereading skills of the kindergartners and then followed the students’ progress through the fifth grade. What they found was that a kindergartener’s lack of awareness of the sounds of words (phoneme awareness; e.g., being able to correctly answer this question: “Which word begins with the same sound as bat: horn, bed, cup?”) predicted behavior problems in Grade 5.</p>
<p>Lead author Kent McIntosh reported, “We were replicating some of our previous research showing that pre-reading skill deficits predicted future behavior challenges and wanted to see whether change in these skills would change their risk levels. We thought that if school personnel could get these students on track to positive literacy outcomes, then their risk for behavior challenges would drop. It was surprising to see just how powerful these effects were—if students who were at severe risk for literacy challenges at the start of Kindergarten picked up these skills in the first half of the year, their risk for behavior challenges basically dropped to zero.”</p>

<title>Who Is Doing What to Whom?</title>
<p>Over the past few decades, an enormous amount of research points to positive approaches as being successful in reducing problem behavior and improving the lives of millions of people. Important to this success, however, is being sure that the people who carry out these positive programs actually are doing what was planned. In other words, do we know if the interventions are being used and implemented the way we want?</p>
<p>This issue of “treatment integrity” (the extent to which a treatment is applied as intended) is crucial since often things can go awry in unintended ways (e.g., a teacher stops prompting a child as instructed). Several researchers looked at the research published in this journal from 1999 to 2009 to see if the studies clearly described what the intervention was that was implemented and, importantly, if the researchers reported data on how well the plans were carried out. Lisa Hagermoser Sanetti and Katie Gritter from the University of Connecticut and Lisa Dobey from the Belmont Public School District in Massachusetts found that most of the studies did define their interventions but many did not collect and report on how the plans were implemented.</p>
<p>Professor Hagermoser Sanetti told us, “Although there is obviously room for improvement, it is encouraging that about half of the intervention outcome researchers publishing in JPBI are defining the intervention and assessing its implementation. I believe considerable research is needed to develop psychometrically sound treatment integrity assessments with adequate psychometric properties before we will see rates of quantitative treatment integrity data in articles increase. The researchers who have reported such data in JPBI may provide valuable information regarding feasible, efficient, and defensible methods of assessing treatment integrity.”</p>

<title>Don’t Forget!</title>
<p>A large number of students have a good deal of difficulty staying focused in class. Sometimes the work presented to them is over their heads and they begin to give up. Other times work can be too easy or boring and their minds wander. And still other students may get a great deal of attention from other students for “goofing off!” What should teachers do for these students to help insure academic success?</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Connecticut (Aimee Faul, Karoline Stepensky, and Brandi Simonsen) examined a simple strategy that could be easily used by teachers to keep students focused. Working with two middle school boys, they instructed their teachers to remind these two students as they entered the class what was expected of with regard to their behavior. This simple prompt improved their behavior in class compared to days when the teachers did not prompt them.</p>
<p>The authors of this study commented, “This study illustrates that sometimes small changes in a teacher's classroom management (e.g., providing a brief prompt) can make a difference in student behavior. We hope the findings encourage teachers to make small adjustments to their basic classroom management practices to meet the needs of students who require additional support.”</p>

<title>When Teaching Reading Skills Is Not Enough</title>
<p>A young child’s ability to read can pave the way for future academic success. On the other hand, not being able to read well by the end of first grade can start an academic slide that leads to dropping out of high school. Because of the fundamental importance of early literacy, the federal government has made this a top educational priority. A number of research based programs are now showing that children who have difficulty reading early on can be helped.</p>
<p>However, not all children succeed with these school programs—especially those students who also have problem behavior or difficulty paying attention. A group of researchers from Northeastern University (Robert Volpe, Gregory Young, Maureen Piana, and Anne Zaslofsky) focused their attention on these children. They combined an early reading program (Kindergarten Peer Assisted Learning Strategies) with classroom management strategies for 20 kindergarten students in an urban elementary school. They found that the combination of approaches to address both reading and behavior problems improved their reading skills better than just the reading program alone.</p>
<p>According to lead author Robert Volpe, “Findings of this study should encourage consideration of student motivation and engagement in the application of academic interventions. Focusing only on increasing the intensity of academic interventions, without consideration of mediating effects of attention and motivation, likely will lead to false positives and preclude the delivery of appropriate services for students with both academic and motivation and/or attention deficits.</p>
