However, the absence of a historical database for the incidence of spontaneous neoplasms has subsequently led to reluctance by some pharmaceutical companies to adopt the use of this short-term carcinogenicity assay. Our laboratory has generated a database summarizing the mortality, body weights, and the incidence of spontaneous tumors in 1420 male and female mice assigned to 26 studies conducted at our facility. In addition, we present the incidence of tumors in positive control mice treated with urethane from these studies. Mortality in the vehicle-treated Tg.rasH2 mouse was low (average of 1% in each study). The most common spontaneous tumors in the Tg.rasH2 mice were alveolar bronchiolar adenoma of the lungs (10.14% in males and 5.77% in females) and hemangiosarcoma of the spleen (3.66% in both males and females). The incidence of all other tumors was generally very low. In the positive control, urethane-treated animals, the incidence of alveolar bronchiolar adenomas and alveolar bronchiolar carcinomas in the lungs was 93.69% and 42.88% in males and 92.43% and 72.79% in females, respectively. In addition, the incidence of splenic hemangiosarcomas in urethane-treated males was 89.18% and 92.25% in females. The 6-month Tg.rasH2 assay is more precise, faster, and more economical than the conventional 2-year mouse assays because of the low incidence of background tumors, very high survival, shorter duration, and the lower number of animals used.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Tg.rasH2</kwd><kwd>spontaneous tumors</kwd><kwd>historical incidence</kwd><kwd>carcinogenicity studies</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January/February 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap> </article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-1091581812471565"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer risk assessment of pharmaceuticals and environmental carcinogens remains heavily dependent on rodent carcinogenicity studies. Historically, 2-year bioassays in 2 rodent species, rats and mice, served as the standard for carcinogenicity assessment. These conventional rodent assays are costly, not always relevant for human risk assessment, and require large amount of test article and a large number of animals. General dissatisfaction with the conventional carcinogenicity assays, and the need to reduce the duration of the assays and the number of animals used, fueled the endorsement of short-term carcinogenicity assays in genetically engineered mice by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) in 1998. Validation of the use of short-term carcinogenicity studies using transgenic mice, including the Tg.rasH2 (CByB6F1-Tg(HRAS)2Jic [+/− hemizygous c-Ha-ras]) mouse, was carried out by the International Life Science Institute Health and Environmental Science Institute (ILSI HESI) through an international collaborative project.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1091581812471565">1</xref></sup></p><p>Developed at the Central Institute for Experimental Animals, the Tg.rasH2 mouse is a hemizygous transgenic mouse carrying multiple copies of human c-Ha-ras gene with its own promoter and enhancer. Under the ILSI HESI project, 26-week carcinogenicity studies in Tg.rasH2 mice were conducted for 21 compounds at different facilities in the United States, Japan, and Europe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1091581812471565">2</xref></sup> These compounds included genotoxic and nongenotoxic human carcinogens, rodent carcinogens/putative human noncarcinogens, and noncarcinogens. Data from these studies gave considerable confidence that this model produces low false positive and false negative rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1091581812471565">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1091581812471565">4</xref></sup> In addition, data from these and other studies also showed that the Tg.rasH2 mouse model can be used for both genotoxic and nongenotoxic carcinogen identification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1091581812471565">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1091581812471565">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1091581812471565"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1091581812471565">7</xref></sup></p><p>Despite extensive initial research, validation studies and the acceptance of this 6-month carcinogenicity model as an alternative to the 2-year traditional model by the regulatory agencies as described in the ICH S1B document<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1091581812471565">8</xref></sup> and acceptance by the regulatory agencies in the United States,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1091581812471565">9</xref></sup> Europe,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1091581812471565">10</xref></sup> and Japan,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1091581812471565">11</xref></sup> the use of this model is still very limited compared to the conventional 2-year mouse models. The causes of low acceptance of the 6-month short-term carcinogenicity assays have been discussed in recent publications and they include lack of knowledge of unexpected tumor findings, lack of knowledge of tumor identification and characterization, unfounded perception that the transgenic animals are oversensitive, and in general, a lack of historical control database.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1091581812471565">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1091581812471565">13</xref></sup></p><p>A historical control database, used in conjunction with statistical analysis, is a cornerstone in interpreting the biological significance of a tumor response and helps reduce false positive and false negative results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1091581812471565">14</xref></sup> In treatment groups, tumors may show statistically significant, albeit only small, increases in incidence relative to controls. In these instances, defining the biological significance of these tumors may only be achieved by comparing the occurrence of these tumors to the incidence seen in the historical database. Irrespective of the results of statistical analysis, a drug- or chemical-induced effect may be verified or nullified, based on where the incidence falls within the historical range. Alternatively, the historical database may be used to verify the validity of the study, by determining whether the incidence of tumors in both the negative and the positive controls used are consistent with what has been reported previously. In addition, the historical control database is useful in assessing possible differences in tumor response between two negative control groups in a single carcinogenicity study.</p><p>Previously published data on spontaneous tumors in Tg.rasH2 mice is limited. In 2001, as part of the ILSI HESI project, a summary of spontaneous tumors in 180 male and 178 female control Tg.rasH2 mice derived from 12 studies conducted at multiple sites was reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1091581812471565">3</xref></sup> However, since the adoption of the ICH guidelines by regulatory agencies in the United States, Europe, and Japan, limited data have been published on the spontaneous incidence of tumors in Tg.rasH2 mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1091581812471565">15</xref></sup> We now present a database summarizing the mortality, body weights, and the historical incidence of spontaneous tumors in 1420 mice (710 male and 710 female) assigned to 26 studies conducted at our facility, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest to be published.

In addition, data were collected from 555 males and 555 females assigned to the positive control groups in these studies. Animals were assigned to groups using a computer-generated randomization program. Animals in the positive control groups received a total of 3 intraperitoneal injections of 1000 mg/kg of urethane (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri) during the first week of study.

The 6-month bioassay provides significant cost savings and flexibility during drug development by shortening study duration (6 months in Tg.rasH2 vs 2 years in conventional mice), using fewer animals (210 in 6 months Tg.rasH2 vs up to 600 in 2-year conventional mice) and reducing overall necessary resources. Data from earlier Tg.rasH2 studies gave considerable confidence that this model produces low false positive and false negative rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1091581812471565">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1091581812471565">4</xref></sup> In addition, the combination of a 2-year rat study with a transgenic 6-month study has produced zero false negatives, while a combination of two 2-year chronic rodent bioassays in rats and mice produced a high number of false positives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1091581812471565">16</xref></sup></p><p>Despite the obvious advantages of this short assay, there is still some reluctance to its use, largely due to the absence of a historical database, lack of knowledge of unexpected tumor findings, lack of knowledge of tumor identification, and characterization and fear of false positives due to an inaccurate perception that transgenic animals are oversensitive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1091581812471565">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1091581812471565">13</xref></sup> Herein, we have presented a large database summarizing the mortality, body weights, and the historical incidence of spontaneous tumors in 1420 male and female mice assigned to 26 studies conducted at our facility under identical conditions, representing the largest historical control data from a single laboratory.</p><p>The overall incidence of spontaneous tumors in our 6-month Tg.rasH2 studies is considerably lower compared to the conventional 2-year mouse models. The percentage of total spontaneous tumors in our studies is 23.05% in males and 23.47% in females. In comparison to the Tg.rasH2 mice, the percentage of total spontaneous tumors in 2-year B6C3F1 mouse studies is approximately 70% in both males and females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1091581812471565">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1091581812471565">18</xref></sup>; whereas, the percentage of total spontaneous tumors in CD-1 male and female mice is around 78%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1091581812471565">19</xref></sup> Since spontaneous tumors interfere with the evaluation of the carcinogenic response, there is discussion of possibly completely eliminating 2-year bioassays by replacing the traditional chronic rodent carcinogenicity assays with a carcinogenicity battery that would include a transgenic study in mice along with a 12-month rat bioassay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1091581812471565">16</xref></sup></p><p>The starting age of the mice on the study is critical. In our studies, the starting age is between 6 and 10 weeks, although we prefer the starting age not to be more than 9 weeks. At termination of the 26-week study, the age of the mice is usually 34 to 36 weeks. This age at sacrifice is optimal since at the age of 40 weeks, mortality in Tg.rasH2 mice significantly increases, more so in females than in males, due to rapid development of spontaneous tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1091581812471565">6</xref></sup> The average mortality rate from all our 26 studies was very low and identical in males and females (3.94%); thus, over 95% of the animals survived to terminal sacrifice at 6 months.

In comparison to the Tg.rasH2 model, the survival rate of control B6C3F1 mice in 2-year carcinogenicity studies conducted by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) is low, ranging between 60% and 77% in males and females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1091581812471565">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1091581812471565">18</xref></sup>; while in CD-1 mice in the 2-year carcinogenicity studies, it is around 40% in both males and females.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1091581812471565">19</xref></sup></p><p>The average body weights of Tg.rasH2 male and female mice at 26 weeks were 29.01 and 23.17 g, respectively. The average body weight gains in males and females were 23.92% and 23.90%, respectively. Our results are similar to those published before for Tg.rasH2 mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1091581812471565">15</xref></sup> With the exception of the second week of each study, the average body weights of male and female positive control animals increased to a greater degree when compared to the age-matched control animals. The increase in the body weights of positive control mice compared to the age-matched vehicle control mice is due to formation of tumors in the lungs and spleen and effusions in the pleural and peritoneal cavities secondary to tumor formation.</p><p>In all our studies, we diagnosed lung alveolar bronchiolar adenomas as single or multiple (more than 1 tumor) in any given animal. We considered the multiplicity of the pulmonary tumors as an important criterion in distinguishing the aggressiveness of the tumors as well as an important feature in evaluating the effect of the test articles. This was particularly evident in urethane-treated animals in which most of the lung adenomas were multiple whereas most of the lung adenomas in vehicle control mice were single. Single adenomas were seen in only a few urethane-treated animals, mainly in animals that were removed early from the experiment either because of natural death or moribundity. Although the basic gross and microscopic features of alveolar bronchiolar carcinomas are in general similar in all Tg.rasH2 mice, the alveolar bronchiolar carcinomas in the urethane-treated female mice are more aggressive grossly and microscopically as compared to the urethane-treated male mice. Similarly, the incidence of alveolar bronchiolar carcinomas in urethane-treated female mice is much higher compared to the urethane-treated male mice. In the vehicle control mice, the incidence of single adenomas, multiple adenomas, and the combined incidence of all primary lung tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) in male mice is much higher than that in the female mice. On the other hand, the incidence of pulmonary carcinomas is almost double in female control mice compared to the male control mice. Our results are generally comparable to the ones noted by others, although the percentage of incidence varied slightly in each study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1091581812471565">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1091581812471565">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1091581812471565">15</xref></sup></p><p>Grossly, spleen hemangiosarcomas in the control animals present as a single nodule or a single depressed focus of red or tan color, up to 5 mm in diameter. However, it is common to see either multiple nodules or multiple depressed foci in the spleens of urethane-treated animals. Often, there is concurrent enlargement of the spleen, usually in urethane-treated mice. The splenic enlargement is generally due to extramedullary hematopoiesis noted in nontumor portions of spleen. We also note that there is often gross enlargement of spleen due to microscopic evidence of extramedullary hematopoiesis in animals with a hemangiosarcoma in nonsplenic tissues. Interestingly, the incidence of splenic hemangiosarcomas in both males and females in our studies is identical at 3.66%. Once again our results are in general agreement with others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1091581812471565">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1091581812471565">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1091581812471565">15</xref></sup> Tg.rasH2 mice also develop rare spontaneous hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas in isolated organs other than spleen as shown in our studies. It is noteworthy that these tumors are more common in the testes and uterus.</p><p>In addition to the vascular tumors discussed, Tg.rasH2 mice develop other rare tumors, notably harderian gland adenomas. There has been very limited published data available pertaining to the presence of these tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1091581812471565">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1091581812471565">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1091581812471565">15</xref></sup> Our database has identified a much larger spectrum of rare tumors, including nonsplenic hemangiosarcomas, hemangiomas, sarcomas, and mesotheliomas, although the incidence of each of these tumors is very low. The larger spectrum of rare tumors we identified is most likely because of the larger number of animals included in our database. Identifying rare tumors in a database is pivotal since rare tumors are usually assessed using less stringent statistical tools. A nonsignificant increase in the incidence of rare tumors may be of concern. Only when a large database of spontaneous tumors is available from the same laboratory that performs the study in question can the true significance of these rare tumors be determined. It can be concluded that such an apparent increase is truly biologically insignificant only if the incidence falls within the historical control database. Thus, in determining whether or not an apparent increase is biologically meaningful, any small change in the incidence noted in the historical control database may become important. Borderline increases in the incidence of tumors can be interpreted more appropriately when the historical database is taken into account. Caution should be exercised in using historical control data published from other laboratories, as stated by the US Food And Drug Administration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1091581812471565">20</xref></sup> Since interlaboratory differences in tumor incidence have been previously reported,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1091581812471565">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1091581812471565">21</xref></sup> it would not be appropriate to use a database generated at a different facility. Interlaboratory differences in the database often result from differences in study design (including the age of the animals, duration of dosing, and husbandry practices) and pathologists’ variability in diagnostic criteria and nomenclature used.</p><p>The purpose of the positive control in the Tg.rasH2 studies is to prove the validity of the assay. All previously published data on Tg.rasH2 mice used <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<italic>N</italic>-nitrosourea (MNU) as the positive control material.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1091581812471565">2</xref>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1091581812471565">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1091581812471565">15</xref></sup> We have identified several advantages in the use of urethane over MNU. Urethane is a well-classified genotoxic–mutagenic rodent carcinogen and a possible human carcinogen. It is also a long-acting anesthetic and the signs and symptoms produced post dose verify the appropriate administration of the positive control. In addition, the dose formulation of urethane can be easily prepared with a 21-day stability when stored at 2 °C to 8 °C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1091581812471565">22</xref></sup> In retrospect, MNU is highly volatile, has a short stability period and should be used immediately after preparation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1091581812471565">23</xref></sup> Thus, depending on the method of preparation and handling of MNU, tumor response may be vary between studies. It is expected that the positive control material should produce the same types of tumors as those noted spontaneously. Thus, another major disadvantage of using MNU is that the most common tumors induced by MNU treatment in the Tg.rasH2 mice are stomach squamous cell papilloma/carcinoma, lymphoma, and skin papilloma, which are not the most common spontaneous tumors of the Tg.rasH2 mice. Lung adenomas and splenic hemangiosarcomas, the most common spontaneous tumors in the Tg.rasH2 mice, are induced at a relatively low rate by MNU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1091581812471565">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1091581812471565">15</xref></sup> From our database, it is clear that over the past decade of using urethane, we have produced pulmonary and splenic tumors consistently in every study. Using urethane as the positive control material, the incidence of alveolar bronchiolar adenomas and alveolar bronchiolar carcinomas in lungs is 93.69% and 42.88% in males and 92.43% and 72.79% in females, respectively. In addition, the incidence of splenic hemangiosarcomas in urethane-treated males is 89.18% and 92.25% in females. When the combined incidence of all pulmonary and splenic tumors is taken into account the tumorigenic response in the positive control mice is almost 100%. This shows that the Tg.rasH2-urethane system is robust and proves the validity of assay beyond any doubts. The consistent high incidence of tumors in the urethane-treated groups has allowed us to reduce the number of animals in the positive control group from 25 to 10 animals/sex. The early onset of these tumors has also allowed us to reduce the length of study for these urethane-treated animals, from 17 weeks to 10 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1091581812471565">24</xref></sup> Production of a high number of lung and spleen tumors with urethane allows us to examine only these 2 tissues microscopically; when MNU is used, a number of different tissues usually need to be examined microscopically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1091581812471565">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1091581812471565">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1091581812471565">15</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, although statistical analysis remains a pivotal mechanism in analyzing results from short-term and long-term carcinogenicity studies, evaluating the incidence of tumor occurrence against an established historical control is useful in a variety of situations when statistical analysis alone could not establish the biological significance. The usefulness of a database is dependent on the sample size. Herein, we have presented the findings from our historical control database for the Tg.rasH2 mouse, which represents the largest set of data published for this strain. The low incidence of background tumors in the 6-month Tg.rasH2 model compared to the high incidence in a 2-year conventional mouse model allows us to more effectively draw conclusions about any treatment-related effects or lack thereof. The use of urethane as a positive control agent consistently produces pulmonary tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) and splenic hemangiosarcomas proving the validity of the assay. Since the establishment of the database in 2004, we have noted a very low variability in the incidence of spontaneous tumors between each of the studies and there have been no changes or differences in tumor incidence or trend, demonstrating the robustness of the animal model and the genetic stability of the strain, and confirms the reproducibility of the results.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-1091581812471565"><label>Author’s Note</label><p>The authors Paranjpe and Elbekaei contributed equally for this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn2-1091581812471565"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn3-1091581812471565"><label>Funding</label><p>The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1091581812471565"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>DE</given-names></name><name><surname>MacDonald</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name></person-group>. <article-title>Background and framework for ILSI's collaborative evaluation program on alternative models for carcinogenicity assessment.
