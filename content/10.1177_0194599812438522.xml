<title>Objective</title>
<p>The benefit of bone-anchored implantation (BAI) for the treatment of single-sided deafness (SSD) is well established. In this study, the authors sought to evaluate objective hearing outcomes and subjective benefits in patients undergoing BAI for SSD with residual hearing in the implanted ear.</p>

<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>All adult, English-speaking patients undergoing BAI for SSD from 2004 to 2010 were included. Patients were divided into 2 groups: (1) residual hearing in the affected ear (≤90 db hearing level [HL] pure-tone average [PTA]) and (2) profound hearing loss in the affected ear (&gt;90 dB HL PTA). Patients underwent pre- and postoperative objective hearing outcomes testing including speech-in-noise and monosyllabic word tests. Subjective outcomes were measured pre- and postoperatively using the Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile (GHABP).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599812438522">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Patients in both groups showed significant improvement in all objective hearing measures following implantation (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), and there were no significant differences in objective hearing outcomes between groups. Subjective benefits from BAI varied across patients according to GHABP results, but patients with residual hearing in the affected ear trended toward improved satisfaction with their device postoperatively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0194599812438522">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Individuals with SSD and residual cochlear reserve can be successfully implanted with BAI, achieving significant improvements in objective hearing measures. Postoperative improvements do not seem to correlate with the preoperative audiometric testing scores. Although subjective benefit varies across patients, BAI is clearly a viable rehabilitation option for patients with SSD and less than profound hearing loss.</p>

<p>Profound unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) or single-sided deafness (SSD) can affect an individual’s ability to hear in noisy situations, resulting in difficulty with speech comprehension, impaired sound localization,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812438522">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812438522"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812438522">3</xref></sup> and reduced quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812438522">4</xref></sup> Traditionally, aural rehabilitation for patients with SSD required a contralateral routing of signals (CROS) hearing aid,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812438522">5</xref></sup> but the amplification of background noise, distortion of sound, and need to wear a device on the normal-hearing ear kept overall popularity and satisfaction low.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812438522">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812438522">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, previous comparison studies have demonstrated increased benefit with bone-anchored implants (BAIs) as a transcranial CROS system over traditional CROS systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812438522">8</xref></sup> Other devices have been tried for the rehabilitation of SSD patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812438522">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812438522">10</xref></sup> but problems with sound quality, insufficient gain, and limited subjective and objective benefits have yielded little progress over the years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812438522">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812438522">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is accepted that patients with severe-to-profound SSD and poor word recognition in the affected ear do not receive optimal objective outcomes with traditional amplification devices. The BAI was originally described in the 1970s as a treatment option for conductive and mixed hearing losses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812438522">12</xref></sup> and was first described as an alternative for the treatment of unilateral deafness in 2001.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812438522">13</xref></sup> Currently, there are 2 BAI systems approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States for the treatment of single-sided deafness: the Cochlear Baha system (Cochlear Americas, Englewood, Colorado) and the Oticon Ponto system (Oticon Medical AB, Askim, Sweden). Indications for BAI in the treatment of SSD include (1) profound sensorineural deafness (&gt;90 dB hearing level [HL] pure-tone average [PTA] at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz) in the affected ear and (2) normal hearing (≤20 dB HL air conduction [AC] PTA at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz) in the unaffected ear. Multiple studies have demonstrated the BAI to have improved patient tolerance, speech-in-noise comprehension, and overall subjective satisfaction for the treatment of SSD when compared with other rehabilitative alternatives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812438522">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812438522">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812438522"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812438522">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are currently no studies in the literature evaluating objective performance and subjective benefit of BAI in the treatment of SSD when the affected ear is less than profoundly deaf. Only 1 study in the English literature has reported on an affected ear mean PTA of less than 90 dB HL in patients undergoing BAI for the treatment of SSD. However, it is unclear from this study how many patients met the “less-than-profound” criterion, and the individual patient performances for these patients were not reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812438522">18</xref></sup> The purpose of this study is to evaluate both objective hearing outcomes and subjective benefit ratings in patients undergoing BAI for SSD with less than profound hearing loss (≤90 dB HL) in the affected ear and to show these patients can receive both objective and subjective benefit following BAI.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>University of Miami Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained and a retrospective chart review was performed to identify all English-speaking adults (&gt;18 years) undergoing unilateral BAI for SSD between 2004 and 2011. Subjects were excluded if they had incomplete audiometric records, objective testing or subjective survey data, and/or follow-up. As part of the standard institutional protocol, all SSD patients were offered a trial with a traditional CROS system, and those who chose BAI received a preoperative demonstration. In patients with significant residual hearing in the affected ear, a standard hearing aid evaluation was performed, and subjects were included in the current analysis if traditional amplification was rejected based on a lack of objective and/or perceived benefit. All subjects underwent preoperative BAI evaluation using a headband simulation device and postoperative BAI evaluation at the time of loading as per the protocol established by the University of Miami Division of Audiology and described below.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812438522">19</xref></sup> Subjects were divided into 2 groups. The study group consisted of all SSD subjects with less than profound hearing loss (≤90 dB HL PTA) in the affected ear. These patients are referred to as the residual hearing group. The control group comprised all SSD subjects implanted under the standard criteria (&gt;90 dB HL PTA). Air conduction PTA was used to define hearing loss for this study as bone conduction (BC) thresholds beyond 55 to 70 are outside the limits of the audiometer. For those patients with BC thresholds less than 60 dB, we chose to use AC PTA as long as the bone thresholds were &gt;45 dB (otherwise, the patient would be defined as having mixed hearing loss). Given that this study investigated only a subset of patients with SSD who underwent BAI at our institution, some subjects included for analyses have been previously reported as part of a larger series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812438522">20</xref></sup> Additional preoperative evaluation consisted of standard audiometric evaluation including pure-tone air and bone conduction thresholds (PTA at 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz) and word recognition scores (WRS) using NU-6 speech materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812438522">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Objective hearing outcomes for the pre- and postoperative BAI evaluation were reported as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss in the unaided and aided condition using the QuickSIN (Etymotic Research, Elk Grove Village, Illinois). The test was administered in a sound field with speakers located at 90° and 270° azimuth. Babble noise and speech were routed through separate channels and calibrated independently. The multitalker babble was always directed at the better hearing ear and the speech at the poorer ear. A second test condition used the QuickSIN sentences delivered at fixed SNR for 3 different noise levels (+10, +5, 0 dB). In each of these conditions, 30 key words were administered at the appropriate SNR level and the percentage correct calculated. Test setup was identical to the previous testing condition.</p>
<p>All patients were asked to complete the Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile (GHABP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812438522">22</xref></sup> to assess subjective outcomes. For this study, the BAI was considered the hearing aid. All patients had used their device for at least 3 months prior to obtaining questionnaire responses. The GHABP evaluates initial hearing disability, handicap, hearing aid use, hearing aid benefit, residual disability, and subjective satisfaction. The questionnaire is divided into 2 sections: the first covers 4 predetermined listening situations; in the second part, the patient is asked to identify additional listening conditions in which subjective difficulties are experienced. For this study, only the first section was analyzed to standardize responses. Scores are scaled to lie between 0 and 100. Both raw and percentile scores are calculated, with higher scores in the initial disability, handicap, and residual disability domains suggesting increased difficulty, whereas higher scores in the remaining categories of use, benefit, and satisfaction indicating greater approval of the device.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using Wilcoxon signed rank tests for nonparametric data and paired sample Student <italic>t</italic> tests for normally distributed data. Spearman rank correlation testing was used for determining statistical dependence between variables. All analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 16; SPSS, Inc, an IBM Company, Chicago, Illinois). All <italic>P</italic> values &lt;.05 were considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>One hundred eighty subjects underwent unilateral or bilateral BAI during the study period. After patients were excluded based on the above criteria, 19 residual hearing subjects and 26 control subjects were identified. The residual hearing subjects ranged in age from 18 to 79 years (mean, 62 years), and the control subjects ranged in age from 18 to 79 years (mean, 57 years). The difference was not significant. Forty-four patients received the Cochlear Baha system, and 1 patient received the Oticon Ponto system. There were no device extrusions or osseointegration failures. The etiologies for SSD varied and are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812438522"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>. For the 1 patient with mixed hearing loss, there was a severe-to-profound mixed loss with an air-bone gap (ABG) of 28 dB. This was the result of a lateral temporal bone resection for basal cell carcinoma of the external auditory canal with an SNHL predating the surgery. This patient was included for study under the SSD indication as the subject’s BC PTA was outside the FDA guidelines for mixed hearing loss (&gt;45 dB PTA) and his AC PTA classified him as functionally deaf in one ear. As such, he was considered as implanted under the SSD condition rather than the mixed hearing loss condition. In the residual hearing group, mean preoperative WRS in the implanted ear (IE) was 21%, and mean preoperative AC PTA was 68 dB, representing a moderate-to-severe hearing loss. Mean values for the contralateral ear (CE) represented normal hearing thresholds and excellent discrimination scores. These data and those for the control group are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812438522"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>.</p>

<p>Residual hearing subjects were separated into 2 groups for further analysis: moderate hearing loss (50-69 dB AC PTA, mean = 62, n = 11) and severe hearing loss (70-90 dB AC PTA, mean = 76, n = 8). No significant differences were observed between groups for IE PTA, CE WRS, or IE WRS. Significant difference in IE PTA was observed between the groups (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). No significant differences in postoperative objective outcome measures were observed between the 2 groups or between either group and the control group. Closer review of these subjects revealed considerable intersubject variance in preoperative SNR loss despite the similarities in both IE and CE PTAs.</p>
<p>Two of the residual hearing subjects had a preoperative residual IE WRS of greater than 50%. Of these, 1 achieved normal performance on SNR loss testing postoperatively (preoperative SNR loss 19.5 dB; postoperative SNR loss 2.5 dB), and 1 achieved a mild SNR loss postoperatively (preoperative SNR loss 21.5 dB; postoperative SNR loss 6.5 dB).</p>
<p>Preoperative IE and CE PTA and WRS were tested for correlation with postoperative objective hearing outcomes, including SNR loss and percentage correct scores in 3 fixed listening conditions (+10, +5, 0 dB SNR). There were no significant correlations between IE PTA or WRS and any of the objective hearing measures. There were also no significant correlations between CE PTA or WRS and any of the objective hearing measures.</p>
<p>Postoperative GHABP data were collected, allowing for at least 3 months of device usage. There were large standard deviations in the scores reported on the GHABP for both groups, likely reflecting the highly variable range of reported subjective experience with the BAI. For subjects in the residual hearing group, mean (SD) initial disability score was 65.6 (12.8; range, 43.75-91.6), and mean (SD) initial handicap score was 68 (17.5; range, 31.25-100). Questionnaire responses obtained after BAI sound processor loading revealed mean (SD) scores of 27 (20.6; range, 0-75) for residual disability, 74.7 (33.4; range, 0-100) for device usage, 62.3 (21.3; range, 18.75-100) for subjective benefit, and 62.6 (27.5; range, 0-100) for subjective satisfaction. No significant differences in preoperative initial disability or handicap were observed between groups (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05). Postoperative use, benefit, residual disability, and satisfaction reports also did not differ significantly between groups (<italic>P</italic> &gt; .05).</p>

<p>Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2004 estimated that 7.9% of adults have unilateral hearing loss in the speech frequencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599812438522">23</xref></sup> Although most of these individuals may not suffer from profound deafness, their disability can result in the same or similar auditory deficits and handicaps as their peers with profound unilateral deafness. Many individuals with severe and even moderate degrees of unilateral SNHL are ultimately deemed “unaidable” with traditional amplification. As a result, their hearing loss remains untreated.</p>
<p>The term <italic>SSD</italic> is reserved for individuals with profound sensorineural deafness in 1 ear. In 2001, Vaneecloo et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812438522">13</xref></sup> first reported on the success of BAIs in patients with SSD. Since then, the benefits of BAIs for profound unilateral sensorineural deafness have been demonstrated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812438522">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812438522">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812438522"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812438522"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812438522">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599812438522">24</xref></sup> and there has been considerable support for the success of this treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812438522">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812438522">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812438522">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812438522">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812438522">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812438522">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599812438522">24</xref></sup> However, unaddressed in the literature, and of particular interest, are those unilateral sensorineural hearing loss patients with residual cochlear reserve in the poorer ear. It is reasonable to presume that patients with less than profound deafness in the affected ear and an inability to derive benefit from traditional hearing aids because of poor word recognition ability may also benefit from BAIs. Furthermore, the literature has shown that individuals affected by SSD derive significant improvements in their quality of life following BAI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812438522">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599812438522">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0194599812438522"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0194599812438522">27</xref></sup> The present study reports both the objective outcomes and subjective benefits of BAI in patients with residual hearing in the poorer ear.</p>
<p>Objectively, all patients demonstrated significant improvement in all measures for both fixed and variable SNR testing. It is, however, important to realize that objective benefit may vary widely across individuals. Although preoperative AC PTA varied considerably in the implanted ear, no significant correlations were observed between PTA and postoperative objective SNR results. This suggests that despite the degree of hearing loss in the ear to be implanted, the degree of objective benefit varies and cannot be predicted by audiometric AC PTA alone. Conversely, current audiometric candidacy criteria guidelines state that the contralateral ear must demonstrate normal thresholds (&lt;20 dB HL AC PTA); however, 20 of the patients studied in this review had AC hearing thresholds outside the normal range in the contralateral ear, and 12 had BC hearing thresholds outside the normal range in the contralateral ear. There were no significant correlations observed between the contralateral ear AC or BC PTA and postoperative SNR loss or fixed SNR conditions. Perhaps the lack of statistical significance is due to the small number of patients. However, it is also possible that the amount of cochlear reserve in the contralateral ear required for successful stimulation by the BAI falls outside the normal hearing range. This has been previously suggested in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812438522">18</xref></sup> with successful BAI outcomes reported in patients with contralateral hearing loss using a power device to stimulate the better hearing ear.</p>
<p>When the residual hearing group was compared with the control group, no significant objective differences were observed for any of the listening-in-noise conditions. Those subjects with a considerable amount of residual hearing sensitivity might be expected to gain a binaural advantage if the compromised cochlea can be stimulated by the BAI. However, even when subjects with optimal residual hearing (&lt;70 dB AC PTA) were selected for comparison, no significant difference was observed when compared with the control group. Although they do not have improved performance over the traditional SSD candidate, there is also no evidence to suggest they have reduced performance in comparison with SSD patients with profound hearing loss. This is an important finding and supports the consideration of BAIs in individuals with less than profound unilateral hearing loss unable to derive benefit from traditional amplification.</p>
<p>The current study is also the first to evaluate subjective outcomes in patients undergoing BAI for SSD with less than profound hearing loss in the affected ear. Although debate continues as to the best assessment method for evaluating subjective hearing benefits following BAI, the mean GHABP scores obtained in this study suggest a relatively consistent trend of improvement in quality of life and subjective benefits provided by the BAI. Furthermore, there is no observable difference in self-reported outcomes in this population when compared with SSD patients implanted under the standard clinical audiometric guidelines.</p>
<p>It is important to note the considerable intersubject variations observed in GHABP scores; however, this is not surprising given the variance in reported initial disability. More important, the GHABP results demonstrated a significant decrease in disability scores for the study group as a whole following implantation. The BAI users reported consistent device use and subjective satisfaction regardless of residual hearing ability in the implanted ear.</p>
<p>These results, combined with the significant improvement in objective hearing outcomes, provide strong evidence for the successful application of BAIs in patients with SSD and residual hearing in the implanted ear. However, 1 patient in the cohort was no longer using the device because of a lack of perceived benefit with the BAI treatment. Discontinued use of the BAI is a clear contradiction to the overwhelming success of the results reported herein. Despite this, group data reflect high scores for use, suggesting that those patients who do perceive benefit for the BAI use their device consistently. This underscores the importance of individualizing the candidacy process by combining objective and subjective measures preoperatively to predict postoperative outcomes.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The current study demonstrates BAI to be an effective option for hearing rehabilitation in patients with SSD and less than profound hearing loss in the affected ear. Patients with residual hearing showed significant improvement in all objective hearing measures following implantation and performed as well as their peers undergoing BAI for the SSD indication under the standard criteria. Furthermore, patients with residual hearing in the affected ear, like their peers with profound unilateral hearing loss, reported satisfaction and subjective benefit with their BAI device postoperatively. With the current and ongoing improvements in bone conduction technology, there has been a recent surge in new surgical and nonsurgical treatment options for patients with SSD. This combined with continued research may allow for new and expanded indications for those patients with debilitating hearing loss who are currently unable to take advantage of traditional amplification devices.</p>
