<title>Background:</title>
<p>We employed clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures in combination, to assess patient responses to interferon in multiple sclerosis.</p>

<sec id="section2-1352458512460605">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>To optimize and validate a scoring system able to discriminate responses to interferon treatment in patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1352458512460605">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Our analysis included two large, independent datasets of RRMS patients who were treated with interferons that included 4-year follow-up data. The first dataset (“training set”) comprised of 373 RRMS patients from a randomized clinical trial of subcutaneous interferon beta-1a. The second (“validation set”) included an observational cohort of 222 RRMS patients treated with different interferons. The new scoring system, a modified version of that previously proposed by Rio et al., was first tested on the training set, then validated using the validation set. The association between disability progression and risk group, as defined by the score, was evaluated by Kaplan Meier survival curves and Cox regression, and quantified by hazard ratios (HRs).</p>

<sec id="section4-1352458512460605">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The score (0–3) was based on the number of new T2 lesions (&gt;5) and clinical relapses (0,1 or 2) during the first year of therapy. The risk of disability progression increased with higher scores. In the validation set, patients with score of 0 showed a 3-year progression probability of 24%, while those with a score of 1 increased to 33% (HR = 1.56; <italic>p</italic> = 0.13), and those with score greater than or equal to 2 increased to 65% (HR = 4.60; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The response of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients to disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) is very heterogeneous, which makes it difficult to establish whether, and to what degree, one treatment is not producing the desired effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512460605">1</xref></sup> However, because the range of available treatments is broadening, it is becoming imperative for clinicians to accurately predict an individual patient’s response to a given therapy, in order to make optimal therapeutic decisions.</p>
<p>The assessment of short-term responses to therapy relies on outcome measures that may directly or indirectly reflect disease progression. Both clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures have proven useful in detecting disease activity and progression in patients with the relapsing–remitting form of MS (RRMS) who are treated with DMDs, and these two measures have been used in combination, to assess treatment response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512460605">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512460605"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512460605"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512460605">5</xref></sup> In particular, Rio and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512460605">4</xref></sup> proposed a scoring system based on the combined assessment at 1-year of clinical relapses, disability progression as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and active MRI lesions, in order to identify those patients having poor outcomes during the subsequent years.</p>
<p>A recent study shows that the combined measurement of 1-year brain MRI activity with clinical relapses is a good surrogate for assessing the short-term risk of disability progression in RRMS patients who are treated with interferon (IFN).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512460605">6</xref></sup> This observation provides a scientific rationale to test a scoring method for predicting responses to DMDs, based on clinical relapses and/or brain MRI metrics. We used two independent, longitudinal datasets: one from a large, randomized clinical trial of subcutaneous (sc) IFN beta-1a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512460605">7</xref></sup> therapy for RRMS and one obtained from an observational cohort of RRMS subjects who were treated with IFN,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512460605">4</xref></sup> with the aims to:</p>

<p>The first dataset, the “training set,” was comprised of 373 RRMS patients who were treated with sc IFN beta-1a, in the extension phase of the PRISMS (Prevention of Relapses and disability by Interferon beta-1a Subcutaneously in Multiple Sclerosis) study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512460605">7</xref></sup> In this 4-year follow-up dataset, patients received subcutaneous therapy with IFN beta-1a, 44 µg (<italic>n</italic> = 184) or 22 µg (<italic>n</italic> = 189) three times weekly, from the beginning of the study. Eight patients (2%) did not complete the first study year and thus, were not included in the present analysis, which was based on the remaining 365 patients. This dataset was used to develop the new scoring system.</p>
<p>A second dataset, the “validation set,” was comprised of 222 RRMS patients who were treated with different formulations of IFN beta at the Hospital Universitario Vall d’Hebron in Barcelona. In this center, all RRMS patients initiating IFN treatment were included in a follow-up protocol that collected demographic data, information on clinical relapses, EDSS scores and MRI data, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512460605">4</xref></sup> We used that dataset here to validate the new scoring system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1352458512460605">
<title>Defining risk groups</title>
<p>To identify those patients at risk of having a poor response to treatment, we developed a simplified version of the score reported by Rio et al. From now on we will refer to this modified score as the “modified Rio score”.</p>
<sec id="section10-1352458512460605">
<title>Rio score</title>
<p>This scoring system is based on a combination of MRI, relapse and EDSS criteria, as defined after the first year of therapy:</p>
<list id="list2-1352458512460605" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>(a) MRI criterion = 1; if the patient had (on the yearly MRI scan) &gt; 2 active T2 lesions, defined as new or enlarging T2-weighted lesions, plus the number of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd) T1-weighted lesions over the first year;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(b) relapse criterion = 1; if the patient experienced ≥ 1 relapse over the first year;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(c) EDSS criterion = 1; if there was an increase in the patient’s EDSS score of ≥1 point, sustained over at least 6 months and confirmed at the end of the follow-up period.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The sum of these three criteria classifies patients into those having a score of 0, 1, 2 or 3 (from a low risk to a high risk of having a poor treatment response).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1352458512460605">
<title>Modified Rio score</title>
<p>This is a simplified version of the Rio score, which was first developed by working on the training set. In the PRISMS dataset, new lesions occurring on proton density/T2-weighted MRI scans were counted over the first year of treatment on scans performed every 6 months. Over the same period, the number of relapses and the EDSS changes that were confirmed at 6-month visits were assessed. Statistical modeling was used to optimize the score on the training set (see supplementary appendix). Briefly, we first modeled the relationship between the numbers of new T2 MRI lesions and the numbers of relapses with the probability of EDSS progression over the subsequent 3 years, using univariate Cox models. Because it is unlikely that the risk of disability progression increases linearly with the number of new T2 MRI lesions and the number of relapses, these two variables were transformed, using five additional different smoothing functions, and the transforms that gave the best fits were chosen (see Supplementary Appendix for details on the smoothing functions). For those transforms based on a cut-off value, the optimal cut-off was determined as the one yielding the best fit in the Cox model. After this process, the optimized score comprised the following two criteria:</p>
<list id="list3-1352458512460605" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>(a) MRI criterion = 1; if the patient has had &gt; 5 new T2 lesions;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>(b) relapse criterion = 1; if the patient experienced 1 relapse; and relapse criterion = 2 if the patient experienced ≥ 2 relapses.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The score was created by simply summing up these two criteria, as follows:</p>
<list id="list4-1352458512460605" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>score = 0; if new T2 lesions ≤ 5 and relapses = 0;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>score = 1; if new T2 lesions ≤ 5 and relapses = 1; or new T2 lesions &gt;5 and relapses = 0;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>score = 2; if new T2 lesions ≤ 5 and relapses ≥ 2; or new T2 lesions &gt;5 and relapses = 1;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>score = 3; if new T2 lesions &gt; 5 and relapses ≥ 2.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Because the number of new T2 MRI lesions was assessed on 6-month scans in the training set<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512460605">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512460605">7</xref></sup> and on 12-month scans in the validation set, the cut-off value of 5 found in the training set was transformed to a 4 in the validation set (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458512460605">Table 2</xref>). This was decided after an additional analysis verified that the number of new T2 MRI lesions that were counted on the same subjects on yearly scans is about 75% of the number of new T2 MRI lesions, if counted on 6-month scans (see Supplementary Appendix for details). Therefore, for the validation set, the scores were as follows:</p>
<list id="list5-1352458512460605" list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>score = 0; new T2 lesions ≤ 4 and relapses=0;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>score = 1; new T2 lesions ≤ 4 and relapses=1, or new T2 lesions&gt;4 and relapses=0;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>score = 2; new T2 lesions ≤ 4 and relapses≥2, or new T2 lesions&gt;4 and relapses=1;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>score = 3; new T2 lesions &gt; 4 and relapses≥2.</p>

<p>Because the probability to progress in the validation set reflected the prevalence of progression in the IFN-treated population, it was possible to estimate the probability for a patient to progress, if classified as a non-responder (positive predictive value, PPV) and the probability of a patient being free from progression, if classified as a responder (negative predictive value, NPV). Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were also estimated.</p>
<p>Standard protocols of the original studies were approved by institutional review boards in the participating centers. All patients gave written, informed consent.</p>

<p>The prognostic value of the modified Rio score was then tested in the independent Barcelona (“validation”) dataset.

<p>Selecting patients with complete 4-year follow-ups from the initiation of treatment, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NPV of the modified Rio scoring system in identifying patients with an EDSS progression or with &gt; 1 relapse, during follow-up.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The early identification of patients with a poor response to therapy is critical for selecting potential candidates to receive alternative therapeutic approaches that may work better. This is particularly important in patients with relapsing MS, given their partial response to IFN therapy, and the recent advent of more effective therapies; thus, the need to make prompt treatment decisions concerning patients having suboptimal treatment responses, to avoid that MS progresses to such an extent that any treatment adjustment would no longer be effective. In this context, recent studies identify a number of reliable markers of response to IFN therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512460605">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512460605"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512460605">5</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512460605">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512460605"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512460605">10</xref></sup> Among those studies, the score system proposed by Rio and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512460605">4</xref></sup> has the advantage of combining commonly used, short-term (i.e. 1-year) treatment measures of disease activity, such as clinical relapses, EDSS progression and active MRI lesions, to identify patients who are developing new clinical activity (relapses or disability increases) during the ensuing years.</p>
<p>In the present study, we began by modeling, based on the Rio score, a statistically-optimized scoring system using trial data as a training set, which could easily be used on clinical grounds. This statistical modeling provided us with the best approach for processing the training set, which we then validated using an independent clinical dataset (the validation set). In both datasets, we found that there was a very close association between the probability of disease progression and any increasing values in the modified Rio score. Indeed, this modified Rio score correctly discriminated the greatest proportion of patients that were falling into the extreme groups, and this useful discrimination was even more evident when the probability of progression was considered since treatment initiation, as it was 20% for patients with score=0 and almost 80% for patients with a score≥2 over a 4-years follow up period. It must be noted that the lowest score (0) included patients with discrete MRI activity during 1 year (i.e. ≤ 4 new T2 lesions), who were thus considered to be at a low risk of disease progression.</p>
<p>Our analysis reported here confirms the difficulty in classifying patients with an intermediate score, who in our study showed a low-to-moderate probability to progress (33% or 43%, depending on 3 or 4 years of assessment of therapy, respectively). This remains an unsolved issue, probably related to the intrinsic difficulty in defining treatment responses in MS. Indeed, there are at least three factors challenging this definition: the high variability within the course of MS, which (especially in the Relapsing–Remitting phase) makes it difficult to attribute a result exclusively to a treatment, even if there is a drastic change in disease activity; the partial efficacy of IFN treatment, which implies the possibility of having responsive patients with residual disease activity; and the definition of disease progression itself, which in MS is not linear through the course of the disease. Despite these limitations in defining treatment responses in MS, the data reported here provide, even in patients in the intermediate score group, a helpful evidence-based quantitative analysis of the likelihood of disease progression after 1 year of IFN treatment, which could help clinicians make treatment decisions. A future step in improving the scoring system will likely focus on the specific group of patients with a score = 1, perhaps by observing their activity for an additional period of time.</p>
<p>In comparison with the previous approaches used to predict treatment response, the new scoring system presented here has the advantage of being the final result of a statistical modeling procedure. The exclusion of 1-year EDSS progression values from the score is consistent with the observation that a combination of new T2 MRI lesions and relapses seem to be a surrogate for disability progression. Excluding the 1-year EDSS progression also avoids the use of a measure that has high inter-rater variablility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512460605">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512460605">12</xref></sup> that would significantly slow down the decision-making process, as it requires at least a 6-month confirmation in a subgroup of patients; however, an EDSS increase in the first few months of therapy should alert us about the possibility of a poor outcome, regardless of the presence of relapses. The cut-offs for MRI lesions found by statistical modeling can be surprisingly higher than those previously proposed;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512460605">1</xref></sup> however, in our training set the prognosis of patients with 0–4 new T2 MRI lesions during the first year of therapy resulted very similarly. Under these circumstances, the choice of a lower cut-off would have had the effect of lowering the specificity, without a significant gain in sensitivity.</p>
<p>The other novelty provided by the proposed score is the use of the number of new T2 MRI lesions. Previous approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512460605">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512460605">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512460605">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512460605">9</xref></sup> have used T1-weighted Gd-enhancing lesions to assess MRI activity, since these are easier to detect. Unfortunately, we do not have gadolinium scans for the training set, which precluded us being able to study their role in the model. However, it is known that Gd-enhancing lesions are transient, with a time-course of about 1 month,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512460605">13</xref></sup> so that would require very frequent MRI scans to allow for a correct counting of acute lesions. Whereas the classification of a new T2 lesion can be more difficult (i.e. suboptimal MRI scans, incorrect repositioning or presence of confluent lesions) and it is certainly more time consuming, it is also true that T2 signal alterations appearing when a new lesion is formed remain stable in time, as a durable “footprint” of a plaque, thus enabling a correct (and safer) counting of accumulated new lesions, even when the MRI is assessed with much less frequency (i.e. yearly).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the findings reported here translate into clinical practice the observation that the combination of MRI lesions and clinical relapses is a good surrogate for EDSS progression, in IFN-treated patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512460605">6</xref></sup> This observation is translated into a clinical score that is able to correctly discriminate in a short time the vast majority of patients with RRMS who respond or do not respond to treatment. It must be kept in mind that this specific score is not valid for other DMDs; however, it is likely that similar cohorts of RRMS patients who are treated with IFN or other DMDs will be available for similar analyses soon, making it possible to further validate and refine our proposed score for IFN, as well as to derive new scores for other DMDs, perhaps by including other variables such as immunological markers. This scoring model to determine risk of MS progression early on in IFN treatment is an important step towards the idea of personalized medicine, which offers each patient a treatment that is best suited to him or her, according to his or her risk profile.</p>
