<p>Pollutant dispersion in a natural ventilated dental clinic</p>
<p><italic>W Zhang, CM Mak and HM Wong</italic></p>
<p>This study is expected to provide information and guidance in understanding the pollutant spread in a naturally ventilated room such as a dental clinic.</p>
<p>Freezing soil effects on earth-contact heat transfer</p>
<p><italic>SW Rees, PJ Cleall, Y-C Li and K Shao</italic></p>
<p>The principle application relates to the assessment of heat transfer from buildings through to the underlying foundation soils. In addition, the work is of direct relevance to a wider range of applications, for example, ground source heat pumps, thermo-active piles and foundations. The model lends itself to application with respect to utilisation of ground energy within the context of pavement design, particularly, in relation to the alleviation of winter ice problems. It also applies within the context of assessment of urban heat island phenomenon and heat and moisture transfer beneath freezer foundations.</p>
<p>Automated optimal design methodology of elevator systems using rules and graphical methods (the HARint plane)</p>
<p><italic>L Al-Sharif, AMA Alqumsan and OFA Aal</italic></p>
<p>This paper has an important application in allowing the designer to arrive at the optimum design for the elevator system using a clearly defined methodology. This ensures that the number of elevators, their speed and their capacity are optimised, thus ensuring that the cost of the elevator system and the space it occupies within the building are minimised. The method also employs a graphical method (the HARint) in order to allow the designer to visualise the optimality and the feasibility of the different design options.</p>
<p>An optimal predictive control strategy for radiant floor district heating systems: Simulation and experimental study</p>
<p><italic>SH Cho, S-k Hong, S-c Li and M Zaheeruddin</italic></p>
<p>Energy efficiency is a major issue of interest in the design and operation of sustainable heating systems. The radiant floor district heating systems have been successfully installed and operated in many countries resulting in significant energy savings. The optimal predictive control strategy proposed in this study further enhances the potential for higher energy savings from the district heating systems. The optimal control strategy is simple to implement as it relies on the predicted outdoor air temperature and computes future temperature set-points for the boiler water temperature. A suitably tuned Proportional-Integral (PI) controller can be used to track the optimal set-point thus realizing potential energy savings. A programmable logic controller or a supervisory control system would be appropriate to implement the designed optimal control strategy. The local control can be realized by using industrial PI feedback controllers.</p>
<p>Performance analysis on a residential radiant chilled ceiling system and evaluation on indoor thermal environment in summer: an application</p>

<p>Design approach for the integration of services in buildings</p>
<p><italic>F Fouchal, TM Hassan and L Loveday</italic></p>
<p>Successfully integrating building services such as water, air, electricity and data into a single trunking delivery system would offer an important advancement in reducing services installation cost, maintenance and the running cost of a building. Current design tools and techniques do not offer any solution for such integration; hence the current development of a multi-services trunking system. Subject to satisfactory compliance with health and safety requirements, plus maintenance issues, the system is proposed for embedding into building construction walls, panels or for placement into a confined space as a first step towards next generation building service. It is foreseen that many industries and business will be involved in the early stage of this development.</p>
