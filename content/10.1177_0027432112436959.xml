<title>Student-Centered Learning</title>
<p>Students benefit from self-exploration, discovery, and reflection in the learning environment. In “Constructivist Perspectives for Developing and Implementing Lesson Plans in General Music,” author Sheila J. Scott follows an elementary general music teacher as she adds student-centered approaches to her lesson planning. Rather than predetermined step-by-step processes for leading students to new knowledge, she considers her planning as a framework for students to come to “musical ways of knowing and doing” within a collaborative classroom environment.</p>
<p>In planning a series of tasks to reach a unit’s culminating outcome, she devises some tasks, but others will result from students’ questions and ideas. She frames her tasks around teaching strategies that assist students in their questioning and problem-solving initiatives. For example, she uses an O (observe), T (think), and Q/C (question or comment) approach whereby students analyze and question by applying what they know to refine their singing performance. This contrasts with her former teaching role: Students sang the song, and she analyzed the performance, provided feedback for improvement, and then asked students to sing the piece again, incorporating the feedback.</p>
<p>The teacher then devises a reflective listening sheet with the following questions:</p>
<list id="list1-0027432112436959" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>K [know]: What do I know about this music?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>M [mean]: What does this music mean to me?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>L [learn]: What would I like to learn about this music?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Through these questions, the teacher gains insight into her students’ prior knowledge and becomes aware of misconceptions that need addressing in future lessons. Responding to the questions encourages students to find ways to link their interpretations of what they hear to what they already know.</p>

<title>Dialogic Methods Class</title>
<p>“The front-loaded lecture can be a dangerous thing,” says John W. Scheib in “Empowering Preservice Music Teachers through the Dialogue-Centered Methods Class,” in the <italic>Journal of Music Teacher Education</italic>. A lecture creates passive students who are disengaged from the teaching–learning process. Scheib advocates dialogic classrooms that can transform a methods class into an empowering vehicle for student learning, as well as help students foster a greater sense of ownership in their future profession.</p>
<p>As an example, Scheib proposes that after reading assigned material for a class discussion, students should come to class with certain ideas that inform their understandings. “Rather than merely provide a front-loaded lecture on the material,” he says, “a more effective approach to better engage the students might be to simply question <italic>why</italic> the material is important for them to know and understand.” For a reading assignment on various methods of teaching rhythm to children, a class opener could be, “What does it meant to be musically literate?” After some discussion, an ensuing question would be, “How do we/should we teach music literacy?” If responses are mostly uniform, the instructor can play the devil’s advocate and pose problems for debate. Reflective journaling, online chat rooms, blogs, instant messaging, or e-mail exchanges can extend the discussion beyond class time.</p>
<p>Peer teaching, field experiences, and group projects allow students to hold more ownership in course material, but students should be involved in their design and implementation as well as in the postexperience critique. These experiences should be focused on <italic>creating</italic> knowledge rather than merely presenting established knowledge. Through planning, developing, implementing, and self-assessment, studentscreate understandings based on how <italic>they</italic> solved the problem or answered the question.</p>

<title>Intergenerational Music</title>
<p>“Active engagement with music in old age provides many ongoing benefits to older people, including positive self-esteem, feeling competent and independent avoiding feelings of isolation or loneliness (Hays and Minichello, 2005), maintaining or building cognitive skills (Prickett, 1998), and fostering socialization (Carr, 2006; Coffman and Adamek, 1999; Prickett,1998; Southcott, 2009),” says Peter deVries in a recent article in the <italic>Journal of Research in Music Education</italic> (<italic>JRME</italic>).</p>
<p>In a study published in the January 2012 issue of the <italic>JRME</italic> (vol. 59, no. 4, pp. 339–56), deVries examined three older Australians’ active engagement in music making with children. Five key themes about intergenerational (IG) music participation were revealed by his research:</p>
<list id="list2-0027432112436959" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>IG music experiences promoted social engagement.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>IG music experiences fostered the development of positive attitudes about young people.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Choice in music making was valued in the IG music experiences.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The older Australians who participated felt valued and respected.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There was the perception of reciprocity in the learning that occurred.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>DeVries concluded that students in elementary and secondary schools might benefit from the addition of intergenerational music-making opportunities. Of course, the elders would benefit as well.The biggest lesson for the students involved might be the fact that these senior musicians model lifelong music learning and participation in the arts.</p>

<title>Guys in the Choir</title>
<p>What influences boys to enroll in a school choir, and how do they feel about singing? Mark Lucas of the University of Oklahoma in Norman describes his research about the topic in “Adolescent Male Attitudes about Singing in Choir.” His study is found in the November 2011 <italic>Update: Applications of Research in Music Education</italic>. (NAfME members can read this and other <italic>Update</italic> articles at no charge by logging in to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nafme.org">www.nafme.org</ext-link> and clicking “Resources” on the top banner, then “Periodicals” on the left-hand banner.)</p>
<p>Lucas states that junior high music teachers are well aware of the challenges inherent in recruiting and retaining male singers. Changing voices and peer attitudes can be major impediments to teen boys’ participation in a choir.</p>
<p>Boys who enjoy singing have what Kenneth Phillips called “positive group experiences in ensembles with music they enjoy” (June 1994 <italic>Teaching Music</italic>, p. 24). Lucas surveyed teachers in six schools in Kansas and Oklahoma; these teachers had a total of 101 students in seventh- or eighth-grade choir. Each school had a band and a choir.</p>
<p>Results showed that students who believed themselves to be competent (“I’m good at it” said the survey item) and found choir fun were most likely to enroll in these ensembles. Many popular students participated in school choral groups, and peer support was also an important factor, but female peers were more supportive than were male peers. Many young male singers had supportive families, not all of whom enjoyed family singing, although some did.</p>
<p>Most of the boys in the choirs surveyed thought that they were good singers and that singing was pleasurable. Says Lucas, “This supports prior research that students who are confident in music because of success have a positive attitude toward music (Svengalis, 1978).” Self-concept also seemed to play an important role in student retention.</p>
<p>Interestingly, students who also played in the band “had a more positive attitude in general than nonband members,” Lucas stated. He summed up the implications of his study by stating, “Further research is needed to determine what makessinging in choir enjoyable for junior high boys.”</p>
