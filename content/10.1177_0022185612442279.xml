<abstract>
<p>The 2008–2009 recession created major budgetary problems in US cities and states. Conservative Republicans who had triumphed in many state elections in 2010 introduced laws to weaken or eliminate public sector bargaining on the grounds that it contributed to the deficits and hampered government responses to the crisis. Unions and their allies fought back in an effort to preserve collective bargaining and unionism in its last stronghold in the country. This article finds that states with public sector bargaining laws have higher debt-to-state gross domestic product (GDP) ratios and slightly higher deficits than states without such laws, but that the dominant cause of the budgetary problem was the recession, and that unions gave sizable wage and benefit concessions to deal with the crisis. The main motivations for the attack appear to be political opportunism and ideological opposition to governments bargaining with their employees. The majority of citizens favored maintaining public sector bargaining. The backlash from unions and their supporters to the attack in two key states, Ohio and Wisconsin, was sufficiently vigorous to suggest that the long-run effects of the war on collective bargaining may boomerang against the opponents of unionization.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0022185612442279" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 2011, following a conservative tide in the 2010 elections, Republicans in many states in the US introduced bills in state legislatures to weaken or eliminate the collective bargaining rights of state and local employees. The bills restricted the subjects that collective bargaining could cover, increased the contribution of public sector workers to pensions and health care, eliminated dues ‘check-off,’ and otherwise reduced the ability of unions of government employees to function. The ‘war on public sector collective bargaining’ was the most widespread and substantive attack on collective bargaining in the US since the 1930s’ battles in the private sector. It reflects an extraordinary hardening in conservative attitudes toward collective bargaining by government employees. In 1981, when the Reagan administration faced an illegal strike by the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO), the President fired the strikers and kept air traffic going by using military air traffic controllers. The Federal Labor Relations Authority decertified PATCO. But, in 1987, when the air traffic controllers chose a new union to represent them, the Reagan administration bargained with it. The administration never entertained the notion of ending collective bargaining for the air traffic controllers, much less for other federal government workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0022185612442279">Wikipedia contributors, 2011a</xref>). Unlike the conservative politicians who led the attack on public sector bargaining in the 2000s, President Reagan and the conservative Republicans of his era accepted collective bargaining as a legitimate social institution.</p>
<p>This article examines the war on public sector collective bargaining in the US and its possible impact on American labor relations. It lays out the institutional and historical background for understanding public sector collective bargaining in the US; describes the effort to curb public sector bargaining and the fightback of unions and their allies; and examines the economic rationale and the non-economic reasons for the attack. The article concludes by considering the possibility that the war on public sector bargaining energized unions, their supporters, and other citizens during a period of huge income inequality so that it could produce social changes far different from those that opponents of public sector unions hoped to accomplish with their campaign.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0022185612442279"><title>Public Sector Unions and Collective Bargaining</title>
<p>In 2010, the public sector was the stronghold of trade unionism and collective bargaining in the US. Union members constituted 36% of public sector workers, compared to 6.7% of private sector workers. Even though state, local, and federal governments employed just 15% of non-farm employees, over half of organized workers worked for governments (data from US Department of Labor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022185612442279">Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2011</xref>). That the US would have more union members among government than among private sector employees marks a huge change in the historically private sector union movement of America. In 1955, George Meany, the first head of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), declared that public sector workers could not be unionized because ‘it is impossible to bargain collectively with the government.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022185612442279">1</xref></sup> Public sector unionism grew rapidly in the 1960s–1970s when many states enacted laws that legalized public sector collective bargaining, while private sector union density dropped from 38% in 1955 to single digits in the 2000s.</p>
<p>Most public sector employees and public sector union members work for local or state governments. In 2010, local governments employed 53% of all public sector workers, state governments employed 30%, and the federal government (including postal workers) employed 17%. The share of public sector union workers was largest among local employees: 61% in local governments; 26% in state governments; and 13% in the federal government. Among the most important groups of highly unionized local government employees are teachers, the police, and firefighters, though unionization extends to virtually every type of local government employee – sanitation workers, clerks, guards in jails, and so on.</p>
<p>Different laws govern public sector and private sector labor relations. The 1935 National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), modified by succeeding federal law and interpreted by the federal judiciary, regulates private sector labor relations nationwide. The doctrine of federal pre-emption forbids states from modifying or enforcing the NLRA save for the 1947 Taft-Hartley ‘right to work’ provision that allows states to ban agreements that require employees to join the union at their workplace or pay agency fees for union services.</p>
<p>State laws govern labor relations for state and local employees. The First Amendment of the US Constitution guarantees rights to assemble and to petition the government, which the Supreme Court has interpreted as creating a fundamental right of association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0022185612442279">Wikipedia contributors, 2011b</xref>). Workers in the public sector as well as in the private sector are free to form and join unions. Each state, however, determines the labor law for unions of local government employees as well as for state employees. A state can recognize unions, meet and discuss issues with them, bargain with them, or it can outlaw bargaining with them. A state can choose different laws for different groups of public sector employees, with the result that legislation covering teachers, the police, firefighters, and other workers will differ within a state. Until 1959, the most that pro-union states that supported public sector unions did was to enact ‘meet and confer’ laws, which required that management discuss issues with unions representing their employees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022185612442279">2</xref></sup> Then, in 1959 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0022185612442279">Wisconsin Labor History Society, 2012</xref>), Wisconsin legalized collective bargaining in the public sector. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy used his power as the head of the executive branch of the US federal government to issue executive order 10988 that gave federal workers the right to bargain with government agencies over workplace issues but not over wages, whose levels the Congress sets. Many states followed Wisconsin and the federal government to enact collective bargaining laws for public sector workers, setting the conditions for the 1960s–1970s’ spurt in public sector unionism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022185612442279">Freeman, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612442279">Freeman and Ichniowski, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022185612442279">Table 1</xref> sets out the various arrangements for collective bargaining for public sector workers and public sector union density in the US states. It shows that in the 2000s, 27 states allowed collective bargaining for all public employees; five states forbade collective bargaining for all or virtually all public sector employees; while the rest allowed collective bargaining rights for some public sector employees but not for others. States with collective bargaining laws for all public sector workers had a public sector union density of 33%. States with collective bargaining laws for some groups of public sector workers but not others had a public sector union density of 21%. States that outlawed public sector collective bargaining had a public sector union density of 12.5%.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022185612442279">3</xref></sup> Among states where public sector collective bargaining was illegal, public sector density was highest in Texas at 17% and lowest in North Carolina at 10%. Because the states with collective bargaining laws included New York, California, Florida, and other relatively populous states, over half of Americans lived in locales with legal systems favorable to public sector collective bargaining. Operating under executive order 10988, federal government workers had a union density of 26.8% (US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022185612442279">Table 3</xref>). The largest unions in the US were public sector unions or unions with a large presence in the public sector.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022185612442279">4</xref></sup>

<p>Persons who view collective bargaining as the be-all-and-end-all of trade unionism may find it surprising that 12.5% of public sector workers in states that outlaw bargaining join unions – nearly double the density of private sector workers whose unions invariably bargain for them. But public sector unions have ways to improve the conditions of members without signing a collective contract with the employers. They lobby legislatures and the Congress. They campaign to elect politicians who are favorably inclined to them and the interests of their members. They can meet and confer with employers and come to agreements that closely resemble collective contracts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022185612442279">5</xref></sup> Public sector unions such as the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers, and the police and firefighters unions have formidable political machines that usually support the Democratic Party. However depending on the issues and candidates, the police, firefighters, and some local unions or state federations, support Republicans at the local or state level.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0022185612442279"><title>The ‘War’</title>
<p>The conservative Republicans’ attack on public sector bargaining began before the budget crisis and the 2010 election. It began in 2005 in Indiana when, on his first day as a governor, Republican Mitchell Daniels rescinded a 16-year-old executive order<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022185612442279">6</xref></sup> that had established state-level bargaining. Indiana’s legislature had never enacted laws permitting collective bargaining for state employees. It bargained with its employees because a pro-union Democratic governor had used his executive power to mandate bargaining between state agencies and unions, essentially mimicking President Kennedy’s executive order 10988 at the state level, which ensuing governors had accepted. Daniels further dictated no pay raise for state employees for several years and began to outsource government activities to private companies, with the result that state employment per capita fell to the lowest level in the country. Union membership of state employees dropped from 16,408 in 2005 to 1490 in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0022185612442279"><italic>Wall Street Journal</italic>, 2011</xref>). In the same year, newly elected conservative Republican Governor Matt Blunt of Missouri reversed his Democratic predecessor’s executive order that recognized the collective bargaining of the unions of state employees. Blunt also disbanded the state board that oversaw public employee union elections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022185612442279">Preciphs, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The rapid demise of collective bargaining at the state level in Indiana and Missouri, with the election of governors opposed to bargaining with government employees, highlights the fragility of relying on executive orders to create a labor relations system. Recognizing this, and concerned that a future Democratic governor would reverse Daniels’ anti-collective bargaining executive order, the Republican legislature in Indiana passed a law in 2011 that barred any governor from granting collective bargaining rights to state workers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022185612442279">Indiana Law Blog, 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022185612442279">7</xref></sup> At the national level, in 1978 Congress enacted Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act that declared that public sector labor organizations and collective bargaining were in the public interest and guaranteed those rights to federal employees by law, thereby preventing any future President from removing them by rescinding Kennedy's executive order.</p>
<p>The devastation of state and local government revenues in the 2008–2009 recession and the ensuing weak recovery created a budget crisis that opened the door for opponents of public sector unionism in other states to try to follow the lead of Indiana and Missouri. The budget crisis was the worst since the Great Depression. From 2008 to 2009, state revenues fell by 8.5% while the high rate of joblessness increased unemployment compensation from 8.5% of expenditures to 15.1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022185612442279">Pece et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, states had huge deficits in 2009, 2010, and 2011. Assuming that the country does not fall into a double-dip recession, analysts expect the deficits to diminish but to remain serious through at least 2013 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022185612442279">McNichol et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Conservative Republican opponents of collective bargaining saw the budget crisis as a potentially unique opportunity for the rollback of public sector unions. Claiming that the unions’ negotiated wages and benefits were a major cause of the deficits and that bargaining with unions limited the ability of governments to resolve it, Republicans in the Midwest and elsewhere introduced legislation to restrict public sector bargaining.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker, newly elected in 2010, called on the legislature in 2011 to enact the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0022185612442279">Wikipedia contributors, 2011c</xref>), a law that included in a budget bill provisions intended to effectively end public sector collective bargaining in the state of its birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022185612442279">Van Alstyne, 2011</xref>). In response, unions and their allies undertook mass marches and demonstrations. Between 25,000 and 100,000 citizens protested at the state Capitol in Madison at various times in February and March as the legislature considered the bill. Fourteen Democratic state senators boycotted a Senate vote and crossed the Illinois border to prevent the legislature from having a quorum. Republicans threatened to have law enforcement officials bring the legislators to the Capitol when they entered the state. From an undisclosed location, Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller declared: ‘This is a watershed moment unlike any that we have experienced in our political lifetimes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022185612442279">Benen, 2011</xref>). The drama played out nightly on TV and made clear to viewers the huge divide between those who favor public sector unions and collective bargaining and those who oppose governments bargaining with their workers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022185612442279">8</xref></sup> After much parliamentary maneuvering, the legislature enacted Walker’s bill on 9–10 March 2011. Two months later, a County judge struck down the law on the grounds that the legislature had violated the state’s open meetings law when it hastily convened to amend the measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022185612442279">Treleven and Spicuzza, 2011</xref>). However, the state Supreme Court overturned the judge’s decision and the law took effect.</p>
<p>The new law forbade state and local employees from negotiating with the government on issues like pensions, health care benefits, and working conditions. It allowed bargaining on wages only for wage increases at or below the inflation rate. It shifted the burden of paying for pensions and health care benefits from the government to workers, raising employee contributions toward pensions and health care premiums by huge amounts. It required public sector unions to win an <italic>annual</italic> vote to maintain union certification, prohibited them from collecting union dues through automatic payroll deduction, and allowed members to opt out of paying any union dues or fees when they wished to do so. Finally, the bill required agencies to discharge any state employee who “participates in a strike, work stoppage, sit-down, stay in, slow-down, or other concerted activities to interrupt the operations or services of state government, including … mass resignations or sick calls” (Wisconsin State Legislature, n.d.). The wide breadth of this provision reflects the way in which some union workers pressure public sector employers in disputes – by calling in sick or operating by the rules to slow down government services.</p>
<p>However, the bill did not cover all public sector workers. It exempted the unions of police officers, firefighters, and state troopers from most of the changes. Those unions could keep bargaining over whether the municipality will pay their contribution to the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS): ‘To the extent that future collective bargaining agreements continue to provide for the municipality to pay the employee’s contribution to WRS, public safety employees are exempt from the mandate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0022185612442279">Witynski, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Wisconsin law allows citizens to petition for the recall of elected officials after they have served one year in office, forcing the officials to face a new election (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022185612442279">Ballotpedia, 2011a</xref>). Recalls are the last resort of an electorate that feels that the officials have acted egregiously, for instance by not showing up for work or by committing some illegal act, rather than about some policy decision. But enough citizens judged that Walker’s bill to end collective bargaining was sufficiently egregious that they sought to recall six Republican legislators and the Governor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022185612442279">9</xref></sup> Unions and their supporters gained sufficient signatures for the state to hold recall elections for the legislators in the summer of 2011. The Republicans retaliated by petitioning to recall two Democratic legislators. If the Democrats won three Republican seats and held their own, they would gain a majority in the state senate. The voters recalled two Republicans and re-elected the Democrats. In the winter of 2012, unions and their allies had gathered enough signatures that they would be likely to force a recall election of the Governor in that year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022185612442279">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the neighboring state of Ohio, newly elected Republican Governor John Kasich initiated a similar battle. Kasich announced that his labor relations goal was to break the back of organized labor in schools, ban strikes by government workers, and do away with compulsory arbitration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022185612442279">Modern Esquire, 2010</xref>), which is the standard quid pro quo at the state level for settling disputes when state law forbids strikes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022185612442279">11</xref></sup> The Ohio legislature enacted Kasich’s labor bill (Ohio State Senate Bill 5; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022185612442279">Ballotpedia, 2011b</xref>) in March 2011. It extended Ohio’s existing strike ban from police officers and firefighters to all public workers, established penalties for those who participated in protests, and ended binding arbitration to settle contracts with safety forces. It forbade unionized workers from negotiating health care, sick time, or pension benefits, and unilaterally required state employees to pay at least 15% of their health care premiums. As in Wisconsin, the new legislation allowed public workers to opt out of any union dues and fees. Rather than limiting unions to bargaining for stagnant or falling real wages, the Ohio law gave voters the final call on collective agreements. If a collective agreement required a community to raise taxes to pay for it, voters had the right to overturn the contract through a referendum.</p>
<p>Ohio law allows voters to initiate statutes through referendum in order to enact a piece of legislation or to repeal laws that the legislature has passed. In response to Kasich’s labor law, a union-backed coalition, ‘We Are Ohio,’ collected 1,300,000 signatures to place the law on the ballot box in the fall 2011 election – a number far above the required level<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022185612442279">12</xref></sup> – and campaigned vigorously for its repeal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022185612442279">13</xref></sup> The result was a landslide defeat for the anti-union legislation: 61% of voters voted for the repeal and 39% voted to maintain the law. While chastened by this massive defeat, the Governor and his conservative allies threatened to come back with further legislation to weaken collective bargaining.</p>
<p>The war on public sector unionism extended to other states. The National Conference of State Legislatures’ Collective Bargaining and Labor Union Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022185612442279">National Conference of State Legislatures, 2012</xref>) shows a huge outpouring of public sector collective bargaining and labor union bills in 2011–2012, following the Republican triumph at the polls. There were 733 bills in 42 states relating to public employee unions, 140 bills relating to union dues/agency fees, 55 bills on political activities and contributions, 171 bills for public safety employees, and additional bills in other categories making a total of 1707 bills in 50 states. The majority of these bills in most states were designed to weaken unions and their collective bargaining rights. For example, in 22 of the 27 states that allow collective bargaining for all public employees, whose legislatures considered bills on union dues or agency fees, the bills were adverse to the union goal of collecting fees from non-members. But there was one exception: the bills regarding public safety employees in 21 of 25 states were favorable to firefighters, police officers, and other law-enforcement groups.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0022185612442279"><title>Effects of Public Sector Collective Bargaining</title>
<p>One of the stated rationales for the war against public sector collective bargaining was that bargaining contributed to the 2008–2011 budget crises in states and localities and weakened government efforts to resolve the crises. Studies of public sector unionism suggest that bargaining could have some adverse effects on state or local budgets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022185612442279">Freeman and Ichniowski, 1988</xref>). Unions raise wages and benefits for organized workers in the public sector as they do in the private sector, though by smaller percentage amounts. They often bargain to maintain public sector employment. Combining wage and benefit increases with little or no change in employment would increase expenditures for public sector services, creating deficits if the increased spending was not matched by higher taxes.</p>
<p>To see whether collective bargaining is associated with higher deficits, some analysts compare budget deficits/state revenues across states with differing rates of public sector unionization. Since laws regulating public sector bargaining lie at the heart of the ‘war,’ we examine deficits across states with different legal regimes, as identified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022185612442279">Table 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022185612442279">Figure 1</xref> shows that regardless of states’ legal system governing collective bargaining, budget deficits relative to state revenues follow the same pattern. Budget deficits are high in the early 2000s due to the dot.com recession. Budgets are in surplus in the ensuing recovery, then decline through 2008. Budget deficits rise massively with the recession. For 2011–2012, most states are expected to be on the recovery path of their budget.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022185612442279">14</xref></sup> The closeness of the curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022185612442279">Figure 1</xref> indicates that the size of deficits do not vary greatly by the legal system governing public sector collective bargaining. Macroeconomic developments that are associated with the Great Recession, not with public sector collective bargaining, dominate public sector budgets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022185612442279">15</xref></sup> Among the five states that outlaw collective bargaining, the recession hit South Carolina particularly hard, producing a deficit-to-revenue ratio considerably above the national average. But the dominant role of the economy in creating budget ‘ups and downs’ does not rule out the possibility that public sector bargaining contributed modestly to budget deficits.
<fig id="fig1-0022185612442279" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Budget Gap, as percentage of revenue, for states with different collective bargaining systems</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022185612442279-fig1.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>To examine in greater detail the relation between public sector collective bargaining and economic outcomes, we undertook two statistical analyses. First, we estimated the relation of the change in the natural log (ln) of hourly earnings of public sector workers to public sector union membership, using data on individual workers from the outgoing rotation group of the US’s major household survey, the Current Population Survey (CPS).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022185612442279">16</xref></sup> Second, we created a pooled cross-state data set on public sector density, budget deficits, the size of public debt relative to state GDP, and various measures of economic conditions in a state, obtaining state-level data from diverse sources.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022185612442279">Table 2</xref> summarizes our analysis of the relation between collective bargaining laws, union membership, and ln(hourly earnings) of public sector workers in the CPS data. Because the CPS assumes that all union members are covered by collective bargaining (as is broadly the case in the private sector), it does not ask union members if they are covered by a contract. As a result, the CPS measure of collective bargaining does not reflect the public sector reality in which a substantial number of public sector union workers are in states/groups that do not allow unions to bargain and, thus, are not covered by collective bargaining.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022185612442279">17</xref></sup> We deal with this problem by focusing on union membership alone and by conducting a separate analysis for states with different public sector bargaining systems. Estimates of union wage premiums within these legal systems also provide some control for unobserved factors among the states that may be correlated with attitudes toward unions and public sector wages.
</p>
<p>Line one of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022185612442279">Table 2</xref> gives our estimated coefficients and standard errors for regressions of the ln(hourly earnings) of public sector workers on the collective bargaining law of the state. The regressions include measures of a wide variety of demographic characteristics, occupation, and industry so that the coefficients reflect differences in wages among observationally equivalent workers. The estimates indicate that wages are about 7 ln points higher in states with the most favorable collective bargaining laws than in the other two groups. Line two adds a measure of the worker’s union status. The coefficient on the ‘full collective bargaining’ dummy declines markedly, while union membership obtains a coefficient of 9.5 ln points. Union membership is evidently more important in raising wages than is simply working in a state with collective bargaining laws.</p>
<p>Lines three through five report the coefficients on union membership for workers for the three groups of states with different legal systems on collective bargaining. The estimated coefficients here show that union members in states that allow for collective bargaining have a much higher premium than union members in states with partial collective bargaining. But the estimates also show that union members in states that prohibit collective bargaining also have a substantial wage premium. We view this as evidence of the ability of public sector unions to gain economic benefits for members through ‘meet and confer’ agreements and through lobbying and politicking, when they cannot bargain collectively.</p>
<p>Critics of public sector compensation often complain that state and local government workers have health insurance and retirement plans that are worth more than the health insurance and retirement plans in the private sector. Non-wage benefits are a larger share of compensation for government workers than for private sector workers. The public sector advantage in non-wage benefits is large when public sector workers are compared to all private sector employees but modest when public sector workers are compared to private sector workers in big enterprises. But without taking account of public–private sector differences in wages, both comparisons exaggerate the extent to which public sector workers may be getting an especially good deal. The reason is that public sector workers earn lower wages per hour than private sector workers – a pattern that is strongest among the higher-paid and more-skilled workers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022185612442279">18</xref></sup> The pattern of lower wages and higher benefits for public sector workers compared to comparable private sector workers is a classic case of compensating differentials.</p>
<p>The appropriate economic comparison between the sectors is not differences in benefits and wages separately, but differences in total compensation – wage earnings plus non-wage benefits. Combining data from employer compensation surveys with CPS earnings data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022185612442279">Bender and Heywood (2010)</xref> estimate that the total compensation of public sector workers falls short of that of comparable private sector workers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022185612442279">Keefe (2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022185612442279">2011b</xref>) finds a similar result for Wisconsin and Ohio public sector workers. Combining data from pension plans with CPS earnings data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022185612442279">Munnell et al. (2011b)</xref> find that total compensation for public sector workers is comparable to that for private sector workers. Most relevant to our analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022185612442279">Munnell et al. (2011</xref>a: 7) report that ‘within the public sector, the generosity of the pension formula does not appear to differ between states with high levels of unionization and those with low levels.’</p>
<p>Critics of public sector unions often cite the Illinois pension system as the horror case of what can go wrong with a pension system in a state with public sector collective bargaining laws. Illinois obligated itself to US $139b in pensions but set aside funds for only about 38%, giving it an US $85b unfunded liability that the Pew Center on the States called the worst in the country (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022185612442279">McQueary and Greising, 2011</xref>). However, the problems of the Illinois or other state pension systems cannot be blamed on collective bargaining per se since states legislate over the pension system rather than bargain over it.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0022185612442279"><title>Public Sector Bargaining and State Budgets</title>
<p>We consider next the relations between public sector collective bargaining and budgetary problems using the pooled cross-state time-series data set that we created for this purpose. Our analysis concentrates on two measures of the fiscal health of a state: the relative size of the deficit or surplus defined as revenues minus expenditures divided by revenues; and the ratio of state and local government debt to state GDP. In principle, state and local governments must balance their books annually, although in a recession it would be better for the economy if they ran deficits. Debt-to-GDP ratios represent accumulated deficits and state decisions to issue bonds to invest in public infrastructure such as schools, roads, bridges, and the like that contribute to economic growth and well-being. Without analyzing bond issues and the stream of pay-offs from public sector investments, it is not possible to judge whether higher or lower debt-to-GDP ratios are better for a state’s economic health.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022185612442279">Table 3</xref> summarizes our analysis of relations between deficits and the debt ratio and the public sector’s legal bargaining systems and union density in the 2000s. The estimated coefficients come from regression analyses that include the variables listed in the table notes to control for other economic differences among the states.</p>
<p>Line one of panel A shows that states with the most favorable collective bargaining laws have larger deficits but that the effect is statistically insignificant. Line two adds a union density variable to the regression and finds that states with higher public sector density have moderately greater deficits, significant at a 10% level. When we drop the collective bargaining law variables in line three, the coefficient on union density falls modestly but becomes more significant. Finally, the coefficient on union density becomes insignificant in line four when we add state dummy variables to turn the regression into a state fixed effect model. Because public sector density did not change much in the 1990s, however, the fixed effects analysis is likely to be marred by measurement error that biases estimated coefficients toward zero. Our results are broadly consistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022185612442279">Allegretto, Jacobs and Lucia (2011)</xref>, who find that union density in the public sector was positively associated with the size of states’ budget deficits in 2009 and 2010, but this estimated effect lost statistical significance with the addition of changes in house prices.</p>
<p>The estimates in panel B show a more consistent pattern, in which public sector collective bargaining laws or union density are positively associated with debt-to-GDP ratios at high levels of statistical significance, but in the case of the fixed effects regression, the likely measurement error in union density biases the estimated coefficients toward zero.</p>
<p>We conclude that states that have stronger collective bargaining laws or higher public sector union density have modestly higher deficits, whose statistical significance varies with model specification, and have higher debt-to-state GDP ratios, whose economic interpretation depends on the uses to which the states put the borrowed money.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0022185612442279"><title>Concessions or Intransigence?</title>
<p>Opponents of public sector collective bargaining viewed bargaining as an impediment for solving the 2008–2011 state and local budget crisis. Advocates of public sector collective bargaining saw it as a tool to help resolve the crisis as well as improve workers’ well-being when the economy recovers. Did the bargaining produce economic concessions that saved jobs and public services or did it impede state and local efforts to maintain services in the crisis?</p>
<p>There is a wide range of evidence that unions made substantial wage and benefit concessions to save jobs and preserve public services in the 2008–2011 period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022185612442279">19</xref></sup> In the fall of 2009, a Connecticut government reported the pattern of concession agreements in the nearby states of Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, and Rhode Island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022185612442279">Moran, 2009</xref>). In 2011, the governments of New York and Connecticut negotiated sufficiently large concessions with state unions that the unions had to struggle to get their members to accept them. In New York, Governor Cuomo’s deal with the Public Employees Federation, the state’s second-largest public employee union, called for a pay freeze for three years, for workers to forego a scheduled 3% annual raise, and for workers to pay between 2% and 6% more of their health insurance premiums. The goal was to prevent 9800 statewide layoffs and save the city of New York US $2.75b. In September 2011, the members of the union voted down the plan, but five weeks later, they reversed their position and accepted the plan, minimally modified (Kaplan, 2011a). In the spring of 2011, Connecticut Governor Malloy struck a deal with a coalition of state employee unions for a labor savings and concessions agreement aimed at closing the state budget gap without layoffs or deeper spending cuts. In June, two of the unions in the coalition refused to ratify the agreement, which threatened to create a huge deficit that would force the state to fire thousands of workers. Two months later, however, the unions ratified the contract they had previously rejected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022185612442279">Applebome, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022185612442279">2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>In Wisconsin and Ohio, unions were also willing to make concessions to deal with state budget problems. Wisconsin’s public sector unions had accepted most of Governor Walker’s demands regarding wages and benefits in the Wisconsin Budget Bill. Their opposition was to the parts of the bill that threatened collective bargaining. Ohio’s Office of Collective Bargaining pointed out to the Kasich administration that unions had given large concessions in the previous recession (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022185612442279">Joseph, 2011</xref>). A website concerned with Ohio issues listed local union concessions around the state under the headline of ‘Reality check: Public workers have already NEGOTIATED dozens of concessions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022185612442279">Holland, 2011</xref>). But in both states, the conservative Republican majority wanted more than wage and benefit concessions. They wanted to end the institution of public sector bargaining.</p>
<p>In sum, collective bargaining produced sizable union concessions during the states’ fiscal crisis. We do not have sufficient data on unilateral state and local government reductions in wages or benefits in locales without collective bargaining to determine whether the savings in labor costs were larger or smaller in the presence of collective bargaining than in its absence. Given that unions had negotiated wages and benefits above those that would prevail in a non-union market, they had greater room for making larger concessions and may have done so.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0022185612442279"><title>Public Attitudes, Political Expediency, or Market Ideology?</title>
<p>We consider next three non-economic factors that may have contributed to the ‘war’ on public sector collective bargaining. The first is the claim that the American public, made up largely of private sector workers who had experienced three decades of stagnant real wages, declining retirement and health insurance benefits, and was largely without union representation, opposed public sector bargaining as a tool for an elite group of workers to gain economic benefits that the rest of ordinary American workers could not get. This has been a major theme of conservative attacks on the wages and benefits of public sector workers (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022185612442279">Greenhut, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0022185612442279">Zuckerman, 2010</xref>). But the opinion surveys summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022185612442279">Table 4</xref> in the Appendix show that this is an incorrect reading of public attitudes toward public sector bargaining. The percentages for and against public sector unions and their bargaining rights are close, but in eight of the 10 surveys, the majority favors the public sector unions. The exceptions are the 9 March 2011 Gallup poll, which asked about limiting the collective bargaining powers of unions to balance budgets and found a slight majority for restricting collective bargaining, and the August 2011 Manhattan Institute poll, which reports a slight majority for restricting collective bargaining rights on one question but also finds a majority opposed to the Wisconsin law on another question. At the minimum, the opinion polls show no evidence of an enraged public seeking to eliminate unions and their bargaining role in the public sector.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022185612442279">20</xref></sup> The Occupy Wall Street movement targeted persons in the upper 1% of the income distribution, not overpaid teachers or police officers, in its opposition to inequality; and national debate has followed suit.</p>
<p>A second factor that may have contributed to the attack on public sector bargaining was that public sector unions had become so closely aligned with the Democratic Party that, given the opportunity, conservative Republicans believed that weakening those unions would gain them political advantage. That the Wisconsin legislation and many proposed bills in other states excluded public safety officers from the loss of bargaining rights fits with this explanation, as those unions are less closely tied to the Democratic Party than, say, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees or either of the two major teachers’ unions, the National Education Association, and the American Federation of Teachers.</p>
<p>A third factor is that many conservatives have long argued that public sector collective bargaining is problematic in a democracy on the grounds that bargaining takes from the citizenry the right to determine the allocation of public expenditures and levels of taxes. Consider two hypothetical public sector collective bargaining ‘horror stories.’ In the first case, a strong police union negotiates huge pay and benefits for police officers that takes up so much of a city’s budget that the city cannot provide the good schooling for children that the electorate really wants. In the second case, unions negotiate for such a large budget that the city has to raise taxes against the wishes of citizens. The proviso in Ohio’s State Senate Bill 5, which gives voters the right to a referendum to overturn a collective agreement that requires a community to raise taxes to pay for it, certainly reflects this concern. The fear is that collective bargaining gives public employees the power to effect policies that citizens should determine through the ballot box.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0022185612442279" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>What are the potential consequences of the war against public sector collective bargaining for the future of US labor relations? In his 1930 book <italic>My Early Life</italic>, Winston Churchill warned that ‘the statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given, he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022185612442279">Churchill, 1930</xref>: 231). The war against public sector collective bargaining has created a situation in the US in which neither the conservative Republican opponents of unions, nor union supporters and their allies, are masters of policy. In a highly polarized society with huge economic inequality, it has set off ‘unforeseeable’ events. The attack on collective bargaining galvanized union activists and their allies to an extent the US had not seen in decades. The response of unions and their supporters, particularly the mass demonstrations in Wisconsin, arguably set the stage for the Occupy Wall Street movement protests in the fall of 2011 that made income inequality a national issue. The landslide with which voters rescinded the Ohio collective bargaining law showed what an awakened citizenry can do to overturn policies that weaken the ability of workers to defend their own interests. When John Howard pushed the Work Choices Bill attack on collective bargaining and unions in Australia in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0022185612442279">Wikipedia contributors, 2011f</xref>), he did not anticipate that the reaction would be so great as to produce a landslide defeat for his government. The attack on collective bargaining in the US is regional rather than national, so that it is difficult to see it having national consequences by itself. But by sharpening political divisions in the country and raising issues of worker rights at a time when the public is increasingly concerned about inequality and the status of the middle class, the attack on public sector bargaining could potentially produce a type of social change far different from that which its proponents intended when they sought to undo 50 years of public sector collective bargaining.</p></sec>

They raise the value of public sector earnings by 15% to account for employment stability. Richwine and Biggs (2011b) argue that their CPS-based estimate that teachers are paid 19% less than comparable workers in other occupations gives an incorrect picture, because they are education majors with low Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) scores and because they have good pensions and job security. Adjusting for these factors, they estimate that teachers are overpaid by 52%. The direction of their adjustments are likely correct but the magnitudes are extraordinary.</p></fn>

His conclusion was that voters did not realize that the governors/legislatures intended to go after public sector unions (see Sides, 2011).</p></fn></fn-group></notes>
