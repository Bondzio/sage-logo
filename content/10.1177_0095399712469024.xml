<p>Editor’s Note:</p>
<p>This month’s issue continues the dialogue regarding Professor Kasdan’s July 2012 <italic>Disputatio Sine Fine</italic> on the Great Books of Public Administration as Camilla Stivers and Barry Bozeman enter the debate. We will be continuing the discussion in January, so please don’t hesitate to join in the conversation.</p>

<p>“Something there is that doesn’t love a wall.”</p>
<attrib>Robert Frost</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like other professional fields, public administration insists that its turf needs boundaries. Unlike most other fields, however, we seem unable to reach basic agreement on what they are. In fact, we can’t even seem to agree on who “we” are. Are we professors, as both Prof. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399712469024">Kasdan (2012)</xref> and Prof. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399712469024">Sherwood (1990)</xref> assume? Are we also practicing administrators, as the authors of <italic>Reinventing Government</italic> (Osborne &amp; Gaebler, 1992) took for granted?</p>
<p>Who should gain entry into a debate about “our” most influential books? What did bureaucrats think of the reinventing idea? Did they agree they were good people trapped in bad systems? They seem to have done so, given the reported enthusiasm with which they joined agency and interagency conversations set in motion for President Bill Clinton by Vice President Al Gore. Imagine their disappointment when it turned out that reinventing the federal government consisted mainly in downsizing the federal workforce. Meanwhile, professors gnashed their teeth over the fame and influence of a book that not only wasn’t scholarly but also was actually written by outsiders. How dare they!</p>
<p>Prof. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095399712469024">Kasdan’s (2012)</xref> redo of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399712469024">Sherwood (1990)</xref> survey underscores at least the following: Public administration’s need for boundaries deserves a closer look. I hope I understand the kinds of institutional pressures and politics that lead otherwise sensible people, including some in the Kasdan survey, to insist that academic respectability can only be won by rigorous application of the scientific method, no matter the topic at hand. True, use of the scientific method does draw a clear boundary, but it seems overly narrow, having prompted a few even to rule out books per se. After all, even Simon’s <italic>Administrative Behavior</italic> (going-away winner of the Sherwood poll) was an argument for the importance of science, not an exemplar of it. As the poet said, “Before I built a wall I’d ask to know/What I was walling in or walling out/And to whom I was like to give offense.”</p>
<p>What is the cost of building a wall around public administration? It has been said that a profession, or an academic field, needs boundaries to make good on the claim of distinctive expertise. Even if the scientific method produced a distinctive body of administrative knowledge (which it shows little promise of doing), structural barriers to its free application abound. For one thing, experts trained to produce the knowledge—that is, scientists—are not the ones who apply it. Lawlike generalizations, even of the midrange type, have a way of turning murky in practice, no matter how much we insist that administrative practice is “an art based upon a science—upon laws deducted from measurement” according to Taylorite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399712469024">Lilian Gilbreth (1914)</xref> some 100 years ago. This view still has influential adherents, despite little evidence of its practicability.</p>
<p>Another structural barrier to the application of scientific knowledge to practice is, of course, that few if any administrative experts are free from political constraints meant to keep them from applying whatever proven law they believe fits the situation. Accountability requirements stem from the reluctance of representative democracies to take it on faith that the theories and data with which administrators arm themselves are unalloyed, unselfish truth. Thus, even the most expert administrator has to answer to someone who isn’t “one of us.” The fall back argument—that results produced by the scientific method can be trusted because they are objective—is still advanced by many scientists (and in fact use of the method itself, rather than the subject matter or content of the research, has become a de facto boundary of sorts), but has failed to win support in the world of practice.</p>
<p>The notion that science can draw boundaries around the art of administration is problematic for another reason. Science and art are strange bedfellows. If administrative expertise were scientific, it would consist of rules validated by the scientific method, with no lack of clarity about when and how they should be applied. In fact, physical laws don’t have to be applied, they simply have to be accepted. Is there an art to applying Newton’s laws of motion?</p>
<p>If the idea of administration as an art is taken seriously, however, then we must consider what an art actually is, by studying how those who are said to be administrative artists act. This sort of research has been done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399712469024">Dreyfus and Dreyfus (1992)</xref>, who found that artists acquire their virtuosity not by studying theories but by practicing. They found that practice expertise—virtuosity—is pretty nearly the opposite of scientific knowledge. It consists of interpretive skills that can only be learned by practicing them in actual situations, where context, prior experience, judgment, intuition, trial and error, and developing the ability to “feel” the situation are what matter.</p>
<p>The Dreyfus research shows that the acquisition of practice expertise is a gradual movement away from close adherence to rules, facts, and clear situational characteristics, toward greater dependence on experience, use of examples, trial and error, willingness to bend whatever rules seem to be relevant, and exercising interpretation and judgment. This evolutionary process gradually leaves behind the conscious, rational application of rules in favor of intuitive recognition of the shape and substance of situations and the appropriate actions to take within them. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399712469024">Flyvberg (2001)</xref> sums up the results of this research,
<disp-quote>
<p>In normal, familiar situations, real experts do not solve problems and do not make decisions. They just do what “works.” <italic>This does not mean that experts never think consciously, nor that they always do the right thing.</italic> When there is time, and when much is at stake, experts will also deliberate before they act. Their deliberation, however, is not based on calculated problem solving but on critical reflection over the intuition which the expert applies. (p. 17, italics added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In summary, experts are virtuosos. Like champion tennis players or concert pianists, they don’t <italic>apply</italic> their knowledge, they inhabit it and act intuitively—which does not imply irrationality or guesswork, but rather drawing directly on experience in thousands of situations and recognizing similarities with the situation at hand, a skill exercised not instead of rationality but alongside it.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399712469024">Zingale and Hummel (2010)</xref> add two important points. First, paradoxically, novices discount virtuoso-level mastery as unscientific: “It isn’t until the rules no longer make sense that the conditions for new awareness come into context” (p. 18). Expertise is beyond the rules. Second, real expertise moves from confidence in one’s own interpretation to awareness of its limitations. Any particular sense of a situation has vague boundaries, and virtuoso expertise recognizes this. It may be, then, that administrative virtuosity is not only situational but also relational. This seems to lead in the direction of another way of meshing administrative expertise and democratic accountability—another way than simply “Trust Us!”</p>
<p>The notion of <italic>situation</italic> points in the direction of the context, background, or surroundings within which problems and dilemmas show themselves. In administrative practice, we often use the word <italic>situation</italic> to refer to emerging, ill-defined, but seemingly interwoven elements rather than to a clear template (“What the . . . ?” rather than “This is a case of . . . ”). We have what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399712469024">William James (1893/1950</xref>, p. 245) called, “A feeling of . . . ” As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399712469024">Eugene Gendlin (1967)</xref> explains, when I say this, what I feel is not my feeling but my situation—not physically bounded by definite facts, yet I have a sense of significance, a sense of being already in and a part of something. By the time I have a feeling of . . . , I am already in a situation. It has no boundaries of its own, only the ones I—better, we—impose upon it. As James says,
<disp-quote>
<p>My present field of consciousness is a centre surrounded by a fringe that shades insensibly into a subconscious more . . . Which part of it properly is in my consciousness, which out? If I name what is out, it already has come in . . . What we conceptually identify ourselves with and say we are thinking of at any time is the centre, but our full self is the whole field . . . somehow felt as one pulse of our life, not conceived so, but felt so. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399712469024">James, 1909/1996</xref>, p. 288)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Situations don’t exist out there waiting for us to stumble over them. We give them their shape—we draw boundaries, we make our surroundings meaningful. This doesn’t imply that there’s nothing out there, as critics cry gleefully. It does mean that the source of a situation is felt sense joined with meaning making. A situation is a clearing with blurred edges—a center surrounded by a fringe that shades into a surrounding more. Whatever boundaries we draw, to analyze and act, are permeable, tentative, and vague.</p>
<p>William James argued that we human beings are brought together not by explicit rules but by shared confidence in <italic>something</italic> that resists being made specific. He suggested that it isn’t the substantives, the concepts, the nouns, that enmesh us together, but the little words that move the process along: “a feeling of <italic>and</italic>, a feeling of <italic>if</italic>, a feeling of <italic>but</italic>, a feeling of <italic>by</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399712469024">James, 1893/1950</xref>, p. 245)—the vague words that evoke the stream of activity-between, the relations between elements in a situation, which are as significant as the things. James insisted that “The word ‘or’ names a genuine reality” (p. 324).</p>
<p>From this point of view, perhaps the most significant aspect of Prof. Kasdan’s research (and Prof. Sherwood’s before it) is the activity-between it shows us, the conversational dynamics that evoke a shared felt sense of “something” that resists being bounded, that shades out to vague edges, even as we try to define it. Our search for definite knowledge to erect a wall around our turf, in the way that the boundaries of a piece of land turn it into property, has costs we may not be noticing. Perhaps the poet was right: “Something there is that doesn’t love a wall.” The value of vagueness at the edges of our field not only makes room for judgment, for the art of administration, for virtuoso practice but also for expansive, open, and democratic ways of practicing, for the ever-appearing more that is new relationships, new participants, and new perspectives.</p>
<p>Just to stir the pot one additional time, here are the two best (definitely not most influential) books about public administration I’ve read in the last several years:</p>
<list id="list1-0095399712469024" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Stephen J. Rockwell, <italic>Indian Affairs and the Administrative State in Nineteenth-Century America</italic>, a stunning retelling of our history, a model of scholarship, and revelatory in its implications.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hilary Mantel, <italic>Wolf Hall</italic>, a masterwork of fiction that brings to life Thomas Cromwell, who rose from humble beginnings to become Henry VIII’s chief of staff and, in the doing, became one of the inventors of something we now call “public administration.”</p></list-item>
