<title>NCAA to Allow Access to Member Website for NCAA Team Physicians</title>
<p>The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has agreed to grant access to the member side of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://NCAA.org">NCAA.org</ext-link> for AOSSM members who are serving as a team physician for an NCAA institution. The NCAA member website has links to numerous resources and information (eg, topical articles, forms, rule changes) that are not available on the public side of the site. The website content includes information about rules and bylaws, eligibility, compliance, drug testing, recruiting, scholarships, and calendars. Of perhaps greatest interest to AOSSM members is the Health and Safety page, which has links to educational materials on issues of greatest concern to the NCAA (eg, sickle cell trait, concussions, substance abuse). Fact sheets that provide NCAA injury data summaries for women’s volleyball, men’s and women’s soccer, football, and field hockey can be downloaded with information for other sports to be available soon. Researchers who are interested in obtaining de-identified data from the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program can obtain information about how to request these data. Members are also able to sign up for an e-mail alert for new postings of material.</p>
<p>To request access to the members’ side of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://NCAA.org">NCAA.org</ext-link>, please send your name, preferred e-mail address, and college or university affiliations with sports covered to AOSSM Director of Research Bart Mann (<email>bart@aossm.org</email>).</p>
