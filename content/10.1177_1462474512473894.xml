<sec id="sec1-1462474512473894"><title>Adam Crawford (ed.), <italic>International and Comparative Criminal Justice and Urban Governance: Convergence and Divergence in Global, National and Local Settings</italic>, Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2011; 618 pp.: 9780521116442, £95.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>This is a highly successful collection of contributions from leading scholars addressing some of the most pressing questions in governance research. At first glance, it may be difficult to see a unifying logic for discussing ‘international criminal justice’ and ‘comparative criminal justice’ together with ‘urban governance’. However, an excellent introduction by Crawford pulls out synergies between these diverse sectors – shifting conceptions of state sovereignty, relationships between global/local, the control of territory and space – and other authors fulfil the promised exploration of both micro- and macro-dimensions of multi-layered governance.</p>
<p>Contributors tackle a wide variety of issues but the central theme, and the axis around which discussions revolve, is the State and its shifting role in security. The devolution of state security functions to actors both ‘above’ and ‘below’ the national level has, of course, been extensively analysed by researchers in multiple disciplines. Crawford and other authors resist painting these trends simply as a ‘withering away’ of the State, or a ‘victimhood of the national’ (Aas, Chapter 15), but recognize a more complex and compelling story of continually shifting power dynamics where the State remains at the centre of security provision, but as one component within an interdependent network of governance actors.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent sovereignty transfers to date is the field of international criminal justice, an area of law and practice which is typically portrayed as a triumph of transnational action and co-operation. James Cockayne (Chapter 2) presents a valuable corrective to this portrayal, noting that the story that is typically told (a humanitarian desire for accountability post-Second World War, frozen by Cold War politics, and revived in the mid-1990s with the creation of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia) overlooks a gradual turn to legalism that was on-going throughout the United Nations system and which made possible the development of international criminal justice. Other chapters in this section focus more deeply on the operation and impact of the international tribunals, and in doing so highlight the particularly valuable contribution which criminologists can bring to this realm, particularly in attentive analysis to the role of victims of crime and affected communities (e.g. Findlay, Chapter 5; Parmentier and Weitekamp, Chapter 6).</p>
<p>The theme of convergence/divergence which is highlighted in the title is examined by several authors in relation to the ‘big questions’ of criminal justice policy: what shapes penal policy? What is the relationship between penal policy and the wider political and social currents within a society? What is the relationship between penal policy and political economy (Cavadino and Dignan, Chapter 8; Lacey, Chapter 9; Pratt, Chapter 10; and Karstedt, Chapter 14)? These are questions which evade simple answers, beyond the general conclusion that divergence prevails – and, perhaps, that despite the work of some of the best scholars in the field we know very little about why different societies produce different criminal justice systems (or, more to the point, why very <italic>similar</italic> societies produce different justice systems).</p>
<p>Crawford links the theme of convergence/divergence to a broader global environment of flux, suggesting that fluidity, liquidity and movement are ‘the defining characteristics of the contemporary age’ (p. 1). As crime and crime control have been altered and challenged by mobility, criminal justice responses have increasingly dealt with the definition and control of space. The significance of borders and boundaries in establishing categories of inclusion/exclusion is at the heart of immigration and security policies (Aas, Chapter 15; Walker, Chapter 16) but similar processes are also apparent at the sub-national level, in social stratification through the control of urban space. Urban space is increasingly segmented, through security ‘technologies’ which are surprising for their archaism (walls and gates, as discussed by Blandy, Chapter 20) and for their modernity (such as the sonic-device ‘Mosquito teenage repellent’ described by Crawford (pp. 508–510), which broadcasts high frequency sounds only audible to younger ears and is marketed to retailers seeking to deter potential ‘loiterers’).</p>
<p>The structure of this book invites readers to draw comparisons across multiple dimensions of governance, and in doing so raises questions about the nature of comparativism – not least whether the appropriate methodologies and conceptual tools exist to analyse effectively this new state of security. This is addressed by McAra (Chapter 11), who appears to capture the philosophy of many contributors – and perhaps the collection as a whole – in suggesting that analyses of criminal justice policy can no longer remain focused on causal relationships from ‘above’ (political structures and institutions) or ‘below’ (societal culture), but must engage with governance as a multi-layered, networked field.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a tremendously readable, informative collection which successfully asserts commonalities across three very different and conventionally distinct spheres of criminal justice – and in doing so, represents a useful contribution to understanding the effects of globalization on governance, security and the nature of sovereignty.</p></sec>
