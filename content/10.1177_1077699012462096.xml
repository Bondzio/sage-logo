<p>Imagine living in a major metropolitan area with more than a million people as the National Weather Service issues a warning to start evacuating to safe ground in advance of a monstrous hurricane. You begin thinking about vital necessities—food, water, clothing, transportation, and shelter. You need additional information on the condition of local roads, emergency planning, and what to do if things get worse—exactly the kind of information you might expect to find in your local newspaper. Or maybe not, if your paper is <italic>The Times-Picayune</italic>, which in May 2012 announced plans to lay off 200 staffers and publish only three days a week.</p>
<p>That decision was another disheartening development for the city of New Orleans and its once-vibrant daily newspaper. Which begs the question seven years after the landfall of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita: “Have we learned anything?” Fortunately, in <italic>Covering Disaster: Lessons from Media Coverage of Karina and Rita</italic>, edited by Ralph Izard and Jay Perkins, both of Louisiana State University’s Manship School of Mass Communication, the answer is yes.</p>
<p>Every once in a while a collaborative examination of crisis events reveals truly unique insight and important lessons learned for communicators and public administrators going forward. In <italic>Covering Disaster</italic>, Izard and Perkins assemble an array of expertise to partner in sharing their perspectives. The book examines topics such as the performance of national and local news media reporting on the storms, to lessons learned in wake of natural disasters made worse by inadequate government response.</p>
<p>The first chapter considers the role of the news media during crisis and how Katrina reporting differed from reporting on the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The scale and magnitude of both events are also put into perspective, as was their degree of predictability. “Not only was the damage caused by Karina and Rita far more extensive, the story was purely domestic—and predictably expected,” the co-editors write. “There was no foreign enemy to rally against, no shadowy figures plotting the destruction of the United States from abroad. This was a natural, an act of nature, a storm on a path of destruction that had been charted for days.”</p>
<p>The predictability of the inevitable combined with the ineptness of the federal response gave way to journalists finding their voices. The editors note that for once in a very long time, reporters “abandoned their traditional impassive approach to the news and allowed their feelings to show in their reporting.” In reporting with passion in the aftermath of the storms, readers and viewers took notice as modern-day journalism made itself relevant again.</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, Professor Emeritus Guido Stempel III of the E.W. Scripps School of Journalism at Ohio University compares and contrasts the framing and types of coverage provided by network news organizations and local news media in the aftermath of Katrina. For example, ABC, CNN, and Fox had similar percentage of news coverage originating from the studio—about a third. Stempel notes that CBS had a little more than one-fourth of its coverage from the studio. Stempel points out that while network journalists mostly congregated in a few locations, local news media often operated from an advantage.</p>
<p>“The [local journalists] understood the topography of News Orleans and the surrounding area,” writes Stempel. “They knew where problems were likely to occur, so many, print and broadcast, were pre-positioned around the city and throughout the region in advance of the hurricane.”</p>
<p>Still, all in all, journalists went to work telling the story of great suffering on the part of local populations, including the young, old, hospitalized, and infirm. Dead bodies floating in water, the helpless plight of diabetics needing insulin, and the near-total collapse of a city’s infrastructure painted a picture of despair. Everywhere, the camera showed the overwhelming scale of misery and deterioration of the human condition.</p>
<p><italic>NBC Nightly News</italic> anchor Brian Williams, who suffered through a bout of dysentery while reporting from New Orleans, revealed his frustration with government inaction in the days after Katrina made landfall. “I was an eyewitness,” he said. “And so, any moral authority that viewers might have seen, any palpable anger that they might have seen from us owes to that.”</p>
<p>Chapter after chapter the authors of <italic>Covering Disaster</italic> make pointed observations about the expectations of readers and the noble performance of journalists who were victims of the storms, too. The book also examines the issue of coastal erosion, government and media organizations in crisis, and the performance of public relations practitioners. In no uncertain terms, <italic>Covering Disaster</italic> is a groundbreaking analysis that benefits from both academic and working journalist insight. It is a must-read book for students seeking to become journalists and for public officials wanting to understand the dynamics of reporting during and following a disaster.</p>
