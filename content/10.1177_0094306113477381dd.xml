<p>This big-hearted and incisive book reveals how policies and practices related to the demarcation, commodification, and valuation of urban space reinforce hierarchies of race and class. Readers should parse the title in two ways: more prosaically, as promising to elucidate how race-driven inequalities happen in access to employment, health care, mortgage lending, transportation, and education; but also more abstractly, in the sense of racism taking—possessing and commanding—particular spaces. As in his earlier work on race, memory, and popular culture, George Lipsitz documents the damage done by regimes of racial privilege to disadvantaged as well as advantaged groups and individuals. And also in keeping with earlier work, Lipsitz looks to the meaning-making practices of art, literature, and music to provide modes of confronting and destabilizing entrenched hierarchies, and help us imagine what democracy might look like.</p>
<p>Lipsitz begins by defining a “white spatial imaginary,” the signatures of which are an obsession with purity and uniformity, “hostile privatism and defensive localism” (p. 15), and the viewing of space “primarily as a locus for the generation of exchange value” (p. 30). Lipsitz shows how white Americans have legislated their advantage historically, and guaranteed that that advantage compounds into the future in the form of inherited wealth, narrative, and visual norms of “American” identity, and thinly camouflaged identity politics. Even after the gains of the Civil Rights Movement, which dismantled much of the legal armature of this advantage, whiteness continues to carry “an enormous cash value” (p. 36). Yet preserving the white spatial imaginary also carries enormous costs. These costs are both economic and ethical, as Lipsitz points out in his discussions of prison building and incarceration and the logical contortions of recent anti-desegregation referenda and Supreme Court judgments that, in privileging the coded concept of “local control,” reject as unconstitutional the very federal authority that had been used, for much of the nation’s history, to enforce white supremacy. If this chapter can seem a bit of a kitchen-sink critique, it is because Lipsitz wants to emphasize that space has always been essential to making and policing race.</p>
<p>Indeed, Lipsitz argues that we can account for the differing perspectives of blacks and whites on a variety of issues and policies, as “stem[ming] from the experiences and opinions generated by life in different <italic>spaces</italic>” (p. 69). Chapter Two introduces the black spatial imaginary, which, although—or perhaps because—it has been shaped by poverty and lack of access to quality jobs, education, and health care, “goes beyond hostile privatism and defensive localism to envision and enact broader affiliations and alliances” (p. 55). African Americans and other groups of color have branched out, burrowed in[to], and built up (to paraphrase a construction Lipsitz uses throughout the book) the spaces they inhabit—but generally do not own—providing models for “privileging use value over exchange value, sociality over selfishness, and inclusion over exclusion” (p. 61).</p>
<p>Descriptions of a number of such models comprise the last chapters of the book; but first Lipsitz offers two case studies of the white spatial imaginary at work. Chapter Three chronicles the tax-subsidized building of the St. Louis Rams’ football stadium, which occurred simultaneously with the defunding of St. Louis public schools. “What happens to a city or a society that neglects the education of its children in order to build sports arenas?” Lipsitz asks. The answer of course, is that the richest are further enriched while the immiseration of the poor, especially poor children of color, reaches new depths. Challenging the conventional wisdom that views professional sports teams as generators of cultural and economic capital for cities, Lipsitz follows the money as it travels upward through social strata and outward from the inner city, away from public needs such as education and into private coffers. Chapter Four examines the critically acclaimed HBO series <italic>The Wire</italic>, a show which Lipsitz gives due praise and equally due criticism. Despite <italic>The Wire</italic>’s sympathetic and realistic depictions of Baltimore’s drug dealers, police, politicians, dockworkers, teachers, and journalists, the show nonetheless reflects “the default positions inscribed in the white spatial imaginary: that people who have problems <italic>are</italic> problems” (p. 112) and that the meliorative programs effected by the Civil Rights Movement failed. In the final analysis, he observes, <italic>The Wire</italic> “leaves us with nothing to do but be disturbed and challenged, yet ultimately numbed by depictions of our own destruction” (p. 113).</p>
<p>It is precisely this desolation that Lipsitz wishes to avoid; and the remainder of <italic>How Racism Takes Place</italic> seeks to replace numbness with an affirmation of the agency of various communities of color. It should come as no surprise to readers of Lipsitz’s earlier work that this agency takes material shape through cultural production. Chapter Five traces the community-building of jazz musician Horace Tapscott, who gathered a group of activist musicians in postwar Los Angeles. Similarly, Chapter Six focuses on artist John Biggers and the Project Row Houses initiative in Houston’s Third Ward. Biggers and other community members sought to transform their community not only aesthetically but economically, through restoration and collective ownership of decrepit houses and commercial buildings. To Biggers’ and Tapscott’s “visible archives” of the black spatial imaginary Lipsitz juxtaposes the “invisible archives” of Paule Marshall’s fiction, Betye Saar’s visual art, and Lorraine Hansberry’s dramatic work. This work both painstakingly documents the ways in which the white spatial imaginary excludes people, and particularly women, of color, even as it seduces them with promises of upward mobility and consumer citizenship. Above all, these materializations of the black spatial imaginary testify to the collectivity, solidarity, and humane values of the black spatial imaginary. Given the centrality of these archives to his arguments, one wishes that the book featured some images.</p>
<p>Lipsitz ends with a look at New Orleans, both its history as a key node in the African diaspora and its post-Katrina transformation under neoliberalism, retrenched racism, and what Naomi Klein has called “predatory disaster capitalism” (p. 235). Lipsitz takes the reader on a musical tour of the city that, for all his encyclopedic knowledge and enthusiasm, risks becoming an uncritical travelogue, the author’s pleasure in the city’s inexhaustible musical creativity leaping through the prose. The weakness of this otherwise excellent book is its occasional line-crossing into romantic celebration of African American figures and communities. The strategy is perhaps appropriate given the ignorant disdain of so much representation of African America, but it does not match the gimlet eye with which he dissects the white spatial imaginary. However, the book mounts a powerful challenge to the recent justifications of racialized inequalities through revanchist scientific racism or the various “culture of poverty” concepts. Lipsitz marshals abundant evidence to show that such judgments “depend… upon fervent denial of the realities of racialized space” (p. 243).</p>
