<p>When the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland met in Edinburgh fifty years ago this month, the Moderator elected to chair the Assembly was Dr Nevile Davidson, who had been minister of Glasgow Cathedral since 1935. Had it not been for an act of typical generosity he would have been in all probability elected Moderator of the previous year’s General Assembly. Dr Davidson declined to be nominated as Moderator in 1961, when he heard that Dr Archie Craig, who had given so much not only to the Church of Scotland but the wider church too, was to be proposed. Along with Archie Craig, Nevile Davidson had been a Church of Scotland delegate to the Faith and Order Conference at Lund, which resolved that churches should not do separately what they could do together. Archie Craig was duly elected, and he had the privilege of handing over to Nevile Davidson when he demitted office.</p>
<p>It came as something of a surprise, remembering Nevile Davidson’s cut-glass accent and his aristocratic connections, that in the early nineteen fifties, he had been a great supporter of the Scottish Covenant which demanded a Scottish parliament to deal with Scottish affairs within the United Kingdom. At the meeting in the Kirk’s Assembly Hall of more than one thousand delegates to a National Assembly which sought self-determination on Scottish matters, Nevile Davidson was asked to lead the opening prayer. The inspiration of the Scottish Covenant, John McCormick, wrote later, “He rose magnificently to the occasion, and in sonorous tones and unmatched eloquence, he gave voice to the common purpose and united supplication of the people”.</p>
<p>In those days the General Assembly met for ten days, and at the closing session the Moderator was expected to give a substantial address, lasting at least an hour. In the course of his, Nevile Davidson identified three conditions which he believed required to be met if the Church was to be revived: the recovery of the parish system, where the emphasis was on the needs of the secular rather than the religious community. As a corollary to that, the willingness of congregations to release ordained clergy from constant pastoral attention to them in order to meet the needs of those outside the congregation. And third, taking the role of the ordained eldership seriously.</p>
<p>It did not happen. The parish system had been unworkable since the massive movements of population in the nineteenth century, and no amount of praise for it then (and now) will change that. Congregations had become the focus of their ministers’ primary concern since the church followed the population into the suburbs. Forty years before Dr Davidson became Moderator, the General Assembly was told that “the church’s resources were greatest where the need is least and least where the need is greatest”. Little had changed. And the practical effect of the eldership seldom matched the theory and the theology behind it.</p>
<p>As a former Convener of the Church and Nation Committee. Dr Davidson might be expected to have said that “the demand for the Church to confine its interest and its influence to its own domain is completely irrelevant. For the proper domain of the Church is the whole arena of modern life [which will] compel it to intervene in what appear to be purely political or economic or cultural issues”. The truth is, however, the Church of Scotland has been far better at diagnosing what is wrong with society then putting its own house in order.</p>
