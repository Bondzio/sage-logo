<abstract>
<p>The political-economy literature has so far almost unanimously regarded Slovenia as the social-democratic exception in Central and Eastern Europe, due to a combination of highly consensual democratic institutions, low party polarization, strong social partners, and developed social dialogue. However, the situation, since the fall of the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (LDS), which governed in 1992–2004, seems to be swiftly changing. Polarization has increased, union legitimacy declined, and social dialogue—especially in the aftermath of the 2007–2009 financial crisis—has all but collapsed. The 2010 pension reform is an archetypical example of how Slovenia now much more resembles its quarrelsome Eastern neighbours than the idealized exception that political scientists usually point at.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Political scientists have often had problems dealing with Central European countries, which are described as a “transition” regime, which combines liberal traits within a weak corporatist tradition. Two exceptions stand out, however, as the varieties of capitalism literature placed the Baltic states—Estonia in particular—and Slovenia at the two ends of the liberal-corporatist spectrum. Slovenia has been hence labelled as neocorporatist, as a coordinated market economy falling within the Continental European model, and as a corporatist social-welfare state.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0888325411415518">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>There was indeed strong evidence, both with respect to the country’s institutional configuration and its socioeconomic indicators, justifying the Slovenian anomaly. During its gradual transition from socialism to a market economy, Slovenia developed consensual decision making as its modus operandi, where the powerful social partners, especially the Association of Free Trade Unions of Slovenia (ZSSS), negotiated on equal terms with the government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0888325411415518">2</xref></sup> The institutional setting preserved numerous checks and balances, with deliberative fora that warrant broad societal representation (with such relics of the Yugoslav past, as the corporatist National Council, the second parliamentary chamber). Party institutionalization was low and polarization minimal, as grand coalitions were the norm and accession to the EU was a goal common to all party factions. Unionization used to be one of the highest in Europe, and not only among New Member States. Tripartite social dialogue thrived through dedicated nation-wide institutions, leading to encompassing collective agreements. Slovenia deliberately copied from Germany its vocational training and firm-level workers representation structures. Aside from the ownership structure (widespread state and insider ownership predominate), these institutions qualify Slovenia as a coordinated market economy (CME). Likewise, socioeconomic indicators place Slovenia very close to Scandinavian countries with respect to employment protection and social equality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0888325411415518">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Notwithstanding these characteristics, by early 2011, the highly consensual image of Slovenia does not typify the tiny country any longer. Since the ousting of the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (LDS), which almost uninterruptedly governed between 1992 and 2004, the political-institutional configuration that rendered such developments possible substantially changed. High rather than moderate polarization characterizes the country’s politics, where two parties—the Social Democrats (SD) and the Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS)—dominate. The grand coalitions that ruled the country during the 1990s are a memory of the past. On paper, unionization is still high, but the official figures are misleading. During the crisis, employees often circumvented the unions and autonomously negotiated with the employers, thereby delegitimizing the whole labour movement. Moreover, the membership to the country’s employer associations is no longer compulsory, which will possibly undermine the legal validity of collective agreements in the not too distant future. Finally, the consensual policymaking tradition has been largely disrupted, partly as a consequence of the 2007–2009 financial crisis and of the <italic>vincolo esterno</italic> represented by the Stability and Growth Pact and imminent OECD membership. The tripartite Economic and Social Council (ESC), whose agreement was necessary to pass onto Parliament any legislative acts dealing with relevant socioeconomic issues, has been lately systematically disregarded. The recent example of the 2010 Pension and Disability Insurance Act (PDIA-2) is a case in point.</p>
<p>In sum, Slovenia has gradually become a conflictual polity, where weak social partners are unable to negotiate. That social partnership is regarded as an impediment rather than a building block for societal advancement pulls the country closer to its quarrelsome Eastern neighbours.</p>
<p>The article proceeds as follows. The first section discusses the main characteristics of Slovenian exceptionalism. The following section takes a brief look at the Slovenian transition from socialism up to the financial crisis. The third section analyses its political-institutional structures, the weakening of the social partners—especially the unions, but also the government and employer associations—and, consequently, of social dialogue. The next section discusses the 2010 pension reform and focuses on the technical content, timeline, and perceptions on social dialogue. The final section concludes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0888325411415518">
<title>Slovenia as a Corporatist Social-Welfare State</title>
<p>According to recent studies that assess Central and Eastern European countries (CEE) within the varieties of capitalism literature, Slovenia evolved into something very similar to a CME.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0888325411415518">4</xref></sup> Several political-economy characteristics of the ex-Yugoslav republic confirm such supposition.</p>
<p>Undeniably Slovenia is neocorporatist. Slovenia had one of the highest union densities in CEE, 44.3 per cent in 2003, compulsory membership of employer associations (until 2006) and powerful tripartite (or interest-based) bodies, both at the corporatist—the Economic and Social Council (ESC)—and political levels—the National Council.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0888325411415518">5</xref></sup> These institutions result in collective wage, income, and social policy agreements that basically cover the entire working population.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0888325411415518">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the firm level, Slovenian works councils are influential and they evolved from the Yugoslav tradition of self-management. The system was transformed in 1993, loosely mimicking the German Betriebsräte.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0888325411415518">7</xref></sup> Additionally, firm-level labour union organizations exist in the majority of Slovenian firms, leading to strong (dual) workers’ representation. Finally, Slovenia adopted—with mixed success—a German-inspired dual system of apprenticeship (in firms and vocational schools), leading to the development of firm- and industry-specific skills.</p>
<p>There are, however, characteristics that pull Slovenia away from an ideal-type CME configuration. Because of the insider ownership structure and an interventionist state, both consequences of the 1992 Ownership Transformation Act, managerial rather than purely market-based capitalism emerged. Hancké, Rhodes and Thatcher call such arrangement the “compensating state,” a depiction that perhaps better fits to emerging market economies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0888325411415518">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>As for socioeconomic indicators, these show that Slovenia developed one of the most egalitarian societies in the European Union as a whole. With respect to employment, the total Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) index is above the OECD average (2.6 out of 6.0, between Belgium and Germany). Total spending on social protection exceeds the OECD average (23.0 per cent of GDP in 2005, compared to the 20.5 per cent average). The very low Gini coefficient of income inequality (0.247 in the mid-2000s)—a consequence of the strong redistributive role of the Slovenian tax and benefit system—was lower only in Denmark and Sweden. The gender gap with respect to earnings is one of the lowest among OECD countries (11 per cent in 2004).</p>
<p>Such favourable developments, in marked contrast with most other Eastern countries, required specific political and institutional structures, in particular strong social partners that are not afraid to strike complex negotiated agreements. During the past decade, however, these institutions have been substantially eroded, partly because these same structures have generated unintended consequences, which need rapid and resolute correction.</p>

<title>The Slovenian Transition: Gradualism, Immobilism, and Elite Preservation</title>
<p>Slovenia is regarded as a post-socialist success story. After a spell of extraordinary politics under the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia (Demos), Slovenia embarked on a gradual transition to a market economy and liberal democracy, as well as to EU membership, under the guidance of Janez Drnovšek’s Liberal Democracy (LDS). Gradualism and bipartisan government characterized its twelve years in power. In 2004, the Slovenian right-conservative bloc, led by Janez Janša’s SDS, tried to shake up the economy through neoliberal policies and uproot the ruling socio-economic elites through widespread reappointment of cadres. Even though Janša’s imperative style was severely punished at the 2008 elections, during its term in office, Slovenia successfully presided the EU Council and adopted the Euro.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0888325411415518">9</xref></sup> The following government, a centre-left coalition led by Prime Minister Borut Pahor’s SD announced a thorough reform plan, as a response to the financial crisis and the <italic>vincolo esterno</italic> represented by the Stability and Growth Pact and OECD membership. The coalition has so far failed to steer the country through the worst economic crisis since its independence.</p>
<p>It is puzzling that the financial crisis hit Slovenia so badly after fifteen years of sustained growth, low unemployment, and inflation at Euro-area level. According to Eurostat, the unemployment rate rose from a low of 4.2 per cent in September 2008 to 7.8 per cent in December 2010, and GDP fell by 8.1 per cent in 2009. Two interrelated problems have been building up during the country’s transformation: excessive gradualism and marginal replacement of former socialist elites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0888325411415518">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to Adam and Tomšič, the high level of elite reproduction under LDS was far from beneficial, bringing long-term negative effects, including the establishment of monopolies and rent-seeking behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0888325411415518">11</xref></sup> One of the various mechanisms through which this happened was the transformation of Yugoslav social property, which started in 1989 with the Marković laws.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0888325411415518">12</xref></sup> Disputes over the allocation of economic privileges culminated in the 1992 Ownership Transformation Act. This was a compromise between gradual and decentralized privatization and the rapid and centrally administered distribution of shares.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0888325411415518">13</xref></sup> The former would benefit existing elites; the latter would advantage players not holding privileged positions, that is, the emerging right-conservative bloc.</p>
<p>The consequence was delayed privatization, inefficient manager and employee buyouts, hybrid Privatization Investment Funds and various noncompetitive quasi-state funds. These led to the ineffective development of financial services and widespread insider trading, generating distrust towards institutional investors, keeping foreign owners out of the country, and creating powerful yet inefficient majority shareholders of the Slovenian enterprise sector.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0888325411415518">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Second, converting the political-institutional structures inherited from Yugoslavia was a complicated exercise, which profoundly impacted on the Slovenian transition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0888325411415518">15</xref></sup> The country’s affluence, social peace, and consensualism prevented shock therapy from being applied to any policy but monetary stabilization. Understandably, transforming a regional economy into a national economy, breaking away from Yugoslavia, and peacefully overcoming its socialist legacies (limited pluralism and self-management in a quasi-market economy) demanded caution, broad consensus, and strong social partnership.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0888325411415518">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, deliberate reform gradualism proved to be a double-edged sword. On one hand, Slovenian policy makers managed—starting from favourable initial conditions, within the post-socialist context—to successfully lead the transformation and simultaneously preserve social peace. Slovenia developed an effective form of “competitive corporatism,” both through social pacts and at firm level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0888325411415518">17</xref></sup> Stanojević employs Wolfgang Streeck’s terminology and calls it “competitive solidarity”: wage restraint is exchanged against a series of benefits, and stable employment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0888325411415518">18</xref></sup> This generated substantial growth despite gradualism.</p>
<p>On the other hand, decision makers resorted to lengthy negotiations to face organized interest groups. Structural reforms were often diluted and partial <italic>immobilismo</italic> characterized the long transition phase under Janez Drnovšek’s grand coalitions. Economic restructuring was slow in crucial sectors, such as finance, tertiary education and the judiciary. Likewise, large chunks of the welfare state—health care, pensions, family benefits, and the labour market—failed to undergo adequate reform.</p>
<p>If this was acceptable for so long, it was due to the very favourable initial circumstances. However, the situation dramatically changed with the financial crisis. Instead of building up savings, Janez Janša’s centre-right coalition slashed revenues and increased spending during the economic boom following the accession to the EU. The delays in restructuring became instantly relevant, as fiscal sustainability and labour competitiveness were swiftly undermined. The subsequent, Pahor’s centre-left government is caught in a catch-22 situation. Rojec et al., in fact, show that gradualist approaches entrench special interest groups, which employ economic resources for redistributive battles rather than to enhance efficiency. Accomplishing structural reforms becomes increasingly difficult at a time they are most needed, lowering the competitive edge of the economy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0888325411415518">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to the dismal outcome of its stay in power, Janša at first (2004–2005) rejected gradualism, opted for neoliberal policies and adopted an adversarial stance towards the social partners. In order to rekindle the Slovenian economy, Janša hired the so-called young economists and set up a Committee of Reform pooling more than two hundred experts. These drew an ambitious, neoliberal reform agenda, whose core were the flexibilization of the labour market and the introduction of a flat tax rate. The reform, however, ended with a memorable debacle.</p>
<p>Janša’s attempt clashed against ZSSS’s protests and Slovenian consociationalism. The public became swiftly disaffected: the approval rate plunged from 70 per cent in December 2004 to 45 per cent less than one year later. Simultaneously, the SDS-led coalition launched a “cadre tsunami” to dismantle most Slovenian socioeconomic networks. Instead of introducing structural reforms, the centre-right bloc veered towards economic populism, thereby attracting harsh criticisms from the very “young economists” hired at the beginning of incumbency.</p>
<p>During the 2008 electoral round, Slovenians rejected Janša’s confrontational style and voted him out of office. PM Pahor’s centre-left coalition took power during the harshest crisis to hit the tiny republic. According to Mojmir Mrak of the Faculty of Economics, Slovenian banks became illiquid in late 2008, and since Slovenia is a small open economy, the fall in international orders triggered an economic collapse. In the period of sustained growth 2005–2007, Janša’s government did not build budget surpluses and the European Commission failed to warn against such lax fiscal policy.</p>
<p>Consequently, the global financial meltdown exacerbated all the negative traits of the Slovenian economy. The accumulation of structural delays forced Pahor’s government to propose several unpopular measures and to act with excessive haste. The Slovenian Exit Strategy 2010–2013 envisages a number of structural measures (reform of the pension system, health care, and long-term care) as well as institutional adjustments (to corporate governance, financial supervision, financial services, and competition).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0888325411415518">20</xref></sup> The Government introduced a “traffic light” system to track these legislative developments.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0888325411415518">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>In contrast to the previous government, Pahor’s centre-left executive at least initially committed to social dialogue to introduce these reforms. However, as will be shown with respect to the 2010 pension reform, the social partners became extremely weak and captured by vested, narrow interests. Hence, Rojec et al.’s prediction that structural reforms become ever more difficult—in this case, because the social partners are unwilling to give in and strike complex negotiated bargains—proved to be true.</p>
<sec id="section4-0888325411415518">
<title>The Political and Institutional Underpinnings of Gradualism</title>
<p>Underpinning gradualism are the Slovenian institutional structures, which generate a thick web of checks and balances. With the 1991 Constitution, Slovenia became a parliamentary democracy that espoused asymmetric bicameralism with a marked neocorporatist flavor. Whereas the National Assembly is directly elected, the National Council’s members represent key economic interest organizations. The former wields almost exclusive legislative power and the latter has the right to veto legislation and force the Assembly to vote again on a given issue. Referenda are quite common in Slovenia and are a last resort option to prevent the adoption of unwanted laws. As for the electoral system, this is proportional with low thresholds, generating party fragmentation.</p>
<p>As a result of all these, divisive policy making is almost unattainable in Slovenia, because of lengthy legislative procedures and the diversity of interests to accommodate. Hence, such a system requires certain political characteristics to succeed: moderate polarization and cohesive governments; strong, collaborative social partners; and the inclusion of tripartite bodies in the policy-making process. All these were present until the early 2000s in Slovenia. The current situation is instead radically different.</p>
<p>During the past decade, Slovenian social dialogue has been eroded. Amid their generalized weakening, the relative strengths of the social partners have changed significantly. Because of interrelated reasons, governments are less capable of striking bipartisan deals or fruitfully negotiate with labour and employers. This led to unilateral attempts at policy making, clearly incompatible with the consensualism embedded in Slovenian institutions. The unions, which, exceptionally for post-socialist countries, strengthened their socioeconomic role during transition, have witnessed declines in their membership and legitimacy. The employer associations’ impact on policymaking had already been criticized as insufficient, and due to widespread insolvency and low competitiveness, has further declined. Finally, Slovenia has had so far well-developed social dialogue, in particular with respect to socioeconomic legislation, because of the Economic and Social Council’s (<italic>Ekonomsko-socialni svet</italic>, ESC) prominent role. However, as it will be shown, tripartite negotiations have all but collapsed after the financial crisis.</p>
<sec id="section5-0888325411415518">
<title>The government and party system</title>
<p>According to Adam, Kristan, and Tomšič, there is a bipolar division of the political space in Slovenia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0888325411415518">22</xref></sup> The two camps are not internally homogeneous, but constitute the left–right divide in the country. Three parties represent the left-liberal bloc: the Social Democrats (SD), the Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (LDS) and Zares. They all originate from former socialist elites. SD is the successor of the League of Communists of Slovenia (ZKS), and LDS of the League of Socialist Youth of Slovenia, the reformist socialist faction in Yugoslavia. After LDS’s electoral debacle in 2004, some runaway members formed the liberal Zares.</p>
<p>The right-conservative bloc (parties of the Slovenian Spring) is constituted by a variable number of parties. Currently, two are represented in the National Assembly: the Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) and the Slovenian People’s Party (SLS). These parties formed during the period of political pluralization and democratization.</p>
<p>Until the 2004 elections, the left-liberal bloc dominated: right-conservative parties ruled only after the founding elections, which witnessed the landslide victory of the six-party coalition Democratic Opposition of Slovenia (Demos), and for a short period during the year 2000. As mentioned above, LDS and SD enjoyed an advantageous position with respect to the competitors. The endogenous transition allowed former cultural, business, and political elites to socialize into the new political system and maintain their pre-transition status.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0888325411415518">23</xref></sup> Hence, rather paradoxically, the business elites are from the left, while the parties of the Slovenian Spring consider themselves as the losers in socialism.</p>
<p>Until the 2004 elections, the two blocs differentiated themselves with respect to their attitude to the past (interwar period and Communism), as well as to the role of religion. These are losing importance, as socioeconomic regulation is gaining ground. In 2004, Janez Janša’s Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) managed to secure a convincing victory. Their manifesto focussed on the failures and weaknesses of twelve years of LDS executives (rising clientelism and corruption) and promised radical liberalization and denationalization reforms to enhance Slovenia’s competitiveness. The left instead campaigned against rising inequality and for the preservation of social values.</p>
<p>Even though Adam, Kristan, and Tomšič point out that the bipolar structure in Slovenia is not so clear-cut because of the rather balanced electoral support of the two blocs and informal networks between them, the polarization of the political space has increased since 2004, leading to the impossibility to strike bipartisan deals and to excessively heated electoral competition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0888325411415518">24</xref></sup> This happened mainly for three reasons.</p>
<p>First, the difference in electoral support for the two main parties has narrowed substantially. If in 2000, LDS and SDS obtained, respectively, 36.3 and 15.8 per cent of the vote, in 2004, 29.1 per cent of the electorate voted for SDS and 22.8 per cent for LDS. In 2008, the situation was even more balanced: SD, which replaced LDS as leader in the left-liberal bloc, won by getting 30.5 per cent of preferences. SDS obtained 29.3 per cent. This means that polarization increased since 2004. Using the data set of Armingeon et al., the polarization score for Slovenia in 1990–2010 is a mere 0.286, which is very low for post-socialist countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0888325411415518">25</xref></sup> However, this score is entirely imputable to the post-2004 period.</p>
<p>Second, the era of grand coalitions has definitely ended in 2004. As Demos collapsed already in 1991, the left-liberal camp officially returned to power in 1993, under the guidance of Janez Drnovšek’s Liberal-democratic Party (LDS). Drnovšek served as Premier until 2002 and under his leadership, LDS became the most important political entity in Slovenia. Because of party fragmentation, before Janez Janša’s executive, all but one government were grand coalitions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0888325411415518">26</xref></sup> Since 2004, both Janša’s right-conservative executive as well as Pahor’s left-liberal government did not include any parties from the other bloc. Consequently, the single-issue Democratic Party of Pensioners (DeSUS)—a significant source of political instability—has often played the role of pivotal party, participating uninterruptedly to every executive since 1997. This qualifies it as one of the most successful pensioner parties in the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0888325411415518">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, even though ideological antagonism was always acute in Slovenia, during the 1990, the common goal of acceding to the EU aligned the interests of all political forces. As accession became certainty by the early 2000s, the political space decompressed, leading to extremely heated and uncertain electoral competition.</p>
<p>In sum, as a consequence of high polarization, the end of grand coalitions and extremely heated electoral competition, bi-partisan, consensual decision making has become less likely in Slovenia than in the past.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0888325411415518">
<title>The trade unions</title>
<p>In Slovenia there are seven trade union confederations (union centrals in Slovenian), of which two are limited to certain professions. Because of pluralization in early transition, the labour movement split along pro- and anti-communist lines. Representing the left, the Alliance of Free Trade Unions of Slovenia (ZSSS) is the largest labour organization in the country. It is the successor of the Slovenian section of the former Yugoslav trade union and it retained its primacy until the present day. Two other leftist unions, namely, the Confederation of Trade Unions of Slovenia, Pergam, and the Confederation of Trade Unions ’90 of Slovenia (Konfederacija ’90), seceded from ZSSS in the 1990s. On the right, Demos created in the early 1990s Independence, Confederation of New Trade Unions of Slovenia. Whereas in the mid-1990s, KNSS was the second largest organization, its strength now compares to that of Konfederacija ’90. Finally, in 2006, seven public employee unions formed Confederation of Trade Unions of the Slovenian Public Sector (KSJS), whose majority of members are civil servants.</p>
<p>Two factors contribute to the weakening of the union movement in Slovenia and perhaps call for a recalibration of their role in Slovenian policy making. First, the membership of the five main unions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0888325411415518">Table 1</xref>) has been steadily declining, but this is basically not recorded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0888325411415518">28</xref></sup> There is no legal right for the Slovenian government to ask the unions to declare their members. According to a government official (anonymous interview), the European Commission’s figures are grossly inflated for a number of unions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0888325411415518">29</xref></sup> ZSSS probably does not have more than two hundred to two hundred fifty thousand members, including pensioners; Pergam seventy thousand, while KSJS is similarly stable at seventy to seventy-five thousand. The others are very marginal, having between five and fifteen thousand members. Even though the criteria to participate in social dialogue are undemanding, in the future these may not qualify as proper confederations any longer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0888325411415518">30</xref></sup></p>

<p>Second, the unions have lost much of their legitimacy during the financial crisis. In fact, employees have bypassed them on several occasions, thereby shattering the so-called competitive solidarity, the basis for internal (firm-level) social partnership in Slovenia.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0888325411415518">31</xref></sup> The example of wildcat strikes, which did not even spare Gorenje, one of the most successful Slovenian exporters, is paradigmatic. This translated into a loss of internal legitimacy of trade union confederations, of ZSSS <italic>in primis</italic>, and hence into the inward-looking radicalization of their positions to regain authority over their (ageing) membership. In turn, this radicalization undermined the capacity to constructively participate in social dialogue, restricting the room to find compromises for all social partners.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0888325411415518">
<title>Employer organizations</title>
<p>There are four major employer organizations in Slovenia. Two of these, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia (<italic>Gospodarska zbornica Slovenije</italic>, GZS) and the Chamber of Craft and Small Businesses of Slovenia (<italic>Obrtno-podjetniška zbornica Slovenije</italic>, OZS), represented all entrepreneurs during 1991–2006, because of compulsory membership. Since 2006, membership is voluntary in the more important GZS and overall employer associations’ density decreased, as they now employ some 80 to 90 per cent of private sector employees. Since collective agreements require a density threshold of 50 per cent for automatic extension to entire categories, further declines may be detrimental.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0888325411415518">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, with respect to social dialogue after the financial crisis, this was a development of marginal importance. What matters more is that employers are plagued by widespread company insolvency and low competitiveness, leading to mass layoffs. Within this scenario, employers became very concerned with their own narrow issues (particularly, the level of their contributions and liabilities), further hampering the possibility to reach agreements through social dialogue.</p>
<p>Interestingly, with respect to the 2010 pension reform, neither Chamber did significantly participate, confirming their scarce involvement in policy making. More vociferous was the smaller Association of Employers of Slovenia (<italic>Združenje delodajalcev Slovenije</italic>, ZDS), founded in 1994, following the advice of the International Labour Organization (ILO).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0888325411415518">
<title>The Economic and Social Council and other tripartite boards</title>
<p>Slovenian social partners exert multiple influences on policy making. They have a quasi-compulsory advisory role through the Economic and Social Council (ESC) and an administrative role in the tripartite boards of the Institute for Pension and Disability Insurance (IPDI), the Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia (HIIS), and the Employment Service of Slovenia (ESS).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0888325411415518">33</xref></sup> Finally, the social partners draft every year or two a social pact, which specifies their mutual obligations. Economic, social, and wage policy is collectively negotiated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0888325411415518">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Starting with Janša’s executive, the effectiveness of tripartite bodies—the backbone of Slovenian social dialogue—has been significantly undermined and this trend, despite claims to the contrary, has continued during Pahor’s incumbency. Nowhere did this happen more clearly than with respect to pension policy.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Institute for Pensions and Disability Insurance (IPDI) plays an important role for the social partners. IPDI is almost exclusively responsible for the whole Slovenian retirement system. Even though the Institute is subordinated to the Ministry of Labour, Family, and Social Affairs, it enjoys relative autonomy. However, it has no active role in the legislative process, apart from giving recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0888325411415518">35</xref></sup> The Government approves its general director.</p>
<p>The composition of the Institute’s executive board and assembly (now committee) has been a major concern for all the partners involved, especially the trade unions. The issue gained in prominence after early transition, that is, after the honeymoon period between the unions and the Government was over. After that, the boards’ composition changed constantly.</p>
<p>Janša’s centre-right executive most actively tried to subordinate the IPDI to the governing coalition. The long-standing director Janez Prijatelj was ousted after twenty-six years and replaced by Marjan Papež. Simultaneously, the board and assembly were eliminated and substituted by a committee consisting of twenty-seven members, with a composition very favourable to the government. This should again change under Pahor’s executive: if the new pension reform enters into force, the Committee will be downsized to fifteen members, with proportionally more representatives for the unions.</p>
<p>More important for social dialogue as a whole is the role played by the Economic and Social Council. The ESC has been created in 1994 within the “Agreement on the Economy’s Wage Policy for the Year 1994,” an annex to that year’s social pact. Hence, the ESC is not underpinned by any legal act, but it nonetheless wields substantial power. It was customary that the National Assembly discusses socioeconomic legislation approved by ESC members. The ESC cooperates in the drafting of legislation and gives recommendations, it has the right of initiative to adopt new laws or amend existing ones, and it elaborates opinions with respect to legislative drafts, including the budget. The ESC sends its opinions to the National Assembly, the National Council, and to the public. Its main areas of concern are social pacts, rights and insurances, employment and industrial relations, collective agreements, prices and taxes, economic policy, legal security, codetermination, union rights, and freedoms.</p>
<p>Currently, the ESC has twenty-four seats, eight for each social partner. Each national trade union confederation and each employer association and chamber nominates at least one representative (employers have seven, the unions and government eight each). The ESC decides at unanimity, and each of the social partners has one vote. If there is disagreement, the ESC decides the deadline for reaching an agreement (maximum thirty days).</p>
<p>Given that the ESC is underpinned by customary rules only, Janez Janša’s executive broke away from this tradition and sent several acts to the National Assembly, outmanoeuvering the ESC. Because of the crisis as well as external and time constraints, Pahor’s centre-left government has done the same (for example, with the fundamental 2010 pension reform), despite claiming in several electoral manifestos that social dialogue is necessary and that it will be respected.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0888325411415518">36</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Failure of Social Dialogue: The 2010 Pension Reform</title>
<p>Since independence, old-age and disability pensions were almost perennially on the agenda of Slovenian decision makers. Two major reforms, in 1992 and 1999, marked the period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0888325411415518">37</xref></sup> However, neither was sufficient to fiscally stabilize the system in the longer run. The main problems that plague the ex-Yugoslav republic are a rapidly ageing population, low average retirement age, and a high pension to wages ratio. Additionally, the supplementary private pension schemes introduced by the two reforms required thorough rationalization (see following paragraphs).</p>
<p>Even though the 1999 Pension and Disability Insurance Act (PDIA-1) temporarily reined in public pension spending, this would in a no-reform scenario increase from 11.2 per cent of GDP in 2009 to 19.7 per cent in 2050.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0888325411415518">38</xref></sup> This, coupled with the need to increase the labour participation of older workers—according to Eurostat, the employment rate of Slovenians aged fifty-five to sixty-four was 35.6 per cent in 2009, against an EU average of 46.0 per cent —imply that reforming the pension system became a <italic>conditio sine qua non</italic> to stabilize Slovenia’s future fiscal position and to gain in international competitiveness.</p>
<p>The financial crisis precipitated the situation. Pahor’s centre-left coalition proposed several unpopular measures, including the 2010 pension reform. These measures were also devised in response to mounting external constraints. The European Commission launched an Excessive Debt Procedure in 2009, and the OECD—Slovenia is a member since July 2010—issued several warnings.</p>
<p>However, constructive social dialogue to enact a necessary reform simply failed. The government acted with excessive haste and there was no agreement within the coalition, as DeSUS disapproved of some policy solutions. At the same time, the crisis radicalized the attitudes of the other social partners, which remained entrenched in their original negotiating positions. The government had to bypass the Economic and Social Council, and legislated the new Pension and Disability Insurance Act (PDIA-2) only with the external votes of the Slovenian People’s Party (SLS) in the National Assembly. A referendum on the whole package is currently pending, becoming basically a plebiscite for or against the governing coalition.</p>
<p>The 2010 pension reform is just an example of a worrisome trend: because of their weakness, the social partners seem incapable of reaching complex negotiated agreements, a building block of Slovenia’s success in the past twenty years.</p>
<sec id="section10-0888325411415518">
<title>Technical Content</title>
<p>The 2010 Slovenian pension reform is chiefly parametric, diluting the most radical proposals that were advanced at the early stages of social dialogue. Notwithstanding, at the micro level, the reform forces rational individuals to work up to three years longer for a similar level of pension benefits. At the macro level, it lowers overall pension spending by 2 per cent of GDP by 2050 (with respect to the no-reform scenario). This means that pension expenditures do not rise for five years and that fiscal sustainability is assured for some ten to fifteen years, after which a renewed round of reforms will become necessary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0888325411415518">39</xref></sup> The retirement age, the benefit formula, and the provision of private pensions underwent substantial changes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0888325411415518">40</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section11-0888325411415518">
<title>Retirement age</title>
<p>The 2010 reform simplifies the Slovenian retirement system, whose complexity increased with every reform round. Stanovnik writes that eligibility conditions for pensioning are obscure, including the terminology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0888325411415518">41</xref></sup> Numerous exceptions prevented the effective retirement age from significantly rising. So, the PDIA-2 goes a long way to improve the situation, especially by increasing the statutory retirement age from sixty-one/sixty-three for women/men to sixty-five for all. At the micro level, a “standard” person should work longer to get comparable old-age pension benefits. Hence, the effective retirement age shall increase by two to three years, thereby lowering aggregate spending. This is, however, offset by bonuses and the possibility to draw a partial pension, once minimum eligibility is reached.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0888325411415518">42</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0888325411415518">
<title>Pension benefit formula</title>
<p>The original proposals have been substantially diluted during negotiations with the social and coalition partners. The final result is a tighter contribution–benefit link, including the recalibration of the benefit calculation formula and the introduction of more effective bonuses and maluses, the elimination of horizontal equity, less generous indexation, and finally, the possibility to draw a partial pension under determinate conditions.</p>
<p>Even though the document on pension modernization envisaged a two-step reform, that is, the initial elongation of the pension assessment base from the average net wage of the eighteen best consecutive years to thirty-five, and then the gradual introduction of either a point system or individual (NDC) accounts, PDIA-2 settled for the best thirty consecutive years, from which the three worst are deducted (de facto twenty-seven years).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0888325411415518">43</xref></sup> The Act does not foresee a second reform step.</p>
<p>Within the coalition, the most controversial issue was lowering indexation, which was, since 2005 Janša’s concession to DeSUS, tightly anchored to net wage growth. The final text envisages yearly indexation based on 70 per cent wages and 30 per cent prices, after a transitory period (2012–2015), when the ratio is 60:40. This came together with a notable simplification: horizontal equalization was eliminated from the system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0888325411415518">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>Finally, PDIA-2 introduces the possibility to draw a partial pension and more effective bonuses, if a person continues to be employed after reaching the minimum eligibility conditions. The decrements for retiring early have been substantially increased.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0888325411415518">
<title>Private pensions</title>
<p>The 2010 pension reform envisions a thorough reform of professional pensions as well as several changes to collective supplementary retirement schemes.</p>
<p>Professional pensions are a mandatory funded supplementary pension scheme that mainly covers people working under heavy or unhealthy conditions. This small fund for 41,000 employees was established in 1999. However, the plan’s structure was awkward and the accumulated sums insufficient. Hence, the whole system was restructured.</p>
<p>Supplementary pension schemes in Slovenia have been criticized for their limited coverage (57 per cent of the labour force by 2009), low premia paid in (also because of low tax incentives), conservative asset management, leading to unspectacular returns, and lack of comparability, due to the existence of too many different products on the market. Moreover, the possibility to withdraw as a lump sum the whole accumulated wealth after ten years of occupational insurance was seriously worrying the industry in 2010. Hence, the government decided to introduce various changes, mainly related to eligibility (now entirely tied to having fulfilled the conditions for an old-age or early pension under the statutory pillar), investment strategies as well as to the pay-out phase.</p>
<p>Major novelties are the rules regarding the investment strategy of supplementary pension funds. Strict quantitative limits on asset classes have been relaxed and replaced with the indication of those markets where pension funds can invest (mainly publicly traded assets in the EU and OECD countries) and with rules closer to the Prudent Person Principle. There are of course quantitative limits for investing into the sponsor, real estate, derivatives, and other limits in line with EU directives. Moreover, pension funds have to lead an investment strategy that either guarantees a minimum rate of return or resorts to life-cycle sub-funds. Funds are required to create three different sub-funds with different investment strategies, of which the one aimed at the oldest cohorts has to guarantee a minimum rate of return.</p>
<p>The issue of early withdrawals has been dealt with in two ways. To discourage current members to take out their savings as lump sums, the taxation of annuities was halved. Only 50 per cent is subject to the Personal Income Tax, thereby bringing Slovenian supplementary pensions closer to an Exempt Exempt Exempt taxation regime. With respect to the newly insured, instead, annuitization is mandatory upon retirement, if the accumulated assets exceed five thousand euros. Much to the disappointment of private providers, tax deductions on premia have not been increased.</p>
<p>Deep disagreement on fundamental policy issues—retirement age as well as indexation—as well as the relative aggressiveness of the government with respect to the social partners characterized the social dialogue on the 2010 pension reform.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0888325411415518">
<title>Policy Disagreements</title>
<p>Increased retirement age and pension qualifying period was the most controversial issue. The social partners did not reach an agreement, because the unions (especially ZSSS) did not accept any quid-pro-quo to lift their request for retirement without decrements at fifty-eight/sixty for women/men with thirty-eight/forty years of service period. Such request was often depicted as an “anti-reform” by Minister of Labour Ivan Svetlik, as the effective retirement age for men was already almost sixty-two. As Slovenia is heading towards a referendum on the 2010 PDIA-2, ZSSS’s manifesto encouraging voters to strike down the reform is almost entirely focused on this point, stressing that people who are employed in heavy or unhealthy occupations are unable to work that long before retiring. Similarly, the employer associations have repeatedly alerted the government to the fact that the Slovenian labour market is not ready to absorb high numbers of elderly workers, especially in the absence of adequate additional incentives.</p>
<p>The disagreements surrounding lower indexation started even before the 2010 pension reform was debated. As a quick fix for the crisis, the government—which failed to react on time and postponed some necessary cuts—prepared two austerity budgets, for 2010–2012, (partially) freezing the indexation of pensions and the wages of public employees, as well as social transfers. These measures provoked an outcry both within (mainly on behalf of the Democratic Party of Pensioners of Slovenia [DeSUS]) and outside the government. Hence, the recalibration of the indexation of pension benefits started on a wrong foot.</p>
<p>Originally, the Ministry of Labour proposed the introduction of Swiss indexation (50 per cent wages and 50 per cent prices).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0888325411415518">45</xref></sup> This was of course unacceptable to DeSUS, which had to cater to its constituency of pensioners. Subsequent negotiations even created a rift between the party (supported by some fifteen thousand retirees) and the Union of Associations of Pensioners (ZDUS) (which has some two hundred fifty thousand members among the retired population). The latter was, in fact, willing to find a compromise on the lower end of the scale (60 per cent wages and 40 per cent prices), while DeSUS, until the very end, and even backtracking on its own concessions, asked for an 80:20 ratio. Finally, DeSUS neither voted for the budget 2011–2012 nor for PDIA-2.</p>

<sec id="section15-0888325411415518">
<title>The Process</title>
<p>Even though most social partners decry the deteriorating quality of social dialogue in Slovenia, the number of tripartite working groups and their frequent meetings testify to the (at least initial) willingness by the government to build consensus around reforms. The debate on the reform of the statutory and supplementary pension schemes in Slovenia took place between March 2009 and September 2010. The government had with the social partners more than fifty meetings in at least seven different fora (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0888325411415518">Table 2</xref>),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0888325411415518">46</xref></sup> and produced about three hundred documents.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>During the debate, the government gave in on a number of points, watering down the most radical early policy solutions. Notwithstanding, the negotiations broke irremediably down because the social partners felt that their alternative proposals were not taken into account.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0888325411415518">47</xref></sup> Consequently, in September 2010, the government unilaterally submitted the text to the National Assembly. Despite the withdrawal of support by the Democratic Party of Pensioners and a veto by the National Council, the Parliament approved the Pension and Disability Insurance Act (PDIA-2) in December 2010, with the votes of the opposition Slovenian People’s Party (SLS).</p>
<p>This outcome resulted from all the traits that characterize the changing nature of Slovenian policy making. The pressure and acuity of the financial crisis radicalized the positions of the social partners, which were unable to react to common challenges that were, in turn, the unintended consequences of gradualism—the very modus operandi that characterized Slovenia’s success in the past two decades—and of wrong economic policy choices during a time of high economic growth.</p>
<p>The government was, as a consequence of the crisis, under extreme pressure by International Organizations, especially the OECD and the European Commission. This led to excessive haste during decision making of different structural reforms and to very unpopular, albeit temporary, anti-crisis measures. The government opened too many social fronts at the same time, and the situation soon became unmanageable. The presence of DeSUS in the centre-left coalition was the last straw that led to the complete breakdown of the consensus in the parliamentary debate.</p>
<p>The trade unions were also badly hit by the financial crisis: they did not respond adequately and were several times overridden by the workers themselves. This, coupled with falling overall membership and the threat of marginalization, probably led to the radicalization of social dialogue. The unions, to a varying degree, entrenched themselves into their original positions.</p>
<p>The employer associations, which are plagued by widespread firm insolvency and low competitiveness, were very concerned with their own narrow issues. However, they rightly made the government aware that the Slovenian labour market is hardly ready to absorb high numbers of elderly workers. Even though they showed apprehensiveness with respect to the state of social dialogue in Slovenia, they did not help the other social partners in bridging the most divergent positions.</p>
<p>As of May 2011, the reform process is yet unfinished: the main trade union, ZSSS, managed to collect enough signatures to ask for a referendum on the whole PDIA-2, which was—despite the counterarguments of the government—confirmed by the Constitutional Court.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0888325411415518">48</xref></sup> Consequently, the fate of the 2010 pension reform, and with it of both Pahor’s incumbent executive as well as of the challenges awaiting an eventual future government, is in the hands of the electorate.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The socioeconomic achievements of Slovenia since its independence, as well as its institutional configuration, created the perception in the political-economy literature that the ex-Yugoslav republic is a social-democratic, neocorporatist exception among post-socialist countries. This article agrees with such analyses; however, it also claims that the Slovenian anomaly was underpinned by favourable political-institutional characteristics—and advantageous initial conditions—that secured its success.</p>
<p>Highly consensual democratic institutions, low party polarization, strong social partners, and developed social dialogue allowed Slovenian policy makers to gradually steer the country from early transition to EU and EMU accession. Gradualism, however, proved to be a double-edged sword. On one hand, social peace and relative wealth were secured through effective “competitive corporatism”; on the other hand, some urgent structural reforms were postponed because of the lengthy negotiations that such modus operandi necessarily entails.</p>
<p>The financial crisis exacerbated these negative traits, calling for economic restructuring and reform. However, the very political preconditions that underpinned Slovenia’s success seem to have vanished during the past decade. The social partners appear weakened and unable to engage in constructive social dialogue that may end the political and policy impasse, which is threatening the country’s socioeconomic achievements.</p>
<p>The perceptions surrounding social dialogue in Slovenia vary dramatically, ranging from the government’s claims that it did whatever in its power to find a negotiated solution, to the unions’ statements that social dialogue in Slovenia is dead. However, continuing social dialogue still seems the only way forward for a consensual polity such a Slovenia, as stated by President Danilo Türk. His comments on the 2010 pension reform seem particularly fitting: “So we entered a blind alley. . . . But there is no real alternative to dialogue. It is something that concerns us all, both present and future generations. I wish that this time would be employed to thoroughly figure out what kind of dialogue we need and to also implement it. We did not manage to develop a culture of compromise, way too often is debate perceived as confrontation, where one of the parts has to be defeated, has to capitulate. And this is really bad for our political culture.”</p>

<p>Rojec et al., “The Rise and Decline of Gradualism in Slovenia.” According to the authors, the main elements of gradualism are (1) the privatization process, which failed to create an efficient ownership structure inducing rapid restructuring; (2) extensive state intervention in the economy in the form of state aid to corporate sector; (3) hesitant liberalization, demonopolization and privatization of financial services and infrastructure, coupled with labour market rigidities, exacerbated inflation, and lowered competitiveness; (4) costly and inefficient exchange-rate policy helped the survival of non-competitive industries. These factors discourage restructuring by crowding out companies from the capital market in favour of the central bank and the state; creating barriers to entry due to subsidies to existing companies; restricting foreign loans and investment; and by making imports more expensive.</p>

<p>In an early assessment of the 2010 reform, the OECD lauded these significant legislative changes. However, it still deems them insufficient to guarantee long-term financial sustainability. In particular, the OECD decries the excessive generosity (and no actuarial neutrality) of the benefit formula, of valorization and indexation as well as the discrepancies in the eligibility conditions of men and women.
