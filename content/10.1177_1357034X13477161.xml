<abstract>
<p>Emile Durkheim and Henri Bergson, two of the most important thinkers of early 20th-century France, give us different accounts of the relationship between habits, society and life. The article focuses on their use of embodied metaphors to illustrate how each thinker conceives of habit as a force of life. It argues that Durkheim uses the metaphor of ‘lifting’ to describe how social life creates habits capable of transcending bodily instinct. Bergson also recognizes the force of habits; he uses the language of leaping to describe the kind of action required to transcend them. The article makes three claims. First, it argues that these metaphors are central to each thinker’s understanding of the means by which habits attach us to life. Second, they offer a means of revisiting, and explicating, Bergson’s tacit critique of Durkheim in his <italic>Two Sources of Morality and Religion</italic>. Third, they both symbolize processes of conversion that inform each thinker’s diagnosis of the moral challenges faced in modern social life.</p>

<body>
<p>Two of the most important thinkers of early 20th-century France have given us interesting, but quite different, accounts of the relationship between habits, society and life. According to Emile Durkheim, the founder of French sociology, collective habits are sustained, regular ways of thinking, acting and feeling. Habits ensure the relative stability of social life, and to the extent that they exercise constraint over individual desires, they enable human beings to overcome their ‘natural’ instincts. In short, habits reflect the discipline required for human beings to self-actualize as moral beings. Henri Bergson, a contemporary of Durkheim’s, acknowledges the constraining moral pressure of habits in <italic>The Two Sources of Morality and Religion</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>). But, in contrast to Durkheim, who argues that the formation of collective habits establishes a difference in kind between human and non-human animals, Bergson claims that habits and instincts differ merely by degree. The singularity of human beings is not to be found in our capacity to form social habits, but in our ability to transcend them.</p>
<p>Despite their different perspectives, it is interesting that Durkheim and Bergson both use active, embodied terms such as ‘lifting’, ‘raising’, ‘leaping’ and ‘jumping’ to describe how human beings orient themselves to the kind of regular, sustained practices we call ‘habits’. This article claims that it is possible to use these terms as heuristic devices to explain how each thinker understands habits as constitutive of vital life forces, independent of whether they are social or biological. As such, the article draws on recent studies that argue that metaphorical language is not only grounded in ordinary embodied experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1357034X13477161">Gibbs et al., 2004</xref>: 1190), but that this experience also shapes the meaning we give to our concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1357034X13477161">Gibbs, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1357034X13477161">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1357034X13477161">Wilson and Gibbs, 2007</xref>). In a very general way, I want to suggest that the relationship between metaphor and embodied concepts intersects with what Latour has called ‘body talk’, understood as the way that the body is exhorted in accounts about what it is and does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X13477161">Latour, 2004</xref>: 206). And here we might say that, for both Durkheim and Bergson, habits are a constitutive dimension of our embodied experience in the world.</p>
<p>I want to argue that Durkheim repeatedly uses the metaphor of ‘lifting’ (<italic>élever</italic>) to describe how our habitual association with one another creates a force capable of transcending our bodily instincts. Bergson uses the language of the ‘leap’ (<italic>bond</italic>) or a ‘jump’ (<italic>saut</italic>) as a metaphor to describe the kind of action required to transcend the force of habits. The article makes three claims. First, I want to argue that these metaphors are central to each thinker’s understanding of the means by which habits attach us to life. Second, these metaphors give us a powerful way to read the <italic>Two Sources</italic>as – among other things – a sustained interrogation of Durkheim’s understanding of society and the role of habits within that theory. Third, these metaphors represent processes of conversion. Durkheim uses the language of lifting to describe the conversion from individual instinct <italic>to</italic> collective habits, and Bergson uses the ‘leap’ to describe how the creative emotion of love can facilitate a leap <italic>from</italic> habit. As metaphors for conversion, they play an important role in each thinker’s diagnosis of the ethical and moral challenges of the 20th century and beyond.</p>
<p>This article claims that the debate between Durkheim and Bergson is worth revisiting for three reasons.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1357034X13477161">1</xref>
</sup> First, it contributes to the current rethinking of familiar and long-standing dualisms between the social and the natural, the mind and the body, and the cognitive and the affective. Second, the debate adds texture to the current interest in Gabriel Tarde (1903 [1895]), who conceives of invention and imitation as immanent to <italic>any</italic> modality of association whether human or non-human.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1357034X13477161">2</xref>
</sup> Tarde’s conception of the social was addressed by Durkheim, negatively and explicitly, and later by Bergson, positively and implicitly in <italic>Two Sources</italic>. Third, it forces us to think about how habits shape the relationship between what a body is (or does) and the way it is <italic>affected</italic>, that is how it is moved or put into motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1357034X13477161">Blackman and Venn, 2010</xref>: 9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1357034X13477161">Despret, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1357034X13477161">Latour, 2004</xref>). It contributes to an appreciation of the affective forces that shape our feelings of attachment to what David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1357034X13477161">Stern (1985</xref>: 57) calls the ‘vital processes of life’, whether these processes are conceived as primarily social (as for Durkheim) or biological (as for Bergson).<sup>

<title>Durkheim’s Lift</title>
<p>Emile Durkheim’s (1858–1917) central contribution to social theory is a conception of society as a reality<italic> sui generis</italic>. Society is not a biologically conditioned reality, but a human achievement. For Durkheim, it is an accomplishment insofar as it represents the human ability to transcend the physical constraints of our bodily organism through cultivating collective habits and representations that are external to any given individual. In short, society is the collective overcoming of our animal nature. Throughout his writing, Durkheim often uses the French verb <italic>élever</italic> which means ‘to raise’ in order to convey this sense of ‘accomplishment’, ‘overcoming’ or ‘transcending’ the organic limits of our physical bodies. According to the <italic>Grand Larousse</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1357034X13477161">Guilbert et al., 1977</xref>) the word <italic>élever</italic> can be used to describe the process by which one attains a higher degree of moral and intellectual development. This accords with the derivation of the word <italic>élève</italic>, which translates as ‘student’ or ‘pupil’. But there is a more physical sense of the word that is used when we ‘raise our arms’ (<italic>élever les bras</italic>) or when we ‘raise something from the ground up’ (<italic>faire monter verticalement à partir du sol</italic>). In the English translations of Durkheim’s work, and here I am thinking of <italic>The Elementary Forms of Religious Life</italic>(1995 [1912]) in particular, the word <italic>élever</italic>is translated into English as ‘lifting’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1357034X13477161">4</xref>
</sup> And if we consult the <italic>Oxford English Dictionary</italic>, the English verb ‘to lift’ imparts the two senses implied by the French term: a sense of physical exertion or effort <italic>and</italic>the sense of moral improvement.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1357034X13477161">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Let us consider two quotations from <italic>The Elementary Forms</italic>:
<disp-quote>
<p>Precisely because society <italic>lifts us above ourselves</italic>[<italic>élève au-dessus de nous-mêmes</italic>], it does constant violence to our natural appetites. So that we can fulfill our duties toward it, our conditioning [<italic>dressés</italic>] must ready us to overcome our instincts at times – when necessary, to go up the down staircase of nature [<italic>à remonter, quand il le faut, la pente de la nature</italic>]. (1995 [1912]/1960: e321, f452)</p>
<p>However complex the outward manifestations of religious [i.e. social] life may be, its inner essence is simple, and one and the same. Everywhere it fulfills the same need and derives from the same state of mind. In all its forms its object is to<italic> lift man above himself</italic>[<italic>d’élever l’homme au-dessus de lui-même</italic>] and to make him live a higher life than he would if he obeyed only his individual impulses. (1995 [1912]/1960: e417, f592)</p>
</disp-quote> In the first quotation, <italic>élever</italic> is used to describe how society overcomes our embodied, biological rootedness, for it is this rootedness that persistently checks any individual attempts to transcend the organism. The French conveys something of the requirement to ‘elevate’ <italic>above</italic> ourselves insofar as ‘we draw ourselves upwards’ or ‘build upwards in height’; this is the sense of the term adequately, if not precisely, conveyed by the more physical sense of ‘lifting’. The second quotation evokes the sense of spiritual fulfilment and emotional satisfaction found in the impulse to correct and improve oneself. Again, Durkheim uses the verb <italic>élever</italic>, but this time he uses it to express the sense of intellectual or moral growth that stems from society’s capacity to lift us above ourselves to a higher form of life. Both quotations give us a first impression of the hierarchical and oppositional relationship Durkheim establishes between society and the individual, a relationship that illuminates the link I’d like to draw between lifting and habit.</p>
<p>Let us deepen these reflections by turning to consider Durkheim’s argument in the essay titled ‘The dualism of human nature and its social conditions’ (2005 [1914]). This essay develops his observations about the dualistic nature of man scattered throughout <italic>Elementary Forms</italic>(1995 [1912]: 14, 267, 297, 370). Essentially, he claims that man comprises two competing and irreducible tendencies that express different ‘states of consciousness’:
<disp-quote>
<p>There really are in [man] two groups of states of consciousness that contrast with one another in their origins, their nature, and the ends toward which they tend. One expresses only our organism and the objects with which it is most directly in relationship. Strictly individual, these states of consciousness <italic>attach</italic> us only to ourselves, and we can no more detach them from us than we can detach ourselves from our body. The others, on the contrary, come from society; they translate it in us and <italic>attach</italic> us to something that goes beyond us. Being collective, they are impersonal; they <italic>turn us</italic> toward ends [<italic>ils nous tournent vers des fins</italic>] that we share in common with other men; it is through them and through them alone that we can commune. (Durkheim, 2005 [1914]: 43; emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote> Granted, Durkheim does not use the language of <italic>élever</italic>here to depict the process of elevating or lifting one to a higher moral life as he does in the two passages I noted from <italic>Elementary Forms</italic>. But there is nonetheless a sense of transformation at work, one that depends upon the strength of the collective forces to ‘turn us’ (<italic>ils nous tournent</italic>) toward a qualitatively different form of being, a being that ‘we share in common’ with others. The capacity for transformation is premised on a difference in kind between innate tendencies governed by instinct and those socially conditioned forms of conduct found in collective habits. Put somewhat differently, human beings are capable of forming cohesive and durable relations with one another that are not based on hereditary ties or biological instinct, but on habits that develop and change over time. Where instincts <italic>attach</italic> us to our innermost selves, habits – at least those that are collective and shared – <italic>attach ourselves to others.</italic>Even if both provide a degree of regularity and stability to the way we experience the world, the important point is that instincts are individual and immutable while the latter are collective and, consequently, open to change.</p>
<p>How do habits simultaneously ‘lift us up out of ourselves’ and ‘turn us away from ourselves’? From where do they derive the strength to shift our primary attachment from the self to others? It is helpful to consider habits in relation to the notion of <italic>collective representations</italic>. Durkheim argues that human beings are unique because we share representations of the world around us. He calls these ideas values and beliefs, ‘collective’ representations. They are the ‘concepts with which we routinely think’ (1995 [1912]: 436). He argues that it is impossible for us to ‘<italic>live without representing to ourselves the world around us and the objects of every sort that fill it.</italic> But by this alone, that we represent them to ourselves, they enter into us and thus become part of ourselves’ (2005 [1914]: 37–8; emphasis in original). What is significant for me is the sense in which these representations ‘enter into us’ and ‘become part of ourselves’. To the extent that collective representations constitute a ‘we’, they ‘<italic>become something else</italic>’ by means of the ‘<italic>sui generis</italic>forces developed in association’ with other human beings (1974 [1898]: 26; emphasis in original). The process by which they ‘enter’ us and ‘become’ part of us, I’d like to suggest, is a process of <italic>conversion</italic>insofar as they ‘become something else’. Durkheim remarks in <italic>Rules of Sociological Method</italic>that society facilitates this process of conversion by virtue of the fact that it calls forth conduct automatically. In short, habits ‘crystallize’ social practices, habits and actions, and as such transform the nature of one’s attachment to self and to others (1982 [1895]: 82). Society is a source of the range of ‘habitual’ representations and actions that ‘enter us’ and ‘transform us’ <italic>by lifting</italic>us out of ourselves (1995 [1912]: 209).</p>
<p>The metaphor of lifting brings into relief the difference in kind that Durkheim seeks to draw between <italic>human</italic> collective habits and <italic>animal</italic>biological instincts. Two points are important to note here. First, these oppositions (e.g. human–animal, collective–biological and habit–instinct) are not natural. The distinction between human and animal is based on the capacity to <italic>lift</italic> us out of our biological, instinctive nature. This process establishes a hierarchy, and the very capacity to form hierarchies is a ‘social thing’, for, as Durkheim remarks in <italic>Elementary Forms</italic>, ‘only in society do superiors, subordinates and equals exist’ (1995 [1912]: 149). Second, the ability to lift us away from our biological tendencies toward even more robust social attachments requires persistent, sustained <italic>effort</italic>. The power of the social is continually checked by the force of our biological instincts. To overcome the exigencies of our so-called ‘animal nature’, we must do them a <italic>constant</italic> violence. It is society that provides sufficient strength to resist the force of nature. This social conditioning is expressed by the two senses of the word <italic>élever.</italic>It is society that <italic>lifts</italic> us out of, and away from, the persistent pull of biological instinct by means of collective habits; in so doing, it elevates us in relation to other living beings – i.e. animals – whose solidarity and cohesion with one another is based on instinct. Our collective habits ground the moral life of society and give shape to our goals, aspirations and ideals. Society <italic>lifts</italic> us to a moral way of life, and in the process, we are reborn: we are no longer ruled by our physiology as we once were, but we are transformed into the human beings that our habitual relations and practices enable us to become. Our habits create new potentialities for transformation. For Durkheim, in short, they make us human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1357034X13477161">Jones, 1999</xref>: 47, 83, 108).</p>

<sec id="section2-1357034X13477161">
<title>Bergson’s Leap</title>
<p>Now let us consider the way Bergson uses metaphors such as ‘leap’ [<italic>bond</italic>] and ‘jump’ [<italic>saut</italic>] to explain the relationship between habits, society and life as he presents it his last book <italic>The Two Sources of Morality and Religion</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1357034X13477161">6</xref>
</sup> Before doing so, it is helpful to articulate the aims of this book and the nature of its critical dispensation at some length for two reasons: first, to make sense of the way that Bergson uses embodied metaphors on his own terms; and, second, to contrast Bergson’s use of the metaphor ‘leaping’ with Durkheim’s penchant for ‘lifting’. The argument in <italic>Two Sources</italic> is especially significant for our purposes because it gives a critique of Durkheim’s theory of society.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1357034X13477161">7</xref>
</sup> This critique is implicit because the book rarely mentions Durkheim by name, and yet the emphasis on concepts such as ‘pressure’, ‘moral obligation’, ‘discipline’ and ‘habit’ in the first part of the book is so extensive and deliberate that it unmistakably bears Durkheim’s signature.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1357034X13477161">8</xref>
</sup> Bergson gives a critique of the science of ‘society’ – represented in the book by the disciplines of ‘sociology’ and ‘ethnography’ – by means of extending the argument he lays out in <italic>Creative Evolution</italic> (1998 [1907]).</p>
<p>It is worthwhile to give an overview of the argument Bergson advances in <italic>Creative Evolution</italic>before proceeding to <italic>Two Sources</italic>, since the former establishes the philosophical ground for the latter. Bergson’s overarching aim in <italic>Creative Evolution</italic> – as with all of his work – is to establish ‘precision’ in philosophical concepts. The difficulty is that human understanding is limited by an intelligence that cannot think the <italic>reality</italic> of time. We cleave to measuring time as a sequence of intervals or moments that eludes the irreducible flow of real time. The knowledge that we produce, grounded as it is in this limited, but necessary intelligence, is always already inadequate to the reality it seeks to represent. Bergson argues that this ‘reality’ is a composite of that which our intelligence can grasp (the manifestation of an object) and that which eludes it (the object as it is in time). Thus, in the search for knowledge:
<disp-quote>
<p>[t]he only explanation we should accept as satisfactory is one which fits tightly to its object, with no space between them, no crevice in which any other explanation might equally well be lodged; one which fits the object only and to which alone the object lends itself. (1974: 1)</p>
</disp-quote> An adequate explanation must combine an interrogation of the object under investigation with an appreciation of the reality of time as an active, transformative force.</p>
<p>This observation allows us to appreciate <italic>Creative Evolution</italic> as a critique of an evolutionary biology that treats species variation as either accidental (rather than constitutive of life) or indicative of individual efforts (rather than the whole of life). Such accounts lack precision for Bergson because, as above, they exhibit an inadequate grasp of the reality of time. The corrective offered by <italic>Creative Evolution</italic> is to develop a <italic>theory of knowledge</italic> in relation to a <italic>theory of life</italic>. Bergson makes the simple, but provocative point that life <italic>is</italic> in time, it <italic>exists</italic> in time:
<disp-quote>
<p>The<italic> theory of knowledge</italic> and the <italic>theory of life</italic> seem to us inseparable from one another. A theory of life that is not accompanied by a critique of knowledge is obliged to accept as they stand, the concepts that the understanding [<italic>l’entendement</italic>] puts at its disposal: it can but enclose the facts, willing or not, in pre-existing frames which it regards as definitive. It thus obtains a symbolism which is convenient, perhaps even necessary to positive science, but not a direct vision of its object. On the other hand, a theory of knowledge which does not replace the intellect in the general evolution of life will teach us neither how the frames of knowledge have been constituted nor how we can enlarge or go beyond them. It is necessary that these two inquiries, theory of knowledge and theory of life, should join each other, and, by a circular process, push each other unceasingly. (1998 [1907]: xii/492–3; translation modified)</p>
</disp-quote> Put simply, if the faculty of intelligence is a product of evolution then it cannot be studied independent of its evolutionary context in order to produce an accurate, or rather, ‘precise’, explanation of the nature of life. Any theory of life must be accompanied by a theory of knowledge that interrogates the conceptual terms of the explanations it advances (e.g. mechanism and finalism).</p>
<p>Thus, <italic>Creative Evolution</italic>presents an understanding of evolution that accounts for the tendency of life to create new forms that are simultaneously continuous and discontinuous. Bergson seeks to establish a <italic>continuity</italic>between different forms of life (insofar as they are all <italic>living</italic> beings) and a <italic>discontinuity</italic> between them (insofar as one must be able to account for variation and change between species). Life, defined more precisely, is thus characterized by an unstable balance between two opposing, yet complementary tendencies. In a living being, they take the form of tendencies toward ‘reproduction’ on the one hand, and ‘individuation’ on the other (1998 [1907]: 13). To survive, living beings must <italic>endure.</italic> It is this capacity for <italic>endurance</italic> that becomes a singular characteristic of life. This forms the basis for his claim that the tendencies contained in a living organism can be compared to the evolution of life as a whole: ‘Like the universe as a whole, like each conscious being taken separately, the organism which lives is a thing that <italic>endures.</italic> Its past, in its entirety, is prolonged into its present, and abides there, actual and acting’ (1998 [1907]: 15).</p>
<p>Bergson builds on these founding premises in <italic>Two Sources</italic>when he claims that attempts to explain morality independent of evolutionary accounts are error-ridden. In the same way that evolutionary biologists tend to use intelligence – itself a product of evolution – to explain evolution, so too do sociologists tend to use society – also an evolutionary outcome – to explain morality. Sociologists follow a tradition of thinkers who rarefy intelligence and sociability in their efforts to explain social and moral life. Bergson’s remedy is to call ‘for a biological interpretation’ in order to return ‘intelligence and sociability’ to ‘their proper place back in the general evolution of life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 116). Thus, one of the aims of <italic>Two Sources</italic> is to claim that the <italic>theory of morality</italic> and the <italic>theory of life</italic> must not be separated if we are to achieve precision in our explanation of moral life. If we extend the logic of <italic>Creative Evolution</italic>, it is possible to see that Bergson argues for an evolutionary theory of society and, by extension, an evolutionary theory of morality. Indeed, a theory of morality that is not accompanied by a theory of life is unable to explain its generative principle, and, further, how it might be developed or enhanced. Similarly, a theory of life that is obliged to accept an understanding of morality that is restricted to moral obligation without a theory of morality will be limited. In short, as with <italic>Creative Evolution</italic>, the goal of the <italic>Two Sources</italic> is precision. It is to present us with an evolutionary account of morality, one that does not dispense with moral obligation, but situates it within a theory of life, so as to explicate what Bergson terms a ‘complete morality’.</p>
<p>We are now in a better position to consider Bergson’s use of the metaphor of ‘leaping’. Both <italic>Creative Evolution</italic>and <italic>Two Sources</italic>use the English word ‘leap’ to translate the French <italic>sauter</italic> ‘to jump’ and <italic>bond en avant</italic>‘leap forward’.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1357034X13477161">9</xref>
</sup> Both texts rely on this metaphor to connect the two opposing, yet fundamental tendencies of life – expressed as ‘continuity’ and ‘discontinuity’ in <italic>Creative Evolution</italic>, and now as ‘pressure’ and ‘aspiration’ in <italic>Two Sources.</italic> Let’s examine how Bergson uses the metaphor of ‘leaping’ in each of these texts in more detail.</p>
<p>Bergson uses the language of <italic>leaping</italic> in <italic>Creative Evolution</italic> to express the quality of the effort required to grasp both tendencies of life. Our ordinary intelligence allows us to see the products of evolution in the diversity of species that surrounds us, but it cannot capture the reality of life. Bergson forces us to appreciate that each species is a composite of continuous and discontinuous tendencies, and to grasp this requires us to think intuitively, to think beyond the constraints of the intellect:
<disp-quote>
<p>The act by which life goes forward to the creation of a new form, and the act by which this form is shaped, are two different and often antagonistic movements. The first is continuous with the second, but cannot continue in it without being drawn aside from its direction, as would happen to a man leaping [<italic>un sauteur</italic>], if, in order to clear the obstacle, he had to turn his eyes from it and look at himself all the while. (1998 [1907]: 129)</p>
</disp-quote> If life comprises two ‘different and often antagonistic’ movements, it is instructive that Bergson uses the metaphor of ‘leaping’ here rather than, say, ‘extending’ or ‘reaching’ to move from one to the other. What the metaphor of leaping accomplishes that the language of extending does not, is to draw attention to the fact that these two movements, these two acts of life, are <italic>fundamentally different in kind.</italic> One cannot move from one to the other by a simple means of ‘extending’, ‘reaching’ or even ‘lifting’. These latter metaphors are suggestive of movement by degree, of a general incremental movement from one to another. They are useful as means of describing the composite reality of life but they fail to reflect the qualitative change required to move from one tendency to the other. In other words, metaphors of ‘extension’ tend to describe objects at rest rather than in motion; they present objects as clearly defined rather than in flux.</p>
<p>Let us consider these points in relation to another passage from <italic>Creative Evolution</italic>:
<disp-quote>
<p>He who throws himself into the water having known only the resistance of the solid earth, will immediately be drowned if he does not struggle against the fluidity of the new environment: he must perforce still cling to that solidity, so to speak, which even water presents. Only on this condition can he get used to the fluid’s fluidity. So of our thought when it has decided to make the leap [<italic>le saut</italic>]. <italic>But leap it must</italic>[<italic>il faut quelle sauté</italic>]<italic>, that is leave its own environment.</italic> Reason, reasoning on its powers, will never succeed in extending them, though the extension would not appear at all unreasonable once it were accomplished. (1998 [1907]: 193; emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote> This passage is instructive because it describes the instinctive tendency to struggle against a new environment, to ‘cling to solidity’ even when presented with ‘fluidity’. We cannot appreciate the <italic>experience</italic> of the <italic>simultaneity</italic>of ‘solidity’ and ‘fluidity’, even though we <italic>think</italic> we can. Accordingly, we resist fluidity as a matter of instinct. In short, the intellect is capable of apprehending ‘solidity’, but it cannot appreciate ‘fluidity’.</p>
<p>To demonstrate that both tendencies are not mere extensions of the other, Bergson must adopt a metaphor that underscores the difference in kind between them. We ‘jump’ from <italic>discontinuity</italic>to <italic>continuity</italic>, and so we must ‘leap’ from what the intellect ‘knows’ to what is ‘unknown’. The metaphor of leaping illustrates the means by which we must leave the comfort and security of that which is ‘already made’ in order to attach ourselves to something that is in the process of ‘being made’. Such a leap is not easy; it is a painful <italic>effort</italic> that does a violence to our nature. It is not a permanent violence, but sudden and spontaneous. It involves a ‘turning back on itself’, a sudden ‘twisting’ that is infrequent, and can only be sustained for moments at a time given the strength and force of the instinctive tendency to struggle against the new (1998 [1907]: 237). Thus, for Bergson, leaping is a metaphor for conversion – it represents a <italic>turning away</italic> from one tendency of life at the same time that it <italic>turns towards</italic>the other.</p>
<p>Bergson also uses the metaphor of leaping to signal a process of conversion in the <italic>Two Sources.</italic>But a conversion from what, to what? <italic>Two Sources</italic>develops the central argument of <italic>Creative Evolution</italic>that life has two different and opposing tendencies. In <italic>Two Sources</italic>, they take the form of ‘closed’ and ‘open’ tendencies of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">Bergson, 1977 [1932]</xref>: 51; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1357034X13477161">Worms, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1357034X13477161">2004b</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1357034X13477161">10</xref>
</sup> The closed tendency exhibits a <italic>pressure</italic>that is associated with habitual obligation: it is ‘the more perfect as it becomes more impersonal, closer to those natural forces which we call habit or even instinct’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 50). The open tendency expresses the <italic>aspiration</italic> of a love that is independent of any object: it is more powerful insofar as ‘it apparently triumphs over nature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 50). These tendencies are rarely, if ever, experienced ‘purely’. Typically, we experience them as a composite of the full spectrum of ‘social life’, and so, consequently, we would be mistaken to think that there are actually existing societies that we could call ‘closed’ or ‘open’.</p>
<p>Let us examine each of these tendencies in order to understand the conversion that the ‘leap’ seeks to effect in <italic>Two Sources.</italic>The closed tendency is organized by a natural pressure that culminates in a web of obligations that assumes the form of ‘habits’ in humans and ‘instinct’ in non-human animals. A habit may start as an intelligent activity, but insofar as it is automatic and unthought, it assumes the form that necessity demands by nature:
<disp-quote>
<p>an activity which, starting as intelligent, progresses toward an imitation of instinct is exactly what we call, in man, a habit. And the most powerful habit, the habit whose strength is made up of the accumulated force of all the elementary social habits is necessarily the one which best imitates instinct. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 26)</p>
</disp-quote> Although Bergson seeks to establish a continuity between habit and instinct, he does not collapse one into the other. He repeatedly insists that although the <italic>content</italic>of human habits is always contingent, in aggregate, the <italic>habit of contracting habits</italic> bears a profound resemblance to instinct. As such, habits ‘have a force comparable to that of instinct in respect of both intensity and regularity’, and it is this force that Bergson calls the ‘totality of obligation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 27). Like instincts, habits exert a ‘pressure on our will’, and each individual habit corresponds to some kind of social necessity. They are together entwined to form obligations that ‘at once actualize social pressure into a diffuse network of everyday practices, and at the same time, draw strength from the whole, such that the whole of obligation is immanent to each habit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1357034X13477161">Lefebvre and White, 2010</xref>: 467).</p>
<p>Here we can establish a first point of contrast with Durkheim. For Durkheim, what distinguishes habits from instincts is their inherent malleability and flexibility; Bergson also acknowledges the contingency of habit. But Bergson begins from the perspective of the whole of life. Thus, he is able to claim that instinct and habit are similar in the <italic>effect</italic>of their power to constrain. It is from the perspective of the totality of obligation that he can claim that habits differ from instinct by degree and not in kind. We must insist on their difference – in the case of instinct, ‘each rule is laid down by nature, and is necessary’, whereas with habit the only necessity is having a rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 28). But again, from the perspective of obligation <italic>in general</italic> we can see that habit is nothing other than a ‘virtual instinct’ akin to ‘that which lies behind the habit of speech’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 28). Habit renders obligation as natural and unthinking as instinct, and it is through habit that human societies achieve their necessary stability and durability.</p>
<p>A second point of contrast between Durkheim and Bergson follows from the first, and has to do with the role of collective representations in forming habits. As we saw for Durkheim, the ability of the intelligence to create collective representations is a resolutely human capacity. Yet from the perspective of the totality of obligation, Bergson argues that social life is immanent to both instinct and intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 27). This is because instinct and intelligence are tools or implements that organize a living being’s orientation to life:
<disp-quote>
<p>[l]et us merely recall the fact that life is a certain effort to obtain certain things from raw matter, and that instinct and intelligence, taken in their finished state, are two distinct means of utilizing a tool for this object; in the first case, the tool is part of the living creature; in the other, it is an inorganic instrument which man has had to invent, make and learn to handle. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 118)</p>
</disp-quote> Even though instinct is organized by necessity and habit by the necessity of contracting habits, at root they both share a fundamental orientation to life. This orientation is actualized according to the basic needs of life – cohesion, preservation, and obligation – regardless of whether the life in question is animal or human. Thus, for Bergson, it is impossible to <italic>lift</italic> the individual up and away from their root biological tendencies and into society because the basic tendency toward pressure is found in both animals and humans from the perspective of obligation in general.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1357034X13477161">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Bergson argues that where habit and instinct affirm an attachment to life, the intellect inadvertently weakens it. Intelligence encourages reflection and egoism. In the first instance, reflection engenders an awareness of the inevitability of death. And, second, this same reflection counsels egoism and self-preservation above all else. The consequence is that we feel insecure and anxious:
<disp-quote>
<p>For the intelligent being was not living in the present alone; there can be no reflexion without foreknowledge, no foreknowledge without inquietude no inquietude without a momentary slackening of the attachment to life. Above all, there is no humanity without society, and society demands of the individual an abnegation which the insect, in its automatism, carries to the point of an utter obliviousness of self. Reflexion cannot be relied upon to keep up this selflessness. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 210)</p>
</disp-quote> What restores the deficiency of attachment to life is the capacity of the intelligence to create myths and stories of reassurance about an ‘afterlife’ or ‘reincarnation’. The fabulation function is found in static religion: it is ‘that element which, in beings endowed with reason, is called upon to make good any deficiency of attachment to life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 210).</p>
<p>We can now begin to appreciate what Bergson means by the open tendency of life. It takes the form of an appeal or aspiration that coincides with the generative principle of life itself. It is an emotional spark, a ‘leap’ of faith, a trust or belief. It galvanizes our attachment to life. This spark is <italic>love.</italic>For Bergson, it is inseparable from joy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 212). The open tendency is an aspiration to love without object, to love beyond family and nation; it is an appeal to love beyond definite, particular objects of affection. The love of family and nation expressed by the closed tendency is one way of preserving our attachment to life in the face of threat. It defends against hostilities, betrayal, hurt. And in so doing, it assumes a ‘progressive expansion of feeling [that] keeps pace with the increasing size of the object we love’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 31). But this extensive logic to love <italic>all of humanity</italic>is incompatible with the natural instinct to defend one’s family and nation against enemy threat.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1357034X13477161">12</xref>
</sup> Bergson observes – somewhat snidely – that nothing makes this clearer than times of war. We might assume that our social obligations are obligations to humanity writ large, but ‘under exceptional circumstances, regrettably unavoidable, they are for the time being inapplicable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 31).</p>
<p>Not everyone can experience open love in its pure, unmediated form. Only one who is capable of moving beyond the natural imperative to love one’s brother, mother, neighbour and citizen can do so. Only one who has the strength to <italic>resist</italic> the pull of habit can do so. Only ‘a soul strong enough, noble enough to make this <italic>effort</italic>’ can do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 212; emphasis added). Throughout history, Bergson notes that there have been instances of individuals – mystics and other great souls – who have been able to <italic>activate</italic> this creative impulse. They impart an unmediated, objectless love in contrast to those who might simply <italic>receive</italic>it:
<disp-quote>
<p>But whichever way we look at it, life is a thing at least as desirable, even more desirable, to man than to the other species, since the latter receive it as the effect, produced in passing, by the creative energy, whereas in man life is that successful effort itself, however precarious and incomplete this success may be. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 211)</p>
</disp-quote> Non-mystics may feel the ‘whisper’ of open love when our spirits are touched, and in such moments <italic>feel</italic> an attachment to life increasing in strength, resilience and fortitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 212).</p>
<p>For Bergson, then, the leap is a metaphor for moving beyond that which is most natural to us – our habits, our instincts, our self-preservation. In passing, Bergson uses the Latin <italic>saltus</italic>, which finds frequent expression in the scientific maxim <italic>natura non facit saltus</italic> and translates roughly as ‘nature does not make leaps’. I take it that Bergson is saying that if man is capable of leaping, then he can only leap insofar as he transcends his nature. If this ‘nature’ is expressed by the closed tendency and if there is evidence, however infrequent, of extraordinary souls who are capable of transcending their ‘nature’ to love openly, then we might modify the maxim above along the following lines: ‘nature leaps, but only in man’ (<italic>natura facit saltus, autem in homo</italic>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, I have argued that Durkheim and Bergson use embodied metaphors of conversion to show how habits attach us to life. My focus on ‘lifting’ and ‘leaping’ has allowed us to see how each thinker addresses the opposition between the social and the natural world. These metaphors of embodiment illustrate the way that Durkheim and Bergson each understand the complex relationship between habit, life and society. They enable us to see that habits have an affective quality that attaches us to vital life forces.</p>
<p>Let us briefly revisit the discussion. For Durkheim, human nature is characterized by two opposed and antagonistic elements, presented as a contrast between individual/social, animal/human and instinct/habit. The only force able to exceed the individual–animal–instinct is the combined <italic>effort</italic>of the collective group. As we have seen, Durkheim uses the metaphor of ‘lifting’ (<italic>élever</italic>) to describe how we must each abnegate our personal desires in order to lead a moral life. As Durkheim remarks in <italic>Elementary Forms</italic>, it is only ‘[a]s part of society [that] the individual naturally transcends himself both when he thinks and when he acts’ (1995 [1912]: 16). For Durkheim then, <italic>lifting is a metaphor of conversion that turns us toward habits.</italic> <italic>We must lift ourselves to become human.</italic>Bergson argues, in contrast, that the difference in kind that Durkheim seeks to establish between animal and human is a false opposition. One must remember that ‘humanity is an animal species’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 235). Our dependence on habits for survival, that is on the ‘habit of habits’, conditions a totality of obligation that differs from instinct merely by degree. For Bergson then, <italic>leaping is a metaphor of conversion that turns us away from habits. Leaping demands an effort that moves us beyond the human.</italic>
</p>
<p>But why must we engage in these efforts, different as they are? Interestingly, both Durkheim and Bergson offer their metaphors of lifting and leaping as responses to crisis. In Durkheim’s case, the metaphor of lifting appears as a response to a crisis of morality. He presents the terms of the crisis in <italic>The Division of Labour</italic>, where the morality of traditional societies (i.e. mechanical solidarity) has lost its influence, and its successor (i.e. organic solidarity) has not developed quickly enough to fill the void (1984: 339). Durkheim worries that our attachment to morality, that is to social life, has consequently weakened. Accordingly, to respond to this deficit of attachment, we must make the necessary <italic>effort</italic> to affirm and develop our moral dispositions. To this end, he argues in <italic>Moral Education</italic>: ‘[W]e are living precisely in one of those critical, revolutionary periods when authority is usually weakened through the loss of traditional discipline’ (1961: 54). Our task, put simply, is to salvage our ‘moral patrimony’ – something that is only possible by means of <italic>lifting</italic> ourselves toward habits that subvert our natural tendencies. For Bergson, however, the imperative to leap is episodic, it is now urgent in its demand. He too, although, is responding to a moral crisis, if not a crisis in morality. Our intelligence exhibits a tendency toward closure. It has outstripped the bounds of nature, now we have learned how to annihilate ourselves as a species.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1357034X13477161">13</xref>
</sup> In other words, our intelligence has found yet another way to weaken our attachment to life. We must then find a way to strengthen this attachment, but to do so, we must <italic>leap</italic> from the habits that will lead to annihilation, and rekindle the roots of a morality that can inhibit it. Bergson reminds us that ‘[t]he very root of morality is the creation of life in general’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 270). This root is synonymous with the open tendency of love. And so we must leap <italic>from</italic> the defensive attitude associated with closed ‘society’ and adopt the attitude of the open (<italic>l’âme ouverte</italic>). Such ‘a leap forward [<italic>bond en avant</italic>] … can take place only if society has decided to try the experiment; and the experiment will not be tried unless society has allowed itself to be won over, or at least stirred’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 74). Odd as it may seem, the crises to which Durkheim and Bergson each respond are similar, as are the remedies which they recommend. Both require an effort – it is simply that we must decide whether we are to lift or to leap.</p>

<p>Although several authors have observed that Bergson’s <italic>Two Sources</italic> offers critical commentary on Durkheim’s conception of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1357034X13477161">Guerlac, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1357034X13477161">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1357034X13477161">Kolakowski, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1357034X13477161">Riley, 2002</xref>), there is still remarkably little work in French or English that traces their engagement (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1357034X13477161">Keck, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1357034X13477161">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1357034X13477161">Lefebvre and White, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1357034X13477161">Worms, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1357034X13477161">2004b</xref>, for exceptions).

<p>It might be interesting to pursue a genealogy of the uses of ‘lifting’ in social and political thinking. Such a project might begin with an examination of J.-J. Rousseau’s <italic>Discourse on the Origin of Inequality</italic> (1992 [1755]) in order to explore the transformation of the human animal by society. It could also consider lifting in the Freudian sense of how, in ‘Creative writers and daydreaming’ (1959 [1908]) art offers a relief in the form of a pressure being lifted (<italic>aufgehoben</italic>) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1357034X13477161">Chamberlain, 2000</xref>: 33). It might also take up the sense of ‘lifting’ in the way that laughter may ‘lift’ cathexis in <italic>Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious</italic>(1960 [1905]).</p>

<p>The <italic>Oxford English Dictionary</italic> defines the word ‘lift’ variously<italic>:</italic> Consider its meaning as a verb: ‘To raise into the air from the ground, or to a higher position; to elevate, heave, hoist. Also, to erect, rear on high (a building)’. Compare this to its meaning as a noun: ‘An elevating influence or effect; Also a cheering or encouraging influence or effect, a sense of elation’ (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.OED.com">www.OED.com</ext-link>).</p>

<p>It is important to note that Bergson’s interest in habits is sustained throughout his career. In <italic>Time and Free Will</italic> (2001 [1889]), for example, Bergson argues that habits are sustained, regular ways of thinking, acting and feeling that – although important for social life – are nonetheless limited because they restrict, rather than encourage freedom. They express the automatic, non-reflective dimension of lived, bodily experience on a par with animal instinct. Later, in <italic>Matter and Memory</italic> (1991 [1896]), his observations on habit are developed in conjunction with a new concept of memory that seeks to resolve long-standing debates over the relation of consciousness to matter. It is with his final book,<italic> The Two Sources of Morality and Religion</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>), that his observations on habit are fleshed out in relation to a theory of society that takes its inspiration from <italic>Creative Evolution</italic> (1998 [1907]). In <italic>Two Sources,</italic>habits are the embodiment of an interconnected web of obligations that tie us at once to ourselves and to others.</p>

<p>The publication of this book in 1932 came as a surprise even to Bergson’s closest friends. Bergson had largely retired from academic and public life due to debilitating arthritis. Bergson was appointed to the Collège de France in 1896 where he taught until 1919. In 1916, the French government entrusted him with a diplomatic mission to Spain, and a year later, with another to the United States. He went on to become president of the League of Nations’ International Commission for Intellectual Cooperation, which was precursor to UNESCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40a-1357034X13477161">Lefebvre and White, 2012</xref>). Because so many years had passed since the publication of his last major work, commentators often remark on the difficulty of reconciling his earlier ideas with those in the <italic>Two Sources</italic> (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1357034X13477161">Scharfstein, 1942</xref>).</p>

<p>See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1357034X13477161">Lefebvre and White (2010</xref>) for a reconstruction of Bergson’s critique of Durkheim in <italic>Two Sources.</italic> The argument in <italic>Two Sources</italic> was developed over 25 years following the publication of <italic>Creative Evolution</italic> in 1907. Its roots include a long and tense institutional as well as intellectual relationship with Durkheim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1357034X13477161">Fournier, 2008</xref>: 652–3, 821–5, 829–31, 865–6).</p>

<p>If one were to pursue a broader genealogy of the ‘leap’ in philosophy, one would likely begin with an examination of Kierkegaard, to whom the phrase ‘a leap of faith’ is commonly attributed. Yet, as several commentators have remarked, Kierkegaard himself does not use the phrase in these specific terms. In <italic>The Concept of Anxiety</italic> (1981 [1844]), for example, the leap is used to describe sin which can have no moral justification of explanation. Nietzsche also famously uses the language of ‘leaping’ in conjunction with ‘dancing’ to describe the process of overcoming in <italic>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</italic>(2006 [1883–5]). See Gilles Deleuze’s discussion of the contrast between Kierkegaard and Nietzsche in <italic>Difference and Repetition</italic> (1994 [1968]).</p>

<p>In <italic>Two Sources</italic>Bergson specifically uses the term ‘uplift’ to describe Durkheim’s dualistic conception of human nature, albeit in an oblique fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1357034X13477161">1977 [1932]</xref>: 66–8).</p>

<p>With prescience Bergson anticipates the atomic bomb in <italic>Two Sources</italic>: <disp-quote>
<p>But now intelligence, raising the construction of instruments to a degree of complexity and perfection which nature … had not even foreseen, pouring into these machines reserves of energy which nature … had never even thought of, has endowed us with powers beside which those of our body barely count: they will be altogether limitless when science is able to liberate the force which is enclosed, or rather condensed, in the slightest particle of ponderable matter.
