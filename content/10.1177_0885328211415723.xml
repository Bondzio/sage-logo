<p>Dense and well-adherent fluoridated hydroxyapatite [Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2−<italic>x</italic></sub>F<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, FHA] coatings with various amounts of fluorine contents (<italic>x</italic> = 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0) were deposited on commercially available pure titanium by aerosol deposition using FHA powders in order to investigate the effect of fluorine content on the properties of the coatings. FHA powders with different compositions were synthesized by solid-state reactions of hydroxyapatite (HA) and fluorapatite (FA) powders at various ratios. X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results showed that fluoride ions were successfully incorporated into the HA lattice for both the FHA powders and the FHA coatings. Scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed dense microstructures and good substrate adhesion of the coatings with high adhesion strengths of more than 33.1 MPa.

In addition, <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular tests, including cell attachment, proliferation, and alkaline phosphatase activity of MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells grown on the coatings, demonstrated that an FHA coating with a moderate degree of F<sup>−</sup> substitution, <italic>x</italic> = 1.0, had a stronger stimulating effect on cell proliferation and differentiation. These results suggested that there exists an optimum fluorine content level in the FHA coatings for the best long-term stability and cellular responses.</p>

<p>Synthetic hydroxyapatite [Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>, HA] has been extensively investigated as a popular biomaterial with significant clinical potential due to its structural and chemical similarities with human bone mineral and its excellent biocompatibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211415723">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211415723">2</xref></sup> Fluorapatite [Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, FA], in which fluoride ions fully substitute for OH<sup>−</sup> ions in the HA lattice, is also an interesting biomedical material exhibiting a higher stability than HA and comparable biocompatibility to HA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211415723">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211415723">4</xref></sup> Pure FA is reported to be less soluble than pure HA, and hence, it can be properly used for applications requiring better long-term stability in a biological environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211415723">4</xref></sup> In addition, fluoride ions can reduce the formation of dental caries in bacterially contaminated environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211415723">5</xref></sup> and can enhance bone formation by stimulating osteoblast activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328211415723">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211415723">7</xref></sup> Most of all, the main merit of FA is its capability to form a fluoridated hydroxyapatite [Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2−<italic>x</italic></sub>F<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, FHA] solid solution with partial substitution of OH<sup>−</sup> by F<sup>−</sup>. The F<sup>−</sup> substitution brings about a reduction in the volume of the unit cell and the chemical stability of the apatite lattice is enhanced by the stronger electrostatic bond between fluoride and its adjacent ions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211415723">8</xref></sup> Therefore, the chemical and biological properties of the FHA can be easily tailored by manipulating the extent of F<sup>−</sup> substitution.</p>
<p>Calcium phosphate ceramic (CPC) coatings on metallic implants have recently attracted much attention in dental and orthopaedic fields because they can provide both the bioactive nature of CPCs and the load-bearing ability of metallic implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211415723">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211415723">10</xref></sup> Plasma spraying is the most common way to produce bioactive ceramic coatings, such as pure HA and FHA, on metallic implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211415723">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211415723">9</xref></sup> However, this method has several limitations, including poor mechanical properties of the resulting coating due to its low density and microcracking, microstructural non-uniformity, and poor adhesion between the coating and substrate, all resulting in the deterioration of the long-term stability of the implant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211415723">9</xref></sup> Furthermore, it is very difficult to precisely control the chemical composition of the coating due to the extremely high processing temperature. Therefore, in recent years, sol–gel coating and electrodeposition techniques have been frequently used as alternative methods to fabricate HA or FHA coatings because they can produce the coatings with homogeneous microstructure and stoichiometric composition through relatively low-cost equipment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211415723">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211415723">12</xref></sup> However, these techniques also suffer from the major drawback of poor adhesion between the coating and substrate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211415723">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Aerosol deposition (AD) is a newly developed coating technique based on powder spraying and has been used successfully to produce dense and well-adhered HA-based coatings on titanium (Ti) substrates at room temperature (RT).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211415723">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211415723"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211415723"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211415723"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211415723">18</xref></sup> AD uses solid powder particles as the starting materials and a dense coating layer is formed by the high kinetic energy impact of the particles onto a substrate, which enables the coating to exhibit a high adhesion strength. In addition, the starting powder and the resultant coating layer have the same chemical composition because AD is carried out at RT. Therefore, the coating composition can be precisely controlled by changing the powder composition, making it possible to obtain multi-component coatings.</p>
<p>The objective of this study was to develop dense and well-adhered FHA coatings on Ti substrates using AD and to investigate the effect of fluoride ion substitution on the phase development, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the FHA coatings. In addition, the <italic>in vitro</italic> biocompatibility performance of the FHA coatings with regard to their compositions was also evaluated through the cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation tests.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0885328211415723"><title>Powder procedure</title>
<p>A commercially available, nanocrystalline HA (Samjo Industrial Co., Ltd, Cheongwon, Korea) powder with an average diameter of about 15 nm was used as the starting powder for the HA coating. The control of the starting powder particle size is very critical for fabricating a dense coating layer using AD and there exists an optimum particle size range for coating formation, outside of which there is insufficient bonding or no coating deposition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211415723">19</xref></sup> Therefore, the as-received HA powder was heated at 1100°C for 2 h in air in order to obtain a powder with a particle size appropriate for coating. The resultant powder was then characterized using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer (HELOS/BF, Sympatec GmbH, Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany) and it showed a particle size distribution covering a range 0.4–10 µm with a mean particle size of 2.2 µm.</p>
<p>FA powder was prepared by a solid-state reaction method with β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) and calcium fluoride (CaF<sub>2</sub>); 3 mol of high-purity β-TCP (Merck Co., Darmstadt, Germany) and 1 mol of CaF<sub>2</sub> (Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI, USA) were mixed and milled using zirconia balls in a ball mill for 24 h with ethanol. The mixed chemicals were then dried and heated at 1000°C for 2 h in air to form FA.</p>
<p>FHA solid solution powders with different compositions of Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2 − <italic>x</italic></sub>F<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> (<italic>x</italic> = 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5) were designated as 0.5FHA, 1.0FHA, and 1.5FHA, respectively. The degree of F<sup>−</sup> substitution was indicated by the <italic>x</italic> value. The various compositions of the FHA powders were prepared by mixing the FA with HA powders according to the chemical formula, and then heated at 1050°C for 2 h. Finally, they were divided into five experimental groups (HA, 0.5FHA, 1.0FHA, 1.5FHA, and FA) to be used as coating and Ti as control group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0885328211415723"><title>AD method</title>
<p>The coatings were deposited on Ti substrates by AD. Before coating, a 0.5 mm thick sheet of commercially available pure Ti (CP-Ti, JIS Grade 2) was prepared through grinding with 2000 grit SiC paper and cleaned in distilled water and ethanol. Two kinds of Ti substrates were used for coating: 10 × 10 × 0.5 mm<sup>3</sup> plates and φ 25 × 0.5 mm<sup>2</sup> disks.</p>
<p>Full details of the apparatus utilized in the AD system have been described elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211415723">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211415723">15</xref></sup> The powder in aerosol chamber was mixed with a carrier gas and ejected onto the Ti substrate through a slit-type nozzle with a 10 × 0.5 mm<sup>2</sup> rectangular opening. The flow rate of air used as the carrier gas was 30 L min<sup>−1</sup>. Coatings with a thickness of 5 µm were deposited over the entire surface of the Ti substrates by scanning the Ti substrates on a motorized <italic>X</italic>–<italic>Y</italic> stage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0885328211415723"><title>Characterization of the biomaterials</title>
<p>Phase analysis of the powders and coatings were performed using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Xpert-Pro, Philips, Almelo, The Netherlands), with Cu-Kα radiation generated at 40 kV and 30 mA. The 2<italic>θ</italic> range was from 20° to 60° at a scanning speed of 1° per min with a step size of 0.02°. The coatings were further characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, IFS 66, Bruker Optics, Ettlingen, Germany). The FT-IR spectra were recorded in the 400–4000 cm<sup>−1</sup> wave number range. The microstructures of the coatings were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-5800, Jeol Co., Tokyo, Japan). The surface roughness of the coatings was measured using a laser surface profilometer (Perthometer PGK 120, Mahr GmbH, Göttingen, Germany). The surface parameter used for evaluation of the surface roughness was the arithmetic average roughness (<italic>R</italic><sub>a</sub>).</p>
<p>The tensile adhesion strength of the coating on the Ti substrate was measured using a universal mechanical testing system (Instron series IX automated materials testing system, Instron Corp., MA, USA) according to the standard adhesion test (ISO 13779-4). The coatings were deposited on Ti disks that were 25 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in thickness. Both top and bottom surfaces of the coated disks were glued to the fixture of the universal mechanical testing system using high-strength epoxy (3M Scotch-Weld Epoxy Adhesive 2214, 3M Corp., St Paul, MN, USA). Five adhesion strength measurements were performed for each of the coated samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0885328211415723"><title>Dissolution test</title>
<p>In order to investigate the dissolution behavior of the coatings, the coated samples were soaked in pH 7.4 tris-buffered saline (TBS, Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI, USA) solution at 37°C for up to 15 days. The calcium ion dissolved in the TBS solution was measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Optima-4300 DV, Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA, USA). Three samples of each group were examined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0885328211415723"><title>In vitro cell tests</title>
<p>To analyze the cell proliferation and differentiation behaviors on the coated samples, MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cells (CRL-2593, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were used. The cells were cultured in an α-minimum essential medium (Join Bio Innovation, Seoul, Korea) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, USA), 2mM of L-glutamine, 50 IU mL<sup>−1</sup> of penicillin, and 50 µg mL<sup>−1</sup> of streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% air; the medium was changed twice a week. The coated and uncoated Ti plate samples with dimensions of 10 × 10 ×0.5 mm<sup>3</sup> were used for the cell tests and they were sterilized under ultraviolet light for the experiments.</p>
<p>Three hours after cell seeding, cell attachment on the samples was observed with SEM at a 5 kV accelerating voltage after the cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, dehydrated gradually, and coated with gold.</p>
<p>For the cell proliferation tests, the cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells mL<sup>−1</sup> on a 24-well plate containing the samples and kept in an incubator at 37°C for 5 days. The cells were then washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution, placed in culture media containing MTS solution (3-(4,5-dimethlythiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, Cell Titer 96® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit, Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA), and returned to the incubator to be kept at 37°C for 3 h. Finally, the plate was read at an absorbance of 490 nm using a microplate reader (Model 550, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).</p>
<p>Cell differentiation was assessed by measuring the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of the cells cultured on the samples. The cells (1 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells mL<sup>−1</sup>) were placed on the samples and cultured for 10 days, washed with PBS, and detached using trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. After centrifugation, the cell pellets were resuspended in 1% Triton X-100 solution and disrupted by means of a cyclic freezing/thawing process. The amounts of protein in the cell lysates were quantified using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and the ALP activities were assayed colorimetrically using <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate (ALP yellow liquid substrate for ELISA, Sigma, St Louis, MO). The absorbance of the reaction product, <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenol, was measured at 405 nm using a microplate reader.</p>
<p>The MTS assay and ALP activity test were performed in duplicate and five samples were used for each test group. The mean and standard deviation were derived for each sample. The Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used for the analysis of statistical difference on the <italic>in vitro</italic> cellular test results, and statistical significance was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0885328211415723"><title>Results and discussions</title>
<p>The XRD patterns of the synthesized HA, FHA, and FA powders are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211415723">Figure 1</xref>. All the powders exhibited a highly crystalline pure phase of apatite without any secondary phases. Although it was not easy to distinguish between the five kinds of powders by XRD, the slight shift of the (3 0 0) peak toward a higher angle as the fluorine content in the powders increased was clearly observed (upper right inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211415723">Figure 1</xref>). This peak shift is related to the <italic>a</italic>-axis contraction which arises from the substitution of F<sup>−</sup> for OH<sup>−</sup> because of the smaller ionic radii of F<sup>−</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211415723">20</xref></sup> The XRD result demonstrated that FHA powders with different fluorine contents were successfully synthesized by the solid-state reaction of HA and FA.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211415723">Figure 2</xref> shows the XRD patterns of the coatings deposited on the Ti substrate. Similar to the case of the powders, the (3 0 0) peaks of the fluorine-containing coatings were shifted to the right-hand side, as compared to that of HA. Furthermore, the position of the (3 0 0) peak showed a systematic shift as the fluorine content in the coatings increased. The peaks of the coatings were reduced in intensity and became broadened compared with those of the starting powders, which was attributed to the poor crystallinity and small crystallite size of the coatings, which was induced by the high-energy impact of particles onto the substrate during AD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211415723">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211415723">15</xref></sup>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328211415723">Figure 3</xref> shows the FT-IR spectra of the coatings deposited on the Ti plate. The characteristic PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> stretching and bending bands of apatites could be observed in the 900–1200 and 500–600 cm<sup>−1</sup> ranges, respectively, for all the coatings irrespective of fluorine content. However, for fluorine-containing coatings, there were some variations with respect to HA in the bands regarding librational and stretching modes of the OH<sup>−</sup> group. The OH<sup>−</sup> librational mode at 630 cm<sup>−1</sup> was clearly present in the HA coating but absent in the FA coating. The gradual disappearance of this band as the fluorine content increased can be explained by the F<sup>−</sup> substitution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211415723">21</xref></sup> Another change in the FT-IR spectra with the F<sup>−</sup> substitution was apparent around the band corresponding to the OH<sup>−</sup> stretching mode. A single band at 3572 cm<sup>−1</sup> was observed in the pure HA coating. The intensity of this band decreased as the fluorine content in the coating increased and a new band appeared at 3543 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which was indicative of the F<sup>−</sup> substitution for OH<sup>−</sup> in the apatite lattice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211415723">21</xref></sup>

<p>The coating adhesion strength is a critical factor that can significantly affect the mechanical integrity and long-term stability of any coated implant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211415723">22</xref></sup> The adhesion strength of the coatings with the Ti plate, which was evaluated by the tensile pull-out test, is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885328211415723">Table 2</xref>. Only the samples suffering adhesion failure between the coating and substrate were included in the calculation of the adhesion strength value. As expected from the flawless interfacial microstructure between the coating and substrate, all the coatings exhibited a high adhesion strength ranging from 33.1 to 37.6 MPa and the values were two times higher than the critical value of ISO 13779-2 for HA coatings (15 MPa).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211415723">23</xref></sup> However, there was no obvious relationship between the adhesion strength and the fluorine content in the coatings.

The dissolution rate of the FHA coatings was intermediate between the pure HA and FA coatings and the amount of dissolved Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion was reduced as the fluorine content in the coatings increased.

<p>Dense and well-adherent FHA coatings with different compositions were deposited on titanium substrates by AD using FHA powders with the objective of improving dissolution resistance and biocompatibility of an HA coating. Both the FHA powders and coatings were characterized by XRD and FT-IR, revealing that F<sup>−</sup> ions were effectively substituted for OH<sup>−</sup> ions in HA. The substitution of F<sup>−</sup> for OH<sup>−</sup> lowered the solubility of HA in a TBS solution and affected cellular responses to the coatings. An FHA coating with a moderate degree of F<sup>−</sup> substitution (<italic>x</italic> = 0.1) exhibited the best cell spreading, cell proliferation, and differentiation activities. Finally, the FHA coating with the chemical composition of Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)F was found to be the best candidate biomaterial due to its moderate solubility and excellent biocompatibility, and hence it can be potentially applied for various biomedical implants requiring long-term stability.</p>
