<abstract>
<p>Carbon fiber surface energy is calculated using molecular mechanics simulations on the basis of variation in nonbond energy of carbon fiber due to the presence of various functional groups i.e., OH, CO, and COOH. A step-wise methodology is adopted so that optimized graphite models are used to build separate models of carbon fibers for discrete percentages of OH, CO, and COOH to know the effect of each functional group. Eventually, models of three real carbon fibers are developed to know the combined effect of functional groups on the surface energy of carbon fibers.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311410491" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is believed that there are three major possible processes responsible for adhesion of fiber with the matrix in composite materials i.e., mechanical coupling, chemical bonding, and thermodynamic adhesion. However, thermodynamic adhesion is considered the primary bonding mechanism and other processes may have only marginal impact.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410491">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Properties of all the composites in general and carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites in particular depend largely on the quality of bonding at fiber–matrix interface. CFRP is the most important category among the revolutionary materials. Despite the importance of CFRP, a lot is yet to be known about their interfacial characteristics mostly due to the complex structure of carbon fiber itself and also due to the absence of appropriate experimental techniques to study the interface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410491">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410491">3</xref></sup> Interfacial properties of CFRP are governed mainly by the carbon fiber surface characteristics. Standard practice to enhance the surface properties of carbon fiber is to increase its surface energy by introducing oxidizing functional groups with the help of surface treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311410491">4</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311410491">9</xref></sup> These surface treatments are mostly proprietary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410491">10</xref></sup> However, it is established that these treatments enhance the surface energy of the fibers by adding oxidizing functional groups i.e., hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carboxyl, making them suitable for better wetting by the matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311410491">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311410491">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311410491">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311410491">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Various experimental techniques have been used to characterize carbon fiber surface so that advantages of surface treatments and the effect of various functional groups can be identified.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410491">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311410491">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311410491">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410491">10</xref></sup> But the exact effect of these functional groups on carbon fiber surface is still unknown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410491">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311410491">8</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311410491">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Awaja et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410491">1</xref></sup> have reviewed various approaches regarding the calculation of surface energy of a soild surface in terms of contact angle measurements. They have classified these approaches into two broad categories i.e., components approach and equation of state approach. The former approach considers surface energy of a solid as a combination of dispersive (van der waals) and polar (hydrogen bonding) forces, whereas total surface energy of a solid can be measured directly with the help of the latter one. Young, Fowkes, geometric mean, Wu harmonic mean, and acid–base are the major versions of components theory. Two or more different probe liquids are required to find out components of surface energy of a solid in each of these techniques. Conversely, equation of state theory requires only one probe liquid to find the total surface energy. In their review, they have also enumerated various arguments against and in the favor of each theory describing their weaknesses and strengths.</p>
<p>Nonbond energy can be considered as a comprehensive term which covers all these components of surface energy and it can be calculated conveniently using molecular mechanics technique. Though molecular mechanics is used extensively in the field of drug designing, its application in materials science is quite rare. Only a few researchers have attempted to employ molecular simulation to study the various aspects of CFRP but their focus remained mostly to simulate either some kind of adsorption experiment to measure the surface energy of carbon fiber or to find the interaction energy of fiber and matrix directly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410491">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311410491">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311410491">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311410491">11</xref></sup> Hamerton et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410491">2</xref></sup> have conducted molecular mechanics simulations by making a carbon fiber model by introducing OH and COOH groups together. However, they have considered the graphite planes in vertical position so that functional groups can be attached only at one edge of graphite plane with a maximum of six pairs of OH and COOH. Allington et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311410491">8</xref></sup> have modeled the carbon fiber surface on the basis of basal planes and tried to calculate the surface composition by reverse calculation of interactions of small molecules with the help of molecular simulation and then compared results with inverse gas chromatography data. However, their model has incorporated grafting of one type of functional group at a time. In their subsequent publication, Allington et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311410491">9</xref></sup> have presented three different models of carbon fibers i.e., plane, stack, and sandwich, and tried to simulate the effect of respective functional group on adhesion characteristics with the help of adsorption interactions with small probe molecules. Attwood and Marshall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311410491">11</xref></sup> have constructed carbon fiber models on the basis of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data having all functional groups together but they have simulated the contact angle measurement experiment with the help of molecular simulation and tried to prove that tetra glycidyl diamino diphenyl methane is attracted more toward carbon fiber surface than diamino diphenyl sulphone.</p>
<p>In this study, surface energy of carbon fiber is calculated directly on the basis of variations in its nonbond energy due to the introduction of functional groups on its surface with the help of molecular mechanics simulation. Interactions only among the molecules present on carbon fiber and its surface are considered without the influence of any probe or matrix molecules. In this way, pure surface energy of carbon fiber can be ascertained without the influence of any external molecule. Interactions with a specific matrix can be carried out separately and specifically due to the fact that behavior and orientation of polar molecules on a surface are always unique against the particular type of interacting molecule.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410491">1</xref></sup> First of all, a step-wise methodology is adopted so that pure graphite model is optimized with respect to density and number of planes; hence, it becomes suitable to construct carbon fiber model. Second, carbon fiber models are developed to know the independent effect of each type of functionality content on carbon fiber surface energy. Finally, models for actual carbon fibers are developed so that all functionalities are present together on the basis of XPS data from literature. Calculated values of surface energies are also compared with the reported values for the same fibers.</p></sec>

<p>Total surface energy of a solid can be calculated directly using the following equation:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311410491">3</xref></sup>

where γ is the surface energy of the solid, <italic>E</italic><sub>surface</sub> the energy of surface normalized with respect to number of layers, and <italic>E</italic><sub>bulk</sub> the energy of the bulk solid before cleaving the surface which is also normalized with respect to number of layers. <italic>A</italic> is the surface area created due to cleavage of the bulk into two surfaces. However, it was found during simulations that only nonbond energy contributed to alter the total energy of the system during cleaving of a surface from the bulk and also when surface functionality content is changed. Therefore, values of respective nonbond energies for <italic>E</italic><sub>surface</sub> and <italic>E</italic><sub>bulk</sub> are used to calculate surface energies in this study.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec4-0021998311410491"><title>Model development</title>
<p>Real carbon fiber surface is very complex but a simple modeling approach is followed in this study. A pure graphite structure was constructed on which oxidizing functional groups were grafted. Several species like Na, Ca, Si, and N were ignored due to their very low content reported in published XPS data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410491">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311410491">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410491">10</xref></sup> In addition, surface roughness, pores, and other topographical information were also not included in the model. It was found that major influence and evidence were in favor of only three functional groups i.e., Hydroxyl, Carbonyl, and Carboxyl.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311410491">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311410491">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410491">10</xref></sup> Therefore, only these three types of functional groups were considered in this model. ‘Build’ menu of Material Studio 4.3 (Accelrys Software Inc.) was used to construct the models and ‘Discover’ module to conduct molecular mechanics simulations.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0021998311410491"><title>Graphite model</title>
<p>Graphite model was imported from the available library structures of the software. Standard graphite model was based on the ideal density of graphite i.e., 2.24 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Surface was constructed by cleaving (0 0 1) plane using ‘Cleave’ command (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311410491">Figure 1(b)</xref>) and structure minimized using ‘Discover Smart Minimizer’. A 30 A° vacuum layer was added at the top to avoid interactions between atoms of subsequent layers due to periodic boundary conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311410491">Figure 2</xref>). Dimensions of existing cell were too small for simulation. Therefore, ‘Supercell’ command was used to expand the model. Final structural parameters were as follows:

<p>Surface area = 335.413 × 10<sup>−20</sup> m<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>To select the number of layers of graphite model necessary for reasonable accuracy, surface energy was calculated with various number of layers for pure graphite (density 2.24 g/cm<sup>3</sup>). It was found that two-layer model was accurate enough and provides suitable depth to the model. Results are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311410491">Table 1</xref>.

<p>Similar models for graphite having densities of 1.77 and 1.73 g/cm<sup>3</sup> were also constructed by keeping the values of <italic>c</italic>-axis at 8.6 and 8.8 A°, respectively, to know the effect of density on surface energy.

<sec id="sec6-0021998311410491"><title>Carbon fiber models</title>
<p>Due to considerable dependence of surface energy on density, carbon fiber models were constructed on the basis of graphite model so that resultant density of 1.77 g/cm<sup>3</sup> was achieved, as most of the commercially available carbon fibers have almost similar value of density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311410491">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311410491">8</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410491">10</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec7-0021998311410491"><title>Carbon fiber models having separate functional groups</title>
<p>Separate models of carbon fiber were constructed by manual grafting of respective functional groups on the top layer of graphite model so that resultant density remained at 1.77 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. Discrete percentages of each functional group were modeled separately. Adjustments for double bonds and hydrogen addition were made using respective commands of the software. Placement, orientation, and distribution of these functionalities could produce variable results. Therefore, uniform distribution of the groups and minimum energy principle were followed in this regard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311410491">Figure 3</xref>).
<fig id="fig3-0021998311410491" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Carbon fiber surface model with (a) OH group, (b) CO group, and (c) COOH group.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311410491-fig3.tif"/></fig></p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0021998311410491"><title>Carbon fiber models having combined functional groups</title>
<p>Finally, models representing actual carbon fiber were developed by grafting all three functional groups together on the basis of XPS data obtained by Dilsiz and Wightman,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311410491">12</xref></sup> as given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998311410491">Table 3</xref>. There can be several combinations and distribution patterns of these functional groups on the carbon fiber surface. Therefore, different schemes were developed for each model with different distributions of functional groups and one with the minimum energy was selected for a specific composition.

<p>All the models of pure graphite and carbon fibers were subjected one-by-one to molecular minimization using ‘smart minimizer’ of ‘Discover’ module and then single-point energies were calculated. Condensed-phase Optimized Molecular Potentials for Atomistic Simulation Studies (COMPASS) force field was used and temperature for all simulations kept at 0°K. Structural optimization was carried out by selecting 5000 steps of molecular mechanics so that the energy convergence is less than 1000 kcal/mole with ‘steepest descent’.

<sec id="sec11-0021998311410491"><title>Optimization of graphite model</title>
<p>To optimize the graphite model with respect to number of planes and density, first surface energy of graphite was calculated as a function of number of planes placed below the surface. Results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311410491">Table 1</xref>. It is clear from the data that a two-layer model gives sufficient accuracy and addition of more number of planes will cause only a longer simulation time.</p>
<p>Primary aim of graphite model construction was to use it as a basis for carbon fiber model development. Therefore, reference of density was kept as 1.77 g/cm<sup>3</sup> as most of the commercial carbon fibers have almost similar value of density. Calculation of surface energy of other two values of 1.73 and 2.24 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311410491">Table 2</xref>) was performed to emphasize the importance of selection of density, as it may alter the results of carbon fiber model very effectively. This dependence of surface energy on density can be best explained based on Lenaard–Jones 6-12 principle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311410491">13</xref></sup> Variation in density of graphite results in variation in interatomic distances. Ideal density of graphite is 2.24 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and at this value of density, it has the minimum nonbond energy of bulk material. As the density is decreased, nonbond energy starts increasing due to low rate of decrease in repulsive forces than relatively higher rate of increase in dispersive forces. In this model, density was adjusted by variation in <italic>c</italic>-axis; therefore, there is no change in nonbond energy of surface (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311410491">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-0021998311410491"><title>Effect of functional groups–separate models</title>
<p>Simulations were carried out by introducing functional groups on the carbon fiber surface upto a maximum of 32% due to the fact that even after severe oxidation treatment, percentages of individual functional groups remain below 25%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410491">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Variation of surface energy of carbon fiber with the change of OH group content is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410491">Figure 5</xref>. Upto about 23% of OH group, surface energy decreases and then increases very sharply on further increase in OH group content. It may be noted that from 14% to 24% of OH percentage, surface energy contribution becomes negative.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311410491">Figure 6</xref> reflects the simulation results regarding effect of CO group on carbon fiber surface energy. Surface energy first drops slightly upto about 15% of CO group and then increases steadily. However, there is no negative contribution of surface energy by the CO group.

<p>Simulation results regarding effect of COOH group on carbon fiber surface energy are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311410491">Figure 7</xref>. It is evident that here trends of surface energy are opposite to that of OH and CO groups. There is a moderate increase in surface energy with increase in COOH content upto about 18% of COOH. From 18% to 24% of COOH, there is a sharp increase in surface energy of carbon fiber, which again starts declining beyond 25% and almost levels off at 32% of COOH.

<p>These trends can be correlated with the findings of Gardner et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311410491">10</xref></sup> and Morita et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311410491">14</xref></sup> that hydroxyl group is the primary carbon–oxygen functionality in the as-received fibers, but progressive oxidation acts to decrease its relative surface concentration in favor of COOH and CO groups.</p>
<p>Similarly, according to Yue et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311410491">5</xref></sup> carbon fiber surface oxidation adopts the same sequence, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311410491">Figure 10</xref>. In a way, first OH group will be formed, which will later transform into CO and COOH on further oxidation.</p>
<p>Effect of respective functional groups on carbon fiber surface energy can be deduced from the fact that when a surface is cleaved from the solid bulk material, its total energy is increased due to the unsatisfied bonds or nonideal electronic distribution at the surface, which are otherwise satisfied in the bulk state due to the presence of neighboring atoms. When an oxygen atom makes a single bond with a carbon atom in graphite structure, system free energy is lowered due to a better electronic distribution at the surface. Therefore, surface energy of carbon fiber start decreasing with the addition of very first OH group but its effect becomes more pronounced at about 13% of OH group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410491">Figure 5</xref>. Ultimately, due to saturation, further addition of OH group also causes increase in the free energy of the system and consequently the surface energy of the carbon fiber. Therefore, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410491">Figure 5</xref>, trend of surface energy reverts at 21% and overall contribution to surface energy becomes positive beyond 24%. The same behavior is not reflected in the case of CO and COOH groups, due to the fact that these groups can attach to the carbon fiber surface, only after breaking the existing bonds between carbon atoms of graphite structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311410491">Figure 10</xref>).</p>
<p>Allington et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311410491">9</xref></sup> have also found similar trends that initially OH group concentration increases with moderate surface treatment of carbon fibers and then decreases before becoming constant and percentages of both of CO and COOH increase as soon as OH group contents start decreasing.</p>
<p>Surface energy values of carbon fibers vary from 30 to 76.8 mN/m<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311410491">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311410491">16</xref></sup> upto a maximum value for pitch-based fibers as 100 mN/m.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311410491">17</xref></sup> Therefore, from trends of surface energy obtained in this study, it can be assumed that as-received or moderately oxidized fibers have more OH group concentration than CO and COOH. Therefore, their surface energy values are toward the lower side, as the tendency of OH group is to decrease the surface energy of carbon fiber at lower percentage values. On further increase in surface treatment extent, the surface energy of carbon fiber increases, which can only be possible if OH content decreases and contents of CO and particulary COOH increase, because COOH group contributes to increase the surface energy of carbon fiber the most.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-0021998311410491"><title>Effect of functional groups–combined models</title>
<p>XPS and surface energy data obtained by Dilsiz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311410491">12</xref></sup> are used to develop carbon fiber models with combined functional groups. Three states of AS4 (HEXCEL Corporation, USA) carbon fibers i.e., unsized, sized with Ultem®, and sized with Poly Thioarylene Phosphine Oxide (PTPO) are selected. Though the effect of sizing on carbon fiber surface energy is beyond the scope of this study, sized fibers are selected only to study the variation in functional group concentration and their subsequent effect on surface energy of carbon fiber. Total Oxygen content i.e., O1s values of Dilsiz and Wightman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311410491">12</xref></sup> in each type of fiber is divided among OH, CO, and COOH groups on the basis of C1s peak distribution data of Dilsiz and Wightman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311410491">12</xref></sup> and results summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998311410491">Table 3</xref>. Three separate models are constructed having functional groups according to the data mentioned in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998311410491">Table 3</xref>.</p>
<p>Surface energy of each model was calculated by molecular mechanics simulation and results compared with experimental data of Dilsiz and Wightman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311410491">12</xref></sup> for respective fibers, as depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021998311410491">Table 4</xref>. Simulated and experimental values show good agreement. The difference in surface energy values of all three types of carbon fibers is due to the presence of dissimilar functional groups with variable content and these results are in accordance with the analysis presented above. PTPO sized fiber has only OH group (7.8%) on the surface. Therefore, it reflects the minimum value of surface energy i.e., 27.1 mN/m, due to the fact that the presence of OH group causes to decrease the surface energy of carbon fiber at this percentage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311410491">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311410491">8</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998311410491">9</xref>). In the case of Ultem® sized fiber, OH content is increased from 7.8% to 10.16% but at the same time CO functionality is also added. Consequently, decrease in surface energy of carbon fiber due to increase in OH group is compensated to a certain extent by the increase in surface energy due to the addition of CO group. Thus, a resultant surface energy value of 51.1 mN/m is achieved for Ultem® sized fiber. Finally, unsized fiber contains all three functional groups present on its surface so that OH and CO percentages are reduced with an addition of COOH group. As a result, unsized fiber has demonstrated the highest value of surface energy i.e., 65.4 mN/m, as COOH group causes to increase the surface energy of carbon fiber the most.</p>
<p>Lower shade of simulated values may be attributable to the calculations at 0° K. Various assumptions are made to simplify the models and due to the absence of effect of probe liquids, which is included in the experimental data.</p>
<p>As a result, the method introduced in this study can be used to estimate the surface energy of a carbon fiber of known composition or on the other hand, an oxidation treatment level can be planned to achieve a carbon fiber with desired surface energy value. Furthermore, it is suggested that surface oxidizing functional groups content of carbon fibers may be increased as much as possible with special focus on COOH to maximize the surface energy and ultimately wettability of carbon fibers.</p>
<p>However, the extent of surface treatment may be kept up to the level so that it does not deteriorate the mechanical performance of fibers itself. In this way, good interfacial adhesion can be achieved between carbon fibers and polymer matrix and CFRP composites having optimum mechanical properties can be produced.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec14-0021998311410491" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Molecular mechanics simulation technique is employed to measure the surface energy of carbon fiber with the help of Material Studio 4.3 software (Accelrys Inc) using COMPASS forcefield. Variation in nonbond energy of carbon fiber due to the presence of a particular type and content of one or more of oxidizing functionalities i.e., OH, CO, and COOH is made the basis of surface energy calculations. In this manner, pure surface energy of carbon fiber is calculated without any influence of some probe or matrix molecule in contrast to the adsorption simulations performed till date. Study is conducted in three major phases so that first graphite models are constructed and optimized. Second, separate models of carbon fibers having ascending percentages of functionalities are built and surface energy trends for each functional group determined separately. Finally, three real carbon fiber models are developed on the basis of XPS data from literature to measure the combined effect of functional groups, as per composition, on the surface energy of carbon fibers.</p>
<p>Trends of surface energies based on individual functional groups are supported well by the previous studies. Likewise, simulated and experimental values of respective total surface energies of all three real carbon fiber models have also shown a good agreement. Therefore, the method introduced in this study can be used fairly well to estimate the surface energy of a particular carbon fiber of known composition or conversely an oxidation level or treatment can be designed to achieve a carbon fiber with desired surface energy.</p></sec>
