<sc>d</sc>-Limonene, a common monoterepene has been shown to have antiproliferative, apoptosis-inducing and chemopreventive effects. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of <sc>d</sc>-limonene on the growth of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-promoted skin tumor development. We found that <sc>d</sc>-limonene (50 and 100 mg/kg body weight) treatments to the mouse skin significantly reduced the TPA-induced (a) edema and hyperplasia (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001); (b) expression of cyclooxygenase-2; (c) ornithine decarboxylase activity (<italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001); and (d) [<sup>3</sup>H] thymidine incorporation into DNA (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). In addition, treatment of <sc>d</sc>-limonene effectively restored the level of reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase, catalase and malondialdehyde production in TPA-treated mouse skin. In a two-stage skin tumorigenesis study, <sc>d</sc>-limonene significantly reduced the tumor burden (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005) and tumor incidence as compared to DMBA/TPA-treated mice. <sc>d</sc>-Limonene treatment also extended the latency period of tumor development from 4 to 9 weeks. <sc>d</sc>-Limonene treatment decreased the expression level of Ras, Raf and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 in DMBA/TPA-induced tumors. A decrease in the expression of Bcl-2 and an increase in Bax expression were also observed in tumor tissues of mice treated with <sc>d</sc>-limonene. Taken together, our findings suggest that <sc>d</sc>-limonene may exert its chemopreventive activity through the inhibition of inflammation, oxidative stress and Ras-signaling as well as the induction of pro-apoptotic state during TPA-mediated promotion of DMBA-induced skin cancer in mouse model.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cancer is a growing health problem due to the changes in lifestyle such as inappropriate diet, obesity, infections, radiation, stress, use of tobacco, lack of physical activity and exposure to the environmental pollutants.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0960327111434948">1</xref>
</sup> The risk of cancer can be reduced either by eliminating the identified carcinogens or by minimizing exposure to them, for instance, by dietary habits. Epidemiological studies indicated that many dietary agents are well-known chemopreventive agents.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0960327111434948">2</xref>
</sup> These agents have the ability to modulate at more than one critical pathway of carcinogenesis. So, the chemopreventive intervention using the naturally occurring dietary substance is extremely desirable to delay the process of carcinogenesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0960327111434948">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The development of skin cancer is a multistage process that involves initiation, promotion and progression.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0960327111434948">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0960327111434948">5</xref>
</sup> In the mouse model of skin cancer, tumor initiation can be caused by a single topical application of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA; a carcinogen that mutates H-Ras proto-oncogene).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0960327111434948">6</xref>
</sup> Subsequently, the repeated applications of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) trigger tumor promotion, involving clonal expansion of initiated cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0960327111434948">6</xref>
</sup> The mutated Ras protein gets farnesylated by the enzyme farnesyl transferase (FTase). The farnesylated Ras protein then gets attached to the cell membrane which leads to the activation of Ras/Raf/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) cascade.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0960327111434948">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0960327111434948">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Applications of TPA also induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which induces DNA strand breaks and oxidation of DNA bases, leading to mutagenesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0960327111434948">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0960327111434948">9</xref>
</sup> Increased level of ROS damages almost all biomolecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins, thus playing a key role in the pathophysiology of a number of degenerative and chronic diseases, including cancer.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0960327111434948">9</xref>
</sup> During oxidative stress, a reduction in the activities of antioxidative enzymes viz. catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) and reduced glutathione (GSH) content has been found with an increase in the level of ROS in murine skin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0960327111434948">9</xref>
</sup> The status of intracellular redox is regulated by antioxidant enzymes (CAT, GR, GPX and GST) and nonenzymatic antioxidants (GSH and vitamin C).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0960327111434948">10</xref>
</sup> They also activate proinflammatory genes such as in the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and various transcription factors.<sup>

<p>
<sc>d</sc>-Limonene (1-methyl-4-isopropyl-cyclohexene) is a natural product found in essential oils of orange, lemon, mandarin, lime, grapefruit and many other plants. <sc>d</sc>-Limonene has been reported to modulate the oxidative stress and to have the chemopreventive activity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0960327111434948">12</xref>
</sup> The chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic efficacies of <sc>d</sc>-limonene have been reported against various chemically induced animal tumor models.<sup>

</sup> <sc>d</sc>-Limonene has been shown (a) to induce phases I (cytochrome P450) and II (glutathione transferase and uridine diphosphate-glucuronyl transferase) carcinogen-detoxifying enzymes, during the initiation phase of carcinogenesis<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0960327111434948">16</xref>
</sup>; (b) to inhibit farnesylation of Ras protein<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0960327111434948">17</xref>
</sup>; and (c) to trigger apoptosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0960327111434948">15</xref>
</sup> Phase I and phase II clinical trials of <sc>d</sc>-limonene have also been undertaken with advanced cancer and exhibited minimal toxicity in these studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0960327111434948">18</xref>
</sup> However, its mechanism of antitumor activity is still unclear.</p>
<p>In the present study, we investigated the effect of <sc>d</sc>-limonene on TPA-induced edema, hyperplasia, expression of COX-2, oxidative stress enzymes, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and [<sup>3</sup>H] thymidine incorporation as early tumor promotion biomarkers in the skin of Swiss albino mice. We also investigated the effect of <sc>d</sc>-limonene on Ras/Raf/ERK1/2-signaling pathway and expression of Bax and Bcl-2 in DMBA/TPA-mediated skin tumorigenesis.</p>

<sec id="section4-0960327111434948">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Female Swiss albino mice (6–8 weeks old; 20–25 g) were obtained from Central Animal House Facility of Hamdard University, New Delhi. The mice were housed in a well-ventilated room at 25 ± 2°C under 12-h light:12-h dark cycle. The mice were fed pellet diet (Hindustan Lever Ltd, Bombay, India) and drinking water <italic>ad libitum</italic>. The study protocols (CAHF file no. 283) were approved by the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision on Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), India. The mice were treated and killed according to approved ethical guidelines. The dorsal skin of the mice was shaven with an electric clipper (Oster A2, USA) followed by the application of hair-removing cream (Anne French, Geoffery Manners, Bombay, India) at least 2 days before treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0960327111434948">
<title>Treatment schedule for investigating the effect of <sc>d</sc>-limonene on TPA-induced tumor promotion biomarkers in the skin</title>
<p>Mice were randomly divided into five groups of six each. Mice of group 1 received topical treatment of 200 μl acetone and served as vehicle control group. Mice of group 3 were topically applied with <sc>d</sc>-limonene (50 mg/kg body weight was dissolved in 200 μl acetone/mouse), and those on groups 4 and 5 were applied with <sc>d</sc>-limonene (100 mg/kg body weight in 200 μl acetone/mouse). Thirty minutes after these treatments, mice of groups 2, 3 and 4 received topical treatment of TPA (2 μg/200 μl acetone/mouse). The treatments were carried out for 3 days, once a day. Mice of all groups including vehicle control were killed by cervical dislocation 12 h after the last TPA treatment. The dorsal skin of each mouse was immediately removed and cleaned to remove the extraneous material with sharp scalpel blade in ice cold 0.8% NaCl. The skin was then processed for evaluation of edema, histopathology, immunohistochemistry and oxidative stress enzymes.</p>
<p>For estimation of ODC activity and [<sup>3</sup>H] thymidine incorporation, the treatment schedule and allotment of mice were exactly same as above. To measure the ODC activity, the animals of all groups were killed after 6 h of last TPA treatment. For the [<sup>3</sup>H] thymidine incorporation into epidermal DNA, mice of all the groups were injected intraperitoneally with [<sup>3</sup>H] thymidine (20 μCi/mouse/200 μl saline) 18 h after the last TPA treatment and were killed after 2 h of [<sup>3</sup>H] thymidine treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0960327111434948">
<title>Mouse skin edema and histopathological studies</title>
<p>The estimation of skin edema was done per the method described by Afaq et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0960327111434948">4</xref>
</sup> A skin punch of 1 cm diameter was made fat-free and weighed quickly. The skin punch was dried for 24 h at 50°C and reweighed. The loss of water content was determined. The extent of edema was calculated as the difference in water gain between control and TPA-treated groups. The inhibitory effect of <sc>d</sc>-limonene was calculated as the difference between control and <sc>d</sc>-limonene-/TPA-treated groups.</p>
<p>For histopathological study, the dorsal skins were removed and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The skins were then embedded in paraffin wax as standard procedure and 5 µm sections were cut. The sections were stained with hematoxylin &amp; eosin. The infiltrations of leukocytes in dermis were observed and epidermal thickness (as an indicator of hyperplasia) was measured at least in six different regions using microscope (Motic Digital Microscope).</p>

<title>Immunohistochemical analysis</title>
<p>The dorsal skins of mice were excised and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. The skins were embedded in paraffin wax. Five-micrometer thick sections were cut and mounted on silanized glass slides. The sections were deparaffinized in xylene and dehydrated in graded ethanol. For antigen retrieval, the sections were kept in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 95°C for 6 min. Each section was treated with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 20 min and then with blocking solution (1% non-fat skimmed milk) for 30 min. Sections were incubated with monoclonal anti-COX-2 antibody at room temperature for 2 h. Thereafter, they were incubated with secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. In order to develop the color, DAB was applied on each section for 3–5 min. Sections were then rinsed with distilled water and counterstained with hematoxylin. Finally, they were microscopically (Motic Digital Microscope) analyzed at least in six different regions.</p>

The homogenates were then centrifuged at 10,000<italic>g</italic> for 30 min and a portion of supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000<italic>g</italic> for 60 min at 4°C to obtain the microsomal pellet and cytosol. The cytosol was used for the estimation of ODC activity per the method of Verma et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0960327111434948">24</xref>
</sup> In brief, the reaction mixture (495 μl) contained 400 μl of cytosolic enzyme solution and 95 μl of co-factor mixture containing 0.32 mM pyridoxal phosphate, 0.4 mM EDTA, 4 mM dithiothreitol, 0.4 mM ornithine, 0.02% Brij-35 and 0.05 μCi DL [<sup>14</sup>C] ornithine. After adding the enzyme solution and cofactor mixture, the test tubes were immediately closed with rubber stopper and the central well assemblies were containing 0.2 ml ethanolamine and methoxyethanol mixture in 2:1, v/v ratio. The reaction mixture was kept in water bath at 37°C for 1 h. The reaction was arrested by injecting 1.0 ml of 2.0 M citric acid solution along side of glass tubes and the solution was kept for 1 h to ensure complete absorption of CO<sub>2</sub>. Finally, solution in central well was transferred to vial containing 2 ml ethanol and 10 ml scintillation fluid. Radioactivity was counted in scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6500 multipurpose).

</sup> Skins were quickly removed and the extraneous materials including dermis were cleaned, and homogenates (10%, w/v) were prepared in ice-cold water. To the homogenate, an equal volume of ice-cold 10% TCA (trichloroacetic acid) was added and centrifuged at 2500<italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The supernatant was then discarded and the precipitate was washed with cold 5% TCA and centrifuged. The precipitate thus obtained was incubated with cold 10% perchloric acid (PCA) at 4°C overnight. The suspension was centrifuged, washed with 5% cold PCA and dissolved in warm 10% PCA, followed by incubation in a boiling water bath for 30 min. It was then filtered through Whatman 50 filter paper to get clear nucleotide solution, which was taken for DNA estimation by DPA (diphenylamine) method. A fixed volume of filtrate was used for [<sup>3</sup>H] thymidine counting in liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS 6500 multipurpose).

<title>Two-stage mouse skin tumorigenesis</title>
<p>The mice were divided in four groups of 20 mice each. Mice of group 1 received 200 μl acetone only and served as vehicle control. The treatment of the dorsal skin of mice of groups 2, 3 and 4 was initiated by single topical application of 50 μg DMBA in 200 μl acetone. One week later, tumor growth was promoted by repeated topical applications of TPA (2 mg in 200 μl acetone). Mice of group 2 were treated with TPA alone and served as positive control. However, mice of groups 3 and 4 topically received <sc>d</sc>-limonene 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight in 200 μl acetone, respectively. Thirty minutes after this treatment, TPA was applied to mouse skin for tumor promotion. The treatments were performed thrice a week up to the termination of experiments (21 weeks). Skin tumors with a diameter of &gt;1 mm were counted and recorded every week. The data are expressed as the percentage of mice with tumors (tumor incidence) and the number of tumors/mouse (tumor burden) are plotted as a function of weeks on test. On the completion of experiment, the mice were killed by cervical dislocation. The skin/tumors were harvested for Western blot analysis.</p>

<p>Raf protein expression was analyzed in connection with Ras protein analysis. An elevated level of Raf protein was observed in DMBA/TPA-mediated skin tumor in comparison with acetone-treated skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0960327111434948">Figure 5</xref>). Whereas, pretreatment of <sc>d</sc>-limonene at both the doses (50 and 100 mg/kg body weight), prior to TPA application showed reserve effect in expression of Raf protein as compared to that of DMBA/TPA-treated group. To study the Ras-mediated signaling pathway, we next analyzed the phosphorylation of p-ERK1/2 as downstream effectors of Ras protein. Application of TPA in DMBA-initiated mice skin elevated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in comparison to acetone-treated. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in <sc>d</sc>-limonene-pretreated (50 and 100 mg/kg body weight) skin tumors were significantly inhibited in comparison to that of DMBA/TPA-treated tumors.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The promotion stage in multistep tumorigenesis offers an opportunity to delay the process of cancer development. It provides a realistic path to understand the mechanism of action of chemopreventive dietary agents. Multiple lines of studies showed that phorbol-type tumor promoters induce inflammatory responses like induction of edema, hyperplasia and COX-2 expression in epidermal cells leading to malignant transformation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0960327111434948">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0960327111434948">8</xref>
</sup> Histological changes (edema and hyperplasia) of skin and infiltration of polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes in dermis are responsible for increasing the risk of carcinogenesis. TPA-induced upregulation of COX-2 and subsequently production of prostaglandins (PGs) indicate its role in tumor promotion and in tumorigenesis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0960327111434948">31</xref>
</sup> Maier et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0960327111434948">32</xref>
</sup> reported that interleukin-1a induces PG synthesis and primes leukocytes to enhance the production of reactive oxygen intermediates in epidermal keratinocytes; the latter have been implicated in the induction of tumor formation. However, our result showed that pretreatment with <sc>d</sc>-limonene attenuated the induction of COX-2 enzyme by TPA, suggesting that COX-2 is likely to be potential target for <sc>d</sc>-limonene.</p>
<p>Accumulating evidences showed that the tumor promoter induces infiltration and activation of leukocytes which induce the production of ROS in the cells.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0960327111434948">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0960327111434948">33</xref>
</sup> According to earlier observations, <sc>d</sc>-limonene alters the increased level of GPX, GST and GSH content, indicating the potency to diminish the oxidative stress response.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0960327111434948">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0960327111434948">34</xref>
</sup> We observed that pretreatment with <sc>d</sc>-limonene, prior to TPA treatment reduced the effect of ROS by elevating the activities of antioxidative enzymes CAT, GR, GPX, GST and GSH content. Our findings suggest that <sc>d</sc>-limonene reduces the TPA-induced oxidative stress in murine skin through the activation of antioxidative enzymes.</p>
<p>ODC is a rate-limiting enzyme of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) biosynthesis that is essential for normal cell growth and differentiation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0960327111434948">35</xref>
</sup> Elevation in the activity of ODC has been detected in transformed cell line and experimental animal tumors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0960327111434948">30</xref>
</sup> Application of tumor promoter induced the activity of ODC and incorporation of thymidine into DNA, thereby enhancing the growth and differentiation of cell leading to development of cancer. Our data showed that <sc>d</sc>-limonene significantly inhibits TPA-mediated increase in epidermal ODC activity and thymidine incorporation.</p>
<p>We demonstrated that <sc>d</sc>-limonene suppressed the TPA-induced promotional changes, thus extending the latency period of tumor and reducing the tumor burden. In summary, <sc>d</sc>-limonene exhibited an inhibitory effect on DMBA/TPA-mediated tumorigenesis by reducing the TPA-mediated inflammation (including COX-2 induction), oxidative stress and hyperproliferation responses, at least in part. DMBA treatment produces carcinogen–DNA adducts which may induce G→A transition or A→T transversion. Such point mutations in codon 61 have been shown to be associated with overexpression of the <italic>H-Ras</italic> gene.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0960327111434948">36</xref>
</sup> Ras protein becomes activated and anchored to the inner cell membrane via farnesylation to transduce the cell proliferation signal. Since, <sc>d</sc>-limonene and other monoterpenes are known to inhibit FTase activity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0960327111434948">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0960327111434948">17</xref>
</sup> In this context, we examined the Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 pathway in DMBA/TPA-induced skin tumors. In our study, <sc>d</sc>-limonene decreased the level of membrane-bound Ras protein and increased the level in the cytosol. Activation of Ras protein (anchored) leads to the activation of Raf protein (first step, the best accepted downstream Ras effector), which in turn activates the ERKs by phosphorylation. Activated ERKs target many proteins including transcription factors and other protein kinases resulting in transduction of signal to nucleus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0960327111434948">36</xref>
</sup> Our analysis confirms that the application of <sc>d</sc>-limonene significantly suppresses the DMBA/TPA-mediated activation of Raf and phosphorylation of ERK1/2, leading to the suppression of Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 cascade during the promotion phase of murine skin tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Inhibition of Ras pathway alters the expression level of many intermediate apoptotic proteins like Bim, Bax, Bcl-2 and so on, thereby leading to apoptosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0960327111434948">37</xref>
</sup> The <italic>Bcl-2</italic> gene product is a negative regulator of apoptosis, which forms a heterodimer complex with Bax and neutralizes the effect of pro-apoptosis. Thus, the ratio of Bax-to-Bcl-2 protein plays a crucial role in apoptosis in DMBA/TPA-treated mouse skin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0960327111434948">38</xref>
</sup> In the present study, we found that <sc>d</sc>-limonene treatment suppresses the DMBA/TPA-induced downregulation of Bax and upregulation of Bcl-2 during skin tumorigenesis. Therefore, <sc>d</sc>-limonene efficiently suppresses the formation of DMBA/TPA-mediated skin tumor through the induction of pro-apoptotic state. Ji et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0960327111434948">39</xref>
</sup> demonstrated that <sc>d</sc>-limonene treatment to human leukemia cells induce apoptosis through the mitochondrial death pathway with an increase in Bax protein expression and involvement of caspases. However, elevated level of ROS can also activate ERK1/2; and induction of apoptosis by triggering mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, release of pro-apoptotic factors and activation of caspase-3 and -9 and subsequent cleavage of poly (ADP-ribosyl) polymerase.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0960327111434948">40</xref>
</sup> Recently, Chang et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0960327111434948">36</xref>
</sup> reported that TPA treatment activates the Ras/Raf/ERK1/2-signaling pathway, NF-κB and expression of COX-2. Additionally, many epithelial tumors exhibit elevated levels of ODC enzyme that can also lead to upregulation of the Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 pathway.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0960327111434948">41</xref>
</sup> In a previous study, <sc>d</sc>-limonene exerts the antiproliferative mechanism through the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ERK pathway activation and induces the apoptotic process.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0960327111434948">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In conclusion, the topical treatment of <sc>d</sc>-limonene inhibits Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 signaling pathway and promoted to pro-apoptotic state and delayed the DMBA/TPA-mediated murine skin tumorigenesis, by attenuating the skin inflammatory responses (edema, hyperplasia and COX-2 expression). Thus, <sc>d</sc>-limonene exhibited several potent chemopreventive effects on the reduction of skin tumors, providing protection from the development of this form of papilloma.</p>
