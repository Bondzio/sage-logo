<abstract>
<p>Congestive heart failure (CHF) accounts for more health care costs than any other diagnosis. Readmissions contribute to this expenditure. The authors evaluated the relationship between adherence to performance metrics and 30-day readmissions. This was a retrospective study of 6063 patients with CHF between 2001 and 2008. Data were collected for 30-day readmissions and compliance with CHF performance measures at discharge. Rates of readmission for CHF increased from 16.8% in 2002 to 24.8% in 2008. Adherence to performance measures increased concurrently from 95.8% to 99.9%. Except for left ventricular function (LVF) assessment, the 30-day readmission rate was not associated with adherence to performance measures. Readmitted patients had twice the odds of not having their LVF assessed (odds ratio = 2.0; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .00005; 95% confidence interval = 1.45-2.63). CHF performance measures, except for the LVF assessment, have little relationship to 30-day readmissions. Further studies are needed to identify performance measures that correlate with quality of care.</p>

<body>
<p>Congestive heart failure (CHF) is the most common Medicare discharge diagnosis, accounting for more health care costs than any other medical condition in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612465066">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612465066"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612465066">3</xref></sup> The public health implication of heart failure is related not only to the burden of health care cost but also to the widespread prevalence of the disease. It is estimated that 5 million Americans are living with the diagnosis of heart failure, while another 550 000 Americans are diagnosed with this condition every year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612465066">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The increased prevalence of heart failure in the United States over the past 3 decades has been attributed to the growing percentage of the population who are elderly. It is estimated that 80% of patients admitted with heart failure are older than 65 years of age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612465066">2</xref></sup> The economic impact of heart failure is tremendous, with an annual health care cost estimated to be more than $35 billion in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612465066">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612465066">4</xref></sup> A significant portion of this expenditure has been attributed to frequent readmissions; 20% of all patients discharged from the hospital with heart failure are readmitted within the first 30 days and 50% are readmitted within 6 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612465066">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612465066">6</xref></sup> Although there has been tremendous progress in evidence-based knowledge in clinical medicine, there has not been a parallel increase in guideline-centered patient care. Adoption of practice guidelines in the “real world” has been poor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612465066">7</xref></sup> Paucity of adoption of clinical practice guidelines has led to the implementation of performance measures by quality assurance organizations and third-party payers. These performance measures have been used as surrogate indicators of quality of care.</p>
<p>Performance measures for heart failure include documentation of the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) at discharge for patients with systolic dysfunction, CHF discharge instructions at discharge from the hospital, smoking cessation counseling, and left ventricular assessment. Despite the widespread use of performance measures, the value of these measures in improving clinical outcomes is yet to be defined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612465066">8</xref></sup> Compliance with heart failure performance measures and 30-day heart failure readmissions are not only publicly reportable as measures of quality of care but also will be tied to reimbursement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).</p>
<p>The authors sought to study whether adherence to heart failure performance measures translates to reduced 30-day readmissions.</p>
<sec id="section1-1062860612465066" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This is a retrospective study designed to investigate whether adherence to heart failure performance measures translates to reduced 30-day readmissions. The study was conducted in a regional health care system comprising 4 hospitals with an integrated electronic medical record system. A trained nurse abstractor prospectively collected data for performance measures compliance and 30-day readmissions. Readmission was defined as admission to the hospital within 30 days of discharge from the hospital with <italic>International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision</italic> (ICD-9) codes for CHF. All patients older than 18 years of age who were admitted to the health network between December 2001 and December 2008 with ICD-9 codes for CHF were included in the study. These patients were identified from the heart failure registry using ICD-9 codes designated for CHF. Patients from this group who were readmitted within 30 days of the index hospital admission were further stratified.</p>
<p>Data abstracted from both the electronic and paper medical records for patients who had been readmitted included demographic information, comorbid conditions, diagnostic tests, preadmission and postdischarge medications, and compliance with heart failure core measures at discharge. Local institutional review board approval was obtained prior to the initiation of this study.</p>
<sec id="section2-1062860612465066">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Categorical variables are expressed as numbers and percentages, whereas continuous variables are expressed as means. The χ<sup>2</sup> test was used to measure associations for categorical variables and to describe the relationship between heart failure performance variables and the dependent variable (readmission rate). Statistical significance was determined by a <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05. The crude rate of readmissions was calculated by dividing the number of 30-day readmissions by the total number of heart failure admissions during the specified time interval. Composite performance measures were calculated using a linear combinations method with each core measure weighted similarly. Appropriate care measure scores were calculated for each of the 4 core measures. Statistical calculations were done using Epi Info program version 3.5.1 (Statcalc, Epi Info 2008, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA).</p>

<sec id="section3-1062860612465066" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>There were 6063 patients admitted for heart failure between December 2001 and December 2008. During this time 19.6% (1191) of the patients were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. The average age of patients was 77.4 years. Females comprised 52.6% (3185) of the study patient population. Two thirds (76.80%) of the study population had hypertension (4651), while 74.0% (4481) had coronary artery disease. Another 74.0% (4481) of the study population had a history of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA). Patients with a history of peripheral atrial disease comprised 70.3% (4257) of the study population. Patients with a history of diabetes comprised 73.8% of the total CHF admissions.</p>
<sec id="section4-1062860612465066">
<title>Readmissions</title>
<p>There was a 47.6% relative increase in the number of readmissions for heart failure over the study time frame. The average length of hospital stay of patients admitted for CHF was 5.8 days (standard deviation = 4.2 days) with a maximum stay of 59 days. During the same time frame, the compliance rate for all 4 heart failure core measures had a relative increase of 11.5%. There was poor correlation between compliance to all the 4 core measures and readmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1062860612465066">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section5-1062860612465066">
<title>Performance Measures</title>
<p>Although the general trend was overall improvement in all the performance measures over time, the smoking cessation core measure and ACEI use achieved 100% compliance. The compliance rate for the left ventricular assessment core measure was 99.8%. However, the core measure of discharge instruction (at time of discharge) ranked the lowest at 77.6% at the beginning of the study but improved to achieve 100% over the course of the study. The appropriate care scores shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1062860612465066">Figure 2</xref> paralleled the increase in adherence to the 4 compliance measures during the study period.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Performance measures and heart failure readmissions have been used as surrogate markers for quality of care for patients with heart failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612465066">9</xref></sup> Third-party payers and other health care quality monitoring agencies, such as CMS and the Joint Commission, have used the scorecards from these measures to rate hospitals and individual practitioners on the quality of care they deliver for in heart failure. Furthermore, these scorecards are publicly reported to guide health care consumers in the decision-making process regarding their health care choices. These scorecards also have been used in pay- for-performance initiatives to encourage quality of care in heart failure patients. Notwithstanding this, the role of adherence to these performance measures in reducing readmissions has not been substantiated in scientific studies. Furthermore, the clinical guidelines that form the basis of these performance measures are heavily weighted with consensus expert opinion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612465066">10</xref></sup> In one study, it was found that only 22% of the heart failure guidelines were based on evidence from multiple clinical trials and/or meta-analysis (Level of Evidence: A).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612465066">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Readmission to the hospital is influenced by a multiplicity of factors, some of which are socioeconomic. Philbin et al reported that low socioeconomic status is related to increased readmissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612465066">12</xref></sup> Patient compliance to treatment outlined by health care providers has been shown to influence readmissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612465066">13</xref></sup> Presence of comorbid conditions (eg, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases) may have a negative impact on heart failure readmissions. In the current study, overall adherence to all 4 performance measures had no impact on the rate of 30-day readmissions to the hospital. Left ventricular function assessment, however, was associated with reduced readmissions. This finding is in line with a recent study by Schopfer et al, who reported that left ventricular function assessment was associated with 30-day readmissions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612465066">14</xref></sup> Interestingly, they also found that smoking cessation counseling was associated with reduced 30-day readmissions. They also reported that outcomes for heart failure patients were more closely associated with hospital volume and socioeconomic factors than with compliance to heart failure performance measures.</p>
<p>The independent relationship of heart failure performance measures and readmission rate can be attributed to the heterogeneity of the factors that influence readmissions to the hospital. Philbin and colleagues also reported a dependent relationship between a patient’s clinical and demographic characteristics and readmissions to the hospital. Patients of a lower socioeconomic class were more likely to be readmitted for heart failure than patients of a higher socioeconomic background.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612465066">12</xref></sup> Furthermore, Philbin et al did not show any correlation between adherence to heart failure performance measures and readmissions. However, Chung and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612465066">15</xref></sup> showed that adherence to heart failure performance measures reduced all-cause heart failure readmissions to the hospital, although their sample size was small (196 patients) and the duration of the study was only 6 months. In the current study, however, there was no significant association between adherence to heart failure performance measures and 30-day hospital readmission rates.</p>
<p>Importantly, the authors do not feel that documentation of compliance to 2 of the 4 core measures (providing discharge instructions and smoking cessation counseling) provides meaningful information about quality of care for heart failure patients. The current findings are in line with the retirement of these 2 measures in the recent (2011) American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association/American Medical Association-Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement (ACCF/AHA/AMA-PCPI) performance measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612465066">16</xref></sup> Some authors have criticized the checkbox mentality of heart failure performance measures, arguing that merely checking a box for a particular performance measure does not translate to quality of care. For instance, documentation of ACEIs at discharge does not imply evidence-based practice and optimal dosage usage of these drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1062860612465066">17</xref></sup> Luzier et al reported that most patients discharged on ACEIs were not on appropriate dosages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612465066">18</xref></sup> The updated 2011 ACCF/AHA/AMA-PCPI performance measures guidelines have proposed some new metric measurements for inpatients with heart failure at discharge, including patient follow-up appointment, symptom management plan, discussion about an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (if appropriate), and specific beta-blocker therapy for patients with left ejection fraction less than 40%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612465066">16</xref></sup> These guidelines do not yet conform to the CMS or Joint Commission guidelines that are publicly reportable.</p>
<sec id="section11-1062860612465066">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One overarching limitation is that this is a retrospective study; hence, the myriad etiological factors responsible for readmissions in heart failure patients could not be controlled for. For instance, patient compliance with medications is a common cause of heart failure exacerbations that can directly affect readmission. The readmission rates reported could be an underestimation as heart failure readmissions outside the health network could not be accounted for. This study used existing administrative data to make inferences about the relationship between performance measures and readmissions. Finally, using ICD-related codes and administrative data has inherent limitations related to mislabeling of codes, which could adversely affect the quality of the data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1062860612465066">19</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The authors found no correlation between a hospital’s adherence to heart failure performance measures and 30-day readmission rates. There was a statistically significant relationship between the lack of left ventricular assessment and readmission rate. There also was a trend toward reduced readmissions for patients on ACEIs, although the results were not statistically significant. Left ventricular function assessment may guide the type of therapy for heart failure patients in that patients with low ejection fraction may be started on evidence-based therapies known to improve outcomes. More studies should be conducted to address the relationship between the current heart failure performance measures and how they relate to quality and outcomes of care for heart failure patients.</p>
<p>Studies also should address current performance measures and whether they should continue to be used as surrogate indicators of the quality of care and how these measures affect clinical outcomes. The fact that adherence to these core measures will be tied to reimbursements for hospitals necessitates adopting measures that are robust for measuring clinical outcomes. More studies should focus on comparative effectiveness research in heart failure patients to identify the most cost-effective measures with the highest clinical benefits.</p>
