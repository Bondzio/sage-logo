<p>This article begins by acknowledging the general worry that scholarship in the humanities lacks the rigor and objectivity of other scholarly fields. In considering the validity of that criticism, I distinguish two models of learning: the covering law model exemplified by the natural sciences, and the model of rooted particularity that characterizes the humanities. With those two models set forth, I defend the humanities against the general challenge of lack of rigor by showing how objective standards of evaluation are to be understood within the particularity model. I then discuss the distinct benefits offered by that model of learning and conclude by showing how the skills and temperament associated with that model can be usefully deployed to illuminate Conrad’s <italic>Heart of Darkness</italic>.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1474022212441770"><title>An unstated worry</title>
<p><sc>Skepticism about the value of the humanities</sc> has many causes. Among them is surely the fact of increased demands (fueled by the steep cost of higher education) for assessment and accountability, of the sort humanists tend to resist because of the difficulties in measuring progress in the humanities through easily gathered data. In addition, the very idiom of ‘constructing knowledge’, so common across college campuses today, carries the suggestion of knowledge built according to a blueprint, through the creation of discrete and visible sequential levels with which one ascends ever higher, and so reflects a notion of learning that may not be ideally suited to the humanities. And, of course, grim economic realities in the United States and elsewhere increasingly make the pursuit of the humanities – reading novels, studying paintings, learning about the world’s religions, and so on – seem a relative luxury, a reasonable pursuit once one has learned a marketable skill that ensures economic productivity, but certainly not the first order of business.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1474022212441770">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Without downplaying the influence of such factors, I believe that a good deal of skepticism towards the humanities reflects another concern that is rarely expressed openly but is for that reason more threatening and more difficult to counter. I have in mind the worry that the humanities are somehow not as rigorous as other areas of inquiry and that humanistic study is not subject to clear criteria for success in the way that characterizes other fields. To those who harbor such concerns, study in the humanities more closely resembles pleasant conversation among those with like interests, marked by few clear evaluative standards, and so contrasts with more demanding fields of study populated by scholars whose command of a specific and recondite body of knowledge firmly distinguishes them from the general public.</p>
<p>In this article I take as my point of departure this conception of the humanities and show that, though rooted in a genuine and important distinction between humanistic learning and other kinds of inquiry, it rests on an impoverished conception of intellectual and cognitive growth, one that overlooks certain aspects of human understanding that are especially vital as we navigate our lives both individually and collectively. The crux of my argument will be that the humanities offers an unmatched opportunity to develop skills connected to the exercise of responsible judgment that is critical in the sort of mature, reflective persons that education aims to create. I do not claim that this is the only or most important good that study in the humanities offers, and other articles in this journal well attest to the range of those benefits. The idea of responsible judgment that I stress here is offered only as one among a range of such considerations, though one that is, I believe, unduly neglected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1474022212441770"><title>Two models of learning</title>
<p>Let me begin by contrasting, in admittedly stylized and overdrawn fashion, two models of learning. The first I shall call the covering law model. This model construes learning as a matter of developing greater familiarity with, and command of, general principles that explain more and more discrete phenomena. For example, on this model one might move from uncertainty about the reproductive processes of a certain animal to a clearer grasp of the principles explaining how those processes work in that animal; from there to the identification of still more general principles explaining how such processes work within a certain class of animals; and so on. Central to the expansion of such principles in the covering law model (and so central in the move to greater knowledge as conceived within that model) is the movement from the particular to the universal, from the concrete case to knowledge of a broader principle covering that object or event and explaining those aspects whose workings had been unclear. The identification of such general principles is, in the popular consciousness, the purpose of the ‘scientific method’, which imagines researchers running highly controlled experiments with the aim of deriving data that would allow them to articulate broad principles explaining both the particular data and (the real payoff) relevantly similar occurrences everywhere. We might say, then, that the goal of this model is to subtract from the particular object or event whatever marks it as solitary and unique and to identify common features and properties it shares with other similar objects or events, thereby bringing more of the world into a rational ordering. The covering law model is thus ultimately concerned not with the particular thing in itself but with the truth about that particular which it shares with others like it.</p>
<p>The second approach to learning I call the model of rooted particularity. This model does not engage the particular chiefly to uncover ever more general principles that will explain a greater number of similar phenomena, nor does it conceive of advances in understanding in terms of possessing more general laws of greater explanatory power. Instead, for it the purpose of engaging with the particular lies in achieving better understanding of the object itself, which necessarily involves attending to its distinct aspects in a manner that does not subsume them under more general explanatory principles. To be sure, the humanities do engage with the universal – their importance in large part derives from doing just that – but this is because the objects they study engage with issues of universal import: our confrontation with mortality, the fragility of love, our capacity for loyalty and betrayal, the problem of suffering, and so on. But universal subsuming principles are of little help in explaining the impact or value of such works. (The greatness of the<italic> Iliad</italic> is not illuminated by noting that it exemplifies the destructive logic of violent conflict; the power of Manet’s <italic>Olympia</italic> is not explained by noting that it reflects the corrupting combination of sex and commerce.) The value of the particular lies not in revealing a general principle of universal import, but rather in concretizing such ideas and engaging our keen interest in a way that demands that we pay attention to the particulars. This is especially important because in our lives we never confront the horror of war <italic>as such</italic>, the debasement of sexuality <italic>as such</italic>, but instead encounter such things always in particular ways, with particular emphases, distinctions, and saliencies that call for specific individuated responses.</p>
<p>We can sum up the contrast thus. In the covering law model, the particular thing studied is of value chiefly insofar as it points to something beyond it; the point of engaging with the particular object or event is to gain knowledge of which the particular is an (in principle replaceable) instance. In the model of rooted particularity, the value of engaging the object lies not in arriving at some general principle that subsumes and orders that object and others relevantly like it, but instead in gaining greater clarity through experience of that particular thing, conveyed precisely and only through that object itself.</p>
<p>To be clear, these two models are ideal types; there are no doubt approaches to learning that combine features of both, and others that proceed in quite different ways. The study of history, for example, can profitably be carried out with an emphasis on either model, while the currently voguish model of service learning seems not to match neatly with either one. Still, the overall contrast is broadly familiar and maps onto approaches in higher learning in what I hope are recognizable ways. The covering law model is far more apt as a characterization of work in the natural sciences, while the rooted particularity model fits closely much of the work in the humanities. The social sciences can be carried out with an emphasis on either model, a fact that explains not only why a field like history is sometimes grouped within the humanities and sometimes with the social sciences, but also why some social scientists view themselves as more akin to humanists, others as more like natural scientists.</p>
<p>I have no wish to defend the superiority of one model over the other, and any such attempt seems to me deeply wrong-headed. Each model is no doubt appropriate in different contexts, depending on such things as the nature of the phenomenon to be understood, our reasons for engaging with it, and the specific difficulties that threaten clear understanding. The world of things worth knowing and skills worth having is, happily, vast. My goal here is instead to sketch some of the benefits especially attached to the rooted particularity model which strongly characterizes the humanities. This task seems especially important given two important questions raised by the contrast between the two models I have outlined. First, what benefits are offered through study in the rooted particular model? The covering law model yields general principles ordering aspects of the world that had previously appeared disconnected, creating a unified and growing body of knowledge and at the same time helping us navigate that world more effectively. What is gained through the study of the rooted particular? Second, how should we understand not just the authority of the claims made by humanists with respect to the particular objects they study, but also the general criteria of correctness within that model? Since the claims advanced within debates in the humanities are neither derivable from nor vindicated by the sort of general principles the covering law model generates, what makes any such claims better than any others? My ultimate interest here is in addressing the first question, but since my answer hinges upon a clear grasp of the standards of appraisal that characterize the humanities, I will begin with the second.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1474022212441770"><title>Criteria of correctness</title>
<p>It is no secret that many outside the humanities (and some within) harbor genuine doubts that there exist legitimate standards qualifying good work within its fields of study. The widely publicized Sokal hoax of 1996 (in which an intentionally ludicrous paper on physics was accepted by a cultural studies journal that embraced its impenetrability, highly complicated jargon, and left-wing leanings) was to many an object lesson in the contrast between the humanities’ subjectivism, susceptibility to ideological manipulation, and penchant for linguistic bombast on the one hand, and the clear standards of inquiry, objectivity, and accuracy to the things themselves that characterize a legitimate field of knowledge like physics on the other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1474022212441770">2</xref></sup> The image of contagion – as tropes of the humanities seeped into a hard science – sprang readily to mind, and the event garnered the publicity it did because it confirmed a widespread sense that the humanities broadly lack the clear and compelling criteria of success that characterize the sciences.</p>
<p>I think no defense of the humanities can succeed without confronting this challenge and explicating how objective criteria get a foothold in the humanities. Some of this work Jonathan Jacobs carries out very well in his article printed in this issue, and I shall not repeat those arguments. Instead, I shall offer somewhat different considerations that, I hope, further confirm Jacobs’ points from a somewhat different direction.</p>
<p>One fruitful way to think about increased understanding in the humanities is by analogy with broader instances of careful discrimination that all of us experience in diverse areas of our lives. Take three such contexts: fine cuisine, athletic prowess in a sport, and home decor. In each domain we recognize some people as better at making qualitative judgments and decisions than others. They are persons who have been engaged in that task for some extended period of time and who have, through close observation of others already attuned to the relevant qualitative features, developed their capacity for discernment and an implicit fluency with the standards of excellence appropriate to that domain. It is because one has sampled so much high cuisine, and been encouraged to see how the cinnamon brings out the spice, that one can make especially sharp distinctions among dishes that others simply don’t see; because one has been watching soccer for years, alongside others who have taught one to look for the deftness of the player’s first touch on the ball, that one sees so quickly the extraordinary quality of the new 18-year-old signing; because one has learned to understand how colors, form, and texture contribute to a pleasing visual experience while promoting ease of human use that one can better assess various ways of arranging interior space; and so on.</p>
<p>We often describe such improvements in understanding as an increased ability to appreciate what is before us, and the idea of appreciation is especially apt here, as it captures not just the enjoyment that can be derived from making positive evaluative judgments of value but also the broader ability to make such judgments at all. The philosopher David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474022212441770">McNaughton (1988)</xref> has discussed the development of this ability in the context of aesthetic receptivity, and his account nicely illuminates the central features involved. Says McNaughton, ‘Someone can fail to notice on first encounter aspects of a painting or a piece of music which, perhaps after repeated study, later become apparent. The natural and almost irresistible conclusion is that he has developed a fuller and livelier appreciation of the work by coming to see or hear more clearly what was always there, waiting to be noticed’ (1988: 58). It is through developing this capacity for appreciation, McNaughton notes, that we learn how to justify and assess evaluative claims about a work of art. We do so, he says, by bringing another
<disp-quote>
<p>to see or hear it the way you do. That would involve getting him to pay more careful attention to the work by pointing out salient features and giving him hints as to how to approach it. This may be the work of a moment . . . It is more likely, however, that the process will take time, and success may come only after a long period of training. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474022212441770">McNaughton, 1988</xref>: 58)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>(To see the idea, consider the contrast between an aficionado of modern jazz and someone who hears in it only a confusion of noise.) As a result of such exposure, says McNaughton, one develops the ‘ability to discriminate what was there in the music all along’ (1988: 58). This amounts to a genuine cognitive change, an increase in what one now understands. While McNaughton concentrates on the aesthetic domain (and then extends the point to moral judgment generally), his account applies as well to the general case of learning to exercise the sort of intelligent judgment that picks out relevant evaluative features in any domain, and which characterizes our lives generally.</p>
<p>Skeptics who believe that only the covering law model generates truly objective standards of assessment might still demand a list of propositions demonstrating the alleged increase in knowledge that has resulted from the encounter with rooted particulars. Here we do well to recognize a distinction, stressed by Joseph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474022212441770">Raz (2003</xref>), between two cognitive states: knowledge and understanding. Raz contrasts John, an expert on the train’s timetable who can answer any question relating to arrivals and departures, with Jane, who has an unerring ability to know which wines to pair with which foods. Jane, we want to say, is a good judge of wines; John is not a good judge of train times. But surely both possess genuine cognitive powers that distinguish them from others. The difference is that John’s can be cashed out through a list of discrete and listable facts, whereas Jane’s is in large part implicit and harder to capture in principles that can be formulated with any level of specificity.</p>
<p>Here the skeptic can, of course, simply dig in his heels and insist that there is nothing for Jane to understand better or worse: it is just not the case that some wines do in fact go better with certain foods than others, that some novels really are better than others, that certain interpretations are more plausible than others, and so on. Against such skepticism stands the plain fact that all of us continually and confidently make such judgments and defend them with good reasons, not just in the domain of the humanities but, as I suggested above, in various aspects of our lives. One can thus maintain such strong skepticism only by rejecting the many social practices of evaluation without which our lives would be unrecognizable. The sort of understanding that the humanities promote, I am suggesting, is distinct from other cognitive domains not in being more subjective or involving the mere projection of incorrigible reactions, but because the cognitive gains that mark it are not captured in formal principles that can be deployed to subsume particulars. Instead they consist in letting the particular speak and being responsive to what it says.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1474022212441770"><title>The value of rooted particularity</title>
<p>Having sketched a picture explaining our ability to adjudicate more- or less-well-grounded claims in the humanities, I can move fairly quickly in explaining the value of this sort of education. I will forgo the fact (no less important for being obvious) that engagement with complex and careful expressions of the human creative spirit is an intrinsically valuable activity. Instead, I want to stress the close connection between the sort of education offered by the model of rooted particularity and the challenges that confront human beings as we respond to the world in our capacity as practical agents. Defenders of the humanities sometimes claim, in a fashion that constitutes little more than argumentative hand-waving, that the humanities encourage a degree of reflectiveness that helps us engage more mindfully in the world. Here I shall try to explain in more detail precisely what that reflectiveness involves and how study in the humanities can advance it.</p>
<p>As responsible agents in the world, human beings face two major challenges: figuring out what to do, and getting ourselves to do it. The second depends on such factors as our relative strength of will, diligence and focus, ability to resist corrupting influences, and so on. And while some might make the argument, I see no reason for thinking that study in the humanities should help even a jot in dealing with this second challenge and so shall say no more about it here. The first, figuring out what to do, itself raises two kinds of questions. To begin with, there is the question of what we must do now to get us the end we require. We need to stop the spread of illness, but how? We need to get potable water from here to there, but how? And so on. Such questions largely involve navigating our world successfully and acting on it in ways that will bring practical success, and in this context especially the covering law model, with its emphasis on general principles that provide a rational accounting of ever greater parts of the world, is often indispensable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1474022212441770">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The other question that can arise in figuring out what to do occurs at a prior stage of deliberation. Here the question is not, how do we bring about the end we know we want? It is instead, what is the end we should be trying to bring about? It is with respect to this second question, I believe, that the conception of learning embodied in the rooted particularity model can be especially helpful. The reason for this has to do with a view about the particular challenges confronting mature moral agents that is, I hope, both familiar and uncontroversial. The most important occasions where we find ourselves uncertain what to do are cases where we are faced with competing principles each of which individually makes some strong prima facie claim on us. This is true at both the individual and collective levels (i.e. both personally and politically). We are torn between the claims of a dear friend and our institutional responsibilities, for example, or we wish to improve overall economic efficiency but at the same time to minister to the least well-off. Such cases are the most challenging practical dilemmas we face because each of the rival principles at play has a strong claim to our allegiance.</p>
<p>If this is broadly right, then those who can navigate such instances well will be distinguished not by their possessing an especially large set of general principles, but rather by their ability to exercise careful judgment across competing principles in a particular case. Sticking with the example just given from the personal realm, the sort of judgment involved will require careful attentiveness not to the general facts that one claim comes from a friend and the other from my involvement in some institution, but to the particular details that arise in this case. Who is this friend? How long have I known her? Has she made sacrifices for me? How urgent is her interest? And so on. And similarly with respect to the institution in question. How important is it? To what degree is my involvement with it voluntary? Will it be damaged by attending to my friend’s claim? And so on. It is clear that I cannot resolve my predicament by appealing to a general covering principle, the application of which entails what I should do, and even if I were able to construct such a principle, it would necessarily make reference to so much that is distinct in this situation as to be largely irrelevant to other situations I encounter (which is to say, it will be no general principle at all). Instead, what I must do is weigh these various considerations with a nuanced sensitivity to the strength each particular feature carries in this particular case, in the hope that I can register appropriately the force of these competing considerations. We thus reach the critical question facing this argument for the value of the humanities: is the rooted particularity model likely to help develop such sensitivity?</p>
<p>There are several reasons to think the answer is yes. The first and most important has to do with the way in which the rooted particularity model broadly discounts the ultimate explanatory value of general principles (which, as noted above, never by themselves justify evaluative judgments of the objects encountered within that model). The activities of forming and defending judgments within that model encourage one to display, then, precisely the suppleness in reasoning and judgment that I have suggested is vital for human beings as they move through a world of practical challenges. Such an education also helps guard against simplistic approaches to practical deliberation that would take refuge in an immature rule-worship insensitive to the shifting weight that complicating particulars might carry in any such challenges. In addition, the kinds of discussion that occur within the rooted particularity model, which often reveal how multiple competing answers contain a part of the truth (Macbeth is monstrous but somehow sympathetic; he is someone we reject but in some ways strive to emulate; his ambition is at once foreign to us and disquietingly familiar), help facilitate an awareness of the complex and not always reconcilable considerations relevant to the many judgments we must make. Indeed, such discussion often makes clear that, even where one view wins out on the whole as correct, the competing considerations are not thereby shown to be nugatory. They are simply outweighed in this instance, though they may be decisive when conjoined with different considerations in another. Finally, the requirement of attentiveness to diverse and sometimes competing considerations can help impede the dogmatism and narrow-mindedness that often block appropriate responsiveness, especially to that which is unfamiliar, threatening, or strange.</p>
<p>None of these considerations would be as valuable as each is if the challenges of responsible agency could be met through the simple application of some covering principle entailing a single correct response, but I have argued that the task of being a mature agent is not discharged that way. To the degree that in moving through the world we face the kind of challenge I have described, then, the training offered by the rooted particularity model, and the habits of mind it engenders, can be especially important.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1474022212441770"><title>Case study: <italic>Heart of Darkness</italic></title>
<p>My comments to this point have been fairly abstract. To help make them more concrete, I shall close with a discussion of Joseph Conrad’s <italic>Heart of Darkness</italic>, a work that both (1) exemplifies how study in the humanities can generate and sustain the capacities I have been stressing, and (2) directly engages with the main concerns of this article. Now, to be sure, Conrad’s novella touches on a range of important issues that have justly received wide critical attention – European colonialism, gender relations, the relative value of truth and illusions, and the idea of authenticity, to name a few. In this closing section I shall concentrate on a relatively neglected theme of the book that connects to the guiding idea of my argument, namely the value and role of moral principles in cases where agents face difficult judgments about what to do. I shall try to show that the overall trajectory of <italic>Heart of Darkness</italic> tells the story of Marlow’s coming to grasp the futility of navigating practical challenges by means of universal principles and so the inescapable role played by responsible judgment.</p>
<p>The importance of this theme comes across at various points in the book. Most obviously, Marlow twice in his narrative expresses strong doubts about how far moral principles can effectively constrain our behavior. First, talking about the difficulties Europeans face in resisting what could seem the siren call to give in to their natural impulses, Marlow says that successful resistance hinges on a man’s meeting that temptation ‘with his own true stuff – with his own inborn strength. Principles? Principles won’t do. Acquisitions, clothes, pretty rags – rags that would fly off at the first good shake’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474022212441770">Conrad, 1995</xref>: 43). And several pages later, wondering how his African boatmen are able to restrain themselves from devouring their passengers given their great hunger, he opines that when it comes to resisting hunger, ‘superstitions, beliefs, and what you may call principles . . . are less than chaff in a breeze’ (50). Set aside Marlow’s masculine bias in the first passage, his dubious assumptions about his African companions in the second. What is worth noting in both is Marlow’s direct reflection on the place of general principles in navigating the moral challenges that life presents and his confident, twice-avowed skepticism about the usefulness of moral principles in such instances.</p>
<p>At the same time that he rejects the importance of principles, however, Marlow to the end remains committed to the authority and centrality of moral norms. He declares that it was the ‘moral victory’ in Kurtz’s dying words that won him Marlow’s loyalty ‘to the last’, and his endorsement of the need for morality is further confirmed as the book, nearing its conclusion, brings into ever sharper contrast the unscrupulous manager of the company, motivated only by the coldest concern with profit, and the character of Kurtz, who despite having succumbed to what remain ‘unspeakable rites’ nevertheless was motivated originally by genuine moral zeal. The manager repudiates moral ideals entirely; Kurtz stands as the shell of a man originally formed entirely by his commitment to them. Marlow signals his repudiation of the manager’s approach, and his alignment with Kurtz, when he announces, after a conclusive quarrel with the manager, ‘I turned mentally to Kurtz for relief – positively for relief’ (76).</p>
<p>Bringing these two ideas together lets us see the point about morality that Conrad is making through the spiritual journey Marlow undergoes. At the same time that we cannot ignore Marlow’s unequivocal rejection of the usefulness of moral principles (‘less than chaff in the breeze’), we also clearly see him endorsing the ongoing importance of both moral assessment and the constraints of morality. From this it follows that Marlow’s position must be that we should conceive of moral deliberation, and morality’s structure generally, as consisting not primarily in fixed principles that have the scope of covering law but instead as requiring more contextual judgments sensitive always to the changing nature of particular circumstances.</p>
<p>Precisely this idea, I suggest, is illustrated in the critical final scene of the book, where Marlow encounters Kurtz’s ‘Intended’ back in Brussels. The centrality of this scene within the novella as a whole Conrad attested to in a letter to his publisher, declaring that ‘in the light of the final incident, the whole story in all its descriptive detail shall fall into its place – acquire its value and significance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474022212441770">Kimbrough, 1988</xref>: 210). What then is revealed in this scene? The answer hinges on its pivotal moment, Marlow’s lie to the Intended and his declaration that Kurtz’s last words were her name rather than Kurtz’s summary judgment of his own moral corruption, ‘The horror!’ Several explanations can be given for Marlow’s behavior here, and the lie may be overdetermined, but the most persuasive reading, powerfully advanced by Juliet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474022212441770">McLauchlan (1983</xref>), is that Marlow lies because he realizes how fragile is morality’s hold over us and hopes that maintaining the image of Kurtz as a man unswervingly faithful to his moral norms might shore up its claims to authority. The alternative – i.e. revealing the ease with which even the most apparently admirable man can slough off moral constraints – would, Marlow allows, ‘have been too dark – too dark altogether’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474022212441770">Conrad, 1995</xref>: 95).</p>
<p>This important work of confirming morality’s authority, however, involves Marlow in precisely the sort of action that, as Conrad has carefully established, is deeply at odds with one of the central principles to which Marlow himself had declared his allegiance. Earlier in the book Marlow has gone out of his way to make clear his repugnance to lying, declaring ‘I hate, detest, and can’t bear a lie, not because I am straighter than the rest of us, but simply because it appalls me. There is a taint of death, a flavor of mortality in lies’ (32). So as Marlow comes to accept the lie as part of necessary work in the service of morality, the reader too comes to see that at moments of moral complexity the right thing to do is determined not by simple adherence to some covering law principle like ‘never tell a lie’, but by weighing our commitment to such prima facie principles against other competing considerations in the moment. The final scene, I am suggesting, thus confirms with finality – for both Marlow and the reader – the frequent uselessness of principles’ insight as we struggle to be responsible moral agents, and the urgency on such occasions of our exercising careful judgment attuned to the diverse considerations that no single principle can encompass.</p>
<p>It is nearly impossible to engage students with a text like <italic>Heart of Darkness </italic>without grappling in some substantial way with the complexities it raises. Was Marlow right to lie to the Intended? Why should we side with Kurtz against the manager? Is Kurtz’s initial moral zeal somehow corrupt from the outset? And so on. The fact that such questions so easily engage our passions, and that works in the humanities generally so frequently engender strong affective responses, just makes our engagement with such issues all the more influential on the development of our character. Here, however, I should take pains to be clear about the ambitions of the argument I am making. I am not claiming, as defenders of the humanities are sometimes wont to, that humanistic study works inevitably to improve all students’ abilities to see themselves and one another more fully, in a manner that inevitably constitutes cognitive advancement. Would that were so; I fear there is nothing inevitable about any of this. But a weaker claim may still be good enough. The more students are asked to attend to the particulars of any complicated evaluative judgment (I have been stressing the realm of moral evaluation, but such evaluations will arise on many other axes: the beauty of a composition, the degree to which a literary figure is heroic, the meaning and value of unfamiliar religious practices and traditions, and so on), the more they can be expected to make similar discriminations in other contexts. The plausibility of this claim, it should be noted, holds for both models of learning I have discussed and so does not assume a position on the relative merits of either. After all, if we did not think that exposure to any such model might usefully inform our students’ practice after the semester was over, it would be hard to see why we should bother helping them develop facility with these models rather than just presenting them with conclusions reached by experts.</p>
<p>The case for the humanities I am advancing, then, stands or falls on the appeal of two ideas. The first is the value of being a responsible and reflective person, capable of making judgments that involve careful responsiveness to considerations that always outrun our general principles. The second is that the mode of engagement with particular objects promoted by the humanities is likely to be especially helpful in enhancing one’s ability to become such a person. Nothing I have said is meant to suggest that persons can develop such traits only through study in the humanities, and I see no reason to endorse that thesis. But I have tried to give reasons for thinking that such an education can play a uniquely valuable role in this process, and in doing so to provide yet more solid ground for the importance of this distinct mode of understanding and inquiry.</p>

<fn id="fn1-1474022212441770"><label>1</label><p>Cf. Bill Gates’ comments, as quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022212441770">Kolowich (2011</xref>). ‘In the college area, everybody should have a sense of which of the colleges – both community and four-year institutions – are doing very well [i.e. in terms of job creation]. You can even break that down by the departments. It’s actually very interesting when you take higher ed and think of it in that way. The amount of subsidization [by the state] is not that well-correlated to the areas that actually create jobs in the state – that create income for the state.’ </p></fn>
<fn id="fn2-1474022212441770"><label>2</label><p><italic>Social Text</italic> is not, I realize, a journal squarely located within the humanities. But its embrace of the sort of theory that now characterizes much work in the humanities explains why the incident confirmed to many the idea that standards of scholarship in the humanities and its related fields had gone off the rails.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn3-1474022212441770"><label>3</label><p>In stressing the pragmatic value of the knowledge generated by so much work within the covering law model, I do not mean to deny that scholars working within that model are often strongly motivated both by the intrinsic desire to know or by the intrinsic pleasure that such inquiry and knowledge can provide. But I stress here the pragmatic benefits because they so powerfully justify such inquiry in the minds of the general public.</p></fn></fn-group></notes>
