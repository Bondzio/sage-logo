<abstract>
<p>Circadian rhythms are endogenous self-sustained oscillations with 24-hour periods that regulate diverse physiological and metabolic processes through complex gene regulation by “clock” transcription factors. The oral cavity is bathed by saliva, and its amount and content are modified within regular daily intervals. The clock mechanisms that control salivary production remain unclear. Our objective was to evaluate the expression and periodicity of clock genes in salivary glands. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, and immunohistochemistry were performed to show circadian mRNA and protein expression and localization of key clock genes (<italic>Bmal1, Clock, Per1</italic>, and <italic>Per2</italic>), ion and aqua channel genes (<italic>Ae2a, Car2</italic>, and <italic>Aqp5</italic>), and salivary gland markers. Clock gene mRNAs and clock proteins were found differentially expressed in the serous acini and duct cells of all major salivary glands. The expression levels of clock genes and <italic>Aqp5</italic> showed regular oscillatory patterns under both light/dark and complete-dark conditions. <italic>Bmla1</italic> overexpression resulted in increased <italic>Aqp5</italic> expression levels. Analysis of our data suggests that salivary glands have a peripheral clock mechanism that functions both in normal light/dark conditions and in the absence of light. This finding may increase our understanding of the control mechanisms of salivary content and flow.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The oral cavity has a moist environment due to saliva, which is secreted from numerous major and minor glands in the oral cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022034512451450">Tucker and Miletich, 2010</xref>). The major, parotid, sublingual, and submandibular salivary glands (SGs) normally contribute over 90% of the total volume of unstimulated saliva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512451450">Edgar, 1990</xref>). SGs contain several cell types, including acinar cells, which are responsible for water and protein secretion, myoepithelial cells surrounding the acini and ducts, and ductal cells, which modulate the composition of the saliva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512451450">Gresik, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512451450">Denny <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Saliva contains numerous enzymes, hormones, growth factors, immunoglobulins, and many other active molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512451450">Dawes, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512451450">Levine, 1993</xref>). It has been shown that salivary flow rate follows circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512451450">Dawes, 1972</xref>). The secretion levels of salivary substances also follow circadian rhythms, which seem to be important for effective nutrition and self-defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512451450">Dawes, 1974</xref>). These studies suggest that the SGs may contain a circadian clock to regulate the type, amount, and content of saliva. Indeed, the existence of such a clock mechanism has been demonstrated for other vital organs such as the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512451450">Stow and Gumz, 2011</xref>). SGs and kidneys share physiological mechanisms involving a multitude of ion and water channels. Several genes that regulate fluid movement are highly expressed in both kidneys and SGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512451450">Takata <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512451450">Maeda <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control circadian saliva production and secretion. This study was undertaken to fill this important scientific gap.</p>
<p>A circadian clock is regulated by differential daily expression of 20 transcription factors called clock genes. There is a central clock in the brain and several peripheral clocks that can also act independently of the central clock. The central clock is composed of about 20,000 neurons, all of which express clock genes that oscillate in synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022034512451450">Welsh <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512451450">Ikeda, 2004</xref>). Clock genes are defined by a set of criteria that include rhythm in activity or amount as well as molecular evidence of a feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022034512451450">Williams and Sehgal, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512451450">Myers <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Clock genes transmit output signals that drive rhythms of gene expression in central and peripheral tissues. The most direct mechanism by which clock genes drive circadian gene expression is through regulation of promoter activity of clock-controlled genes. Clock genes can also indirectly drive circadian gene expression through regulation of promoter activity of clock-controlled genes, which in turn regulate the transcription of downstream genes at specific daily times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512451450">Kondratov <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Very recently, clock genes have begun to be discovered as key regulators of several diverse diseases, including cancer and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512451450">Krugluger <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512451450">Mostafaie <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512451450">Marcheva <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022034512451450">Xia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512451450">Shimba <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Saliva plays numerous protective roles for oral tissues maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512451450">Mandel, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512451450">Dowd, 1999</xref>). Adequate salivary flow and saliva content are directly related to health status. In contrast, reduced salivary flow rate is an indicator of xerostomia, which may be caused by SG disorders, such as Sjögren’s syndrome, and chronic sialoadenitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512451450">Daniels and Fox, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512451450">Mese and Matsuo, 2007</xref>). Reduced salivary flow is also found in cases of sialolithiasis, due to blockage of the ducts, and in post-radiation head and neck cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512451450">Rice, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512451450">Mese and Matsuo, 2007</xref>). Many aspects of the biological mechanisms that result in xerostomia remain unclear. Regardless of the cause, patients with hyposalivation suffer from difficulties with swallowing and food mastication, dental caries, hampered speech, impaired taste, and nocturnal oral discomfort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022034512451450">Vissink <italic>et al</italic>., 2003a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022034512451450">b</xref>). Our study aims to increase understanding on how clock genes affect salivary flow rates and content. This knowledge may be applied in the future toward a better understanding of salivary gland physiology.</p>

<title>Materials &amp; Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0022034512451450">
<title>Animals and Circadian Experiments</title>
<p>Male C57BL/6J mice (from 8 to 12 wks of age) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Only male mice were used, to minimize potential sex-related differences in hormonal differences over circadian rhythms. The animal use was approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of the University of Michigan. For circadian experiments, all time interval calculations were based on the indicated zeitgeber (ZT, an event that provides the settings for a biological clock), and 6:00 a.m. was considered ZT 0 (detailed in the Appendix).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022034512451450">
<title>Human Tissues</title>
<p>Samples of human salivary glands were obtained from patients of the University of Michigan Hospital (Ann Arbor, USA) with prior signed informed consent form. All the material used for this study was collected from biopsies necessary for the diagnosis of salivary gland pathologies. The study was conducted in accordance with IRB regulations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022034512451450">
<title>RNA Isolation and RT-PCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated from freshly excised submandibular SGs and kidney tissues at the same time-point, with the use of TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and a 2-µg quantity of RNA was reverse-transcribed with TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems, Branchbury, NJ, USA). The submandibular gland is a mixed gland that secretes the highest amount of unstimulated saliva and contains both serous and mucous cells, making the submandibular gland a good model for evaluating the differential expression of clock RNAs and proteins in salivary glands. The resulting cDNA was then amplified by RT-PCR or real-time RT-PCR (detailed in the Appendix) with specific primers (Appendix Table 2).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022034512451450">
<title><italic>In situ</italic> Hybridization, Immunohistochemistry, and Imaging</title>
<p><italic>In situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of SG sections were performed (described in the Appendix). Briefly, paraffin mouse submandibular, parotid, and sublingual salivary glands were used. At the end, sections were photographed on an Olympus microscope. Sense probes of mouse <italic>Bmal1</italic> and <italic>Per2</italic> were used as negative controls of ISH. As IHC negative controls, both omission of primary antibodies and omission of secondary antibodies were used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022034512451450">
<title>Cell Culture and Transfection Studies</title>
<p>HEK293 (human embryonic kidney 293) cells were plated in 6-well culture plates at 70% confluence and transfected with 2 μg of Bmal1-pCMV (kindly provided by Dr. Lei Yin, Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan) or empty pCMV plasmid with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen; detailed in the Appendix). After transfection, RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA and used for quantitative RT-PCR.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022034512451450">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed with Student’s unpaired <italic>t</italic> test. Each experiment was performed at least twice, and the representative data are presented as means ± SD of at least 3 independent replicates.</p>

<title>Detection Clock RNAs by RT-PCR</title>
<p>Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (Arntl or Bmal1), clock homolog (mouse) (Clock), period homolog 1 (Drosophila) (Per1), and period homolog 2 (Drosophila) (Per2) mRNAs were detected in mouse submandibular SG extracts by conventional RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512451450">Fig. 1</xref>), as well as in the kidney, which is a tissue known to be regulated by clock genes (positive control). However, submandibular gland protein C <italic>(Smgc)</italic>, a specific marker of SGs, can be detected only in SGs but not in the kidney.

Four key clock proteins, <italic>Bmal1, Clock, Per1</italic>, and <italic>Per2</italic>, were found to be rarely expressed in serous acini, but their expression in mucous acini and striated ducts was very strong in submandibular SGs. In contrast, all 4 clock proteins were very strongly expressed in serous acini and mucous acini, as well as in striated ducts. We also tested human submandibular SG sections for PER1 expression. As in the mouse sections, strong expression was found in human mucous acini and striated ducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512451450">Fig. 2O</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Clock genes, which generate circadian rhythms, are expressed in a circadian manner in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain and in various peripheral tissues. Here, we showed that clock gene RNAs and clock proteins were differentially detected in SG cells. Especially strong expression was detected in serous acinar and duct cells, which indicates that clock genes may play important roles in salivary flow and salivary electrolyte flux regulation. This is the first detailed characterization of clock genes and their products, by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and immunohistochemistry, in all 3 major SGs.</p>
<p>To confirm the existence of circadian regulation in SGs, we then evaluated the oscillatory profiles of key clock gene RNAs, including <italic>Per1, Per2, Clock</italic>, and <italic>Bmal1</italic>, in submandibular glands. All clock genes studied here showed robust circadian expression rhythms in SGs when mice were housed under 12:12-hour light-dark (L/D) cycle conditions. Our data are consistent with those from a previous study which reported the expression of clock genes in submandibular glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512451450">Furukawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In addition to that study, our study also characterized, for the first time, the cellular localization of clock proteins in all 3 major SGs. More importantly, our study demonstrated that clock gene oscillation persists even in dark-dark conditions (D/D), suggesting that the circadian clock mechanism of SGs may also function independently of the central clock located in the brain. These findings provide a major advancement in our knowledge of SG physiology.</p>
<p>Previous studies showed that clock genes are the key regulators of circadian gene expression and daily physiological functions in many organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512451450">Huang <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512451450">Lefta <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms that control circadian salivary secretion are unclear. We hypothesized that the SGs contain a peripheral clock that regulates their functions through differential expression of clock genes, the genes responsible for maintaining circadian rhythms. This hypothesis is in accordance with our data showing that clock genes continue to be expressed at regular daily intervals, even under D/D conditions. We also postulated that clock genes may regulate the expression of key SG genes such as <italic>Aqp5, Ae2a</italic>, and <italic>Car2</italic>. Our promoter analysis revealed that 2 out of 3 key SG genes (<italic>i.e., Aqp5</italic> and <italic>Car2</italic>) contain putative promoter binding sites for clock protein binding, supporting a regulatory role for clock genes in SGs. Consistently, <italic>Aqp5</italic> expression showed a clear circadian pattern under both normal light/dark conditions and under complete-dark conditions. Furthermore, <italic>Bmla1</italic> overexpression resulted in <italic>AQP5</italic> RNA up-regulation, suggesting that <italic>Aqp5</italic> is a key target of clock genes in SGs. In contrast, <italic>Ae2a</italic> and <italic>Car2</italic> did not show a definitive circadian pattern of expression, suggesting that these 2 genes may not be direct targets of clock genes in SGs.</p>
<p>The saliva secreted by the SGs fulfills many functions to maintain the normal homeostasis of the oral cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512451450">Dawes, 1969</xref>). The major constituent of saliva is water. The SGs also secrete ions, mainly K(+) and HCO<sub>3</sub>(−), and re-absorb Na(+) and Cl(−). The volume and the composition of the oral fluid can vary during the day within regular time intervals and within every individual. Salivation can be either stimulated or reduced by several factors and diseases. Hyposalivation, for example, is directly related to high caries, xerostomia, and pain, and much research is focused on treating salivary abnormalities. However, the direct links between causes and effects in different salivary pathologies are unclear. Recently, abnormal expression of clock genes has been found in patients with reduced salivary flow (our own unpublished observations). We therefore postulate that a clock mechanism that implies direct or indirect regulation of key genes important for SG physiology may be altered in diseases with abnormal salivary flow. We are currently evaluating the role of clock genes in salivary gland pathologies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, oscillations of clock genes were first detected in the SGs under light/dark but also under complete-dark conditions. Analysis of our data supports the idea that the SGs contain a circadian clock mechanism. Understanding the role of clock genes in controlling salivary flow and electrolyte content will enhance our understanding of the regulation of salivary functions and will provide a foundation for subsequent studies that may elucidate the potential links between clock genes and salivary diseases.</p>
