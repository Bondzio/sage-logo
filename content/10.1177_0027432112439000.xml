<p>Educators are professionals. Teaching is not just a job; it is at least a career, and arguably a mission. One important attribute of professionals is their constant quest for personal growth. Great music educators are lifelong learners who draw on a variety of sources to improve their expertise and effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0027432112439000">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In my previous column on this topic, I listed the primary purposes of student assessment, and focused on its role in improving <italic>student learning</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0027432112439000">2</xref></sup> The current column addresses the role of student assessment in improving <italic>instruction</italic>. I highlight how measuring student achievement can empower individual teachers to assume responsibility for their own professional growth. I then address the policy and practical issues associated with using student achievement data in teacher evaluation, a topic that is currently generating a lot of heat nationwide.</p>

<title>Assessment to Improve Instruction</title>

<list-item><p>How does a <italic>job</italic> become a <italic>career</italic>?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Why and how must teachers improve their own practice?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What role does assessment play?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To provoke reflection about professional growth, I often ask veteran teachers and preservice undergraduates, “What <italic>percentage</italic> of what you need to know to be a successful teacher do you learn as an <italic>undergraduate</italic>?” In their initial response, most place that percentage somewhere between 10 and 50 percent. The latter, wildly optimistic estimate is usually proffered by teachers-in-training.</p>
<p>It is simply impossible to squeeze everything teachers need to know into a 120-credit bachelor’s program. Compounding the problem, many university music teacher training programs remain hidebound, stubbornly replicating a nostalgic and somewhat hermetic world of large bands, choirs, and orchestras that feels alien to the increasing proportion of K–12 students who crave more personal, creative, and often technological experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0027432112439000">3</xref></sup> As a result, there is a widening disconnect between the skills that beginning teachers possess and the musical interests of the children in their schools.</p>
<p>Most important: in this rapidly changing world, a teacher can <italic>never</italic> be fully prepared. The professional life of great educators runs 24/7 in part because there is always more to learn. Even it <italic>were</italic> possible to attain perfection as a teacher, that blissful state would last only a few moments. As our students as well as the fields of education and music rapidly evolve, there is no such thing as maintaining the status quo; teachers either move forward, or they fall behind.</p>
<p>One of the most important and constant goals of every music educator must therefore be to accept responsibility for his or her own professional growth. In fact, the tireless pursuit of improved performance is one of the hallmarks of professionalism.</p>
<p>Enlightened school districts provide instructional leaders for each content area, including music supervisors who help teachers assess, reflect about, and improve their work. Just as effective teachers empower their students to become self-guided musical learners, so also do effective music supervisors seek to empower members of their faculty to become self-guided professionals. Such supervisors encourage, or even require, teachers to audio or video record their own lessons, so they can learn to identify and remedy their weaknesses.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most systems fail to supply expert leadership, so music teachers’ classrooms are rarely if ever visited by helpful experts. Even when there <italic>is</italic> a music-trained supervisor, it is rare for experienced teachers to receive more than one or two visits in a school year.</p>
<p>Peer coaching can help fill the gap by providing a helpful source of outside input. Although in many schools music educators lack music colleagues with whom to exchange ideas, advances in communications technology are making it possible to share and discuss classroom work with peers regardless of geographic distance. Still, in a profession that involves working with hundreds of students each week, it is ironic how isolated teachers often feel.</p>
<p><bold>Astute educators realize that <italic>they</italic> are ultimately responsible for monitoring and improving the quality of their own work.</bold> Like their students,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0027432112439000">4</xref></sup> teachers need three key skills to take charge of their own learning:</p>
<list id="list2-0027432112439000" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>they need to <italic>understand</italic> quality,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to <italic>self-assess</italic> their work in relation to quality, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to <italic>take action</italic> to achieve quality.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Self-evaluation is just as important for the independent growth of teachers as it is for students.</p>

<sec id="section2-0027432112439000">
<title>Assessment and Reflective Practice</title>
<p>The process that professionals use to improve their own practice has been described as a cycle of <italic>reflective practice</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0027432112439000">5</xref></sup> The cycle involves four steps: planning, instruction, assessment, and reflection (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0027432112439000">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>While regular review of classroom video plays an important role in self-improvement, measuring student achievement—the primary goal of education—is essential. In the absence of achievement data, it is far too easy to engage in self-delusion instead of self-assessment.</p>
<p>Teachers sometimes comment that “the best way to learn to teach is through experience.” Unfortunately, the wrong kind of experience can have the opposite effect, by deepening bad habits. Teachers who neglect to monitor and reflect on their students’ achievement end up recycling their own weaknesses. They subject one class after another to the same ineffective strategies, in an educational rerun sadly reminiscent of the movie <italic>Groundhog Day</italic>.</p>
<p>Successful teachers, on the other hand, turn their classrooms into educational laboratories where they constantly identify and test new strategies to help their students learn.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0027432112439000">6</xref></sup> They are social scientists running a never-ending series of experiments in which the chief dependent variable (i.e., the primary outcome of the experiment) is student achievement. Through their analysis of the relationship between their actions and student learning, they make the reflective practice cycle three-dimensional, a helix that elevates their practice toward excellence with each completion of the circuit.</p>

<title>Assessment in Teacher Evaluation</title>

<list-item><p>How should teachers be evaluated?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What role should student achievement play in teacher evaluation?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How can music teachers promote fair evaluation systems that respect the nature and importance of their work?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Teacher evaluation has traditionally been based primarily on the extent to which educators use strategies and exhibit behaviors deemed desirable by experts. School leaders sought the wisdom of contemporary thinkers—sometimes credible sources, such as Robert Marzano and Charlotte Danielson, sometimes the latest guru du jour—in a quest for strategies to improve success. Educators typically learned about these strategies and behaviors by participating in professional development and, ideally, by observing model instruction.</p>
<p>From such sources, teachers have learned to maintain orderly classrooms, to present key concepts through a variety of modalities/media, and to ask divergent questions that elicit higher-level thinking. Administrators periodically visited classrooms to check that those favored strategies are used. They completed standardized observation forms to provide teachers with feedback. Teachers submitted plans to improve how well they carry out those strategies. At the end of the year, teachers received a rating or grade for their work.</p>
<p>This paper-intensive but comfortably familar system is, however, currently being challenged by the same forces that are shaking so many other iconic practices of public education.</p>

<sec id="section4-0027432112439000">
<title>Averting a Teacher Evaluation Train Wreck</title>
<p>The nature of teacher evaluation is changing rapidly—whether for good or for ill remains to be determined. The Obama/Duncan administration and a number of governors are promoting teacher evaluation based on student achievement. The U.S. Department of Education announced that states would have to require achievement-based teacher evaluation to obtain competitive federal funding and waivers from certain onerous requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0027432112439000">7</xref></sup> A number of governors and legislatures—hungry for additional funding during challenging economic times and, in some cases, sensing a political opportunity to vilify teachers or their unions as indolent obstacles to “school reform”—have been only too willing to comply.</p>
<p>Prompted in part by business models, legislators and school leaders are increasingly looking beyond how well educators appear to <italic>teach</italic> to the “bottom-line” question of how much and how well their students <italic>learn</italic>. The news is filled with reports of “education governors” and federal policymakers promoting “value-added” and “growth models” that hold individual teachers accountable for student achievement. During my presentations at state conferences, I ask teachers to raise their hands if their school or district is focusing on data. The air is immediately stirred by waving limbs, typically accompanied by wry facial expressions.</p>
<p>While almost everyone agrees that a primary purpose of teaching is to help students achieve, and it therefore seems logical to consider student achievement when evaluating a teacher’s success, there is disagreement about <italic>how</italic> achievement should be factored in. Among the key issues that inevitably and appropriately arise are as follows:</p>
<list id="list4-0027432112439000" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>For what achievement should teachers be accountable?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How will that achievement be measured?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What level of achievement (or change in achievement) is acceptable or reasonable, and who should decide?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Should that level vary according to students’ background and/or opportunity to learn?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Finding sensible solutions to these questions is important to all teachers, but <italic>particularly</italic> important to ensure fair evaluation of educators who teach subjects—including music—that are not measured by standardized state tests. Unfortunately, many emerging achievement-based teacher evaluation initiatives have been hastily slapped together to address arbitrary grant or legislative deadlines rather than educational goals, and are therefore poorly designed. Some misguided policymakers have seized on the expedient “one-size-fits-all” approach of mandating that schoolwide standardized three-Rs test scores be a significant factor in the evaluations of <italic>all</italic> teachers, regardless of the subject or students they teach. While that would certainly be a <italic>cheap</italic> solution, in every sense of the word, it is also educationally <italic>bankrupt</italic>.</p>
<p>State tests assess only a narrow range of the curriculum, even within the few subject areas they address. Policymakers seem to have forgotten that the main reason schools teach so-called basic skills is to enable students to learn <italic>content</italic>. Encouraging teachers of content-laden subjects—such as the arts, social studies, and science—to abandon the substance of their disciplines to focus on the three Rs therefore undermines the very purpose of education. The educational cost of implementing a standardized test–based evaluation system for teachers and their students, who already suffer the intellectual and spiritual deprivations of narrow NCLB curricula, is far greater than either should be forced to pay.</p>
<p><bold>Evaluating teachers of music based on test scores in <italic>subjects</italic> they do not teach is not only <italic>unfair;</italic> it is <italic>absurd</italic></bold>. Evaluating them based on schoolwide scores that include <italic>students</italic> they do not teach compounds the injustice. Grover J. “Russ” Whitehurst, director of the Brookings Institution’s Brown Center on American Education and former director of the Institute of Education Sciences in the U.S. Department of Education in the second Bush administration, highlighted this problem in comments about one state struggling to meet its grant deadline:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>[Tennessee is] struggling more or less unsuccessfully with the same issue that every state and district struggles with as they leap into meaningful teacher evaluation. . . . They don’t have [student] assessments for the majority of the staff. [Using schoolwide math and reading scores for teachers of other subjects] doesn’t pass the common-sense test for being a measure of what it’s intended to measure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0027432112439000">8</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The bad news in Tennessee—as in other states—was that politicians’ ill-considered <italic>legislation</italic> had become educators’ <italic>problem</italic>. The good news is how our national association worked with Tennessee’s music educators to solve that problem.</p>

<sec id="section5-0027432112439000">
<title>NAfME: Leader on Fair Music Teacher Evaluation</title>
<p>Seeing the need to protect music educators and their students from damaging teacher evaluation policies, NAfME took action. Responding to alarms raised by state MEA leaders, I appointed a group of music educators who are expert in teacher evaluation to develop a position statement to guide legislators and other policymakers.</p>
<p>Led by Johanna Siebert, the chair of our Council of Music Program Leaders, the Teacher Evaluation Task Force developed two helpful documents. The first document, the NAfME Teacher Evaluation Position Statement, lays out commonsense guidelines, such as “Measures of student achievement used in teacher evaluation . . . must be based on student achievement that is directly attributable to the individual teacher, in the subject area taught by that teacher.” The second, companion document outlines strategies to help music teachers and program leaders advocate for appropriate evaluation systems. You can download both of these documents from the NAfME website.</p>
<p>Leaders of affiliated state MEAs report that the NAfME position statement has empowered them to influence the policies of their state departments of education, by moderating or reversing policy decisions that could harm music education. In states that are requiring local districts to develop their own achievement-based teacher evaluation systems,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0027432112439000">9</xref></sup> teachers and music program leaders have been using the position statement and the advocacy document to guide local administrators toward more arts-friendly evaluation guidelines. Several state MEAs and local music faculty are developing music assessment tools to support appropriate evaluation. Which brings us back to the story of Tennessee. . .</p>
<p>Memphis arts program leader Dru Davison was appointed to serve on NAfME’s Teacher Evaluation Task Force, both because of his leadership on this issue in Tennessee and because of his work with teachers in the Memphis City Schools to develop evidence-based portfolios to document achievement in music. In January Davison met with his state’s Commissioner of Education, who was presented with the NAfME position statement and a progress report on the Tennessee arts assessment pilot. The Commissioner expressed appreciation for the work of the teacher development team and offered support for the pilot.</p>
<p>In early February, following a series of NAfME meetings with the U.S. Department of Education about our position statement, Davison was invited to Washington present Memphis’s arts assessment work to U.S. Secretary of Education Duncan and other officials. Secretary Duncan’s speech at Harvard the following week illustrated how much progress we are making on this issue:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Some folks will point out, correctly, that most teachers don’t teach in tested subjects. So, how can student achievement be factored into teacher evaluation in non-tested subjects? . . .</p>
<p>Just last week I met with Dru Davison, a fantastic music teacher in Memphis. Arts teachers there were frustrated because they were being evaluated based solely on school-wide performance in math and English. So he convened a group of arts educators to come up with a better evaluation system.</p>
<p>After Dru’s committee surveyed arts teachers in Memphis, they decided to develop a blind peer review evaluation to assess portfolios of student learning. It has proved enormously popular—so much so that Tennessee is now looking at adopting the system statewide for arts instructors. If we are willing to listen, and to do things differently, the answers are out there.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0027432112439000">10</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>You should feel proud that music educators, through the work of your national organization and its members, have become national leaders in the struggle for educationally sound, sensible teacher evaluation. Through presentations of our Teacher Evaluation Position Statement to the U.S. Department of Education and Congress, NAfME has not only gained the respect and attention of those institutions; it is also improving the likelihood that any new federal legislation or regulations will respect the skills and needs of music educators.</p>
<p>I urge you to lend your voice to this effort, by signing up for Groundswell in the Advocacy section of NAfME’s website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.NAfME.org/advocacy">www.NAfME.org/advocacy</ext-link> and by encouraging others who care about arts education to do the same. The more voters we can reach through our Groundswell system, the more positive influence we will have.</p>

<title>Implications for Teachers</title>
<p>Teachers too often view the purpose of assessment narrowly, as a tool either for grading or, at best, for providing feedback to their students. Assessment is, however, also essential for teachers to realize their own professional potential. Measuring student achievement is a crucial step in the process of self-evaluation, reflection, and self-improvement. Music teachers therefore need to develop or adopt appropriate measures of student achievement, and use the results to further their professional growth.</p>
<p>Across the United States, policymakers are turning to the results of student assessments as a means of measuring and improving teacher performance. The best of the emerging teacher evaluation initiatives push us to do <italic>better</italic> what we should have been doing <italic>all along</italic>:</p>
<list id="list5-0027432112439000" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>to identify what is most important through clear, thoughtful, and specific outcomes (i.e., <italic>curriculum</italic>);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to measure how well that curriculum is learned (i.e., to <italic>assess</italic> student achievement); and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to figure out how to help more students achieve success (i.e., to <italic>improve instruction</italic>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To support your own and your state MEA’s advocacy efforts, download and use the NAfME Teacher Evaluation Position Statement and advocacy guidelines.</p>
<p>Finally, join the national movement for a balanced education that includes quality music instruction by signing up for Groundswell (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://advocacy.nafme.org">http://advocacy.nafme.org</ext-link>). Encourage members of your community to get involved by inserting the downloadable Groundswell flyer in your next school concert program. The future of our profession, our culture, and—most important—our students is at stake.</p>
