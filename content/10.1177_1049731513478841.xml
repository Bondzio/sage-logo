<p>Despite the title, this book is not really about the criminal justice system. This book is about the systematic distortion of national social data that results from “the continued use of data collection strategies and estimation methods that predate prison expansion” (p. 3). Becky Pettit, a sociologist at the University of Washington, confronts these outmoded methodologies by offering her own calculations with a focus on African American men; however, her findings are equally relevant to any marginalized subpopulation disproportionately represented in America’s prisons. The bottom line can be simply stated, almost everything that is commonly known about African American men in national databases is substantially incorrect because of the influence of mass incarceration on young African American men.</p>
<p>Pettit’s first chapter serves as an introduction to the book. Readers unfamiliar with mass incarceration in America since the mid-1970s will find her summary brief and well documented. Her concerns about the inaccuracy of household-based social surveys, the dominant methodology used in national statistics, lie principally in the manner in which inmates and former inmates are systematically undercounted. The racial disparities in involvement with the criminal justice system tilt heavily against young African American men with less than a high school education so that imprisonment is more common than military service, marriage, or college graduation. For these men, “spending time in prison has become a normative life event” (p. 18).</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, Pettit turns her attention to the history of social data in America. Rooted in the constitutionally mandated census for apportionment and taxation, Pettit traces the history of household-based sample surveys to supplement the census data for research, policy making, and grants-in-aid. Readers may be amazed at Pettit’s critique of the inadequacy of the 13 major national surveys detailed in this chapter. Only the National Adult Literacy Survey intentionally includes the incarcerated in the sampling. Even the decennial census, despite significant efforts to reduce the undercount, continues to miss 5% of African American men, an error rate 5,000 times higher than the overall undercount. In Chapter 3, Pettit explains the incongruence of invisibility in social data for the most surveilled group in America, inmates and former inmates, and provides an example of how disproportional incarceration distorts estimates of the share of African American young men who do not have a high school education.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 is a devastating critique of the social data that suggests African American progress in education, employment, and earnings. Contrary to the findings of the Current Population Survey (CPS) that high school graduation rates are converging for White and African American men, adjustment of CPS for inmates and former inmates indicates no improvement in the last 20 years. The American educational system, rather than providing the foundation for increased opportunity for African American men, may be sustaining inequality. Conventional data sources also distort the estimates of employment. Typical estimates of African American male employment find a 12–16% gap in the employment rate when compared to non-Hispanic White men. The adjusted rate is at least 16% higher and as much as 22% for young, undereducated Black males. Less than half of undereducated, young, Black men are employed. Regarding earnings, the White advantage of approximately 20% through conventional sources is actually 60% when adjusted. “National statistics … cannot be taken at face value” (p. 67).</p>
<p>Chapter 5 is devoted to Pettit’s analysis of voter turnout and concludes that, once again, the national statistics are incorrect. Further deficiencies of national statistics are noted in Chapter 6 with attention to the children of incarcerated parents, underestimates of the African American rural population, and the prevalence of health problems. In each case, the reader will be most impressed by the lack of hard information on these measures. In the final chapter, Pettit addresses what social workers would label social injustice. She asserts that “the criminal justice system creates a unique form of social exclusion that is rooted in the invisibility of America’s inmates” (p. 101). In <italic>Poverty Knowledge: Social Science, Social Policy, and the Poor in Twentieth-century U. S. History</italic> (Princeton, 2001), Alice O’Connor argued that the construction of knowledge shapes institutions, politics, and broader cultural meanings. As Pettit so clearly describes, the reality of mass incarceration in America challenges the accepted process of knowledge creation in our national statistics. Improvement in the methodologies of data collection in national statistics is a social justice imperative.</p>
<p>Because national statistics frame the context in which social work research takes place, I believe that Pettit has penned an important book. Social work researchers are advised to consult her Methodological Appendix to determine data sources and approaches that are suitable for adjusting extant national statistics for marginalized populations. To ignore the import of her work is to begin research with faulty baselines.</p>
