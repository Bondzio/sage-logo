<p>Solvent-based methods are commonly employed for the production of polyester-based samples and coatings in both medical device production and research. The influence of solvent casting and subsequent drying time was studied using thermal analysis, spectroscopy and weight measurement for four grades of 50 : 50 poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) produced by using chloroform, dichloromethane, and acetone. The results demonstrate that solvent choice and PLGA molecular weight are critical factors in terms of solvent removal rate and maintaining sample integrity, respectively. The protocols widely employed result in high levels of residual solvent and a new protocol is presented together with solutions to commonly encountered problems.</p>

<p>Polyesters such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), and their copolymer poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), are the most widely employed bioabsorbable polymers clinically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328210376997">1</xref>]. Since the early 1970s these FDA approved polymers have found uses in sutures/fibers, scaffolds, orthopedic fixing devices, and drug delivery implants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328210376997">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328210376997">4</xref>]. Polyester-based bioabsorbable polymers are used in drug delivery applications such as drug eluting stents due to their biocompatibility, degradation into carbon dioxide and water through hydrolysis of the ester bonds, and the ability to tailor degradation behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328210376997">5</xref>].</p>
<p>As PLA, PGA, and PLGA are predominantly bulk-eroding polymers, degradation takes place throughout the sample thickness, until a critical molecular weight is reached in which the degradation products become small enough to be solubilized. This enables a drug dissolved in the polymer to be released in a controlled manner. Implantable drug delivery systems produced using PLGA have degradation times ranging a few weeks to 2 years depending on lactic:glycolide ratio and molecular weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885328210376997">6</xref>].</p>
<p>The most commonly used method for producing PLA, PGA, and PLGA thin films on a laboratory scale is via solvent-casting, also known variously as film casting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328210376997">7</xref>], solution processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328210376997">8</xref>], and solution-casting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328210376997">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328210376997">10</xref>]. This method involves dissolving the polymer in a suitable solvent; commonly dichloromethane (DCM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328210376997">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328210376997">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328210376997">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328210376997">13</xref>], chloroform (CHCl<sub>3</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328210376997">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328210376997">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328210376997">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328210376997">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328210376997">15</xref>], or in some cases acetone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328210376997">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328210376997">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210376997">16</xref>], and then casting the solution onto glass slides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328210376997">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328210376997">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328210376997">14</xref>], glass Petri dishes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328210376997">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328210376997">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328210376997">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328210376997">15</xref>], Teflon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328210376997">16</xref>], or stainless steel molds. This method is widely adopted and extensively reported in literature since no specialized equipment is required and variables such as sample thickness and size can be easily controlled. Solvent-based techniques are also employed on an industrial scale for applying drug-loaded coatings, such as in the production of drug eluding stents. A wide range of protocols employing different solvents, drying times, drying temperatures, molds, etc. are reported, with the most commonly reported drying regimes consist of between 24 and 48 h at room temperature often followed by a further 24–48 h in vacuum at 40–50°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328210376997">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328210376997">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328210376997">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328210376997">18</xref>]. This group of bioabsorbable polyesters can also be processed using conventional melt processing techniques such as extrusion and injection molding.</p>
<p>This study was conducted in order to investigate the influence of solvent casting on polymer properties and to aid in the establishment of a standardized protocol.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0885328210376997"><title>Materials</title>
<p>50 : 50 PLGA 1A (0.05–0.15 dL/g), 2A (0.25–0.35 dL/g), 3A (0.35–0.45 dL/g) were purchased from Lakeshore Biomaterials. 50 : 50 PLGA 1B (0.15-0.25 dL/g) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (UK). All grades of PLGA were used as received. Chloroform (99.8 %), DCM (99.9 %), and acetone were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (UK). RainX was purchased from Shell Car Care International Ltd (UK).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0885328210376997"><title>Preparation of Films</title>
<p>The protocol for producing the thin films samples involves adding 0.53 g 1 : 10 (w/w) of PLGA to 5.3 g of solvent in a 28 mL sealed glass bottle and leaving for 24 h at room temperature to dissolve. The solution was then poured into a 60 × 12 mm<sup>2</sup> Anumbra glass Petri dish (Scientific Laboratory Supplies, ANALAB, UK) pre-treated with RainX and left for 24 h under a fume hood at room temperature to evaporate. Treatment by either Sigmacote or RainX to the glass petri dishes is vital for successful removal of the thin films as it prevents the sample from binding to the glass. This is particularly important as much literature report the difficulty in removing the thin films from the mold, with many choosing to leave the PLGA attached to the glass. This difficulty in removal of the thin films can hinder the ability for analysis and degradation. Using the solvent evaporation technique 12 PLGA thin films were produced. Duplicate samples were produced of PLGA 1A, 2A, and 3A in DCM, and PLGA 1A in CHCl<sub>3</sub>, DCM, and acetone. Subsequently the films were dried at 40°C in a vacuum oven at 500 mbar for 14 days; samples of each were removed and analyzed ‘as received’ (namely before solvent casting), after 2 and 14 days drying using attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The samples were turned every 2 days and regularly weighed during drying. The resulting films had an approximate thickness of 200 µm. It was found that all samples should be removed from the petri dish after 2 days of vacuum drying since removal of the thin films at this time point avoids breakages in the low molecular weight polymers. The plasticizing effect of the residual solvent which remains after 2 days vacuum drying renders the PLGA sufficiently pliable to avoid fracture.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0885328210376997"><title>Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
<p>The infrared spectra were recorded with A BIORAD FTS 3000MX Excalibur series spectrometer with an attenuated total reflection (ATR) accessory using a KRS-5 single crystal with an angle of incidence of 45° giving 25 internal reflections. A total of 1000 scans for each were recorded between 400–4000 cm<sup>−1</sup>. All spectra were baseline corrected using OriginPro 7 software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0885328210376997"><title>Differential Scanning Calorimetry</title>
<p>DSC experiments were performed using a DSC Q100 (TA Instruments). Approximately 5 mg of sample was taken and heated from -20°C to 220°C at a rate of 10°C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere at 50 mL/min.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0885328210376997"><title>Thermogravimetric Analysis</title>
<p>TGA experiments were carried out using a TGA Q600 (TA Instruments). Approximately 5 mg of sample was taken and heated from room temperature to 450°C at a rate of 10°C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere flowing at 100 mL/min. Percentage solvent was calculated as % weight loss between 80°C and 200°C using TA Universal Analysis software.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0885328210376997"><title>Weight Loss Measurements</title>
<p>Weight loss was obtained using a Sartorius balance with 0.1 mg readability. Samples were weighed at regular time intervals to estimate residual solvent; all samples were weighed three times at each time point.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0885328210376997"><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
<p>Weight loss measurements are the most commonly reported method for determining residual solvent levels, but were found to be misleading as samples had generally reached their original polymer weight of 530 mg within 2–5 days, which could be interpreted as indicative of complete solvent removal. However, weight loss continued with additional drying; in addition TGA, DSC, and ATR-FTIR uncovered effects due to residual solvent after drying for up to 14 days. The inaccuracy of using weight loss measurement for determination of residual solvent level can be attributed to material losses during the transfers involved in sample production. This gives rise to residual solvent levels of less than 0% shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328210376997">Figure 1</xref> as calculated from the initial polymer weight. These losses occur from both the transfer from the glass bottle to the Petri dish mold and losses incurred when removing the sample repeatedly from the mold for weight loss measurements.

<p>No correlation was observed between polymer molecular weight and the rate of solvent removal during drying. Referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328210376997">Figure 1</xref>, solvent removal initially occurs at a high rate during the first 2 days of drying and DCM has a higher initial rate of evaporation than CHCl<sub>3</sub>. Acetone was used in initial studies but was discarded due to uncontrolled rapid evaporation in air at room temperature making the preparation of homogenous cast samples problematic.</p>
<p>Results obtained using DSC and TGA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328210376997">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885328210376997">2</xref>) also confirm that the commonly reported drying time of 24–48 h is insufficient for complete solvent removal. To determine lot to lot and measurement variability, duplicate samples were taken from three specimens of PLGA 3A in DCM subjected to 2 days drying for DSC and TGA analysis. The standard deviations for these six samples were 3.3°C and 1.2% for DSC and residual solvent via TGA respectively, leading to 95% confidence intervals of ± 6.6°C and 2.4% (95% confidence calculated from 1.96*SE.). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0885328210376997">Table 1</xref> illustrates the glass transition temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>) measured via DSC in the ‘as-received’ state and solvent cast after 2 and 14 days vacuum drying at 40°C. The <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> of the ‘as-received’ PLGA was in range ∼35.5°C–43.1°C depending on the supplier and molecular weight. This decreased to ∼11.0–24.3°C when solvent-cast and dried for 2 days. This change in <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> is indicative of increased chain mobility induced by residual solvent, with chloroform showing a greater reduction in <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> compared to DCM. This plasticizing effect has been previously reported to result from residual solvent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328210376997">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328210376997">20</xref>]. After 14 days the glass transition temperature reverted back towards the ‘as-received’ state, samples prepared with DCM displaying a <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> ∼21.6–29.7°C after 14 days. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328210376997">Figure 2</xref> illustrates a typical DSC trace of ‘as received’ and solvent cast PLGA; it can be seen that solvent processing reduces <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> and broadens transition. Two additional peaks labeled A and B are evident in the solvent cast sample after 2 days drying. These are attributed to solvent evolution effects and are less pronounced after 14 days drying. As discussed this shift in <italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub> reverts towards its ‘as receive’ state slightly after drying but the broadening effect remains.

<p>The TGA traces illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885328210376997">Figure 3</xref> show that the degradation temperature of the polymers increased with increasing molecular weight in the ‘as-receive’ material as expected. Referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328210376997">Figure 4</xref>, which depicts solvent cast PLGA, the weight loss in the region 80–200°C which is not present in ‘as-received’ PLGA can be attributed to the removal of residual solvent. TGA analysis also showed that there were significant solvent levels remaining in all samples after the commonly reported drying time of 2 days; this ranges from 4% to 12% depending on solvent type, decreasing to between 4% and 8% after 14 days (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0885328210376997">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328210376997">Figure 4</xref>) as determined by TGA. Samples prepared using DCM displayed lower residual solvent levels compared with CHCl<sub>3</sub>. In agreement with the weight loss results, no obvious trend was observed between polymer molecular weight and residual solvent levels.

<p>ATR-FTIR spectra are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328210376997">Figure 5</xref>, the major peaks associated with PLGA are present and attributed as: C–H stretch (2850–3000cm<sup>−1</sup>), C=O stretch (1700–1800 cm<sup>−1</sup>), C–O (1090–1172 cm<sup>−1</sup>), and CH<sub>3</sub> (1386–1452 cm<sup>−1</sup>) [4]. These peaks remained present throughout the drying process. However, a decrease in the relative peak height associated with the C=O and C–O bonds was observed after solvent casting. The relative peak height associated with these bonds was observed to reduce upon solvent casting and drying for 2 days, and then revert towards the ‘as-received’ state after 14 days drying. This change in relative peak intensity can be attributed to an increase in free volume due to residual solvent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328210376997">14</xref>].</p>
<p>These results showed that while no trend was observed between molecular weight and residual solvent levels, there is a clear difference between CHCl<sub>3</sub> and DCM. It has also shown that although 2 days drying is insufficient for complete solvent removal it is desirable to remove the thin films from the casting mold at this time. It has been found that to remove the samples successfully, the CHCl<sub>3</sub> samples should be removed while they are still warm while the DCM samples should be left to cool for a minimum of 4 h before being removed; both must be removed after 2 days. It is also necessary to ensure that the glass Petri dish is coated properly with RainX or Sigmacote [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328210376997">4</xref>] before casting; polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) liners may also be suitable. Higher molecular weight polymers resulted in more robust thin film samples which remained intact throughout the drying and removal from the mold. Extreme care must be taken with the lower molecular weight samples in order to maintain integrity.</p>
<p>From the results obtained in this experiment it has been found that DCM is the preferred solvent in terms of initial drying rate and residual solvent levels measured by TGA. TGA obtained recorded DCM residual solvent levels of between 6.1% and 7.6% after 2 days reducing to between 4.1% and 5.6% after 14 days. DSC observed a glass transition temperature returning towards ‘as-received’ values after 14 days, and weight loss measurements also show a slow in further reduction in weight loss after 14 days. Freier et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328210376997">9</xref>] reported that residual solvent levels would remain relatively similar after approximately 14 days and would not completely be removed until approximately 700 days drying. It has also been observed from the DSC results that CHCl<sub>3</sub> had a greater plasticizing effect on the polymer samples compared with DCM. The samples produced using PLGA 1B can also be seen to behave differently in all analysis; this could be due to different processing conditions used by the manufacturers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0885328210376997"><title>CONCLUSION</title>
<p>This study has shown that the commonly employed protocol for producing thin films results in significant levels of residual solvent and that the method of weight loss measurements for determining removal of residual solvent is inaccurate and attenuate analysis such as TGA is needed to determine solvent removal. DCM showed an accelerated initial weight loss compared with CHCl<sub>3</sub> in both weight loss analysis and TGA. After 2 days there is a 6% difference in residual solvent levels observed in TGA between CHCl<sub>3</sub> and DCM; this decreases to approximately 2% after 14 days with DCM continually reporting lower residual solvent levels. This difference in residual solvent levels between the two solvents is also observed in the glass transition temperature with a 10°C difference after 2 days and 2°C after 14 days. DCM was also shown to produce more robust samples; however, for the low molecular weight polymers it was advisable to leave the DCM samples for approximately 4 h at room temperature to cool before removing them from their molds in order to facilitate ease of handling; the opposite effect was observed for CHCl<sub>3</sub> samples which needed to be removed from the mold while they were still warm. This difference in sample removal was unnecessary for the higher molecular weight polymers. Higher molecular weight polymers were found to produce the most robust samples facilitating ease of handling throughout the drying process and sample analysis.</p>
