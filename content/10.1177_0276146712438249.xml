<title>Description</title>
<p>Organized jointly by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Loyola University Chicago, and Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, the Fourth Subsistence Marketplace Conference will be held July 27-29, 2012 in Chicago at the Loyola University Chicago Water Tower Campus.</p>
<p>Subsistence marketplaces consist of consumer and entrepreneur communities living at subsistence income levels, concentrated in developing countries and regions such as Brazil, India, China, Vietnam and Sub-Saharan Africa. In the last five years, the Subsistence Marketplaces Conference has been a leading forum for developing and sharing research and fostering best practices in these communities.</p>
<p>In its fourth edition, the theme of the 2012 conference is on the emergence of macro-level implications from micro-level research insights. To generalize and expand findings from focused studies of individual consumers, entrepreneurs, and communities, to higher levels such as marketplace ecosystems, markets, economies, and regions is a complex endeavor. It needs dedicated multi-disciplinary, multi-level, and multi-sector work that will guide meaningful policy and market decisions.</p>
<p>The conference will include plenary panels, participatory workshops, key note speeches by thought leaders, special sessions on specific topics, and presentations of papers submitted in response to this call. An emphasis will be on sharing ideas and knowledge among researchers, practitioners and students.</p>
<p>Details about registration, lodging, and accommodations will be available on the conference website at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.business.illinois.edu/subsistence/events/conferences.html">http://www.business.illinois.edu/subsistence/events/conferences.html</ext-link>. Continuing the practices of past conferences, arrangements including lodging will emphasize affordability for a diverse range of participants. Beginning with preconference workshops and a reception on July 27, the conference will continue on the 28th and conclude by mid-afternoon on the 29th.</p>

<title>Call for Papers</title>
<p>Academics, students, social entrepreneurs, policy makers, business and nonprofit practitioners are encouraged to attend and submit papers on a wide range of topics on subsistence marketplaces. Consistent with the theme of the conference, papers emphasizing a bottom-up emergent view are encouraged. Papers that explicitly explore how specific micro-level elements (e.g. consumer behavior) undergo dynamics of interaction and amplification to yield higher-level phenomena (e.g. marketing ecosystem) are especially welcomed.

<title>Submissions for Publication</title>
<p>We are currently exploring the possibility of a publication that is partially or fully based on articles stemming from presentations at the conference. Prior conferences have led to a book (<italic>Advances in International Management</italic> series by Elsevier in 2007), and special journal issues/sections (<italic>Journal of Business Research, 2009 and Forthcoming</italic>). Further details about publication opportunities will be available as they are finalized. A tentative schedule is as follows:</p>
