<p>Infective endocarditis is a rare entity in children. Congenital heart disease is an important predisposing factor. We report a rare case of infective endocarditis after repair of a complete atrioventricular (AV) septal defect in a four-month-old patient. Rescue surgery was necessary and consisted of left AV valve reconstruction.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A four-month-old patient with a common AV septal defect (Rastelli type B) and Down syndrome underwent operation using the modified single-patch technique. The left AV valve zone of apposition (cleft)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111421354">1</xref></sup> was closed with fine interrupted sutures (bileaflet repair). The postoperative result was very good, with no residual ventricular septal defect or atrial septal defect and good function of the reconstructed AV valves. Four days after surgery, the patient developed high fever. The blood culture was positive for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as was the bacteriologic examination of the tip of the removed central venous catheter. This central venous catheter had been placed, as usual, by the anesthesiologist after tracheal intubation. On echocardiography, regurgitation of the left AV valve was identified on postoperative day eight. No vegetations on any of the heart valves or on the patch material were visualized by echo imaging. The initial strategy was to deal first with systemic infection and then to address the left AV valve regurgitation. Antibiotic therapy was tailored according to pathogen sensitivities. The regurgitation became severe by postoperative day 41 and the patient needed ventilatory support. The regurgitant jet was eccentric and directed against the atrial septum. Failure of the left AV valve reconstruction was suspected. The white blood cell count and the C-reactive protein level continued to be high. It was felt that surgery on an emergency basis was the only option in the clinical setting of severe left AV valve regurgitation, increasing requirement for inotropic support and diuretic therapy and need for mechanical ventilation. There was no pulmonary infection. A median resternotomy was performed. There was no sign of mediastinitis. After institution of total cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the ascending aorta was cross-clamped and cardioplegic solution was delivered into the aortic root. The right atrium was reopened using the same incision. There was no dehiscence around the pericardial patch used to close the atrial septal defect and no vegetation was identified on the right AV valve, the ventricular septum, or the pericardial patch. We then detached the pericardial patch from the superior margin of the atrial septal defect and exposed the left AV valve. There was no dehiscence of the repair of the previous zone of apposition (cleft) but a perforation of the original left superior leaflet (LSL) of the common AV valve was identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111421354">Figure 1</xref>). Complete excision of the edges surrounding the perforation was performed in an attempt to remove all infected tissues. The defect was closed using a piece of fresh (untreated) autologous pericardium. An anuloplasty stitch was placed in the region of the commissure between the LSL and left lateral leaflet (LLL). After repair, the valve was tested by filling the ventricle with saline. This showed a competent left AV valve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135111421354">Figure 2</xref>). The intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated an excellent result. The patient was weaned from CPB with mild inotropic support. He had an uneventful postoperative recovery. The antibiotic therapy was continued for four weeks. Twenty-seven months after rescue surgery for acute infective endocarditis, no left AV valve regurgitation was identified on follow-up using transthoracic echocardiography.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite other reports,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111421354">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111421354">3</xref></sup> the microbiological finding in our patient, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, is not typical. It is well known that the central venous catheter can become the source of bacteriemia. Breaks in aseptic technique associated with infusions and drug administration through the central venous line increase the risk of contamination. In our case, microbiological examination of the tip of the central venous catheter identified the same pathogen as in the blood culture. Of course, it is almost always the question whether the primary infectious source is the central venous line or this is secondarily contaminated. The child had neither a gastrostomy tube nor a colostomy tube, and he did not have previous necrotizing enterocolitis. Absence of any localized infection that could explain the positive blood culture suggests external contamination as the likely source. Despite intensive investigation, we could not identify the source of infection. Continuous vigilance of the intensive care unit staff, careful manipulation of the venous lines, and antiseptic measures are very important for perioperative endocarditis prophylaxis.</p>
<p>Of the generally accepted indications for surgery (persistent sepsis, cardiac failure, central, pulmonary, or peripheral embolism, infection of a prosthetic valve and vegetation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111421354">4</xref></sup>), our patient had persistent sepsis, severe valve dysfunction, and cardiac failure. Moreover, he required mechanical ventilation. There was no vegetation or embolic event. The operation was carried out on an emergency basis during the acute phase of the disease. Debridement of all infected tissue and reconstruction of the defect using fresh autologous pericardium allowed us to achieve a very good anatomical and functional result. Although some authors recommend meticulous washing of affected areas with povidone iodine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111421354">5</xref></sup> we have doubts about its effectiveness. In our experience, aggressive debridement of all infected tissues, avoiding foreign materials for valve reconstruction (whenever possible) and effective and prolonged antibiotic administration are the principles to be followed for the treatment of valve endocarditis in children. Despite the fact that glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium is easier to handle, our opinion is that fresh untreated autologous pericardium is more advantageous in dealing with delicate valve structures, especially in small children. Rescue surgery remains the only valid option when infective endocarditis is complicated by acute destruction of the heart structures and hemodynamic deterioration.</p>
