<abstract>
<p>This paper rethinks and revises enclosure narratives, thickening the concept of enclosure by researching a particular place and period: the English Midland county of Northamptonshire in the period between the 16th and the 19th centuries. It argues that while many elements of the landscape were dramatically reshaped by enclosure, the parliamentary enclosures of the late 18th and early 19th centuries were nevertheless part of a much longer process of landscape change. The paper points to the complexities within enclosure thought and experience, drawing particular attention to individuals and groups – including female landowners, ordinary villagers and animals – too often entirely written out of the ‘enclosure story’.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Enclosure, as a social and ideological process, holds a central place in recent theoretical discussions on the politics of geographical restructuring, extending from regional episodes in histories of landscape and culture – notably in the remaking of the Georgian English countryside – to global narratives of society and space, encompassing all manner of forms and sites of power relations transforming the present. The brief period of parliamentary enclosure in the English Midlands, and the dramatic telling of its process and experience, has long been central to longer national narratives of appropriation and dispossession, and like the Industrial Revolution in England, conventionally placed in the advance of progressive world histories of all political persuasions, cast as a canonical act on the world stage. Like the slave trade or the Irish famine, enclosure has been enlisted as one of the social crime scenes in the global narrative of modernization, one of England’s domestic historical traumas, an episode ‘limited in time and place but also immanent with the possibility of recurrence’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1474474011427361">1</xref></sup> So a recent article ‘Spaces of Enclosure’ setting out a matrix of neo-liberal privatization, including corporate mining and global war, opens with a quotation from John Clare’s poem on the early 19th-century enclosure of his home village of Helpston in Northamptonshire, a lament which intersects personal and particular memories with larger histories of culture and nature, of law and freedom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1474474011427361">2</xref></sup> In much the same way, Patrick Keiller’s recent film ‘Robinson in Ruins’ brings together images of landscape and stories about opposition to enclosure – including the failed 1596 Oxfordshire rising and the Otmoor riots of the 1830s – as part of a wider critique of the current global financial crisis and a call for an anti-capitalist uprising drawing on the earlier rebellions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1474474011427361">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this paper we revisit Northamptonshire, the canonical enclosure county, to rethink and revise enclosure narratives. In contrast to recent expansive and generic redefinitions of enclosure that carry with them the danger of casting the analytical net so wide as to thin the concept of enclosure beyond meaning, we will thicken the concept at source in researching a specific period and place. Enclosure’s antonym – the commons – has also been thinned beyond historical-geographical recognition as a sort of open access public space or a form of common property.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1474474011427361">4</xref></sup> Even in Georgian England common land was complex, as a form of governance and experience as well as material resource, encompassing arable and meadow land that was farmed according to collectively sanctioned regulations and more marginal land over which parishioners had legal rights, most notably for grazing, fishing and collecting fuel. The land was nevertheless privately owned, often by major estate landlords, as common land still is in extensive areas of the northern uplands of England.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1474474011427361">5</xref></sup> Through its striking visual impact on the landscape, and in the cultural imagination, enclosure can obscure detailed and subtle processes and experiences of economic and social change and continuity.</p>
<p>This is not to say that enclosure narratives are purely a local, topographical matter. Instead, enclosure always registered in the mind as well as on the ground, both performatively and discursively. In Georgian England, the enclosure of fields and commons was a wide ranging cultural and political act, resonant with larger social narratives of exclusion and dispossession, of deserted villages and invasive powers, tales of a world we have lost. For villagers tutored in the imaginative geography of the Bible, stories of exile and oppression, of forfeited and promised lands, might have material force as a response to events in their own parish, of fenced spaces and stopped pathways. Contemporary anti-enclosure sentiment and actions have often been reconstructed as episodes in the genealogy of radical protest, placed within a ‘people’s history’ which draws connections between anti-enclosure movements including the Diggers and Levellers and other radical heroes like the Tolpuddle Martyrs and the victims of Peterloo.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1474474011427361">6</xref></sup> Yet anti-enclosure feeling was sometimes a conservative response to change, aligned to Tory landed interests that were losing political ground in the commercialization of the countryside and its restructuring in the name of ‘improvement’, the progressive ethos of the time. In such discourses the quickset hedges enclosing commonable fields were aligned to the high walls and palings of nouveau riche parkland, as the rural virtues of Old England, of stability, dwelling and deference, were seen to leave the land.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1474474011427361">7</xref></sup> When we look closer at the archival record, the story – both mythically and materially – is a complicated one, in which the enclosed landscape can be culturally permeable, allowing the continuity and renovation of community practices, while at other times and places new hedges and fences presented barriers on which resistance was focused.</p>
<p>This paper considers the intersection of these processes and experiences in an account of the creation and meaning of a regional landscape undergoing enclosure that includes episodes of particular places in the making. It draws on research conducted as part of the Changing Landscapes, Changing Environments project at the Universities of Hertfordshire, Sussex and Lincoln and funded under the AHRC’s Landscape and Environment Programme. Revisiting one of the most familiar and controversial topics of the long 18th century, the project explored the origins, experience and legacy of parliamentary enclosure in Northamptonshire and in doing so, asked important questions about enclosure’s long-term cultural impact.</p>
<p>For many historians, the enclosure of the English Midlands was first and foremost a story of dispossession and loss.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1474474011427361">8</xref></sup> Just as the medieval open fields were swept away by a new geometric landscape of straight hedges and roads, so too communal modes of agriculture gave way to new notions about a countryside in which private property was king. Jeanette Neeson has estimated that 49 per cent of those with land – and hence access to common rights – in Northamptonshire were dispossessed at enclosure, a finding which broadly concurs with E.P. Thompson’s assessment that enclosure made the poor ‘strangers in their own land’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1474474011427361">9</xref></sup> Yet relatively little consideration has been given to the enduring histories that surround enclosure episodes, and still less to the question of how individuals and communities understood and experienced the changing landscape around them. This is what this paper – and the larger project of which it is a part – aims to do.</p>

<sec id="section2-1474474011427361">
<title>Enclosure landscapes</title>
<p>Lying at the heart of the English Midlands, Northamptonshire is often seen as the classic parliamentary enclosure county.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1474474011427361">10</xref></sup> It experienced high levels of enclosure in the century after 1730: about two-thirds of Northamptonshire parishes were subject to an enclosure Act in this period and an estimated 50 to 60 per cent of the land in the county was enclosed by parliamentary means.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1474474011427361">11</xref></sup> Parliamentary enclosure certainly left its mark on the landscape, effecting a visual transformation which in many parts of the Midlands is still visible 200 years later.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1474474011427361">12</xref></sup> Enclosure under Parliamentary Act brought an end to the communal management of the open fields, extinguishing common rights and allocating discrete portions of land to individual landowners as private property. The new allotments were usually rectangular and the hedge lines straight producing a rectilinear pattern of fields often laid out with little reference to earlier field boundaries. Oliver Rackham estimates that somewhere in the region of 200,000 miles of hedgerow were planted nationally in the century after 1750, much of it in the Midlands.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1474474011427361">13</xref></sup> The impression of uniformity was further underlined by the fact that the hedges were typically made up of a single species, usually hawthorn (<italic>Crataegus monogyna</italic>), also known as ‘whitethorn’ or ‘may’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1474474011427361">14</xref></sup> The comprehensive nature of the process by which the fieldscape was remodelled is signalled by comments from an early 18th-century tithe case from Litchborough, where the defendant argued that 50 years after the 1648 enclosure:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the lands, furlongs and nature of the said field [are] wholly altered and so confounded by the said Inclosure . . . that it is become impossible to [discover] where or how either the glebe land or lands of the other proprietors did lie before the said Inclosure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1474474011427361">15</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Nor were the hedgerows the only new feature in the landscape. Enclosure commissioners had the power to re-align existing roads and stop up other routes, as well as determine the width of roads and verges.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1474474011427361">16</xref></sup> Many pre-enclosure roads were re-aligned to offer more direct routes across the landscape and completely new road networks were sometimes laid out, as under the 1809 enclosure Act for Helpston, Glinton, Peakirk, Maxey, Northborough and Etton.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1474474011427361">17</xref></sup> The straight roads and rectangular fields east of Peakirk were created when Borough Fen was drained and enclosed under an Act of 1812, while the settlement of Newborough – organized, like the fields and roads, on a grid system – came into being a few years later in the 1820s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1474474011427361">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other changes to the landscape included the construction of new outlying farmsteads. Whereas the scattered open field strips which made up each tenants’ holding in the pre-enclosure period had been cultivated from farmsteads in the villages, enclosure tended to consolidate individual holdings into ring-fenced blocks. In these circumstances, it made sense to relocate farmhouses to sites on the newly consolidated farms. This was not always done immediately, and as late as 1794 James Donaldson could remark that there were few instances in the county of farmhouses ‘properly situated in the centre of their farms’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1474474011427361">19</xref></sup> New outlying farmsteads were, however, constructed following enclosure at Aynho, Wicken and Boughton near Northampton among other places.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1474474011427361">20</xref></sup> Boughton’s fields were enclosed in 1756 and a new farmhouse styled as a gothic folly was built in the 1770s as part of a wider programme of building works on the Earl of Strafford’s estate which included an obelisk, gatehouse and several triumphal arches.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1474474011427361">21</xref></sup> The 4th Duke of Grafton also built a number of model farmhouses on his estate in the south-west of the county in 1839–41 including Stoke Plain in Stoke Bruerne and Grove Farmhouse in Shutlanger, both parishes having been enclosed under a late Parliamentary Act of 1840.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1474474011427361">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless the comprehensive re-planning of the local landscape seen at places like Lilford in the Nene valley – where the local landowner removed the village and demolished the church at the same time as enclosing the open fields and remodelling his parkland – remains relatively unusual.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1474474011427361">23</xref></sup> While Northamptonshire has a higher proportion of post-1700 settlement desertions (11%) than either Leicestershire (5%) or Oxfordshire (3%), most were not directly associated with parliamentary enclosure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1474474011427361">24</xref></sup> Where villages were removed in order to create new parkland settings for country houses in the 18th or early 19th centuries as at Brockhall and Overstone, enclosure had usually taken place by non-parliamentary means a century or more earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1474474011427361">25</xref></sup> Similarly, model villages like Sywell were by and large Victorian rather than Georgian interventions in the landscape, as were the estate cottages, schools and churches built on the Spencer estate around Althorp.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1474474011427361">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The length of time which elapsed between enclosure and Victorian efforts to remodel the countryside underlines the long-term nature of the changes which shaped the modern landscape. Even in the heart of the English Midlands, the parliamentary enclosures were part of a much longer process of landscape change and enclosure ongoing since at least the late 15th century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1474474011427361">27</xref></sup> In the case of Northamptonshire, no less than 35 parishes or townships were partially or wholly enclosed before 1600, and another 74 before the first wave of parliamentary enclosures began around 1730.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1474474011427361">28</xref></sup> According to the 1607 Inquisitions of Depopulation, more than 27,000 acres in the county had been enclosed and almost 1500 people evicted between 1578 and 1607.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1474474011427361">29</xref></sup> Much land in the western and central parts of the county was enclosed for sheep grazing and families like the Spencers, Ishams and Treshams kept huge numbers of sheep on the sites of former hamlets and villages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1474474011427361">30</xref></sup> Elsewhere, ‘field closes’ – enclosures managed outside the communal arable system but still seasonally thrown open to common grazing – prefigured more formal enclosure arrangements, as they also did in other parts of England.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1474474011427361">31</xref></sup> Thus, while privately owned land was not always physically hedged, hedgerows were far from an unknown feature of the landscape. Peter Tillemans’ early 18th-century pen and wash drawings of Northamptonshire document the open nature of the pre-enclosure countryside at the same time as suggesting it was neither as bleak nor as unvaried as later pro-enclosure commentators would argue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1474474011427361">32</xref></sup> Although in some areas there was said to be ‘not a hedge, or a tree for more than a mile together’ as John Mastin noted of pre-enclosure Naseby in the 1790s, elsewhere hedges were relatively common.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1474474011427361">33</xref></sup> Hedging accounts for Guilsborough in 1764–5 reveal the existence of considerable numbers of hedges and hedgerow trees in the pre-enclosure landscape, and here at least the earlier hedgerows were clearly re-used at parliamentary enclosure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1474474011427361">34</xref></sup></p>
</sec>

<title>An improved landscape?</title>
<p>While neither privately owned closes nor hedgerows were a completely new feature in the mid-18th-century landscape, the commissioners’ fondness for straight lines meant that the field and road patterns created by parliamentary enclosure were distinct from the more irregular fieldscapes created by earlier piecemeal enclosures in neighbouring areas. Opinions on the new hedges themselves – and the landscapes they delineated – varied widely. The Northamptonshire poet John Clare abhorred the new hedges and fences, writing moving elegies to the lost pre-enclosure landscape. For Clare, the new hedges imprisoned men and sheep, restricting their freedom of movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1474474011427361">35</xref></sup> Clare was the son of a farm labourer but others further up the social hierarchy felt similarly, if for very different reasons. Having previously enjoyed ‘excellent scampering over downs, heaths and commons’, John Byng, Viscount Torrington considered that ‘riding is ruin’d by the new enclosures’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1474474011427361">36</xref></sup> Some people found the new post-enclosure landscape disorientating or even traumatic. The Northamptonshire artist George Clarke reportedly lost his way in new enclosures between Scaldwell and Lamport in the winter of 1867. Having been missing all night, a local search party was dispatched who found Clarke:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>in a very sad condition, having got into a part of a field bounded by two fences, which had confused him, and he had walked backward and forward until he fell exhausted. A cart was procured, and poor Clarke was taken home, but he was never really well again and died about a year afterwards.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1474474011427361">37</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet Byng’s foxhunting contemporaries among the aristocracy and gentry appreciated the added difficulty and excitement created by the new hedgerows.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1474474011427361">38</xref></sup> The Pytchley country in the north and west of Northamptonshire was known for its huge thorn fences and double ditches and as Brooksby noted in <italic>The Field</italic>:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In the Pytchley country you want a good horse; for on a bad one you will see nothing; on a fair one you will lose your nerve, but on the best, you will be able to enjoy yourself as you can nowhere else in the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1474474011427361">39</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Agricultural commentators and improvers were equally enthusiastic advocates of newly hedged landscapes. The pro-enclosure clergymen Reverend James Tyley, rector of Great Addington, described the unenclosed heaths so beloved by Clare as ‘unbroken tracts [that] strained and tortured the sight’, while Arthur Young used picturesque terminology to describe recently enclosed landscapes in the Midlands, south of England and Wales.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1474474011427361">40</xref></sup> There were, nevertheless, differences of opinion even within polite society and individuals on occasion changed their minds about enclosure and improvement. In 1792, at the outset of his career the landscape gardener Humphry Repton told a sceptical John Byng that enclosure was ‘a fine invention and a noble thing’. Later, during the decline of his career in 1816, he was highly critical of enclosure as part of the unsympathetic and excessive landscape modifications carried out on the estates of the nouveau riche, a viewpoint in part informed by Repton’s own exclusion from landed society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1474474011427361">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Contemporaries thus varied widely in their assessments of the landscapes created by parliamentary enclosure, and individual landowners who embraced the improving ideology espoused by men like Young and William Marshall might nonetheless feel ambivalently about certain aspects of improvement. One example from Northamptonshire will suffice. Elizabeth Prowse of Wicken Park on the Northamptonshire/Buckinghamshire border was a committed improver.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1474474011427361">42</xref></sup> As a propertied woman actively involved in estate management and improvement, she also represents a group – that is, female landowners – almost entirely written out of the enclosure story. Having gained control of the Wicken property at her husband’s death in 1767, Prowse spent more than 40 years improving the newly-enclosed estate. Alongside extending the house and landscaping the gardens, park and woodlands, Prowse invested in drainage works, hedging and marling on both the home farm and tenants’ farms. She also experimented with new crops and new agricultural technologies, as well as convincing her tenants to take long-term leases, presumably as a means of encouraging them to make similar improvements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1474474011427361">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>At the same time, Prowse sometimes felt uneasy about both the visual and socio-economic consequences of improvement. In an estate notebook, she criticized improvements made by her predecessor at Wicken, noting how he had cut down an avenue and ‘destroyed’ a pond.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1474474011427361">44</xref></sup> The reference to the destruction of the avenue hints at wider anti-improvement sentiments, and Prowse was certainly deeply aware that the social and economic costs of enclosure were often borne disproportionately by the poor. She quotes Nathaniel Kent on the subject in her memoirs, and like him, saw agricultural labourers as the very ‘nerves and sinews’ of rural society, instituting a programme of educational and philanthropic projects at Wicken which directly benefited the poorest local residents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1474474011427361">45</xref></sup> This included improving the estate cottages, providing free schooling for the cottagers’ children, selling subsidized foodstuffs and founding a Sunday school.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1474474011427361">46</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1474474011427361">
<title>Experiencing enclosure</title>
<p>Contrary to the fears of critics of improvement like Robert Southey, Edmund Burke and William Cowper – shared in part by more recent leftist histories which have pointed to enclosure’s calamitous impacts on the poor – parliamentary enclosure did not always signal a sudden and catastrophic end to traditional and communal ways of life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1474474011427361">47</xref></sup> Looking at enclosure from the kind of long-term perspective adopted in this paper helps to highlight some of the things that did not change. In Northamptonshire at least, there are clear continuities in the social and cultural life of communities before and after enclosure. One strand of the Changing Landscapes, Changing Environments project focused on the local church, investigating how the supposedly catastrophic changes brought about by parliamentary enclosure were registered in church buildings, landholding and parish administration. The results were surprising: while enclosure Acts reorganized both the glebe and tithes, with the glebe usually being consolidated into blocks and the tithes commuted for new allotments, the architecture and ceremonies of the local church were little affected by enclosure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1474474011427361">48</xref></sup> Despite securing valuable new landholdings, only a handful of Northamptonshire churches were rebuilt in the years immediately following enclosure and in most places, churches were re-pewed only in the first half of the 19th century, some decades after the parishes had been enclosed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1474474011427361">49</xref></sup></p>
<p>Evidence from a large sample of Northamptonshire churchwardens’ accounts and vestry minutes demonstrates that enclosure also left the organization of the parish vestry and the traditional round of items paid for by it largely unchanged. Parish sponsored vermin control is one such item, of interest here for what it tells us about how communities experienced enclosure but also of potential significance within the wider literature on animal geographies which has so far said little about vermin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1474474011427361">50</xref></sup> Across early modern Britain, churchwardens paid out bounties on a variety of animal and bird species – including sparrows, hedgehogs, moles, foxes and polecats – designated as vermin by Tudor Acts of Parliament because of the threat they posed to scarce food supplies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1474474011427361">51</xref></sup> Given they were paid from parish rates, one might expect vermin bounties to disappear once the common fields had been enclosed and the benefit of vermin control accrued to individual landowners rather than the community at large. Yet vermin payments continued unhindered through the 18th-century enclosures, trailing off only in the 1820s and 1830s as parish government was reformed. This was the case even in places like Staverton and Yelvertoft where more than 90 per cent of the parish was enclosed under Parliamentary Act.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1474474011427361">52</xref></sup> In other words, parish sponsored vermin control continued even in those communities where parliamentary enclosure had its biggest impact and we might therefore expect to see the most radical changes to the social and cultural life of communities.</p>
<p>That bounties were still paid on a whole array of animal and bird species suggests that professional vermin catchers and village children alike continued to have access to the post-enclosure allotments in order to kill vermin. As a comparison of the churchwardens’ accounts and other local records demonstrates, vermin bounties were paid to a wide variety of individuals drawn from across the social and age spectrum – including sizeable farmers, labourers, cottagers’ children, elderly paupers and gamekeepers to big estates – most of whom brought in only a small number of animal carcasses in any one year. This then was a highly participatory – if also strongly gendered – activity, a form of popular hunting sanctioned by parish vestries which continued into the post enclosure period, even as the Game Laws were increasingly tightened in the last quarter of the 18th century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1474474011427361">53</xref></sup> As one mid-18th century newspaper had it, ‘in the Country where they have no Game, those pass for Sportsmen who shoot Sparrows’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1474474011427361">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Common Law did not recognize entry into private property while pursuing vermin as trespass.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1474474011427361">55</xref></sup> An important ruling of 1809 in the Hertford Assizes drew a distinction between vermin and game including foxes, determining that foxhunters could be prosecuted for trespass where they pursued their quarry over private property but leaving the law on vermin untouched.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1474474011427361">56</xref></sup> Vermin catchers’ right to enter another individual’s property was rendered increasingly doubtful as property rights solidified in the mid-19th century, but as late as the early 20th century, defendants brought before the Northamptonshire Petty Sessions for game trespass continued to claim that they had been shooting vermin – including small birds, crows and rats – rather than game, a defence which was successful in a significant number of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1474474011427361">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>The evidence of vermin control tells us about some of the ways contemporaries experienced enclosure, particularly how they encountered and physically negotiated the new hedgerows. While both former commoners and those shooting game were excluded from the new allotments, parishioners pursuing vermin could enter into privately owned closes. This underlines the permeable nature of the new hedgerows – at least while the hedges were still young – as well as the new ideas of private property embodied by them. The post-enclosure countryside was after all a living landscape which took time to grow – and to heal. While the new hedgerows were not always the ‘physical check to movement’ Nicholas Blomley has suggested, they were, nevertheless, an important site at which enclosure could be negotiated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1474474011427361">58</xref></sup></p>

<title>Opposing enclosure</title>
<p>In early 16th-century Northamptonshire, hedge-breaking was a relatively common way of contesting enclosure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1474474011427361">59</xref></sup> The point in breaking hedges was to allow cattle to graze on the land, but by filling in the ditches and digging up roots those involved in enclosure protest made it difficult and costly for enclosers to re-enclose quickly. That hedges were not only dug up but also burnt and buried draws attention to both the considerable time and effort which was invested in hedge-breaking and to the symbolic or ritualistic aspects of enclosure opposition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1474474011427361">60</xref></sup> Nor was hedge-breaking the only means of opposing enclosure and the consequent loss of common rights. Other forms of direct action against enclosure included impounding or rescuing livestock, the continued gathering of previously common resources such as firewood, trespassing in parks and warrens, and even ploughing up land which had been converted to pasture or warrens, all of which might involve landowners and tenants in surprising alliances against manorial tenants or freeholders who sought to enclose land. Numerous such incidents were reported to the Star Chamber and Chancery courts at Westminster, whose records also preserve evidence of individuals and groups attempting to prosecute Northamptonshire landowners over illegal, depopulating enclosures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1474474011427361">61</xref></sup> Thus, the Midland Rising of 1607 – a wave of enclosure riots and public assemblies which began in Northamptonshire in late May and later spread to Leicestershire and Warwickshire – was preceded by more than a century of small-scale, local enclosure riots often combined with litigation at the central equity courts. The rioters of 1607 again focused their attention on hedgerows, pulling down and burning hedges in enclosed townships like Rushton, Newton, Pytchley and Haselbech, all of which had been depopulated for sheep grazing in the decade or so before the uprising.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1474474011427361">62</xref></sup> In these instances, hedge-breaking functioned not as a means of negotiating an ongoing enclosure within a specific locality, but as a wider commentary on the actions of individual landowning families like the Treshams of Rushton as well as a demand that the king take action to address illegal depopulating enclosures.</p>
<p>Like the opponents of the 16th-century enclosures, those fighting parliamentary enclosure in the later 18th century also combined legal proceedings with direct action at least some of which was focused specifically on hedges. Opposition to social and agricultural change might be registered in a number of different ways in 18th and early 19th-century England, of which both violence against animals and tree maiming – the latter closely related to hedge-breaking – have been the subjects of recent historical-geographical interest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1474474011427361">63</xref></sup> Neeson’s study remains the most detailed account of opposition to the 18th-century enclosures in Northamptonshire. She highlights considerable resistance to enclosure which usually began long before the Bill was taken to the Commons and continued long after the Act received the Royal Assent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-1474474011427361">64</xref></sup> As she points out, anti-enclosure petitions were lodged for 18 Northamptonshire enclosures and one in three successful bills went before Parliament with more than 10 per cent of local landholders refusing to sign them. That 22 per cent of bills were dropped without facing any formal parliamentary challenge may indicate the strength of local opposition, as may the number of years between the first unsuccessful attempts to enclose parishes like Corby, Aynho and Ringstead and their final enclosure up to 60 years later.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-1474474011427361">65</xref></sup> Other non-parliamentary means of negotiating enclosure included local counter-petitions, appeals to neighbouring landowners for support, anonymous threatening poems, refusals to mark out lands for survey and even the theft of the enclosure plan and field books for Wellingborough, all of which put enclosers to additional time and expense.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-1474474011427361">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>Enclosure riots were also recorded at West Haddon, Raunds, Werrington and Wilbarston, often following rejected parliamentary petitions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-1474474011427361">67</xref></sup> Opponents of the West Haddon enclosure sent a petition to Parliament in March 1764, but the bill was passed later in the spring. In July 1765, an advert appeared in the Northampton Mercury inviting ‘Well-Wishers’ to take part in a football game in the open fields on the 1st August, the day after the final common-field harvest had been completed. The assembled mob pulled up fences standing in the fields and burnt them, along with other fencing waiting to be put up, altogether said to be worth £1,500.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-1474474011427361">68</xref></sup> Hedge-breaking and wood-stealing were also reported at Hardingstone, Duston, Warmington and Northampton, while at Guilsborough, gates and fencing were stolen from the local landowners involved in the 1764 enclosure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-1474474011427361">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the Guilsborough landowners, John Bateman, had also run into resistance a few years earlier when he had enclosed parts of the open fields for plantations and improvements to his garden. We know from a number of suits and countersuits lodged at the Assizes that Batemen attempted to prosecute various locals for trespass, claiming they had taken ‘great &amp; frequent pains’ to continue a footway by trampling the grass in his closes, filling in ditches and removing gates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-1474474011427361">70</xref></sup> Something similar was reported after the enclosure of Northampton, when the Mercury ran a notice threatening with prosecution those who ‘since the Shutting up of the common . . . have taken the Liberty to force a Way, by Breaking down the Fences, Riding, and exercising their Horses’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-1474474011427361">71</xref></sup> There was still considerable ill feeling about the enclosure of the commons and the new network of route ways it created two years later, when the gates and stiles were again pulled down by unknown persons, this time in the middle of the night.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-1474474011427361">72</xref></sup> Enclosures re-routed or removed rights of way, hence people acted out their hostility to the new landscape and landholding structures by continuing to use stopped footpaths. Through repetitive bodily action, they literally re-inscribed old route ways onto the post-enclosure landscape, trampling the grass under human feet and horses’ hooves – a practice which recalls Ingold’s and Tilley’s ideas about dwelling and taskscapes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-1474474011427361">73</xref></sup> Importantly, we only know of these incidents because of the subsequent court cases or the threats of legal action which appeared in local newspapers, a reminder of the methodological difficulties inherent in recovering the kinds of repetitive and everyday activities which so often go unrecorded in archival sources.</p>
<p>With the obvious exception of John Clare, the commentaries on the visual and social impacts of the new hedgerows discussed earlier mostly represent the views of large landowners and land agents, all of whom had an economic or professional interest in enclosure and improvement. By contrast, the accounts of enclosure riots – like the example of vermin control – reveal much about the ways more ordinary people experienced enclosure episodes. They allow us to explore popular reactions to enclosure and the strategies, including hedge-breaking, trespass, litigation and parliamentary counter-petitions, by which individuals, groups and communities could oppose it. The evidence from Northamptonshire clearly demonstrates that hedges and fences were seen as sites at which to contest enclosure. Hedges were broken as part of both local negotiations over ongoing enclosures and as a wider commentary on the progress and impacts of depopulating enclosure, as in the 1607 Midland Rising. Moreover just as hedge-breaking was not the only means of negotiating enclosure, so too field boundaries were not the only sites at which anti-enclosure protest could take place. Instead, individuals and groups might oppose enclosure at the village pound or on former commons where villagers continued to collect firewood, wild foods or fish, as well as by moving through the landscape along discontinued rights of way. Many of these sites continued to be significant foci for enclosure protest throughout the period under discussion here, just as several of the same strategies for opposing enclosure – notably, hedge-breaking and animal trespasses – are also evident in both the 16th-century and 18th-century accounts of protest. Thus there are clear continuities in the way communities reacted to enclosure over the period, at the same time as there are also obvious discontinuities: there were, for example, fewer public assemblies and appeals to the law in the 18th and early 19th centuries, in part because enclosure was no longer illegal as it had been in the 16th century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-1474474011427361">74</xref></sup></p>

<title>Landscape in the making: stories so far</title>
<p>This paper set out to rethink and revise enclosure narratives, to thicken the concept of enclosure by researching a particular landscape in the making. In telling Northamptonshire’s enclosure story, the paper has pointed to the complexities of the enclosure process, arguing for a more nuanced account of enclosure’s long-term impact. Parliamentary enclosure reshaped certain elements of the landscape – most notably hedges, roads and farmsteads – producing the ‘planned countryside’ which today dominates much of the English Midlands. Yet it was also part of a much longer process of landscape change. Enclosure in its parliamentary form was by no means an unprecedented innovation in the landscape: in Northamptonshire as in other parts of England, considerable acreages were enclosed in the 15th and 16th centuries, and elsewhere informal enclosure arrangements sometimes prefigured the division and hedging of the land under Parliamentary Act. Moreover, enclosure neither completely closed down access to the countryside nor brought an end to traditional ways of life. Important aspects of village life including church services, architecture and administration were largely untouched by enclosure and, as the example of vermin control demonstrates, the new hedges were not always the impermeable barriers to movement Clare and others imagined them to be. Instead, both foxhunters and vermin-catching parishioners continued to pursue their prey across the newly enclosed landscape: the hedges could be negotiated via gaps, gates and stiles and the new allotments entered, if only in certain circumstances. Nor did parliamentary enclosure fully complete the process whereby complex use rights eventually gave way to individualized property rights. The legal right of vermin catchers to enter another man’s property continued into the 19th century, and the fact that those prosecuted for game trespass in the early 1900s continued to claim they had been shooting vermin indicates just how long memories might survive about these rights of access.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-1474474011427361">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>Just as enclosure experiences varied across time and space, so too opinions on the new landscapes created by enclosure were widely divergent. The politics of enclosure were, of course, immensely complicated and landowners themselves sometimes felt ambivalently about the enclosure of their lands, as the example of Elizabeth Prowse demonstrates. As a result, landowners might support more ordinary villagers in their opposition to enclosure, though these alliances were continually shifting and potentially highly transitory. In discussing these individuals and groups, the paper has also brought new archival materials to bear on the enclosure story. By using the records of parish administration, the accounts and correspondence of propertied women, and court papers and other documents relating to enclosure opposition, the paper has highlighted the role played by ordinary villagers and female landowners in negotiating enclosure in both its parliamentary and earlier forms. It has thereby drawn attention to some of the people so often written out of the enclosure story, assigning them an active role in the unfolding histories of the English countryside.</p>
<p>In eschewing the established narratives of enclosure, the paper has pointed instead to a landscape made up of a multiplicity of enclosure stories. In doing so, it borrows something both from Barbara Bender’s ideas about landscapes which are ‘always in the making’ and from Doreen Massey who, in a recent essay reflecting on Keiller’s film ‘Robinson in Ruins’, argued for a way of understanding landscape as ‘a simultaneity of stories-so-far’, all of them political in being ongoing and unfinished.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-1474474011427361">76</xref></sup> Unlike the model of a palimpsest periodically wiped almost clean and written over, thinking about landscape in this way encourages us to recognize a cumulative, constantly unfolding longer-term perspective on change. It helps us focus on enclosure not as the inevitable outcome of new capitalist ideas about space, property and the individual – or as Whiggish histories might have it, the key moment in the long march of Enlightenment – but instead as both an ongoing process and a contested practice. At the same time, it also enables us to take account of narrative precisely as a perspective, as a representation, a way of making sense of transformations and dislocations, as well as continuities, in the histories of land and life.</p>

<p>Work on the chronology of enclosure has highlighted the scale of enclosure in the period before 1700 – by which date Wordie estimates that up to 71 per cent of the country had been enclosed – while research on enclosure’s geographies has drawn attention to those parts of south-west and south-east England where early enclosure had its biggest impact.

<p>Glebe was property assigned to a local church, which was used to support the clergyman. It usually included the parsonage house and gardens along with agricultural land, which the clergyman might either farm himself or lease out. Parishioners paid one-tenth of their annual agricultural produce to the Church as tithes. These were paid either in kind or cash, but were usually given up in exchange for parcels of land – typically equal to one-fifth of arable and one-ninth of pasture – when a parish was enclosed under Parliamentary Act.</p>

<p>This statement is based on a survey of the faculty registers of the Diocese of Peterborough dated between 1709 and 1840, which are stored at Northamptonshire Record Office. The information from the faculties was cross-referenced against information on standing buildings evidence for church building work in the period 1700–1900, drawn from Pevsner’s <italic>Buildings of England</italic>, the List of Buildings of Special Architectural and Historic Interest and site visits carried out by project team members in conjunction with English Heritage staff. Exceptions include: St John Evangelist, Wicken which was rebuilt in association with an informal enclosure of 1757; St Peter and St Paul, Cosgrove where the church was comprehensively remodelled in the years between the Enclosure Acts of 1767 and 1775; and Lilford, where the church was demolished shortly after the enclosure of the open fields in 1772.

<p>This and the following two paragraphs are based on a systematic analysis of parish sponsored vermin regimes in 96 Northamptonshire parishes, representing one-third of the historic county. For all parishes, detailed surveys of surviving churchwardens’ and constables’ accounts were conducted for the period 1700–1900. The records of 41 parishes (some 43%) of the original sample made references to bounties for vermin and it is on these that the following section is based. See also M. Cragoe and B. McDonagh, ‘Introducing Continuity to Narratives of Parliamentary Enclosure: The Limits of Change in a Midland Landscape’, presented at the RGS-IBG annual conference, 26 August 2009.</p>
