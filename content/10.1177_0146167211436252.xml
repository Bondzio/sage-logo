<abstract>
<p>The present research examines the role of allocations of losses versus gains on the emergence of unethical behavior as a function of people’s social value orientation. The authors demonstrate that (a) proselfs regard unethical behavior to prevent losses as more justified than prosocials (Study 1) and (b) proselfs engage in more unethical behavior to prevent losses than prosocials (Study 2). These differences are explained by prosocials’ greater concern for harm to interdependent others in the domain of losses. A third study further substantiates these findings by revealing that unethical behavior to prevent losses increases among prosocials as harm to others is reduced. In sum, these results reveal that depending on whether people attend only to their self-interest or also consider the outcomes of others, losses either may increase or curtail unethical conduct. Considering social value orientations thus may reconcile conflicting theoretical perspectives on the impact of losses on social decisions.</p>

<body>
<p>Over recent years, an increasing number of business and political scandals involving immoral and unethical practices have emerged, and in everyday life too, such moral transgressions occur frequently (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0146167211436252">Banaji, Bazerman, &amp; Chugh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0146167211436252">DePaulo &amp; Kashy, 1998</xref>). Many of such transgressions revolve around achieving larger profits or <italic>gains</italic>. This observation does not only follow from high-profile business scandals (e.g., the case of Bernard Madoff, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0146167211436252">Kramer, 2009</xref>), but it has also been supported by experimental data which show that individuals are willing to engage in unethical behaviors like lying, cheating, and stealing when they can obtain higher payoffs by doing so (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167211436252">Croson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167211436252">Gino, Ayal, &amp; Ariely, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167211436252">Greenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167211436252">Koning, Van Dijk, Van Beest, &amp; Steinel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211436252">Mazar, Amir, &amp; Ariely, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167211436252">Mead, Baumeister, Gino, Schweitzer, &amp; Ariely, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Life, however, does not only provide opportunities to promote one’s own gains. Rather, people also have to deal with situations in which potential losses can emerge (e.g., pay cuts, layoffs, and so forth). Do people resort to unethical behavior as readily when confronted with such losses as with gains? Or, may they perhaps be even more inclined to do so when faced with losses? This question is not well understood. From a theoretical point of view, this question is interesting, because the literature provides contradictory perspectives on the impact that losses may have. On one hand, insights building upon the concept of loss aversion (the notion that people perceive losses as more negative than they regard gains of an equal magnitude as positive, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211436252">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167211436252">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981</xref>) suggest that self-interest looms larger when people are faced with losses. Research indeed shows that losses may enhance people’s concern for their self-interest and thus give rise to selfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167211436252">Brewer &amp; Kramer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167211436252">Poppe &amp; Valkenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167211436252">Sondak, Neale, &amp; Pinkley, 1995</xref>) and unethical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167211436252">Kern &amp; Chugh, 2009</xref>) behavior. On the other hand, insights rooted in the literature on bargaining suggest that the interests of <italic>others</italic> loom larger when people are faced with losses. Findings in line with this notion suggest that losses may enhance people’s concern for the outcomes of others and for fairness (i.e., the do-no-harm principle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167211436252">Baron, 1996</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167211436252">Leliveld, Van Beest, Van Dijk, &amp; Tenbrunsel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167211436252">Messick &amp; Schell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167211436252">Tornblom &amp; Jonsson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167211436252">Van Beest, Van Dijk, De Dreu, &amp; Wilke, 2005</xref>), thus suggesting that people might be <italic>less</italic> inclined toward selfish and unethical conduct when confronted with losses, in spite of the looming personal costs they face in this domain.</p>
<p>How can these contradicting perspectives be reconciled? We suggest that the possible impact of losses on ethical decisions may depend on interpersonal differences in social value orientation (SVO; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167211436252">Van Lange, 1999</xref>). SVOs are individual differences in the way people evaluate outcomes for themselves and others in interdependent situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0146167211436252">Kuhlman &amp; Marshello, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167211436252">Messick &amp; McClintock, 1968</xref>). These orientations reflect people’s relative concern for their self-interest and for the interests of others, and represent different perspectives on the types of decisions and actions that people consider to be moral and justified when interacting with others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167211436252">Van Lange, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167211436252">Van Lange &amp; Kuhlman, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on these insights, we develop the argument that people with different SVOs may interpret impending losses differently (i.e., in terms of consequences for themselves vs. in terms of consequences for themselves and others) and may also differ in their preference for actions that prevent such losses at the expense of others through selfish or unethical means. We thus reason that interpersonal differences in SVOs may explain people’s ethical decisions when faced with losses and thus may help to explain the inconsistent reactions to loss (i.e., enhancing selfishness or concern for others) that have been documented in previous research.</p>
<sec id="section1-0146167211436252">
<title>SVO and Construal of Social Decisions</title>
<p>SVOs are stable interpersonal orientations that can be distinguished on the basis of the relative weight that is assigned to either outcomes for oneself and to outcomes for interdependent others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167211436252">Messick &amp; McClintock, 1968</xref>). Generally, two major orientations are distinguished: proself orientation—which reflects concern for maximizing outcomes for oneself, with little concern for the outcomes of others—and prosocial orientation—which reflects concern for both outcomes for oneself and outcomes for others, by maximizing joint outcomes and equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167211436252">Van Lange, 1999</xref>). People with either orientation therefore differ substantially in the outcomes they seek to attain when making social decisions and the interests they take into account when doing so.</p>
<p>This distinction also suggests that people with different SVOs <italic>understand</italic> social decisions from very different perspectives (i.e., outcome transformation, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0146167211436252">Kelley &amp; Thibaut, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167211436252">Kuhlman, Camac, &amp; Cunha, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0146167211436252">Rusbult &amp; Van Lange, 2003</xref>). Proselfs primarily seek to attain outcomes that benefit themselves, with little concern for the outcomes of others. They thus understand social decisions particularly in terms of the implications they have for themselves, thereby paying little attention to the implications for others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167211436252">Kuhlman et al., 1986</xref>). Prosocials, in contrast, seek not only to attain outcomes that benefit themselves but also exhibit concern for the outcomes of others. They thus understand social decisions particularly in terms of the implications they have for <italic>both</italic> themselves and others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167211436252">Kuhlman et al., 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>The notion that proselfs and prosocials may understand social decisions from these different perspectives also has important implications for their views on how one should act in such situations, particularly with regard to the appropriateness of benefiting oneself at the expense of others. Proselfs, who exhibit little concern for the outcomes of others, regard it as rational and smart to benefit oneself at the expense of others and are less inclined to regard such actions in terms of morality. Prosocials, in contrast, who do exhibit concern for what consequences their decisions have for others, regard self-benefiting social decisions as immoral and wrong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167211436252">Van Lange &amp; Kuhlman, 1994</xref>). This difference is also reflected in their actual tendencies toward such behavior, with studies revealing that proselfs are more inclined to further their self-interest at the expense of others than prosocials in a wide range of situations—from decisions to cooperate with strangers to citizenship, volunteerism, and even extending to political orientation and voting (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0146167211436252">Penner &amp; Finkelstein, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0146167211436252">Rioux &amp; Penner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167211436252">Van Lange, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0146167211436252">Van Lange, Bekkers, Chirumbolo, &amp; Leone, in press</xref>). In sum, Proselfs and prosocials thus differ substantially in what interests they take into account when making social decisions, particularly with regard to their concern for the interests of others. Consequently, they also take different perspectives on what decisions are permissible when one’s interests oppose those of others, with proselfs using a more lenient and self-serving stance on morality than prosocials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0146167211436252">Sattler &amp; Kerr, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167211436252">Van Lange &amp; Kuhlman, 1994</xref>).</p>

<title>SVO and Ethical Decisions When Faced With Loss</title>
<p>The idea that proselfs and prosocials take different perspectives on social decisions is of great importance for understanding ethical decisions in the face of losses. As noted, the literature provides contradictory perspectives on the impact that losses may have. Some research suggests that losses may evoke greater selfishness through loss aversion (loss aversion effect; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167211436252">Brewer &amp; Kramer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211436252">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167211436252">Poppe &amp; Valkenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167211436252">Sondak et al., 1995</xref>), whereas other research suggests that losses may evoke greater concern for the interests of <italic>others</italic> through aversion to inflicting harm upon them (do no harm effect; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167211436252">Baron, 1996</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167211436252">Leliveld et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167211436252">Messick &amp; Schell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167211436252">Tornblom &amp; Jonsson, 1985</xref>). The fact that proselfs and prosocials differ in their relative concern for either interest implies that different implications are likely to loom larger when people with either orientation are confronted with losses (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167211436252">De Dreu &amp; McCusker, 1997</xref>). Moreover, the finding that proselfs and prosocials take contrasting perspectives on morality suggests that people with either orientation may differ in their tendency to use unethical behavior when confronted with such prospects.</p>
<p>Which concerns will dictate the decisions of proselfs versus prosocials? Proselfs interpret decisions particularly in terms of what they mean for their self-interest. For proselfs, particularly the implications that losses entail for their self-interest therefore are likely to loom larger when they are faced with losses. Given that proselfs have been shown to use a more self-serving view of morality, and to display greater willingness to benefit themselves at the expense of others, they can be expected to be more inclined to avert impending losses by imposing them upon others by deceiving them (i.e., a loss aversion effect).</p>
<p>Prosocials, in contrast, interpret decisions in terms of what they mean for <italic>both</italic> their self-interest and for the interests of others. For prosocials, the implications that losses entail for <italic>others</italic> will thus loom larger as well, instead of only the implications that they entail for themselves. As such, for prosocials, losses will magnify the harmful consequences that deception would inflict on others and thus may limit their inclination to avert impending losses through such means (i.e., a do-no-harm effect). Taken together, we suggest that losses will loom larger in different ways for proselfs and prosocials, and thus have the potential to increase (a loss aversion effect) or decrease (a do-no-harm effect) unethical behavior, depending on whether they are interpreted in terms of consequences for oneself or in terms of consequences for both oneself and others. This idea therefore is consistent with theorizing that has characterized loss aversion as a more individual-focused decision strategy and do-no-harm as a more other-oriented strategy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0146167211436252">Van Beest &amp; Van Dijk, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0146167211436252">
<title>The Present Research</title>
<p>In the present research, we examine how the impact of impending losses on people’s tendencies to resort to unethical behavior depends on interpersonal differences in SVO. We predict that losses will evoke more unethical behavior among people with a proself (i.e., self-interested) orientation than among people with a prosocial (i.e., other-regarding) orientation, while we expect such differences to be less pronounced in the domain of gains, where the impact of social orientations is less prominent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0146167211436252">De Dreu &amp; McCusker, 1997</xref>). Moreover, we expect that for proselfs, losses will evoke more unethical behavior than gains (i.e., a loss aversion effect), whereas we expect losses to evoke less unethical behavior than gains for prosocials (i.e., a do-no-harm effect).</p>
<p>We test these hypotheses in three studies. In Study 1, we examine whether people’s SVOs may explain their <italic>judgments</italic> of the appropriateness of using unethical behavior to prevent losses, versus to achieve gains. In Study 2, we examine whether people’s SVOs may explain their <italic>actual</italic> tendencies to use unethical behavior (i.e., deception) to prevent losses, versus to achieve gains, in a bargaining game. Moreover, as our framework assumes that such tendencies are rooted in people’s concern for the consequences (i.e., harm) for others—the major motivational difference between proselfs and prosocials—we also examine whether differences in this motive may mediate the differences between their respective tendencies to use unethical behavior within either domain. Finally, in Study 3, we provide further evidence for this process by examining how the presence or absence of harm to others may affect prosocials’ willingness to use deception to prevent losses, versus to achieve gains.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0146167211436252">
<title>Study 1</title>
<p>In Study 1, we presented participants with a number of statements about the appropriateness of various unethical acts in the context of a gain or loss frame and measured their judgments of the appropriateness of these acts as a function of their SVO.</p>
<sec id="section5-0146167211436252">
<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section6-0146167211436252">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 66 Dutch students (32 men and 34 women), who participated for course credit or a monetary reward of € (about US$3). They were randomly assigned to conditions in a two-level (frame: gains vs. losses) between-participants design.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0146167211436252">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Upon their arrival in the laboratory, participants were seated in individual cubicles, containing a computer that was used to present the materials and register their responses. We told participants that they were required to respond to a number of unconnected questionnaires.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0146167211436252">
<title>Measuring SVOs</title>
<p>We assessed participants’ SVO using the decomposed game measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167211436252">Van Lange, 1999</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0146167211436252">Messick &amp; McClintock, 1968</xref>). This measure presents participants with a series of nine decomposed games. In each of these games, participants choose between three options, each of which represents a distribution of valuable outcomes between themselves and an anonymous other. These outcomes are presented in terms of points, and participants are asked to imagine that these are valuable, both to themselves and to the other. To assess participants’ general tendencies toward others, the other was said to be someone they did not know and would never knowingly meet in the future. To induce a sense of interdependence, the instructions briefly note that the other would be making similar choices.</p>
<p>In each game, one option offers maximal joint outcomes and equality (the prosocial option), one option offers maximal individual outcomes for the participant (the individualistic option), and one option offers maximal relative difference between the outcome of the participant and that of the other (the competitive option). An example of one choice item is the following: Option A, 480 points for self and 80 points for other; Option B, 540 points for self and 280 points for other; and Option C, 480 points for self and 480 points for other. In this example, Option A represents the competitive option, because it provides a larger difference between the outcomes of oneself and those of the other (480 − 80 = 400) than either Option B (540 − 280 = 260) or Option C (480 − 480 = 0). Option B represents the individualistic choice, because the outcome for oneself is larger (540) than that in Option A (480) or Option C (480). Finally, Option C represents the prosocial choice, because it provides a larger joint outcome (480 + 480 = 960) than does either Option A (480 + 80 = 560) or Option B (540 + 280 = 820), and a smaller discrepancy between own and other’s outcomes (480 − 480 = 0) than either Option A (480 − 80 = 400) or Option B (540 − 280 = 260). The prosocial option therefore represents both a concern for collective outcomes and a concern for equal outcomes, as past research has revealed that people who consistently choose the prosocial option tend to do so for both concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167211436252">Van Lange, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants are categorized as prosocials, individualists, or competitors if they consistently select the corresponding option in at least six of the nine games (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211436252">McClintock &amp; Allison, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167211436252">Van Lange &amp; Kuhlman, 1994</xref>). The latter two categories are typically combined into a single category of proselfs, people who seek to enhance own outcomes, either in an absolute sense (individualists) or in a relative or comparative sense (competitors; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0146167211436252">Van Dijk, De Cremer, &amp; Handgraaf, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167211436252">Van Lange &amp; Kuhlman, 1994</xref>). The present sample consisted of 30 prosocials and 30 proselfs. Six participants could not be classified and were omitted from the sample (in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167211436252">Van Lange, 1999</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section9-0146167211436252">
<title>Measuring judgments of appropriateness</title>
<p>To compare judgments of the appropriateness of unethical behavior, we presented participants with six statements about unethical behavior, which—depending on condition—were framed in terms of gains or losses (items are shown in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0146167211436252">appendix</xref>).

<title>Study 2</title>
<p>Study 1 shows that individuals with prosocial and proself orientations have different judgments on the appropriateness of unethical behavior that serves to prevent losses rather than to achieve gains. In Study 2, we examine whether these views are also reflected in their actual tendencies toward unethical conduct when faced with potential losses or gains.</p>
<p>We examine this question by presenting participants with an Ultimatum Bargaining Game (UBG) task (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211436252">Guth, Schmittberger, &amp; Schwarze, 1982</xref>), framed in terms of gains or losses (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167211436252">Leliveld et al., 2009</xref>). In this task, participants must divide either a positive or negative endowment between themselves and another individual. By taking a bigger share of positive endowments, or leaving a bigger share of negative ones, participants can benefit themselves. However, in order to be carried out, their decision must be ratified by their partner. This means that people cannot overly benefit themselves without risking that their decision will be rejected, which would leave either player with nothing (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0146167211436252">Camerer, 1992</xref>). In the present version of the game, participants <italic>can</italic> freely increase their winnings (or decrease their losses), however, by resorting to unethical means. We provide participants with an information advantage, so that only they know the exact size of the endowment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167211436252">Van Dijk &amp; Vermunt, 2000</xref>). By over- or understating this value to their partner, participants can make an unfair offer appear like a reasonable share, enabling them to increase their advantage without risk of rejection (see the “Method” section that follows for more details). In line with the findings of Study 1, we expect that proselfs will engage in more deception than prosocials when faced with losses, whereas we expect those differences to be less pronounced in case of gains. Moreover, we expect that proselfs will engage in more deception when faced with losses rather than gains, whereas we expect prosocials to engage in less deception when faced with losses rather than gains. Finally, in line with our framework, we expected that these differences in deception would be mediated by concern for harm to others—the major motivational difference between proselfs and prosocials.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 63 Dutch students (19 men and 44 women), who participated for course credit or a monetary reward of €4 (about US$6). They were randomly assigned to conditions in a two-level (frame: gain vs. loss) between-participants design.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0146167211436252">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>We again assessed SVOs using the decomposed game measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0146167211436252">Van Lange, 1999</xref>). The sample consisted of 39 prosocials and 22 proselfs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0146167211436252">
<title>The experimental task</title>
<p>Participants were presented with an UBG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0146167211436252">Guth et al., 1982</xref>), modified by (a) presenting outcomes in terms of losses in the loss condition (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167211436252">Leliveld et al., 2009</xref>) and (b) providing scope for deception by presenting information about the endowment size asymmetrically (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167211436252">Van Dijk &amp; Vermunt, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants learned that they would be paired with another participant through the computer network and that in each pair of participants, a valuable shared endowment had to be divided. Participants were assigned the role of Allocator. They had to propose how this endowment should be divided between themselves and their partner. Their partner (Recipient) could decide whether to accept the offer or not. If he or she would accept, the endowment would be divided as proposed; if not, both players would receive nothing.</p>
<p>The valence of the shared endowment was manipulated. In the gain condition, pairs could divide a collective bonus of 100 points (a decision which provides gain). In the loss condition, pairs had to settle a collective debt of 100 points from individual accounts which each contained 100 points (a decision which causes loss). Note that the payoff structure in either condition is identical: Participants can earn a maximum outcome of 100 points (by taking all of the bonus or having their partner pay all of the debt) and a minimum outcome of 0 points (by taking nothing or paying everything, or upon rejection; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167211436252">Leliveld et al., 2009</xref>). As points were worth 10 cents each, participants’ decisions had actual financial consequences for themselves and their partners: Depending on how the endowment was divided, each could earn between €0 and €10 (US$12).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0146167211436252">
<title>Measuring unethical behavior</title>
<p>As noted, the Recipient’s power to reject unfavorable offers means that Allocators cannot overly benefit themselves in UBGs (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0146167211436252">Van Dijk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167211436252">Van Dijk &amp; Vermunt, 2000</xref>). Our measure of unethical behavior played into this notion. Participants learned that only they knew the size of the endowment, whereas Recipients did not (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167211436252">Van Dijk &amp; Vermunt, 2000</xref>). Instead, Recipients would have to rely on what information the Allocator gave them. This notion gave participants an opportunity to deceive them.</p>
<p>Before making their offer, participants were asked to inform their partner about the size of the endowment, so that he or she could better judge their subsequent offer. Under the pretext that the endowment size differed between dyads, participants could choose between two messages: (a) a message that truthfully reported the size of their endowment (i.e., 100 points) and (b) a message that misrepresented the size of their endowment. In the gain condition, the second option claimed the endowment to be smaller than its true value (i.e., 60 points); in the loss condition, it claimed the endowment to be bigger (i.e., 140 points). By choosing the dishonest option, participants could make a selfish offer appear more favorable; for example, an offer of 30 points to the Recipient would appear more attractive if the Recipient believes the shared endowment to be 60 points, rather than 100; likewise, an offer for the Recipient to pay 70 points would appear more attractive if the Recipient believes the shared debt to be 140 points, rather than 100. Thus, the task provided participants with the chance to increase their gains or decrease their losses by deceiving their partner. Participants’ decisions to report the endowment size truthfully or not therefore were our behavioral measure of unethical behavior (deception: 1 = <italic>yes</italic>, 0 = <italic>no</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0146167211436252">
<title>Manipulation checks</title>
<p>Three manipulation checks tested the effectiveness of the frame manipulation: “I will lose points if the Recipient accepts my offer” (1 = <italic>completely false</italic>, 7 = <italic>completely true</italic>), “In this task, I can chiefly sustain losses,” and “In this task, I can chiefly achieve gains” (recoded); answers were combined into a single scale (α = .87). Three comprehension checks tested participants’ understanding of the scope for deception, by examining comprehension of (a) the endowment size (b) the Recipient’s knowledge of the latter, and (c) which message would enable the highest payoff for themselves. Participants who answered any questions incorrectly reread the instructions.</p>

<title>Concern for harm as a mediator</title>
<p>Our framework assumes that proselfs and prosocials differ in their tendencies toward deception in the face of losses because they differ in their concern for its consequences for others in this domain. We tested this hypothesis using mediated moderation analyses. We used a bootstrap procedure developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0146167211436252">Preacher, Rucker, and Hayes (2007)</xref> to assess the (moderated) indirect relationships because this type of procedure does not rely on assumptions about underlying distributions. In this procedure, the initial effect values (<italic>B</italic> coefficients) of the independent variable (at the two levels of the moderator) are derived from ordinary least squares regression procedures. Because the dependent variable is categorical in nature, the effect of the mediator on the dependent variable is derived from logistic regression analysis. Bootstrapping then generates a sampling distribution of the <italic>product term</italic> of these two coefficients by randomly sampling sets of cases from the original sample and computing the product term. This procedure was followed 3,000 times in our study. Further corrections are then applied to adjust for differences between the product term derived from the original sample and the median product terms of the bootstrap estimates, resulting in bias-corrected confidence intervals (CIs).</p>
<p>Bootstrap tests of the simple indirect effects showed that SVO and deception had a significant indirect relationship, via concern for harm, in the domain of losses (indirect effect = 2.87, 95% CI = [0.10, 4.67]) but not in the domain of gains (indirect effect = 0.52, 95% CI = [−2.16, 3.20]), thus providing evidence that differences in deception rates between proselfs and prosocials in the domain of losses are explained by differences in their concern for harm to others.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0146167211436252">
<title>Study 3</title>
<p>The results of Study 2 reveal that proselfs, but not prosocials, are inclined to engage in greater deception when faced with the prospect of losses rather than with the prospect of gains. Thus, contrary to the predictions of prospect theory, the results reveal that prosocials do not display loss aversion. Although we found no evidence that prosocials engaged in <italic>less</italic> deception when faced with losses than when faced with gains (as we had predicted), the results did reveal that prosocials displayed <italic>more</italic> concern for harm to interdependent others in the domain of losses. As a consequence, prosocials exhibited more concern for harm to others in the domain of losses than proselfs, and this difference was found to explain the difference between their deception rates in this domain. This result is consistent with the do-no-harm effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167211436252">Baron, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Research suggests, however, that to identify behavior as truly motivated by do-no-harm, it is important to distinguish such actions from self-interest (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0146167211436252">Leliveld, Van Dijk, &amp; Van Beest, 2008</xref>). In terms of the present research, this means that to provide evidence that prosocials indeed refrain from using deception in the domain of losses out of concern for harming others, we need to show that people with this orientation <italic>will</italic> engage in greater deception in this domain (thereby furthering their self-interest) when doing so is <italic>not</italic> harmful to others. Thus, to provide further evidence that aversion to harming others underlies the absence of the loss aversion effect among prosocials requires a crucial third study, in which prosocials again receive the opportunity to increase their gains or reduce their losses by cheating, but where doing so either does or does not inflict harm on other individuals.</p>
<p>In Study 3, we therefore focus on individuals with a prosocial orientation. As research has revealed that SVOs exhibit substantial levels of stability over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0146167211436252">Kuhlman et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0146167211436252">McClintock &amp; Allison, 1989</xref>), participants who had displayed a prosocial orientation in a prior study participated in the present experiment. As in Study 2, participants were again presented with the opportunity to increase their gains, or reduce their losses, through deception. Crucially, however, we manipulated the consequences of deception: either harming another individual or having no impact on other individuals. To this end, we modified the UBG task (see Study 2), so that not only the valence of the endowment could be varied (positive or negative) but also the consequences that deception would entail. In the harm condition, the situation was identical to that in Study 2: Deception increased one’s own gains, or reduced one’s own losses, but harmed the outcomes of another individual (i.e., the interaction partner). In the no harm condition, in contrast, participants interacted not with another individual but with a preprogrammed computer strategy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167211436252">Andreoni &amp; Miller, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167211436252">Rilling et al., 2002</xref>). In this condition, deception therefore did not harm the interests of another individual but only limited the outcomes attained by the computer (see the “Method” section that follows for more details). In line with our theoretical framework and the findings of Study 2, we expected that prosocials would display greater deception in the domain of losses when deception would not be harmful to others (i.e., a loss aversion effect) than when deception would be harmful to another individual (i.e., a do-no-harm effect). We expected those differences to be less pronounced in the domain of gains.</p>

<title>Manipulation of harm</title>
<p>In the harm condition, the experimental task was identical to that used in Study 2: A valuable shared endowment had to be divided between two individuals, and the valence of the endowment was manipulated. Participants, in the role of Allocator, had to decide how to divide the endowment. The interaction partner, in the role of Recipient, could decide to accept or reject the offer but could be deceived by providing false information about the endowment size.</p>
<p>In the no harm condition, the instructions were identical, but participants learned that they would conduct the decision task with a preprogrammed computer strategy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0146167211436252">Andreoni &amp; Miller, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0146167211436252">Rilling et al., 2002</xref>), who would act as Recipient. It was explained that this computer player had been programmed to evaluate their offer and would decide whether to accept or reject it. However, participants could deceive the computer player by providing false information about the endowment size (of which only they had been notified by the experimenter).

<p>Deception rates were analyzed using binary logistic regression, with frame and harm entered as the categorical predictors. This analysis revealed the expected interaction effect between frame and harm, <italic>B</italic> = 2.54, Wald = 4.37, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Simple effects revealed that prosocials engaged in significantly more deception when facing losses in the no harm condition (<italic>M</italic> = 70.0%) than when facing losses in the harm condition (<italic>M</italic> = 13.2%), <italic>B</italic> = 2.69, Wald = 8.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .005, whereas deception rates when facing gains did not differ between the no harm condition (<italic>M</italic> = 33.3%) and the harm condition (<italic>M</italic> = 30.0%), <italic>B</italic> = 0.15, Wald = 0.04, <italic>ns</italic>. In addition, the analysis also revealed a significant main effect for harm, <italic>B</italic> = 1.31, Wald = 5.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, indicating that deception rates were higher in the no harm condition (<italic>M</italic> = 50.0%) than in the harm condition (<italic>M</italic> = 21.4%).</p>
<p>The results of Study 3 thus reveal that when faced with losses, prosocials are more inclined to engage in deception when doing so will not harm the interests of other individuals. These findings therefore suggest that prosocials <italic>suppress</italic> their tendency to prevent losses through deception in situations where doing so is harmful to others. Thereby, these findings underline that differences in concern for harmful consequences for others explain people’s ethical decisions in the domain of losses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>When it comes down to evaluating and identifying unethical conduct, both the public eye and psychological research tends to focus on acts committed for gain (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0146167211436252">Croson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167211436252">Gino et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0146167211436252">Greenberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167211436252">Koning et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0146167211436252">Mazar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0146167211436252">Mead et al., 2009</xref>). The present research focused on a different motive that might lead individuals to commit unethical behavior, namely preventing impending losses. Our findings reveal that impending losses have an important impact on ethical decisions, but this impact is not universal. Rather, our findings suggest that the impact of losses depends on how people <italic>interpret</italic> them. People with a proself orientation—who focus primarily on what consequences decisions have for themselves—regard unethical behavior as more justified when faced with losses than when faced with gains. Therefore, proselfs resort to such behavior more readily when it helps them to prevent losses, despite its harmful implications for others. People with a prosocial orientation, in contrast—who also attend to what consequences their decisions entail for others—regard acting unethically to prevent losses as far less justified than proselfs, in light of its harmfulness to others. Their greater concern for harm to others means that prosocials are less inclined to use unethical behavior to prevent losses than proselfs, and only display increased levels of unethical behavior in this domain when they are certain that no others are harmed by it. Our findings thus suggest that losses may “loom larger” in different ways: for some representing a threat to their self-interest which warrants ethical transgressions and for others representing a domain where such transgressions seem particularly grave due to their harmfulness to others.</p>
<sec id="section34-0146167211436252">
<title>The Impact of Loss on Unethical Behavior</title>
<p>A first important contribution of the present research is that it underscores the importance of impending losses as a reason for people to commit ethical transgressions. This is particularly important given the fact that prior research has given much attention to motives related to gains and has studied ethical conduct mostly in situations that feature these positive outcomes. On one hand, the present research reveals that impending losses may serve as a powerful motive for unethical conduct—potentially even more so than gains (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167211436252">Kern &amp; Chugh, 2009</xref>). On the other hand, the present research also reveals important interpersonal differences in the way people respond to losses, rooted in how they interpret social decisions. Although losses may be a sufficient reason to transgress for some, for others they may instead magnify reasons to uphold ethical standards (i.e., their harmfulness to interdependent others). These findings are particularly poignant as they emerged not only on self-reported intentions and tactics in scenarios (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0146167211436252">Kern &amp; Chugh, 2009</xref>, for such an approach) but also on actual decisions in highly interdependent settings, with tangible, monetary consequences. People with different orientations therefore chose to benefit themselves by acting unethically—or to refrain from doing so—in spite of the financial consequences this entailed for themselves and their partners.</p>

<sec id="section35-0146167211436252">
<title>SVO and the Impact of Losses</title>
<p>A second important contribution of this research is that it identifies a moderator that helps to reconcile contrasting theoretical perspectives regarding the impact of losses, namely, interpersonal differences in SVO. Previous findings on the impact of losses have been mixed, with some reporting increased concern for self-interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0146167211436252">Brewer &amp; Kramer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0146167211436252">Poppe &amp; Valkenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0146167211436252">Sondak et al., 1995</xref>) and others reporting increased concern for the interests of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0146167211436252">Leliveld et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0146167211436252">Messick &amp; Schell, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0146167211436252">Tornblom &amp; Jonsson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167211436252">Van Beest et al., 2005</xref>). Our research suggests that these inconsistent findings may be explained by interpersonal differences in the way people interpret social decisions. For people who understand social decisions particularly in terms of their consequences for themselves (i.e., proselfs), the implications that losses have for their self-interest may loom especially large in this domain. When confronted with this prospect, proselfs display behaviors that reflect loss aversion, such as being more likely to deceive others than when being confronted with gains. For people who also understand social decisions in terms of their consequences for others (i.e., prosocials), in contrast, the harm that preventing losses may inflict on others might also loom large in this domain. When confronted with this prospect, prosocials display behaviors that reflect aversion to harming others, such as suppressing tendencies to use deception when such transgressions are harmful to others. Thus, these findings suggest that social orientations may explain people’s tendencies to display loss aversion or harm aversion when confronted with loss and therefore enable a theoretical framework in which both the loss aversion effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0146167211436252">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0146167211436252">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981</xref>) and the do-no-harm effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0146167211436252">Baron, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167211436252">Van Beest et al., 2005</xref>) are integrated.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to note that contrary to our expectations, prosocials were not <italic>less</italic> likely to use deception when faced with losses than when faced with gains; instead, valence particularly affected deception among proselfs. These findings differ from previous research on the do-no-harm effect, which has particularly revealed behavioral differences among individuals who <italic>do</italic> consider the interests of others, namely, prosocials and high perspective takers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0146167211436252">Van Beest et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167211436252">Van Beest, Wilke, &amp; Van Dijk, 2003</xref>), and not among people who do not, like proselfs. For example, research on social exclusion revealed that decisions to exclude others differed strongly among prosocials, depending on the consequences of exclusion for the excluded player; in contrast, such consequences had no impact on the decisions of proselfs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0146167211436252">Van Beest et al., 2003</xref>). Why did valence not affect deception among prosocials but did so among proselfs?</p>
<p>We believe that these differences are rooted in the outcome variable that was investigated in the present research, namely, deception. Deception differs from other self-regarding behaviors because it is covert, rather than overt, and is prohibited by norms of morality and fairness. This has two important implications. First, due to its moral implications, the base rates of deception may be lower than those of more discretional behaviors (like noncooperation), making it more difficult to identify reliable decreases due to possible floor effects. And second, due to its covert nature, examining deception may reveal behaviors that otherwise are constrained by fairness norms. Society generally disapproves of excessive selfishness, and displaying such behavior may invoke punishment and exclusion. Deception enables people to overcome those constrains by allowing them to benefit themselves without being detected. Therefore, deception may have enabled proselfs to act on their preferences (i.e., maximizing their self-interest) without fear of reprisal (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0146167211436252">Van Dijk et al., 2004</xref>), while obscuring responsiveness to loss among prosocials due to low base rates (note that the pattern of results among prosocials did typically indicate lower deception rates in case of losses). Rather, the findings of Studies 2 and 3 suggest that with regard to deception, the behavior of prosocials may be understood more in terms of <italic>suppression</italic> in the domain of losses: If deception is not harmful to others, prosocials are more inclined to use it in the domain of losses; however, if deception is harmful to others, then these concerns loom larger in the domain of losses and overrule their private tendencies to use deception.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section36-0146167211436252">
<title>SVO and Ethical Decision Making</title>
<p>Another important contribution concerns the fact that our findings provide additional support for the idea that social motives may influence ethical decision making. Although research on social orientations has long implied that people with different motives may differ in what they regard as moral (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167211436252">Van Lange &amp; Kuhlman, 1994</xref>), only recently have studies begun to demonstrate that social orientations may affect people’s <italic>actual</italic> ethical decisions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167211436252">Koning et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167211436252">O’Connor &amp; Carnevale, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167211436252">Steinel &amp; De Dreu, 2004</xref>). Our present findings therefore complement and extend our understanding of ethical decision making in several ways. First, by revealing that the impact of social motives on unethical behavior may be magnified in the domain of loss. Our findings suggest that losses represent a catalyst that may both enhance and constrain unethical conduct, depending on people’s SVO. Second, by identifying a possible process that may explain these differences in ethical behavior: concern for consequences for others. Our findings reveal that attentiveness to the harm that deception entails for others (as demonstrated by prosocials) may suppress the catalyzing effect of losses on unethical conduct. Therefore, we identify an other-regarding motive that may influence ethical decisions—a finding that complements the more self-regarding processes like fear and greed that have been identified in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167211436252">Steinel &amp; De Dreu, 2004</xref>). And finally, by revealing that reluctance to deceive others need not reflect an aversion of unethical behavior in itself. Indeed, prosocials did display higher levels of deception when confronted with losses when deception was not harmful to others. This finding is in line with recent research showing that specific circumstances may evoke or suppress tendencies toward deception, such as being confronted with cooperative or competitive others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167211436252">Steinel &amp; De Dreu, 2004</xref>) or when being in a low- or high-power position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0146167211436252">Koning et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The fact that both the present and other recent studies reveal a relationship between social motives and ethical decision making is also important because it may cast new light on the roots of unethical conduct. Although previous insights have mostly linked ethical transgressions to people’s moral development (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0146167211436252">Kohlberg, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167211436252">Rest, 1986</xref>) or the centrality of morality in their self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0146167211436252">Aquino &amp; Reed, 2002</xref>), our findings illustrate that unethical conduct may also be rooted in the way that people <italic>interpret</italic> social decisions: in terms of outcomes for themselves or also in terms of outcomes for others. This reasoning implies that the outcomes people attend to could make them more or less attentive to important ethical cues, such as the consequences of their actions for others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0146167211436252">Tsang, 2002</xref>). When attending only to consequences for oneself, for example, tactics that benefit one’s self-interest may seem smart and appropriate. If one also attends to the consequences for others, however, the harm that such tactics would inflict on others may make them seem immoral instead (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0146167211436252">Van Lange &amp; Kuhlman, 1994</xref>). Similarly, decisions that benefit oneself at the expense of others could be justified more easily if one places little value on the consequences for others (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0146167211436252">Gino, Shu, &amp; Bazerman, 2010</xref>). Thus, people who focus on different outcome information when making decisions could differ in their awareness of the moral implications of their decisions (moral awareness; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0146167211436252">Rest, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0146167211436252">Reynolds, 2006</xref>) and in the ease with which they can justify immoral acts (i.e., moral distortions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0146167211436252">Bandura, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0146167211436252">Tenbrunsel, 1998</xref>). How these orientations relate to these processes, as well as to concepts like moral development, moral intuition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0146167211436252">Haidt, 2001</xref>), and empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0146167211436252">Detert, Trevino, &amp; Sweitzer, 2008</xref>), is an important question to which future research may provide further insight.</p>
<p>Furthermore, future research is also needed to understand the role of social motives in ethical decisions in more naturalistic settings. Unethical behaviors like deception are typically characterized by low base rates and therefore are difficult to study. For this reason, researchers often study them in situations that provide rather powerful cues for unethical behavior, such as having a confederate announce its possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0146167211436252">Gino et al., 2009</xref>) or, as in the present study, having participants choose between honest and dishonest options when they enjoy an information advantage (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0146167211436252">Boles, Croson, &amp; Murnighan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0146167211436252">O’Connor &amp; Carnevale, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0146167211436252">Steinel &amp; De Dreu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0146167211436252">Van Dijk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0146167211436252">Van Dijk &amp; Vermunt, 2000</xref>). Although this allows for better observation of these phenomena, with high levels of experimental control, it does raise the question to what extent such fairly explicit prompts may contribute to the results. In the present research, we attempted to conceal our intentions by framing the decision in terms of exchanging information and by claiming endowment sizes to differ between dyads (thus explaining the different message options). However, the study of these phenomena would greatly benefit if future research would also examine these processes in more naturalistic settings, outside the laboratory. We consider actual proxies of deception, such as theft rates in organizations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0146167211436252">Greenberg, 1990</xref>), as especially promising.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present research clearly shows that self-interested individuals are more likely to commit ethical transgressions in the domain of losses; however, people who also exhibit concern for the outcomes of others particularly attend to the harm that ethical transgressions entail for others in this domain. Thus, although impending loss may prompt some toward greater unethical conduct, for others, loss provides an additional reason to uphold their ethical standards in spite of its personal costs.</p>
