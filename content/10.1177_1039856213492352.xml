<title>Objective:</title>
<p>We performed a bibliometric study on scientific publications on atypical antipsychotic drugs (AADs) from Australia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1039856213492352">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Using the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, we chose those documents produced in Australia between 1993 and 2011, whose title included the descriptors atypic* (atypical*), antipsychotic*, second-generation antipsychotic*, clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, quetiapine, sertindole, aripiprazole, paliperidone, amisulpride, zotepine, asenapine, iloperidone, lurasidone, perospirone and blonanserin. We applied bibliometric indicators of production as well as dispersion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1039856213492352">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>We identified 438 relevant publications. The most widely studied AADs were clozapine (162 documents), olanzapine (103), risperidone (77) and quetiapine (42). There was a lack of exponential growth in publications over time, indicated by non-fulfilment of Price’s Law (correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic>=0.9195 after exponential adjustment <italic>vs. r</italic>=0.9253 after linear adjustment). Publications appeared in 148 different journals, with four of the top nine journals having an impact factor greater than 3; 84 of the articles appeared in the <italic>Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1039856213492352">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Despite Australian publications on AADs appearing in reasonably high impact journals, most were confined to a single Australian psychiatry journal and overall publications did not show exponential growth over the period studied. This might reflect, <italic>inter alia</italic>, the relative paucity of medication trials being performed in Australia.</p>

<body>
<p>In the past 20 years, numerous atypical antipsychotic drugs (AADs), including risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole and asenapine, have been introduced. The advent of these newer agents has been accompanied by a rise in the number of scientific publications pertaining to their pharmacology and clinical use. The current study assesses these trends in Australia.</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856213492352" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>We employed the EMBASE Biomedical Answer web (Elsevier BV, The Netherlands), which consists of MEDLINE (<italic>Index Medicus</italic>, US National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) and <italic>Excerpta Medica</italic> (Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).</p>
<p>We included documents containing, in the author address (AD) section, the descriptor Australia, and in the title (TI) section, the descriptors atypic* (atypical*), antipsychotic*, second-generation antipsychotic*, clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, quetiapine, sertindole, aripiprazole, paliperidone, amisulpride, zotepine, asenapine, iloperidone, lurasidone, perospirone and blonanserin, confining the year of publication to the period 1993–2011. We considered all original articles, reviews, editorials and letters-to-the editor; duplicated documents were deleted.</p>
<sec id="section6-1039856213492352">
<title>Bibliometric indicators</title>
<p>Price’s Law was used to analyse productivity by fitting exponential growth models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213492352">1</xref></sup> To assess whether the growth of AAD papers on antipsychotics follows Price’s Law, we made linear adjustments to the data obtained, according to the equation <italic>y =</italic> 3.1526<italic>x</italic> – 8.4737; and a further adjustment to an exponential curve, according to the equation <italic>y =</italic> 2.095<italic>e</italic><sup>0.193<italic>x</italic></sup>.</p>
<p>To assess the dispersion of scientific information, we applied Bradford’s Law. Bradford proposed a model of concentric zones of productivity, with decreasing density of information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213492352">2</xref></sup> Each zone would contain a similar number of documents, but the number of journals in which these are published would increase on passing from one zone to another. This model permits identification of the journals most widely used or with greatest weight in a given field of scientific production.</p>
<p>We also used the impact factor (IF) for 2011, calculated on the basis of the number of times the journal is cited in the source journals of the Science Citation Index (SCI) during the two previous years and the total number of articles published by that journal in those two years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213492352">3</xref></sup> In addition, we analysed the national participation index (PI) of Australia for overall scientific production (the ratio of the number of documents generated by Australia and the total number of documents on a particular topic).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213492352">4</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1039856213492352" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Our search yielded 438 original AAD documents: 162 related to clozapine, 103 to olanzapine, 77 to risperidone, 42 to quetiapine, 16 to amisulpride, 15 to aripiprazole, six to ziprasidone, four to paliperidone and one to blonanserin. Of these, 39.3% addressed ‘tolerance and safety’, 36.1% ‘clinical efficacy’, 15.1% ‘experimental pharmacology’ and 9.6% ‘not other specified’ (mainly, cost-effectiveness analyses, prescribing patterns and drug reviews). Clinical studies were mainly devoted to schizophrenia (<italic>n</italic> = 69) and bipolar disorder (18) and, to a lesser extent, depression (10) and dementia (7). The most productive institutions in AAD papers were The University of Melbourne (<italic>n</italic> = 25), Monash University (20), The University of Wollongong (19) and The University of Sydney (15).</p>
<p>The past 20 years has seen a marked increase in the number of Australian publications on AADs. This growth has been higher than Australian publications in biomedicine and health in general, as well as in the specific fields of psychiatry and neurology (full data available from the authors upon request).</p>
<p>Mathematical adjustment to an exponential curve produced a correlation coefficient <italic>r</italic> = 0.9195, with 15.45% of variance unexplained. In contrast, the linear adjustment resulted in a correlation coefficient of 0.9253, with 14.38% of the variance unexplained. Thus, Price’s Law was not fulfilled; if the data did fit Price’s Law, their <italic>r</italic>-value would be much smaller than 0.9195, indicating that the growth of publications in AADs would be quicker than that in the field of psychiatry in general.</p>
<p>The mean number of articles per Bradford zone was 73. The nucleus or first zone was made up exclusively of the <italic>Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry</italic>, with 84 articles, while the second zone included seven journals. A total of 148 different journals published material pertinent to this analysis; the nine most used journals accounted for 41.1% of all the publications.</p>
<p>The general contribution of Australian science in AAD had a global PI of 2.26 with respect to world production over the period under study. Among the countries generating AAD research, the most prominent is the US (PI = 29.11), followed by the UK (PI = 6.27), Germany (PI = 5.72), Canada (PI = 4.58) and Italy (PI = 4.29). If we consider the productivity of these countries specifically in the fields of psychiatry and neurology, only Spain of the 10 largest producers in biomedicine and health sciences (in the period 1993–2011) showed higher proportional productivity in AAD studies. Analysing the correlation between PI and the per capita health expenditure of each of the countries with the highest scientific production in health sciences, the distribution was quite similar, apart from China, although in this case it is due to the small Chinese per capita health expenditure (265 PPP int. $) (full data available upon request from the authors).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although the number of Australian AAD papers has increased substantially in recent years, the growth has not been exponential. This finding is at odds with data from countries such as Taiwan,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213492352">5</xref></sup> South Korea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213492352">6</xref></sup> and Japan,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213492352">7</xref></sup> where exponential growths in AAD publications have occurred. This discrepant finding may be due to Australia’s having had more interest in performing post-marketing type studies since regulatory clinical trials tend to be conducted in Europe or the US. Regulatory agencies in Taiwan, South Korea and Japan all demand data specifically from their populations and this might reflect more efficacy studies being conducted there than in Australia. These bibliometric data also show a close correlation with the prescription data in the respective countries. Between July 1995 and December 2001, the use of AADs in Australia increased from an estimated 0.27 to an estimated 3.83 AADs/1000 per day,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213492352">8</xref></sup> and the proportion of prescribed AADs increased from 61% in 2002 to 77% in 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213492352">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The greatest increase in the AAD scientific literature coincides with its approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US and other international regulatory agencies for the use of a number of AADs for treating bipolar disorder. AADs are also commonly used for many off-label indications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213492352">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213492352">11</xref></sup> In the analysis of individual AADs, clozapine was found to be the agent most widely studied in Australia: the increase in publications on clozapine coincided with the release of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) clinical practice guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213492352">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the current study, we also applied indicators of impact and excellence of the publications. The fact that such prestigious journals as the <italic>Journal of Clinical Psychiatry</italic> (IF = 5.799), <italic>Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology</italic> (IF = 4.857), <italic>International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology</italic> (IF = 4.578) and the <italic>Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology</italic> (IF = 4.098) published articles from Australia on AADs underlines the prominence that Australian psychiatry has acquired. But also of note is the extensive use of domestic journals by Australian researchers, with the <italic>Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry</italic> accounting for 19.2% of total production; with <italic>Australasian Psychiatry</italic> and the <italic>Medical Journal of Australia</italic> included, the proportion reached 25.8%.</p>
<p>During the period 1993–2011, papers in the area of psychiatry and neurology accounted for 14.4% of the total scientific production in Australia. As we have shown in recent studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213492352">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213492352"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213492352">7</xref></sup> scientific research on antipsychotic drugs is one of the fastest growing topics within the field of psychiatry. Also, by applying bibliometric tools, other authors have reported the research activity in the field of schizophrenia as greater than that in other psychiatric disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213492352">13</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section9-1039856213492352">
<title>Study limitations</title>
<p>Previous bibliometric studies have addressed limitations characteristic of this approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213492352">14</xref></sup> There are three main limitations in this study:</p>
<list id="list1-1039856213492352" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>We might have excluded some AAD papers where the authors did not put our study inclusion descriptors in the titles or as keywords. Moreover, journals that are not indexed in MEDLINE and <italic>Excerpta Medica</italic> during the study period could not be included.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In the AD section using the descriptor ‘Australia’, we included only those papers with authors specifying ‘Australia’ in their addresses. This might have led to some inaccuracies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The use of the SCI impact factor to determine the merit or quality of scientific contributions is debatable. There have been suggestions that universities should not mainly use the impact factor to evaluate the academic outputs of their faculty members.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213492352">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213492352">16</xref></sup></p></list-item>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study offers an objective picture of the current status of international research on AADs in Australia, using the parameters of quality and dissemination most commonly used in the field. Australia, whilst producing high quality research, does not show the exponential growth in publications found in a number of other countries.</p>
