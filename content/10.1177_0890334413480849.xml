<abstract>
<p>The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) was launched by the World Health Organization and United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund in 1991 following the Innocenti Declaration of 1990, of which New Zealand/Aotearoa was a signatory. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to implement BFHI by breastfeeding advocates, the New Zealand Breastfeeding Authority (NZBA) was established in 1999. Successful BFHI implementation was achieved through a number of factors, including the establishment of a national body (NZBA) with oversight of BFHI facility implementation and auditing, Māori and consumer participation at all levels, the recertification requirements for midwives of breastfeeding education by the Midwifery Council, and maternity facilities having paid BFHI coordinators. Once the NZBA was established, BFHI accreditation of maternity facilities had a rapid rise from 0% in 2000 to 96.1% in 2011 (74 of 77 facilities). Data collected over this period shows a 28.8-percentage-point increase of exclusive breastfeeding at discharge from maternity facilitates between 2001 (55.6%) and 2011 (84.4%). Future strategies focus on having all relevant community providers achieve Baby-Friendly Community Initiative accreditation and on the NZBA’s lobbying the government for initiatives that support, promote, and protect breastfeeding.</p>

The global uptake has been slow, and NZ/Aotearoa was no exception. A number of attempts made at the time by independent health professionals and community groups committed to breastfeeding in NZ/Aotearoa were unsuccessful at both regional and national levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334413480849">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0890334413480849">21</xref></sup> The political climate in the early 1990s was difficult, and economists had the short-term view that breastfeeding generated less income compared to formula.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334413480849">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0890334413480849">22</xref></sup> In 1997 the New Zealand College of Midwives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334413480849">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0890334413480849">23</xref></sup> set up the College Breastfeeding Initiative Taskforce, which invited all stakeholders involved with breastfeeding to attend a large forum with the aim of adapting the WHO/UNICEF BFHI tool to the NZ context. It was believed that the only way forward with the BFHI was to have a shared commitment by all stakeholders. The New Zealand College of Midwives offered its midwifery advisor as the coordinator, and the Royal New Zealand Plunket Society (the biggest well child health provider in NZ/Aotearoa) offered to provide secretarial support.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334413480849">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0890334413480849">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0890334413480849">24</xref></sup> No governmental funding was available at the time; therefore, both organizations shared the costs and relied on the goodwill of stakeholder organizations involved. This was the beginning of the New Zealand Breastfeeding Authority (NZBA). It was established as a nongovernment organization with charitable status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0890334413480849">23</xref></sup> The role of the NZBA was to develop an action plan for NZ/Aotearoa BFHI implementation and BFHI documents based on the global standards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0890334413480849">25</xref></sup> The intent of the documentation was to have “consistent, evidenced based, culturally appropriate practice where ever breastfeeding occurs.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334413480849">20</xref></sup> The role of the NZBA also included the following: coordination with the Ministry of Health (governmental) contracts; consultation with NZBA stakeholders; development, assessment, and accreditation of maternity facilities and evaluation of the national accreditation process; selection of delegates to become BFHI trainers and assessors; provision of education/training workshops for assessors; and the maintenance of a database of accredited assessors, maternity facilities, and education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334413480849">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once established, the NZBA started lobbying the government for implementation of the 4 goals of the 1995 Innocenti Declaration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334413480849">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0890334413480849">23</xref></sup> and in 2000, the NZ government became the 133rd country in the world to formally launch the BFHI, by officially recognizing and financing the NZBA to develop a hospital accreditation program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0890334413480849">24</xref></sup> BFHI accreditation of maternity facilities had a rapid rise from 0% in 2000 to 96.1% (74 of 77 facilities) in 2011.

<title>Māori Recognition through the Treaty of Waitangi</title>
<p>Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi is a significant document that was signed between Māori and Her Majesty Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom, on February 6, 1840.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0890334413480849">26</xref></sup> It is recognized by the government as a binding and guiding document for all aspects of life in NZ/Aotearoa (political, social, economic, and environmental).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0890334413480849">27</xref></sup> It recognizes Māori as the indigenous people of Aotearoa, and Te Reo Māori is 1 of 3 official languages. Sign language and English are the others. Traditional Māori society lived in tribal communities and placed great significance on breastfeeding and nurturing of the mother and the baby.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0890334413480849">28</xref></sup> Papakura (as cited in Ellison-Loschmann)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0890334413480849">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0890334413480849">30</xref></sup> reported that breastfeeding usually continued until the child was walking. This norm was modified through colonization and the long exposure to the Western model of care (not to breastfeed).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0890334413480849">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0890334413480849"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0890334413480849">32</xref></sup> The treaty is an integral part of the BFHI in Aotearoa. BFHI-accredited services must demonstrate standards of practice that indicate compliance to the treaty, incorporating the underlying principles of partnership, participation, and protection. These 3 principles were identified by the Waitangi Tribunal in the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 as a means of enacting the treaty into practice, and they are supported by other health legislation, such as the Public Health and Disability Act 2000.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0890334413480849">33</xref></sup> Māori representation occurs at all levels within the NZBA structure and is further strengthened through the Māori Advisory Group (Te Roopu Whakaruruahau) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0890334413480849">Figure 1</xref>) and an employed Māori advisor.</p>

<p>Consumer and consumer group representation at all levels of health care is recognized as an important aspect by society and the government.

<title>Lead Maternity Carer System</title>
<p>NZ/Aotearoa has a unique maternity system wherein most pregnant women choose a lead maternity carer (LMC) to provide their antenatal, labor and birth, and postnatal care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0890334413480849">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0890334413480849">38</xref></sup> An LMC can be a midwife (midwives are autonomous practitioners), a general practitioner, or an obstetrician working in the community. Most women chose an LMC midwife. The care is free of charge to the woman and baby. The care provided by the LMC is regulated by the Primary Maternity Services Notice (section 88)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0890334413480849">39</xref></sup> and includes referral guidelines for consultation or referral to a specialist, if required. An LMC can support women to give birth at home, at a birthing unit, or in a hospital. The LMC signs an access agreement with the maternity facility and is under obligation to support the implementation and practice of the BFHI. Therefore, maternity facilities need to provide not only a supportive breastfeeding environment and professional development for their staff but also an opportunity for the LMCs to participate in these. In addition to the access agreement requirements, midwives, who are regulated by the Midwifery Council of New Zealand, need to provide evidence of having attended a compulsory 3-hour professional breastfeeding education session to be able to receive their annual practicing certificate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0890334413480849">40</xref></sup></p>

<title>Publicly Funded Maternity Service</title>
<p>The public hospital service across NZ is divided into 20 district health boards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0890334413480849">41</xref></sup> Most boards provide at least secondary maternity services (<italic>secondary</italic> refers to providing specialist obstetric and pediatric care, including anesthetic, but acting as limited obstetric and neonatal referral centers, also known as <italic>level 2 facilities). Some boards</italic> have both secondary and tertiary maternity services (<italic>tertiary</italic> refers to being a major referral center for difficult obstetric and neonatal cases and providing intensive care facilities for women and babies, also known as <italic>level 3 facilities</italic>). There are also 54 primary maternity units throughout NZ/Aotearoa for normal birth service provision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0890334413480849">42</xref></sup> (used by women with “low-risk” factors, also known as <italic>level 1 units</italic>). There are considerable variations in socioeconomic compositions, ethnicity, and geographic coverage among district health boards. Some boards provide a maternity service for only high urban concentration; others have only rural or rural remote communities; and others have both. This needed to be reflected in BFHI assessments and audits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0890334413480849">43</xref></sup> For example, owing to bed shortages in level 2 and 3 facilities, transfer to a primary unit is often required 2 hours after a normal birth. This is a short time frame. To facilitate a speedy transfer, often the baby is weighed, measured, examined, and dressed as soon as possible after birth with little skin-to-skin opportunity.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health, as the government body responsible for specifying contractual maternity facility services, clearly outlines BHFI accreditation as a mandatory requirement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0890334413480849">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0890334413480849">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0890334413480849">45</xref></sup> This enabled the NZBA to develop resources for BFHI documentation and implementation, as well as a robust auditing process and training of assessors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334413480849">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0890334413480849">23</xref></sup></p>

Having such diverse membership can be challenging, but ultimately it has worked well in achieving BFHI and effecting change in national breastfeeding rates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0890334413480849">Table 1</xref>). A moderation panel evaluates the audits and provides the final accreditation. Paid staff members include an administrator, a learning and development facilitator, a BFHI–Baby Friendly Community Initiative coordinator, a Māori advisor, and an executive officer. BFHI assessors are trained and then contracted as required for audits. The NZBA is a small organization, with a low hierarchical structure where effective interactions can take place among all entities as the need arises for fostering successful BFHI implementation.</p>

<title>NZBA BFHI Resources</title>
<p>The NZBA has recognized the importance of generic resources to support the implementation of the BFHI in the maternity facilities. Resources include printed pamphlets for consumers and health professionals on the importance of skin-to-skin and rooming-in, as well as the BFHI process. Some of the printed resources have been translated into Te Reo Māori, and the “Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding” is available in 27 languages, as NZ/Aotearoa has a growing diverse multicultural population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0890334413480849">47</xref></sup> Other tools developed are BFHI pocket cards that cover, in addition to its goals, the WHO/UNICEF’s “International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes” and “Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding,” and the NZ Ministry of Health’s breastfeeding definitions. A short DVD showing the importance of skin-to-skin contact at birth with the baby self-latching has proven to be popular<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0890334413480849">48</xref></sup> (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.babyfriendly.org.nz/news-resources/nzba-resources/">http://www.babyfriendly.org.nz/news-resources/nzba-resources/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Further education guidelines for the BFHI in NZ were released in 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0890334413480849">49</xref></sup> These formed the basis for materials developed for a train-the-trainer education pack and for childbirth education. The train-the-trainer resource includes all materials needed for delivering BFHI education. The NZBA is responsible for offering the train-the-trainer workshops. The NZBA will also be launching an online education program in 2013. This resource will be available for anyone working with breastfeeding mothers, incorporating the different levels of involvement as identified for BFHI requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0890334413480849">50</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section8-0890334413480849">
<title>NZBA BFHI Audit Process and Results</title>
<p>In 2001, the Ministry of Health contracted the NZBA to assess 30 maternity facilities (36% of maternity facilities) before BFHI implementation. The audit reviewed each service’s implementation of the 10 steps (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0890334413480849">Figure 2</xref>). This was an important move, as the results provided a benchmark for the NZBA before BFHI implementation and a baseline for breastfeeding data collection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334413480849">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0890334413480849">44</xref></sup> It was also useful in helping individual services to understand what is needed to achieve BFHI accreditation. The initial audit identified only 7 facilities out of 30 as having met the BFHI standard of at least 75% for exclusive breastfeeding rate at discharge. The average rate on discharge from these facilities for exclusive breastfeeding was 55.6%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0890334413480849">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0890334413480849">52</xref></sup> Since 2001, the average rate of exclusive breastfeeding on discharge has steadily increased and reached 84.4% in 2011 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0890334413480849">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0890334413480849">50</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>Maternity facilities are reaccredited every 3 years with the same process as the initial audit, including interviews with mothers. The reaccreditation also includes reviewing the implementation of recommendations made at the previous audit. This is a major strength of the current BFHI audit system. Sometimes a lapse in breastfeeding practice occurs between audits. This is easily identified during a full audit reaccreditation and therefore can be addressed effectively. Following the initial audit, some services did not maintain an ongoing role for a BFHI coordinator to help continue records, standards, policies, education, required annual self-audit, and review of staff practice. The facilities that had a paid, dedicated BFHI coordinator with time allocated for the administration had fewer challenges at audits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0890334413480849">51</xref></sup> The required annual self-audit has also made a difference, with improved data collection and exclusive breastfeeding rates going up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0890334413480849">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>The NZBA, through regular BFHI audits, has noted a marked improvement in staff practice when measured against the 10 steps between 2001 and 2011 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0890334413480849">Figure 2</xref>). For comparison, see step 4, which advocates assisting mothers to place their babies skin-to-skin immediately following the birth and initiate breastfeeding within an hour of birth, if possible. The results show that 11 units in 2001 initiated skin-to-skin placement and assisted breastfeeding within an hour of birth and that 10 years later, in 2011, all 30 audited units (100%) supported this. Step 5 refers to showing mothers how to breastfeed and how to maintain lactation even if they are separated from their babies. The results indicate the same marked increase over the last 10 years, with 11 facilities practicing step 5 in 2001 and 30 in 2011. This means that more mothers are shown how to breastfeed and maintain lactation even if they are separated from their babies. Step 6 indicates that no food or drink other than breast milk should be given to the baby unless medically indicated. The audit results indicate that 12 units adhered to this step in 2001 and 30 units in 2011 (100%). BFHI audits have contributed to the greater awareness of this with significant results.</p>
<p>By the end of 2011, 74 of 77 maternity facilities have been audited (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0890334413480849">Table 1</xref>). This is a remarkable result for a small country with limited funding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0890334413480849">
<title>Future Directions</title>
<p>The next step is to achieve Baby Friendly Community Initiative accreditation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0890334413480849">51</xref></sup> for all relevant community providers. The average exclusive breastfeeding rate at discharge from maternity facilities has risen, but the community exclusive breastfeeding rates have not shown the same degree of improvement (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0890334413480849">Table 1</xref>). For example, in 2001, the rate was 31.7% at 3 months and reached 42% in 2011. The NZBA is strategically pursuing this goal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0890334413480849">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>Currently, the Parental Leave and Employment Protection (6 Months’ Paid Leave) Amendment Bill is being considered before parliament.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0890334413480849">54</xref></sup> The NZBA wrote a submission to support this change. Twenty-six weeks (6 months) of paid parental leave will support the BFHI and Baby Friendly Community Initiative and the NZ Ministry of Health’s optimal feeding recommendations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0890334413480849">55</xref></sup> to exclusively breastfeed for 6 months. Longer paid parental leave may mean that women who now decide not to initiate breastfeeding or to breastfeed for only a few weeks, because they need to return to paid work soon after the birth, may actually initiate breastfeeding and breastfeed longer. The NZBA has expressed interest in researching this hypothesis.</p>
<p>The NZBA and the Ministry of Health have produced documentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0890334413480849">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0890334413480849">57</xref></sup> to ensure that the intent and guiding principles of the “International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes” are considered by all involved with the health and well-being of families. The NZBA will continue to be involved to advise the government in their reviews of the accessibility, effectiveness, and monitoring of the Code.</p>

<title>Summary of Successful BFHI Implementation</title>
<p>Successful NZ/Aotearoa BFHI implementation was achieved through many activities. The initiation from health professional groups (New Zealand College of Midwives and Royal New Zealand Plunket Society), the shared commitment by stakeholders, the acknowledgment of the Treaty of Waitangi (with the principles of partnership, participation, and protection), and Māori and consumer participation at all levels, which included an appointment of a Māori advisor, contributed greatly to successful BFHI implementation and formed the NZBA organizational structure as it is today. Additionally, the Health and Disability Commissioner’s code of rights, the recognition of the “International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes” as a guiding document, and contractual governmental service specifications for maternity services, including mandatory BFHI assessments, ensured that BFHI requirements were met. Maternity services that had paid BFHI coordinators were more successful in meeting the requirements than those without. Educational resources (hard copy and online) for health professionals, consumers, and government bodies, including translation into Te Reo Māori and several other languages, were another milestone to further BFHI implementation. Other factors that contributed to successful implementation include: the publicly funded maternity system; the provision of a publicly funded LMC (known midwife or obstetrician) for pregnancy, labor, birth, and up to 6 weeks postpartum; committed BFHI–Baby Friendly Community Initiative well child providers as follow-on care; and the mandatory recertification requirements of breastfeeding education for registered midwives by the New Zealand Midwifery Council.</p>
