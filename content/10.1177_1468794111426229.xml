<p>This special issue of <italic>Qualitative Research</italic> explores recent advances in Qualitative Longitudinal (hereafter QL) research methods and the building of QL data resources for sharing and re-use. Our main focus is the work conducted under the ESRC Changing Lives and Times Initiative (Timescapes, 2007–12), which we attempt here to place in the broader context of methods and infrastructure development in the UK.</p>
<p>QL research – qualitative enquiry conducted through or in relation to time – is hardly new; it is part of a rich ethnographic tradition, spanning fields as diverse as social anthropology, oral history, and theatre studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1468794111426229">Kemper and Peterson Royce, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1468794111426229">McLeod and Thomson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1468794111426229">Saldana, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1468794111426229">Thomson and Holland, 2003</xref>). However, until recently QL methodologies were under-developed, datasets were scattered and unavailable, and the literature that explored the contours of the method and promoted its use was sparse.</p>
<p>This has begun to change over the past decade, with QL research gaining recognition as a distinctive way of knowing and understanding the social world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1468794111426229">Neale and Flowerdew, 2003</xref>). Researchers are routinely seeking to incorporate QL methods into their research design and a growing number of studies, ranging from the lived experience of welfare reform to the dynamics of transport and energy, are being funded by government, the ESRC and the main UK charities.</p>
<p>This growth reflects a need to better understand the lived experience of change and continuity in the social world, the processes by which change occurs, and the agency of individuals in shaping or accommodating to these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468794111426229">Neale, 2012</xref>). Understanding how and why change is created, lived and experienced is important in policy contexts where individuals or organizations are required to change their behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1468794111426229">Corden and Millar, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Designs and strategies for working through time are flexible and creative, but two approaches are commonly used. Prospective designs involve tracking individuals or groups through life course or policy transitions as they occur. Working flexibly, each wave of data collection is used to inform the next. The timeframes vary; tracking may be done intensively over the short term to capture particular processes of change through micro-biographical time or critical historical moments. Or tracking may occur over extensive periods of time, to discern changes over the life course, and with the potential to capture the wider sweep of macro-historical change. Repeat cross sectional designs, in contrast, may or may not involve the same individuals. These are commonly used to re-visit classic studies, thereby uncovering historical processes of change and continuity within specific communities or organizations.</p>
<p>Whatever the design, QL research enables an exploration of complex timescapes or flows of time – e.g. the pace of change; the nature of critical moments in an unpredictable life journey; the intersection of time and space to locate and contextualize experiences; and reflections on past and future at each new fieldwork encounter (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468794111426229">Finn and Henwood, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1468794111426229">Flowerdew and Neale, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1468794111426229">Thomson et al., 2002</xref>). The key theoretical approach underpinning the Timescapes initiative is the intersection of biographical, generational and historical time. These are the micro, meso and macro dimensions of enquiry, through which it becomes possible to understand the dynamic relationship between individual and collective lives, and broader patterns of social change. Prospective designs can be combined with retrospective life history accounts to enable the causes and consequences of change to be understood ‘backwards’, from the vantage point of the present. Likewise, capturing imaginary futures at each follow up is a powerful way to understand the changing aspirations of individuals, and how and why their life chances are forged, enabled or constrained over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1468794111426229">Neale, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>ESRC funding for Timescapes was a significant part of the developments outlined above, and has since fuelled further advances in QL methods and data resources. The initiative followed a major consultation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1468794111426229">Henwood and Lang, 2005</xref>) that revealed gaps in qualitative resources for social science research. This was particularly so within longitudinal research, which was, and remains, dominated by large scale cohort and panel surveys. The aim of the ESRC initiative was to scale up and promote QL research, create an archive of data for sharing, and demonstrate its re-use in ways that would complement the existing canon of longitudinal studies in the UK. To that end, we set up a network of empirical projects, led by leading exponents of the method in the UK, and designed to investigate the dynamics of relationships and identities across the life course. We collated data from the projects to establish a multi media archive, and have showcased and encouraged data sharing and secondary use of this resource, as well as building capacity in QL methods and ethics. These enterprises in turn were built on our commitment to advance understandings of time as a theoretical category, a methodological and ethical strategy and an important topic of enquiry in its own right (reflected in the corpus of writings produced across the Timescapes network (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.timescapes.leeds.ac.uk">www.timescapes.leeds.ac.uk</ext-link>).</p>
<p>The articles in this special issue illustrate some of the innovative and path breaking work undertaken in Timescapes and the interlocking nature of its structure; themes recur across the articles, inflected by the specifics of the individual contributions. In setting out to develop and expand a culture of QL research, we adopted a challenging and experimental approach, working at the cutting edge of temporal research, exploring new ways to share data and enhance analysis, and seeking to blur the boundaries around research and archiving, and primary and secondary use. Below we provide an overview of some of the key areas of our work, which are given more detailed treatment in the articles that follow.</p>
<sec id="section1-1468794111426229">
<title>The Timescapes projects</title>
<p>Our programme of research on relationships and identities through the life course has been carried out by a network of researchers from five universities (Leeds, London South Bank, Open University, Cardiff and Edinburgh), working in different disciplinary traditions (sociology, social psychology, social policy, oral history, health studies and cultural studies). We devised seven empirical projects that span the life course, focusing on: siblings and friendships in childhood; the unfolding lives of teenagers; motherhood across the generations; men as fathers; work-life balance in families with young children; grandparents and social exclusion; and the oldest generation (for details of the projects and teams, substantive, theoretical and methodological findings and extensive publications, see the Timescapes website).</p>
<p>Collectively these projects have followed the lives of over 300 individuals. The population samples are from all walks of life and live in highly varied communities throughout the UK. Four of the projects build on heritage data gathered from separately funded, earlier phases of the research, thereby increasing its longitudinal reach and historical value. The projects use a range of methods (in-depth interviews, ethnographic techniques, life histories and case studies) to capture the interior logic of people’s lives as they unfold. There is no one right way to design and conduct QL research and engage qualitatively with time: methods need to be tailored to specific research questions, population samples and disciplinary concerns.</p>
<p>The Timescapes projects are distinctive; each has its own substantive and disciplinary focus, methodological approach, and contributions to scholarship, enabling them to stand alone. Yet they also form a coherent whole and have engaged in valuable cross cutting work through our central strands of work, our residential and team meetings and our website: contributing to QL methods and ethics development, creating comparable data for the Timescapes Archive, exploring secondary analysis of the data, and addressing policy implications. This work is reflected in a number of edited collections, and website guides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1468794111426229">Bornat et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1468794111426229">Edwards and Irwin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1468794111426229">Edwards and Weller, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1468794111426229">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1468794111426229">Finney and Morton, 2011</xref>; Neale and Henwood, 2012; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1468794111426229">Shirani and Weller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1468794111426229">Thomson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Much of this work exemplifies the utility of working within a collaborative network. Timescapes has created a strong set of projects, with both individual and collective features, leading in their own strengths and enhancing the work of the programme.</p>

<title>Inventing adulthoods and men as fathers: case study analysis and ethical practice</title>
<p>The intricate work of the Timecapes projects is showcased in two articles in this issue, ‘Storying qualitative longitudinal research’ (Henderson et al., Making the Long View) and ‘On paternal subjectivity’ (Coltart and Henwood, Men as Fathers). From different disciplinary perspectives (sociology and psychosocial studies) these articles and other outputs from these teams reflect the varied ways that time and temporality can be placed at the heart of empirical, interpretive social science to create new analytical insights on important substantive themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1468794111426229">Henwood and Shirani, in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1468794111426229">Shirani and Henwood, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1468794111426229">2011b</xref>.). Overall, the two articles illustrate how our temporal modes of researching and new approaches to the representation of lives over time are productive of new and creative forms of knowledge.</p>
<p>Making the Long View (hereafter MLV) builds on the Inventing Adulthoods study (London South Bank University). This long-term QL study set in train much that is of continued relevance to our understanding of the principles and conduct of QL research today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1468794111426229">Henderson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1468794111426229">Holland et al., 2006</xref>). In Timescapes the project was funded to archive and explore ways of analysing and representing an important dataset on the lives of young people as they journey into adulthood, generated through repeat biographical interviews since 1996. QL research is notorious for creating huge volumes of temporal data and their management for re-analysis is a key consideration for QL researchers. MLV has established a distinctive way of working with data to create ‘the long view’ as a cross-cutting methodological endeavour within Timescapes.</p>
<p>‘Storying qualitative longitudinal research’ captures the cumulative knowledge and experience of a mature QL study, whose researchers are always seeking to understand and do justice to an ever accumulating (and changing) body of data about young people’s lives in biographical, generational and social/historical contexts. The process is developmental and cumulative; the article gives a detailed account of the evolution of a set of collaborative and reflexive research practices and recounts the researchers’ heightened awareness of their role in the research as it unfolds. In this way, it is able to unpick the important methodological implications of team working over the long term.</p>
<p>The need to develop ways of managing and organizing the data, in good time for analysis to feed into later waves of data generation, requires and suggests new ways of analysing, and ultimately representing data. The sheer size of cumulative qualitative datasets requires shared instruments and templates to aid successful data management and, thereby, to facilitate analysis. This in turn leads to an appreciation of the broader enterprises of archiving and sharing data, a theme that is developed further by Neale and Bishop. Not least, the volume of data gathered over time, along with the sense that the story is never ending, predisposes researchers to ‘pass the mantle’ to others. The fundamental analytic dilemma of QL research is the intermeshing of synchronic and diachronic, cross-cutting and longitudinal analyses, which may be relatively straightforward over a short time horizon, but become increasingly complex as multiple temporalities play out over the longer span. By homing in on the detail of the MLV team’s deliberations about what to do with their data and how to manage it over time, the article illustrates the effective ways used by the team to organize, analyse and represent their individual, family and intergenerational case studies.</p>
<p>The case study is a characteristic mode of representing data across the spectrum of qualitative social science, and it offers the potential to condense cumulative data into a meaningful narrative that carries interpretation and analysis. It is in this area that ‘Storying qualitative longitudinal research’ makes its major contribution, laying bare the processes through which life histories are generated. The point in time that the data is generated, the present, is a moving feast with past and future understood and played out in changing and interacting ways at each point, both by the increasingly reflexively implicated participant and, in this case, the MLV researcher. The detailed and cumulative accounts are not written and represented as static case profiles but as dynamic case histories. Also highlighted is the way writing such case history represents a methodologically innovative strategy for cumulatively ‘conjuring social life’ in a way that combines analytic rigour and imaginative insight.</p>
<p>Building on their earlier contributions on the heightened ethical challenges of QL research, the authors explore these issues in relation to representing the data; in this instance by exploring the ethical production of extremely <italic>long</italic> longitudinal case histories, requiring considerable contextual understanding and detail of individual lives. The detail might compromise protection and reveal the identities of participants, suggesting the need for careful and ongoing negotiations with the participants over the production of these accounts. Overall, the article illustrates the care and attention given to ethical practices where there are complex and changing relationships between researchers and participants, particularly where the participants might be considered potentially vulnerable. The basic concern with sample maintenance in longitudinal research may be reframed here in terms of maintaining long-term relationships, with an acknowledgement that ‘walking alongside’ people as their lives unfold inevitably touches the lives of both participants and researchers.</p>
<p>Many of the themes outlined above are addressed within a different disciplinary and substantive context by Coltart and Henwood in their article ‘On paternal subjectivity’. The Men as Fathers (MAF) study (Cardiff University) was funded under Timescapes to follow up an earlier tracking study following men who became first time fathers in the late 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1468794111426229">Henwood and Procter, 2003</xref>). A new sub-sample of first time fathers was generated, providing the potential to enhance understandings of changes in fathering across generational cohorts. This project is a useful reference point for the ways that issues of multi-modality have been reflected upon within Timescapes. A number of core QL methods have been used:</p>
<list id="list1-1468794111426229" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Accumulation and maturing of the dataset by continuously tracking significant events and turning points in people’s lives, serendipitously focusing on particular themes and moments that became important, repeatedly asking about past memories through the perspective of a shifting present, exploring expectations and anticipated futures and how they play out over time including their long-term repercussions;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Developing bespoke analytical frameworks and data summaries for specific writing projects; as evidenced through project analyses of men’s experiences of the recent financial downturn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1468794111426229">Henwood et al., 2010</xref>) and of contemporary parenting culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1468794111426229">Shirani et al., 2011</xref>);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Utilisation of the principle that rich insights can be produced by ‘adopting a theoretically light touch’ (p. 36 this volume) to the initial organization and interpretation of data, while deriving analytical power from working out an appropriate way to ‘synthesize theory, data and method’ (p. 36 this volume);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Invoking a relational perspective, for example, by bringing to the fore significant others with whom focal study participants have shared or linked lives, including the historical influences expressed through this network of shared relationships. While other Timescapes projects have adopted a focus on the perspectives of multiple family members utilising cross generational designs – with all the attendant benefits and difficulties this brings – MAF has explored relationships of partnering and parenting across the generations through the lens of the fathers’ accounts and with a design that enables analysis of different generational cohorts entering fatherhood.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The article presented here amply demonstrates the value of QL/temporal study in the field of fatherhood and masculinity studies. Drawing on earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1468794111426229">Charmaz and Henwood, 2009</xref>), the MAF team deploys well-honed thematic qualitative analysis skills to explore the complex ways in which the gendered and class identities of fathers are worked out over time and across the generations, and the long-term implications of this for balancing parenting and employment.</p>
<p>Of particular relevance for this special issue, MAF has demonstrated the use of carefully constructed case studies and case comparisons. The analytical work of the article is taken forward through a presentation of two in-depth case studies, which are carefully selected and brought into conversation with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1468794111426229">Thomson, 2007</xref>). The two fathers are from different class backgrounds, with contrasting experiences of being fathered, and the case study analysis deployed here illuminates the complex intersection of personal, cultural and temporal processes in the unfolding of fatherhood.</p>
<p>‘On paternal subjectivity’ adopts a psychosocial sensibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1468794111426229">Henwood and Finn, 2010</xref>) so that it is capable of mining more of the psychological depths and ‘energized flows’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1468794111426229">Finn and Henwood, 2009</xref>) involved in men’s subjective experiences of continuity and change beyond a major life transition. Adopting this sensibility involves drawing upon a range of conceptual and methodological lenses to frame and sharpen thinking; for example, the intergenerational transmission of classed masculinities is viewed as a way of engaging with the affective freighting of men’s desires to ‘take flight’ from forms of masculinity they find troubling and that are intertwined in their biographical accounts. The interplay of past, present and future that is fundamental to QL analysis emerges here as the fathers reflect back on the different relationships they had or have with their own fathers, and their use of these past experiences as resources to develop their own fathering. For one father (Richard) reflections on past relationships shift over time, on seeing his own father in a grandfathering role. In these ways, ‘On paternal subjectivity’ creates a rather different way of getting a balance between analytic rigour and imaginative insight to the one highlighted in ‘Storying qualitative longitudinal research’.</p>
<p>The complexities of QL ethical research practice are further elucidated in this article. Just as Henderson et al. focus on the careful negotiations needed between researcher and research participant in the production of extensive case histories, Coltart and Henwood raise concerns about the representational contexts in which researchers communicate respectfulness towards their participants, and which created an obligation for the team to ‘tread carefully’ in order to avoid reinstating oversimplified evaluative logics when writing up their case study data. They also pay particular attention to the ethical preparation of data for archiving and re-use, to ensure confidentiality and anonymity for their participants.</p>
<p>Both of the articles present, and reflect on, research by project-based teams that are founded on collaborative working. Significantly, both involve moments of reflexivity about the stability (in the case of MLV) and dynamic (in the case of MAF) of team composition in terms of the ethical challenges they raise in team-working. It is important to take non-normative research relations actively into consideration when considering project team work, including issues around the career trajectories and personal life transitions of contract researchers, and age and generational issues affecting academic livelihoods. There are dangers too in normative team-based research practices that uphold dualisms (e.g. between those who collect and analyse data) and create divisions and hierarchies between embodied and textual knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1468794111426229">Mauthner and Doucet, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>We also became aware early on that issues such as timing, synchronization and pacing were not just topics we were researching, but live issues with a bearing on our research practices within and across our teams. This issue of temporal ethics is one that is deserving of further attention.</p>
<p>Drawing on a growing body of writings about ethical research practice, our approach in Timescapes reflects a shift from an accountability model to a process sensitive support model of pursuing ethical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1468794111426229">Miller and Boulton, 2007</xref>) and accepts convincing arguments for an approach that deals with ethical dilemmas through ‘careful judgement based on practical knowledge and attention to detail in context of time and place’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1468794111426229">Edwards and Mauthner, 2002</xref>: 27). Our preference for situated and processual ethics rather than contractual ethics is based on the insight that ethical practices cannot be fully determined a priori for they are context specific and require a sensitive appraisal of local circumstances and sensibilities. But there are different ways of understanding the move to more intensive encounters and processes of engagement between researchers and researched. Partly, this reflects the way research involves participants with differing lives and ethical standpoints and diverse motives to be part of a study. Differences are also highlighted when research crosses disciplinary boundaries, bringing differing methodological commitments into view.</p>

<title>Data sharing and re-use: the Timescapes Archive and secondary analysis</title>
<p>Alongside producing new substantive and theoretical insights and advancing temporal methods and ethics, Timescapes was funded to establish a specialist archive of QL data, and to explore ways of sharing and re-using the resource both within Timescapes and beyond, working with separately funded projects affiliated to the network. These developments are described in the articles by Neale and Bishop, and Irwin, Bornat and Winterton.</p>
<p>The wider development of Qualitative and QL archiving and the culture of re-use in Europe has been documented elsewhere (Bishop and Neale, forthcoming; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1468794111426229">Irwin and Winterton, 2011</xref>; Neale and Bishop, forthcoming), but we draw out some salient points here. The development of the Timescapes Archive was in line with the UK National Data Strategy to coordinate and make better use of research resources and to embed secondary data use more effectively within the social sciences. In 2007, qualitative datasets held nationally were under-utilised, and very few QL datasets were available to use. A discernible gap was identified between the ethos of re-use and the actual practices of qualitative researchers, and discussions around archiving tended to be polarized around the differing priorities of archivists and researchers. In order to move beyond this dualism we developed a stakeholder model of archiving, designed to bring research and archiving into a closer and more productive alignment through ongoing communication and negotiation. Archiving here becomes an integral part of the research process, built in at the design stage, rather than an administrative task tacked onto the end of a project.</p>
<p>The articles in this issue indicate the reasons why early data management planning is important in the context of complex longitudinal data. It enables the organization of complex data and metadata for cumulative analysis, and simultaneously creates good quality data resources as research outputs that are ‘archive ready’ – so facilitating secondary use.</p>
<p>Researchers are also encouraged to re-use data they have generated and link these to related data as their research progresses, thereby combining primary and secondary analysis to increase the robustness and historical reach of their evidence. In order to facilitate this, researchers have a further stake in how the data in the archive is used and by whom. The archive offers secure levels of access for data that are highly sensitive or un-anonymized; their use depends on permission from the originating team. In this way, the archive encourages the sharing of data that might otherwise remain unshared and opens up the potential for a consultative process between primary and secondary users. In mediating the interface between primary and secondary researchers, the Archive offers the potential for more flexible and bespoke options for data sharing than is usually found in generic archives. These innovative approaches are currently under further development and testing with our core and affiliated projects.</p>
<p>The Timescapes Archive was developed over the first three years of our programme and began operating in 2010; it is a fledgling resource with much untested potential for growth. Its future is uncertain in a climate of reduced funding for data infrastructures in the UK. While the preservation of Timescapes data at both institutional and national level is secure, ongoing resources would be needed to continue to build the resource and encourage re-use through the stakeholder approach. Certainly the idea of new forms of archiving that bridge the traditional research/archiving divide has generated a great deal of interest internationally; the reviewers of this article reflected that the idea of archiving ‘in step’ with the research process, and the commitment to enabling archiving within the parameters of the ‘collegial culture of research’ is an exciting and potentially important one, deserving further development in the shift to new cultures of research practice.</p>
<p>The final article in this special issue (Irwin, Bornat and Winterton) explores secondary analysis as a developing methodology within qualitative research and illustrates the varied ways that it may be conducted. The authors reveal the significant potential offered by this method to enhance qualitative evidence and extend its explanatory reach. Within longitudinal research the challenges, but also potential, are magnified.</p>
<p>The authors describe a conventional approach of comparing data across data sets – here drawing on Timescapes data on turning points in individual biographies. This reveals an important insight – that data carries with it the imprint of how it was generated; the same fieldwork question asked in different projects may yield very different accounts, with implications for how questions are posed and in what substantive context. They also document the challenges of ‘mixed’ analysis, bringing qualitative and quantitative data gathered in the Young lives and Times project into a comparative frame, with a view to combining breadth with depth of analysis. The process raises questions about how to situate qualitative evidence, what it represents, and how to link the specific and general. The extent to which such data can be effectively integrated is unclear, but there is undoubted value in combining breadth with depth of analysis to enhance explanation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1468794111426229">Elliott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1468794111426229">Neale, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As a practice, secondary analysis has been accompanied by debates about its effectiveness and robustness, and discussion of the challenges it presents. The authors engage with these debates, exploring to what extent contexts, research questions and data are constructed or produced in the course of asking new research questions or whether, taking a realist approach, the data are indeed ‘out there’. A further methodological approach documented by the team, data sharing workshops, sheds light on this debate. These intensive meetings enabled teams to bring their data into conversation with each other to explore common themes. In the process, the primary researchers became secondary analysts, dialogically interrogating their data afresh through new conceptual and substantive lenses, sharpening their understanding of context and hearing previously unheard ‘silences’ in the data. The resulting analysis was a reframing, leading to new shared understandings, and the development of new research questions. As the authors argue, this represents an important form of secondary analysis.</p>
<p>Across the contributions to this issue, the distinctions between primary analysis (of one’s own data) and secondary analysis (of other people’s data) are blurred in QL enquiry, where primary researchers re-visit their earlier data to engage in comparative temporal analysis. This raises questions about the usefulness of the currently terminology – for example, the concept of enhanced temporal analysis may be a more accurate depiction of the process.</p>
<p>The ethos of data sharing is perhaps more robust in the UK than anywhere else in Europe. Yet challenges remain for qualitative data. Unlike large-scale quantitative longitudinal data, these are not generated initially for secondary use, but to address research questions posed by primary researchers. The originating teams are balancing two potentially competing tasks – that of preparing and releasing data for secondary use while allowing sufficient time for temporal analyses and making original contributions to knowledge. Whatever the commitment to archiving in principle, in practice the push to archive may need to be balanced by the pull to preserve data – at least while primary analysis is ongoing. The challenges were all the greater in this network, where the creation of a data resource and evidence of its re-use over the relatively short lifetime of the initiative was a condition of funding, and yet where the teams were engaged in the elongated time frames of QL enquiry. While researchers and archivists remained sensitive to each other’s concerns, the distinct priorities of these two groups shaped how key practices evolved in the archiving and sharing of the Timescapes datasets.</p>
<p>Whatever the ethos surrounding qualitative data re-use, these issues have important implications for the timing of archiving and the resources needed by originating teams for data preparation tasks. There is still work to be done to build a culture of data sharing and re-use. Data sharing is less likely to be compromised where sufficient incentives, such as rewards and resources are provided by funders; an issue we explore in detail elsewhere. Crucially, new cultures of qualitative archiving and data sharing need to accommodate the differing priorities of primary and secondary researchers. The broader cultural shift requires further effort, encouragement, time and diplomacy – with ongoing commitments to training and capacity building, work with professional associations, and direct engagement with ethical debates over the re-use of data.</p>

<title>Concluding reflections</title>
<p>Like most research, Timescapes is built on collaborative research relationships. In this case they extend across large teams and involve experimental ways of working across the boundaries of research and archiving, and primary and secondary analysis. Ethical considerations emerge not as discrete activities, but as integral to the research process, from design through to the re-use of data. These ethical complexities and challenges are magnified in complex longitudinal research, requiring ethical reasoning and practice to be temporally situated. In such a large-scale network, collaborative working emerges as a methodological and ethical commitment as well as a network of social relationships (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1468794111426229">Cornish et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, blending research and archiving, and primary and secondary use, implies the need for a broader ‘stakeholder’ view of ethics that can acknowledge and balance the varied and ever shifting standpoints and priorities of primary and secondary researchers, archivists, funders, and research participants.</p>
