<p><italic>“The National Institutes of Health is not only the largest institution for biomedical science on earth, it is one of this nation’s great treasures. As social inventions for human betterment go, this one is a standing proof that, at least once in a while, government possesses the capacity to do something unique, imaginative, useful and altogether right.”</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512467035">Lewis Thomas, 1984</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>My family moved from Chicago to the East Bay near San Francisco. In the year 1948, the World Health Organization was established, President Harry Truman was re-elected in an unpredicted upset against Thomas Dewey, and the Marshall Plan approving $17 billion in European aid was ratified. But in my 10-year-old world view, the most significant event was the death of baseball legend Babe Ruth, who was only 53 years old. This was an indelible moment and a sense of where I was when President Truman signed the legislation H.R. 6726 (“National Dental Research Act”) creating the National Institute of Dental Research (NIDR) on June 24, 1948 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512467035">Harris, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512467035">Slavkin, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>This memory was revisited during a discussion with Stephen Jay Gould (a world-renowned evolutionary biologist, philosopher, and essayist). Both of us are Yankee baseball fans, which we realized when we were together in Los Angeles for the International Society of Developmental Biology (ISDB) Congress, August 4-9, 1985 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512467035">Gould, 1986</xref>). Stephen presented the Special Tenth Congress Lecture, titled “Geoffroy and the Homeobox”. He also felt that the record of Joe DiMaggio trumped that of Babe Ruth, while I defended Ruth’s performance with the Yankees.</p>
<p>The Congress is a highlight for the ISDB in that it fosters communication and collaborations between and among scientists, educators, and students in the field of developmental biology. Several years earlier, I was invited to serve as chairman of the Organizing Committee. We selected the theme “New Discoveries and Technologies” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512467035">Slavkin 1986a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512467035">b</xref>). We benefited from the timely convergence of evolutionary, developmental, and molecular biology. In addition, this Congress served as a milestone for craniofacial developmental biology.</p>
<p>Now, I reflect on a few insights and lessons learned during my journey from being a dental student to becoming a biomedical research scientist and administrator. What was it like to serve as the sixth director of the NIDR (1995-2000) and continue to engage in laboratory research? Why did we work to change the name to the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)? What role has advocacy had in my career as a biomedical research scientist, educator, and administrator? Recently, after three years of thinking and writing, I provide an in-depth analysis for the curious reader in my new book, <bold>Birth of a Discipline: Craniofacial Biology</bold>, which addresses these critical questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512467035">Slavkin, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Where to begin? How did I become an advocate for dental research, craniofacial biology, and oral health disparities at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)? First, my experiences in the U.S. Army while stationed at Forest Glen, Maryland made an indelible imprint. I worked as a dental technician to fabricate prostheses for disfigured faces, the result of the bombing of Hiroshima to end WWII. Second, following my graduation from the School of Dentistry at the University of Southern California (USC), two of my primary mentors, Dick Greulich [at that time Richard Greulich was Professor of Oral Biology and Anatomy at the Schools of Dentistry and Medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and then Scientific Director of the Intramural Research Program of the NIDR and later National Institute of Aging (NIA)] and then Lou Bavetta (Lucien Bavetta was Professor of Biochemistry and Nutrition in the School of Dentistry at USC, with expertise in collagen cross-linking), both insisted that I understand the process of discovery, the value of reading and thinking, and the value of the NIH funding for my post-doctoral fellowship. Their coaching was enhanced by Professor Samuel Pruzansky and his ideas about <italic>craniofacial</italic>. Professor Pruzansky at that time was Director of the Center for Craniofacial Anomalies at the University of Illinois in Chicago. These three men taught me the <italic>what, where, why</italic>, and <italic>how</italic> questions related to funding through the perspective of grantees. They explained the peer-review process, Standing and <italic>ad hoc</italic> Study Sections, and the “gold standard” of becoming an independent, hypothesis-directed, biomedical scientist.</p>
<p>Third, my loyalty to the NIH developed with my first research grant award, the year Dean John Ingle recruited me to join the faculty of the USC dental school in July, 1968. This was then followed by more than three decades of continued support through individual R01, program project, center, training, and conference grants. Fourth, I have been, and continue to be, an advocate for pre-natal health care, early childhood development, pre-school K-12 education, and access to health care for all people through scientific research and training. My advocacy included the American Association for Dental Research (AADR), the Institute of Medicine (IOM), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and the American and California Dental Associations (ADA and CDA).</p>
<p>My sense of advocacy stems from life experiences. One experience took place toward the end of my tenure at the NIH. It was June 26, 2000. We were waiting in the East Room in the White House for the announcement of the 95% completion of the human genome. President Clinton was running behind schedule. While we waited, my mind traveled back over highlights of my journey within craniofacial molecular biology. I remembered when my research team isolated and purified the mouse and rabbit amelogenin proteins. This was the era of salt extractions, dialysis, column chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, gel electrophoresis, and amino acid compositions. In the “doing of science”, the methodology and instrumentation determine the pace of accomplishment.</p>
<p>As we waited in the East Room, names from my journey of discovery streamed through my memory. There was Richard Croissant (graduate student in biochemistry), Harald Guenther (post-doctoral fellow), Gary Trump (faculty member and immunologist), Steve Schonfeld (dental graduate from New York University, pursuing a PhD with me), Anna Brownell (trained by Professor Art Veis at Northwestern and doing a post-doctoral fellowship with me at USC), Nino Sorgente (post-doctoral fellow), Mary MacDougall (PhD graduate student in the Craniofacial Biology Graduate Program), Connie Bessem (research technician in my group), and Pablo Bringas (my long-standing colleague and research technician)—together they were responsible for the discoveries related to enamel biosynthesis, isolation, characterizations, and the immunological studies.</p>
<p>We discovered that the antibodies were cross-reactive with enamel matrices from hagfish to human samples. Amelogenin was highly conserved. Mary and Connie analyzed proteomic lines of evidence, one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoreses, coupled with radioactively labeled proteins and immunodetection. We were able to visualize the temporal sequence of isotopically labeled proteins and the subsequent presumed post-translational processing in the forming enamel matrix. Based upon amino acid sequences, we produced antibodies directed against highly conserved motifs found within these proteins.</p>
<p>From a chance encounter, I first met Margarita Zeichner (now Zeichner-David and a professor at USC), who became one of my closest collaborators. She was a post-doctoral fellow working in George Martin’s laboratory at the NIDR. Her focus was on identifying the mRNAs for type I collagen. Earlier, George had asked me to look after his laboratory at the NIDR as an Acting Lab Chief for the Laboratory for Developmental Biology. Through this experience, I met Maggie, and we began to collaborate on the detection of the mRNAs for mouse, rabbit, and sheep amelogenins. Using specific antibodies, Maggie and Victor Lee-Own (a post-doctoral fellow) were successful in precipitating the nascent translated amelogenins from their transcripts.</p>
<p>Maggie made antibodies directed against amelogenins available to Mal Snead. Mal, who had earned his dental degree at Loyola University in Chicago and completed his Residency in Oral Pathology at the Zoller Clinic and PhD in Experimental Pathology with Professor Steve Schwartz at the University of Chicago, joined me as a post-doctoral fellow in 1980. Coincidently, I had just met Savio Woo, a pioneer in molecular biology at Baylor University. I invited Mal to take the lead, and, in collaboration with Maggie and Savio, he employed the amelogenin mRNA to produce amelogenin cDNA. Savio and I arranged for Mal to spend several months with Savio’s group, carrying out these studies and gaining expertise in a number of molecular biology methods and techniques. Our collaboration was completed and published in the <italic>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512467035">Snead <italic>et al</italic>., 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>With the addition of Alan Fincham, a very accomplished protein chemist educated in England with additional experience at the NIDR with John Termine (Branch Chief of the Bone and Teeth Biology Branch), and two new post-doctoral students—Jim Simmer (a dental graduate from the University of Michigan and PhD from Michigan State University) and Edward Lau (his PhD was in molecular biology)—our group used the cDNA to map the gene to the mouse and human X chromosome. Subsequent collaborations demonstrated heterogeneity based on size and amino acid sequence information. Earlier studies showed a pattern of multiple proteins of different sizes and charges, cross-reactive with the highly purified antibodies. We assumed that the explanation was enzyme-mediated degradation after secretion into the forming extracellular matrix.</p>
<p>In contrast, Alan Fincham, Ed Lau, Mal Snead, Maggie Zeichner-David, and Jim Simmer suggested a different explanation. They asserted that we could be observing alternative splicing of the amelogenin gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512467035">Simmer <italic>et al</italic>., 1994</xref>). We learned that the amelogenin gene produces multiple variant mRNAs, which in turn produce the signature pattern of newly secreted proteins.</p>
<p>Alan Fincham had a long history of working with amelogenins and their characterizations. He suggested that there might be a male <italic>vs</italic>. female profile. Additional collaborations proved him correct—the amelogenin gene (AMEL) is located on both the X and Y human chromosomes; however, it is found only on the X chromosome in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512467035">Fincham <italic>et al</italic>., 1991</xref>). This discovery was completely counterintuitive. Why would a structural gene be located on two different human chromosomes? This quickly led to clinical applications with forensic medicine and dentistry to use amelogenin probes to distinguish male <italic>vs</italic>. female specimens following drastic disasters such as airplane crashes and even “9/11”. These discoveries have also contributed to the diagnosis of X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), and even to the advent of therapeutics used for bone regeneration with the use of enamel matrix extracts.</p>
<p>Sensing a change in the ambient sounds around me, I saw that President Clinton had entered and moved toward the podium. The President paused and slowly began to speak. He emphasized the promise of a future benefit for all humankind and underscored the technical feat of reaching a 95% draft of the human genome as of June 2000.</p>
<p>I was convinced that genetics would become a core competency integrated into all of the health professions—medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, nursing, and the allied health professions. Of course, the human genome needed to be completed, analyzed, and eventually applied toward further understanding of single-gene inheritance as well as multiple gene-gene and gene-environment interactions associated with many complex diseases and disorders, including dental and craniofacial diseases and disorders. In addition, the microbiome also needed to be completed to address the complex issues of microbial infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Upon reflection, I realized that this was a historic change with impact on all the health science professions. Like many who came before me, I knew how science could inform clinical practice. If an individual’s genetic blueprint can be analyzed, relative risks can be identified, evaluated, and even ranked for one particular person—from pre-natal through post-natal to terminal life stages. Genomics is a much more ambitious approach than genetics; the science reflects direct assessment of the entire genome and applies to many diseases and disorders such as oral cancer, osteoporosis, temporomandibular joint diseases, and even periodontal diseases. These and other conditions reflect interactions between and among multiple genes and environmental factors. In tandem, microbial genomics provides opportunities to identify significant pathways and gene products suitable for targeted therapeutics to manage infectious diseases, especially when one considers microbial resistance to current antimicrobials.</p>
<p>I realized, as had all previous directors, that dental research is well-positioned at the NIH to continue to advance science while improving the oral health of all people. However, each director learns that success is dependent not only on the remarkable advances of sciences and technology, but also on the ability to achieve closer integration among research, education, clinical practice, industry, and the larger society. Improving the human condition with respect to oral, dental, and craniofacial diseases and disorders requires multifaceted strategies and trans-professional cooperation, not professional isolationism. Training programs that model multidisciplinary research are imperative for continued success. For more than 60 years, NIDCR researchers have learned that oral diseases have no anatomic or disciplinary borders. Indeed, <italic>the mouth is connected to the rest of the body</italic>.</p>
