<abstract>
<p>In contrast to sensory gating, the brain’s ability to re-respond to relevant stimuli and the potential differences between healthy and schizophrenic participants have not been studied in great detail. Here, we explore what auditory paradigms are useful to measure this re-responding ability. Evoked potentials (EPs) were obtained from the Cz channel using 3 paired stimulus paradigms (pairs with equal stimuli {PE}, the second stimulus being lower {PL} or higher {PH} in frequency) and 2 short-train paradigms in which 5 identical stimuli were followed by a lower frequency stimulus (train lower {TL}) or higher frequency stimulus (train higher {TH}). Data were collected from 17 healthy control participants (NC) and 17 age and gender-matched patients with schizophrenia (SZ). Up to 4 data sets obtained on 4 different days were available for each participant. Ensemble averages were computed for each session, from which the P50, N100, and P200 latencies and amplitudes were obtained. No significant differences in amplitude or latency of the various EP components were found between the responses to the second stimulus obtained with the 5 paradigms. Neither did the responses to the fifth and sixth stimuli differ for the TL and TH paradigm, with the exception of the N100 latency of the fifth stimulus, which was longer for TH than TL for NC. Healthy participants had larger amplitudes and shorter latencies than the patients with schizophrenia for the responses to the first stimuli, with the latency differences continuing for the fifth and sixth response. Also, the amplitude and latency of the first response was larger than for the second response in both populations. In conclusion, none of the paradigms studied here, with the employed parameters, are useful to measure the re-responding ability of the brain. Also, the shorter latencies for the repeated stimulus suggest that the neural mechanism underlying attenuation of repeated stimuli is of a facilitating nature.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability of the central nervous system (CNS) to inhibit or suppress the response to irrelevant sensory input is a fundamental protective mechanism that prevents the flooding of higher cortical centers with irrelevant information,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1550059411429524">1</xref>
</sup> which is termed “sensory gating.” Sensory gating is the ability of the brain to modulate its sensitivity to incoming stimuli,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1550059411429524">2</xref>
</sup> encompasses the ability of the brain to inhibit its response to irrelevant repetitive stimuli (gating-out) as well as to re-respond when a physical characteristic of an ongoing stimulus changes (gating-in). Sensory gating-out is commonly measured using the paired-stimulus EP paradigm, in which 2 identical tones are presented in pairs, with a 0.5 second interstimulus interval and much longer (8 seconds) inter-pair intervals. The response to the second stimulus will typically be attenuated compared to the response to the first stimulus.</p>
<p>Ensemble averaged EPs, recorded from the scalp following auditory stimulation, contain 3 main components: a positive (P50), negative (N100), and a positive (P200) component occurring at 50 to 100, 110 to 140, and 160 to 200 ms, respectively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1550059411429524">3</xref>
</sup> The P50 is frequently used to assess sensory gating-out, and numerous studies have reported that participants with schizophrenia have a P50 gating deficit.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059411429524">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059411429524"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1550059411429524">6</xref>
</sup> There is also evidence for a gating deficit in the N100 and P200 range.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1550059411429524">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1550059411429524">7</xref>
</sup> In addition, first stimulus tone (S1) responses in patients with schizophrenia are smaller than in healthy controls.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059411429524">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Gating-out may be related to short-term habituation (STH).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1550059411429524">8</xref>
</sup> The latter can be examined by presenting the participant with trains of identical stimuli.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1550059411429524">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1550059411429524">10</xref>
</sup> Most studies report a rapid decrease in N100 amplitude (up to 50% for the second stimulus), with a few studies reporting that N100 amplitude reduction follows a negative exponential function, reaching an asymptotic value by the third or fourth stimulus.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1550059411429524">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1550059411429524">11</xref>
</sup> More recent studies failed to find any continued decrement from stimulus 2 through 5.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1550059411429524">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1550059411429524">13</xref>
</sup> The latter 2 studies included a test for dishabituation in their design, by presenting a sixth stimulus with different stimulus characteristics than the first 5. Since this sixth stimulus is novel, one would expect that it elicits a larger response than the preceding stimulus. While Budd et al.<sup>12</sup> did not find a general increase in N100 amplitude for stimulus 6 relative to stimulus 5, Rosburg et al.<sup>13</sup> did find such an increase for P50 and N100, but P50 for S6 was still significantly smaller than for S1. The Rosburg et al.<sup>13</sup> study involved intracranial recordings, possibly resulting in a larger signal-to-noise ratio than achievable with surface electrodes.</p>
<p>Despite the extensive literature concerning sensory gating deficits in schizophrenia, little or no attention has been given to the ability of this population to re-respond or dishabituate to deviant stimuli vis à vis healthy participants. While the identical paired-stimulus paradigm has proved to be very useful, and currently is the standard for probing gating-out, no paradigm has emerged as standard for examining gating-in. The present study was designed to fill this gap by testing 4 paradigms in which pairs of nonidentical stimuli, or trains of identical stimuli followed by a different one, were presented to a group of healthy and schizophrenic participants. In addition to the P50 component, we included the N100 and P200.</p>

<title>Data Collection and Preprocessing</title>
<p>Seventeen patients (15 men and 2 women with a mean age of 42 years and range of 23-56 years) with chronic schizophrenia, diagnosed based on the structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, <italic>DSM-IV</italic> [SCID], participated in the study. All were stable outpatients without psychotropic medication changes during the 3 weeks preceding recording of the evoked responses. Age at onset of the illness averaged 20 years (range of 16-29 years). The majority of patients (12) were receiving atypical antipsychotic agents (risperidone or olanzapine), and the remaining patients were stable on typical neuroleptics. All dosages were within manufacturer suggested guidelines. Patients with a history of substance abuse had at least 1 month of verified abstinence and a negative urine test for drug abuse within 24 hours of EP recording. Eleven participants had a history of drug abuse or dependence and 11 of the participants were smokers. None of the participants (in either group) had a history of head injury leading to any length of loss of consciousness, and all had hearing thresholds at least 30 dB less than the peak intensity of the auditory stimuli used for the study. Seventeen healthy control participants (15 men and 2 women with a mean age of 45 and a range of 23-60) were recruited from hospital personnel or through newspaper ads. The age difference was not statistically significant. Healthy participants were screened by a telephone interview and again by a research psychiatrist to exclude any Axis I diagnoses including drug or alcohol abuse. Urine drug screens were not collected for normal participants. If any psychiatric problem, including alcohol or drug use, was suspected, the participant was excluded. Only 2 participants in the control group were smokers. All smoking participants were allowed to smoke until arriving in the laboratory. About 70% of the participants studied here were also used in Hu et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1550059411429524">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Yale University and the VA-Connecticut Healthcare System, and the University of Houston. After a complete description of the study to the participants, written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p>
<p>Auditory EPs (AEPs) were recorded from the scalp of the healthy participants and the patients with schizophrenia using 5 auditory paradigms. The first paradigm (PE) contained 60 pairs of pure tones of 1000 Hz, with a 400 to 600 ms interval separating the first (S1) and the second (S2) tone in each pair. The pairs were separated by at least 8 seconds (subject to a 100 ms computer-imposed jitter) in accordance with established protocol.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1550059411429524">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1550059411429524">15</xref>
</sup> Paradigm PE represents the classic gating paradigm. In contrast, paradigms PL and PH were designed to measure the re-responding ability of the brain to stimulus change and contained tone pairs consisting of a 1000 Hz stimulus always predictably followed by a 500 Hz tone (Paradigm PL) or a 1500 Hz tone (Paradigm PH). In all other aspects, these 2 paradigms were identical to paradigm PE. Paradigms TL and TH were designed to measure the STH and dishabituation capacity of the brain. In these paradigms, trains of 5 identical stimuli (S1-S5) of 1000 Hz were predictably followed by a sixth deviant stimulus, either of 500 Hz (paradigm TL) or of 1500 Hz (paradigm TH) frequency. Again, the stimuli in each train were separated by 400 to 600 ms and an 8 second (with a 100 ms jitter) interval separated the 60 trains in each paradigm. All stimuli had a duration of 4 ms plus a 1 ms rise and fall time and 85 dB sound pressure level, as measured at the ear using a measure-and-hold digital sound meter (Tandy Corp, Ft Worth, Texas), and they were produced by a Grass auditory stimulator. Sounds were delivered using ear inserts (Etymotic Research, Elkgrove, Illinois). The paradigms were presented in random order, and all participants were asked to participate in a maximum of 4 recording sessions, taking place over several weeks. Some recording sessions had to be discarded due to excessive artifacts, and in a few cases the participant did not show up, resulting in 61 to 64 sessions per paradigm for the healthy participants, and 53 to 61 sessions per paradigm for the patients with schizophrenia. Participants were instructed to reduce movement, relax, stay awake, and to avoid eye movement. No cognitive task was given. Recordings were made from gold-disk electrodes affixed to the Fz, Cz, Pz, F1, F2, T3, and T4 locations, referenced to linked ears, but only the Cz lead was analyzed. In addition, eye movements were recorded with a bipolar lead connecting 1 electrode placed 1 cm above and lateral to the right outer canthus to a second electrode placed 1 cm below and lateral to the left outer canthus. Electrode impedances were kept at 5 kΩ or less. Electrical signals were amplified 20 000 times by Grass amplifiers with band-pass filters set at 0.05 Hz and 300 Hz, and digitized with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. Recordings were rejected when electroencephalograph (EEG) activity showed excessive drowsiness during the recording, and individual trials were rejected when activity in any channel exceeded 75 µV or eye-movement artifact was found.</p>
<p>An ensemble average for the S1 responses, and a second average for the S2 responses, was computed for each individual, for each of the 5 paradigms separately (i.e. 10 averages per participant). Similar averages were obtained for the S5 and S6 responses of the TL and TH paradigms (resulting in 4 more averages per participant). These averages were used to measure the amplitudes and latencies of the P50, N100, and P200 components. P50 was taken as the second major positive component following stimulus delivery, provided it fell in the 30 to 80 ms poststimulation interval and was preceded by the Pa wave in the 15 to 40 ms interval. The largest negative deflection between 80 and 150 ms was identified as N100, and the largest positive deflection between 150 and 250 ms as P200. The P50 amplitude was measured from the local minimum between Pa and P50 to the P50 peak, the N100 amplitude from the P50 peak, and P200 from the N100 peak. Grand averages were computed for each of the 14 participant-specific averages using all data from the healthy participants and separately for the patients with schizophrenia (i.e. 28 grand averages).</p>

<sec id="section4-1550059411429524">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>All paradigms should produce identical S1 responses, and reduced S2 responses are to be expected for paradigms PE, TL, and TH. If paradigms PL and PH measure the re-responding ability of the brain to stimulus change, we expect that the S2 response for paradigm PE will be smaller than for paradigms PL and PH. Similarly, we expect that the S6 response will be larger than the S5 response for the TL and TH paradigms. This was explored using 3 four-factor analyses of variance (ANOVAs), 1 for each of the 3 EP components, on the S1 and S2 responses of all paradigms, and a separate set of 3 four-factor ANOVAs (again, 1 for each EP component) on the S1, S5 and S6 responses of the TL and TH paradigms. In case of the S1/S2 comparisons, the independent variables were stimulus (S1 vs S2), paradigm (all 5), population (healthy controls vs population with schizophrenia), and session (4). The latter was included to determine whether there were any differences between earlier and later sessions. In case of the S1/S5/S6 comparisons, the independent variables were stimulus (S1 vs S5 vs S6), paradigm (PL vs PH), population (healthy controls vs population with schizophrenia), and session (4). The ANOVAs were performed for each EP component’s amplitude and latency separately. Where appropriate, <italic>t</italic> tests, subject to Bonferroni correction, were conducted to further explore the effects of the factors. Significance was indicated if <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05.</p>

<p>The grand averages for the S1 and S2 responses of the healthy and patient population are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1550059411429524">Figure 1</xref>, and the average peak amplitudes and latencies (and their standard deviations) are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1550059411429524">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1550059411429524">2</xref>, for the healthy and schizophrenia population, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1550059411429524">Figure 2</xref> presents the averages listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1550059411429524">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1550059411429524">2</xref> graphically.

<p>Analyses of varaince were performed to determine whether there were significant amplitude and/or latency differences between stimuli, populations, paradigms, and sessions. The ANOVA conducted on the amplitudes of all the S1 and S2 responses did not find a paradigm effect, suggesting that the modified paired-stimulus paradigms produced S2 responses indistinguishable from the S2 responses produced by the other paradigms. A session effect was not found either, but stimulus and population effects were found. The stimulus effect was significant for N100 (<italic>F</italic>
<sub>1,1114</sub> = 26.35, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and P200 (<italic>F</italic>
<sub>1,1114</sub> = 25.59, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Paired <italic>t</italic> tests attributed these effects to the amplitudes of the S1 responses being larger than the S2 responses for both populations, but significance was lost for N100 of the schizophrenia group after Bonferroni correction (healthy controls: N100, <italic>t</italic> = 11.99, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001 and P200, <italic>t</italic> = 13.62, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; patients: N100, <italic>t</italic> = 2.21, <italic>P</italic> = .014 and P200, <italic>t</italic> = 2.92, <italic>P</italic> = .002). The population effect was significant for P50 (<italic>F</italic>

<sub>1,1114</sub> = 7.18, <italic>P</italic> = .008), and P200 (<italic>F</italic>
<sub>1,1114</sub> = 21.08, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). In the case of N100 and P200, there was also an interaction between the stimulus and population effects (N100: <italic>F</italic>

<sub>1,1114</sub> = 7.08, <italic>P</italic> = .008). Both interactions were of the ordinal type. The population effects were accounted for by the S1 responses of the healthy control group being larger than the population with schizophrenia (N100: <italic>t</italic> = 3.90, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; P200: <italic>t</italic> = 4.97, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), but no significant population differences were observed for S2.</p>
<p>An ANOVA, performed on the S1 and S2 latencies did not find a paradigm effect. Also, no session effect was found. However, a stimulus effect was found for all 3 components (P50: <italic>F</italic>

<sub>1,1114</sub> = 25.06, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Population effects were found for P50 and N100 (P50: <italic>F</italic>
<sub>1,1108</sub> = 43.35, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; N100: <italic>F</italic>
<sub>1,1114</sub> = 40.41, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). <italic>T</italic> tests revealed that the stimulus effects originated from the fact that the latencies of the S1 responses of both the healthy control group and the schizophrenia group were longer than the latencies of the corresponding S2 responses (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The population effects were due to the patient group having longer latencies than the control group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>A 4-factor ANOVA on the component amplitudes of the S1, S5, and S6 responses did not find a paradigm nor session effect. A significant stimulus effect was found for N100 (<italic>F</italic>
<sub>2,642</sub> = 8.32, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) and P200 (<italic>F</italic>
<sub>2,642</sub> = 11.09, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Also, a significant population effect was found for P50 (F<sub>1,689</sub> = 4.14, <italic>P</italic> = .04), N100 (<italic>F</italic>

<sub>2,642</sub> = 3.28, <italic>P</italic> = 0.04) was indicated for P200. When the ANOVA was repeated for S5 and S6 only, no significant differences were found for any of the factors. In other words, the S5 and S6 amplitudes were not significantly different, nor did they differ between populations; and in the case of the healthy population, both were significantly smaller than S1.</p>
<p>The 4-factor ANOVA on S1, S5, and S6 latencies found significant paradigm effects for N100 (<italic>F</italic>
<sub>1,642</sub> = 7.63, <italic>P</italic> = .006). Stimulus effects were found for all 3 components (P50: <italic>F</italic>

<sub>1,428</sub> = 7.89, <italic>P</italic> = .005) but not for P50. No stimulus or session effects were indicated. <italic>T</italic> tests revealed that the paradigm effects were due to longer N100 latencies observed for the S5 stimulus in the TH paradigm than in the TL in the healthy population (<italic>t</italic> = −1.94, <italic>P</italic> = .03). The corresponding S6 stimuli showed a similar difference, which almost reached significance (<italic>t</italic> = −1.45, <italic>P</italic> = .08). Similar differences were seen in the population with schizophrenia, but none reached significance. <italic>T</italic> tests attributed the N100 and P200 population effects to the longer latencies observed in the population with schizophrenia. These difference reached significance for N100 (paradigm TH, S5: <italic>t</italic> = −3.48, <italic>P</italic> = .003; paradigm TH, S6: <italic>t</italic> = −2.19, <italic>P</italic> = .016; paradigm TL, S6: <italic>t</italic> = −2.79, <italic>P</italic> = .001) and P200 (paradigm TL, S5: <italic>t</italic> = −1.75, <italic>P</italic> = 0.04; paradigm TL, S5: <italic>t</italic> = −2.00, <italic>P</italic> = .09).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We evaluated the utility of several paradigms to assess the gating-in ability of the CNS, and to what degree this ability differed between healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia. Three paired-stimulus paradigms and 2 short-train paradigms were evaluated. The paired-stimulus paradigms differed in the sense that the second tone was identical, lower, or higher in frequency. No statistically significant amplitude or latency differences were found between these 3 paradigms for the responses to the second tone. This suggests that the modified paired-stimulus paradigm is not a promising measure of the “gating-in” capability of the brain, given the specific parameters utilized. We did find, just as in many previous reports, that the S1 responses were larger in amplitude than the S2 responses, and that healthy participants produced larger S1 responses than patients. Also, the S1 latencies of the P50, N100, and P200 components were larger than the corresponding S2 latencies (in health and schizophrenia), and that patients had larger latencies than healthy controls.</p>
<p>The shorter latencies for the components of the second stimulus suggest that the attenuation of repeated stimuli involves a facilitating system. For example, an initial stimulus presentation could cause synaptic potentiation between neurons, resulting in information flowing more rapidly through the neural system processing the input stream. This potentiation could occur at multiple levels in the neural system, and as a result, repeated stimuli are identified faster, leading to shorter latencies. The longer N100 latencies to S2 stimuli in patients with schizophrenia could reflect a deficiency of this facilitation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this deviation in patients with schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Our failure to find a paradigm effect differs from one previous report that normal volunteers had a higher P50 response to the second stimulus when pairs of nonidentical stimuli were presented.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1550059411429524">16</xref>
</sup> However, a second study, using pairs of identical stimuli, pairs with stimuli differing in frequency, and pairs with stimuli differing in intensity only, reported P50 and N100 increases only when the second stimulus was more intense than the first,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1550059411429524">17</xref>
</sup> and thus matches our findings. No reports have appeared describing P200 effects.</p>
<p>The short-train paradigms presented 5 identical tones, followed by a sixth tone lower or higher in frequency. Again, we failed to detect a rebound in the amplitude of the sixth, deviant stimulus compared to the fifth and first stimulus. This matches the results reported by Budd et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1550059411429524">12</xref>
</sup> We did find a paradigm effect for the N100 latency of S5 and S6, which were larger for the TH paradigm than the TL paradigm, albeit that this reached significance for the S5 response of the healthy controls only. We also found that the N100 and P200 latencies of these responses were larger for the patient population than the healthy controls.</p>
<p>Whether or not modifications of the PL, PH, TL, and TH parameters (eg, loudness, frequency, or duration) can improve the effect size remains an open question. As shown in a recent study,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1550059411429524">18</xref>
</sup> stimulus complexity is the main determinant of the degree of dishabituation, followed by lack of knowledge about train length. That is, a complex tone such as a chirp preceded by one or more pure tones will lead to a larger rebound than another pure tone of different frequency. Given the relatively small difference in frequency between the pure tones used in the present study, the deviant tones lack the spectral complexity needed to elicit a response rebound. Also, the EPs elicited here may primarily reflect the activity associated with stimulus detection, rather than encoding stimulus characteristics. Although the sequence in which the paradigms were presented was randomized, once a paradigm started the participants quickly gained complete knowledge of the number and type of stimuli presented. Consequently, once the first stimulus in a pair or short train has been detected, subsequent stimuli are completely predictable and lose their relevance, making them subject to gating-out.</p>
<p>The relatively small number of participants participating in this study may raise questions regarding the power of our statistical findings, and especially the ANOVA results. However, the population and stimulus amplitude effects indicated by the ANOVA match the well-reported findings that S1 amplitudes are generally larger than S2 amplitudes, and that schizophrenic participants produce smaller responses than healthy participants. Thus, we feel confident that insufficient sample size is not the cause for our failure to find paradigm effects.</p>
<p>A better measure of the “gating-in” capability may be the mismatch negativity (MMN) and the P300 event-related potential.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1550059411429524">19</xref>
</sup> Both the MMN and the P300 assess the brain’s response to a change in ongoing stimuli (current definition of gating-in). These 2 paradigms differ significantly from all paired-stimulus paradigms because the stimulus change is random or unpredictable. Both the MMN (considered to be preattentional) and the P300 (considered to be more attentional) consistently show larger responses to the deviant stimuli (i.e. gating-in) but not the frequent stimuli. Additional research will be needed to determine whether such measures adequately quantify gating-in.</p>
