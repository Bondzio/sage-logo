<abstract>
<p>Canoe paddles have been in continuous use for thousands of years. Over that period, the paddle has remained virtually unchanged in basic form and materials. Today, paddles are produced in many different designs by a large number of manufacturers. Prominent within the many factors differentiating the best paddles from the worst is their propensity to resonate during use. This resonance has been so prevalent historically that it has been given its own name: a paddle’s song. The major drawback with paddle resonance is that it is accompanied with the penalty of increased fluid resistance. Paddle manufacturers have long tried to reduce or eliminate paddle resonance, but it is still recognized by paddlers as a significant factor in choosing an optimal paddle.</p>
<p>This study examined canoe paddle resonance in laboratory, open water, and computer modelling environments. The goal was to investigate the characteristics of this commonly occurring phenomenon and validate the techniques used in the modelling studies. The hypothesis tested in this paper is that by employing and comparing scientific measurement and modelling techniques it would prove possible to examine the relationship between physical paddle structure, fluid-based excitation, and resonance observed during paddle use.</p>
<p>The obtained results indicated that the paddle being studied displayed a number of different characteristic resonance patterns or modes depending on the velocity of water flow over the blade. The results of the computer modelling studies on the resonance modes were found to be in good agreement with the observations made in laboratory and open water experiments.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>The open canoe is recognized the world over as an iconic image. Beginning thousands of years ago as a way of life for the aboriginal peoples of North America, the canoe is now primarily a pastime pursuit for millions of people around the globe.</p>
<p>Optimally, a canoe paddle will grip the water when required to propel the canoe, and slide cleanly and without unwanted vibration through the water during stroke recovery or control strokes. A paddle must be strong enough to resist breakage but light enough to be used for long durations of time. It must be stiff enough to give a good feel of the water but flexible enough to cushion the joints of the paddler. In an average day of canoeing a paddler may perform up to 10 000 strokes. Any shortcomings in the paddle will be magnified through the repetitive nature of its use. An inefficient or poor paddle design will leave a paddler uncomfortable with blistered or bloody hands, strained joints, unnecessary fatigue, and a less than optimal experience.</p>
<p>The contrasting requirements for an optimal paddle are at the root of the design challenge facing paddle manufacturers and users. There are currently dozens of paddle manufacturers and many of these companies have their own signature designs that they produce. Their products range from generic, simple, and thus cheap products to custom-designed and custom-fabricated products. In the case of the former, paddle design is driven by economics and costs. In the case of the latter by experience and art. There is little if any science employed anywhere in the industry.</p>
<p>A study dating back to 1936, by Fowler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754337111420649">1</xref>] examined canoe performance as a function of paddling position. This study was years ahead of its time; however, it suffers from flaws in some of its detailed methods and mathematical calculations. Results achieved in this study were enlightening with respect to canoe loading but it did not include paddle design as a focus for evaluation. A later study by Plagenhoef [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754337111420649">2</xref>] examined the stroke mechanics involved in Olympic-class competitive paddling using photographic techniques. The resulting article did not include any specific paddle details but instead focussed on joint centre and paddle motion. Another study from the same period was conducted by Nolan and Bates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754337111420649">3</xref>]. In this study the authors compared the use of straight and bent shafts for paddles used in canoe racing. The only paddle details provided in the accompanying article were the shaft angle, overall blade length, and width of the paddles used in the study. In both of these latter two studies the focus was on competitive paddling, where an upright kneeling stance is employed and strokes are a simple pull on either side of the canoe. This is a very specialized form of paddling that lacks steering strokes, and is not normally encountered during canoeing outside of the competitive arena.</p>
<p>A number of studies have examined oars and paddles used for rowing and kayaking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754337111420649">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337111420649">6</xref>]. In both cases, the mechanics of the strokes are unlike those used in canoeing as are the paddles and oars themselves. The focus of these studies has also been primarily on competitive conditions and none have examined paddle, oar, or, more generally, blade vibration that results during use.</p>
<p>Given the long-term popularity of canoeing, and the number of commercial paddle suppliers competing for market share, it is surprising to grasp that no appreciable scientific research has been undertaken into canoe paddle design and optimization.</p>
<p>Canoe paddle optimization must involve not only the structural form of the paddle but also its interrelationship with the fluid flow over the blade, its mechanical interrelationship with the paddler, and to a lesser extent its aerodynamic characteristics for out-of-water stroke recovery. The associated fluid flow characteristics vary depending on whether the blade is being used primarily for propulsion or control activities. During propulsion, the basic goal of the paddle is to generate as much fluid resistance as possible. During this phase the blade is pulled through the water, and the blade acts as a bluff body with separated flow. The primary direction of free stream fluid to blade relative motion is normal to the blade surface. In contrast during control and underwater stroke recovery manoeuvres, the blade is moved through the water with a relative motion approximately parallel to the blade surface. This form of blade motion is commonly referred to as knifing the blade through the water. In this phase the blade is used as a high-lift low-drag control surface where flow separation may not be desirable.</p>
<p>One characteristic that differentiates optimal from non-optimal paddle performance is water-flow-induced vibrations that can accompany control and underwater stroke recovery manoeuvres. In poor performing paddles, these manoeuvres are almost always accompanied by flow-induced vibrations in the paddle. These paddle vibrations are so common in the sport of canoeing that they have been given a name: a paddle’s song. These vibrations affect the flow properties adjacent to the paddle blade, thereby increasing drag on the paddle blade by as much as a factor of three [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754337111420649">7</xref>]. The best quality paddles do not induce vibrations and therefore avoid the penalty of increased resistance to blade movement.</p>
<p>Canoe velocities can commonly reach 1.5 m/s. Underwater paddle recovery manoeuvres require the paddle blade to be drawn through the water against this flow. A relative blade to fluid velocity of 3 m/s is often achieved. In this situation, vibration and the associated drag on the paddle blade work against the progress of the canoe and reduce overall efficiency.</p>
<p>In examining the literature pertaining to fluid-flow-induced vibrations it is clear that research into the relationship between structural vibrations and fluid flow has remained primarily in the experimental realm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754337111420649">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1754337111420649">9</xref>]. Some limited success has been achieved by Caplan <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754337111420649">6</xref>] with computational modelling of rowing oar blades, but in general the results have not been widely validated with open water results. Within the former studies, it is cylinders and foils that have received the greatest amount of attention. A paddle blade, while typically a symmetrical foil in cross-section, also has the additional complexity of varying shape and fluid velocities along its length.</p>
<p>The physics of fluid structure interactions is complex, multidimensional, and mostly well beyond the scope of this research project. A brief review of some of the related points is, however, necessary to fully understand the work presented in this paper. A structure such as a paddle blade develops a fluid boundary layer when a relative velocity exists between the fluid and the blade. Within the boundary layer, fluid velocity will be a function of the distance from the blade surface. During control and stroke recovery manoeuvres the fluid near the blade is essentially dragged along with the blade, while further from the blade the fluid is stationary. The change that occurs in fluid velocity as the distance from the paddle increases causes the boundary layer fluid to roll or rotate as it leaves the trailing edge of the blade. This rolling of the fluid results in a regular and oscillating pattern of vortices being formed adjacent to the trailing edge of the blade. From research in the field, it is known that the approximate frequency of these vortices is proportional to the blade to free stream fluid relative velocity, and inversely proportional to blade thickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754337111420649">7</xref>]. These oscillating vortices impart oscillating loads on the blade which drive the vibrations in the paddle.</p>
<p>When a structure is subjected to oscillating loads, structural resonance can occur if the loading frequency matches the specific natural frequency of resonance within the structure. In the case of flow-induced resonance, generation of the fluid vortices can also be affected by the resonance of the structure. This effectively creates a feedback system that promotes vortex formation when structural resonance occurs. The overall effect is that the structural resonance causes the vortex shedding to become more organized, which in turns adds more energy to the structural resonance.</p>
<p>For a paddle’s blade, where blade thickness normally increases towards the shaft, determining the range of vortex shedding frequency given a known blade to free stream fluid relative velocity is not a straightforward task. The structural resonance of a paddle is a function of the material from which it is produced, its geometry, and grip locations along with, and to a lesser extent, the natural damping due to the paddler’s hands. Recognizing this difference it should be possible to examine characteristic paddle performance, and in particular a paddle’s propensity to resonant, by examining the resonance created during the use of a paddle.</p>
<p>This study was conducted as part of a larger ongoing research effort into historic aboriginal paddles and currently produced commercial paddle designs. As part of this larger work, the ability to accurately model a paddle’s resonance will be a cornerstone of ongoing investigations. This paper presents the techniques that have been developed and the results that have been achieved in measuring and modelling vibrations of the type that occur during control and underwater stroke recovery manoeuvres. In particular, details of the complex resonance characteristics of a specific paddle are modelled using solid model finite element analysis techniques and compared to the same paddle’s experimentally measured resonance in air and flow-induced resonance observed while knifing through water.</p>

<title>2 Methods</title>
<p>The paddle used in this study was selected because of its unusually good paddling characteristics. This study is part of a larger ongoing study into paddle mechanics, and the chosen paddle is viewed as the best paddle of the many that were collected for the larger study. The paddle studied was an ottertail shaped, 1.58 m long paddle manufactured by Redtail Paddles (Hastings, Ontario) from a single piece of black walnut wood.</p>
<p>Physical measurements of the paddle under study were performed using a number of different tools. Overall length was determined using a metric tape measure. Centre of mass was determined by balancing the paddle on a finger and measuring its location with respect to the tip of the paddle using the tape measure. Location of the central resonance node (i.e. where no structural vibration exists) was determined by holding the paddle in the shaft to blade transition region. The blade flat was then bumped with the heel of the other hand. The location used for holding the paddle was then moved until a clear resonance could be heard. This location was then measured using the tape measure. The width and thickness of the paddle as a function of distance from its tip were measured every 0.10 m, using a pair of direct-reading calipers (Veritas Tools, Ottawa, Ontario) and the tape measure. The profile of the blade was also determined every 0.10 m using a plastic profile gauge (Lee Valley Tools, Ottawa, Ontario). The mass of the paddle was measured using a Brainweight B5000 electronic laboratory scale (Ohaus, Parsippany, New Jersey). The volume of the paddle and wood density were determined by submerging the paddle in a 0.191 m diameter column of water and weighing the displaced liquid.</p>
<p>The paddle’s natural resonance frequency was determined while holding the paddle using two grip formats:</p>
<list id="list1-1754337111420649" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>a single-hand grip located at the centre resonance node near the shaft to blade transition;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a two-hand conventional grip.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The technique utilized for both grip formats was as developed by Siminoff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1754337111420649">10</xref>] for tap tuning musical instruments. In each instance the blade was bumped with the heel of the hand and the accompanying tone was collected and analysed for its dominant frequency using an Apex 775 audio microphone (Apex Electronics, Pickering, Ontario) connected to a CS100 compressor sustainer (Behringer, Willich, Germany) that was then connected to a MacBook Pro personal computer (Apple, Cupertino, California) running the Strobosoft frequency analysis software (Peterson Electro-Musical Products, Alsip, Illinois). Output was in the form of frequency in hertz.</p>
<p>The paddle’s natural resonance oscillation characteristics were investigated using a pair of SEN 09652 three-axis accelerometers (Spark Fun Electronics, Boulder, Colorado). Accelerometer power was supplied using an E3630A Triple Output DC Power Supply (Agilent, Lexington, Massachusetts) and the accelerometer output was input through an USB-6211 A-D converter (National Instruments Corporation, Austin, Texas) into a Acer Aspire One ZG5 NetBook computer (Acer America Corporation, Mississauga, Ontario) running a data collection program custom written in Labview 8.2 (National Instruments Corporation, Austin Texas). Sample collection was at a rate of 1000 Hz.</p>
<p>In this part of the study, one of the pair of accelerometers was taped to the centre line of the blade, 0.3 m from the blade tip. The other accelerometer was then fastened to the paddle a number of times, each time a multiple of 100 mm from the first accelerometer position. The accelerometers were oriented with their <italic>z</italic>-axis normal to the blade’s surface, and their <italic>y-</italic>axis oriented towards the tip. For each pair of accelerometer positions the blade was struck near the first accelerometer with the heel of a hand and acceleration data was collected. The paddle was held at the lower and upper grips in an effort to replicate normal two-hand grip conditions. Comparing the magnitude and phase of the recorded data allowed the relative motion of the paddle for this resonance mode to be investigated. The paddle’s resonant frequency was determined for each strike using a Fourier transform function available in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, Massachusetts).</p>
<p>Open water data collection was accomplished using a 14 foot open aluminium boat of the type commonly used for fishing and a 6 hp outboard motor. Boat speed, direction, location, and GPS time were measured using a BG-331RGTGT global positioning system (GPS) sensor (Mighty GPS, Toronto, Ontario) located in the boat. Output of the GPS unit was updated at 1 Hz. This unit was connected via a universal serial bus connection to the data collection computer.</p>
<p>In this portion of the study, the three-axis accelerometers were held on the shaft of the paddle using tape. The transducers were fixed to the paddle at approximately the mid-shaft region, 1.220 m from the tip. One accelerometer was placed in the plane of the blade, with its <italic>y</italic>-axis pointing towards the upper grip and the <italic>z</italic>-axis normal to the blade. The second transducer was placed parallel to the first on the opposite side of the shaft, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1754337111420649">Fig. 1</xref>. This transducer arrangement was chosen to allow shaft accelerations parallel to the blade (average of <italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>x</italic><sub>2</sub> accelerations), normal to the blade (<italic>z</italic> accelerations), and relative rotational accelerations (<italic>x</italic><sub>2</sub>–<italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub> accelerations) to be determined. In this phase of the study the DC power supply used to power the accelerometers was connected to a 300 W power inverter (Zantrex, Elkhart, Iowa) and a Nautilus 10-2799-4 deep cycle marine battery (Canadian Tire Corporation, Toronto, Ontario) that operated at 12 V. Data was collected at 200 Hz.</p>

</fig>
<p>At the start of each run the paddle blade was placed in the water until it was just below the shaft to blade transition. The paddle was held using a conventional paddle grip. The blade was oriented parallel to the direction of travel to simulate the relative paddle blade to water motion that accompanies stroke recovery manoeuvres, and the paddle was canted out from the side of the boat at approximately 30° to keep it clear of bow wash from the boat, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1754337111420649">Fig. 2</xref>. The boat velocity was then slowly increased to its maximum and then returned back to zero. Gross paddle insertion into the water and orientation with respect to the boat’s direction of travel and water surface remained fixed during this test. Two independent runs were completed with the paddle.</p>

</fig>
<p>The collected data was then analysed using Microsoft Excel 2008 for Mac (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). Initially the accelerometer data and boat velocity data were converted into typical SI units and plotted against time. Regions of paddle resonance were identified and isolated for further analysis. The isolated series of data were then analysed for frequency content using a Fourier transform function available in MATLAB. Isolated sections were plotted against time to examine the shaft acceleration parallel to and normal to the blade of the paddle in addition to rotational accelerations about the shaft.</p>
<p>Computer-based modelling was performed using the solid modelling package NX 7.5 (Siemens). Paddle-specific geometric parameters were used to create a solid model representation of the tested paddle. Material properties were assigned based on measured material density and values for the Poisson’s ratio and modulus of elasticity for black walnut obtained from the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1754337111420649">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1754337111420649">12</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1754337111420649">Table 1</xref>). A quick test of model accuracy was performed by comparing the calculated mass for the paddle to the measured mass, as well as the calculated centre of mass to the measured centre of mass. The paddle’s resonance modes were modelled in NX 7.5 using a finite element approach and a mesh size of 8.0 mm. The result was a series of characteristic natural frequencies and corresponding displacement patterns for the resonance modes specific to the modelled paddle.</p>

<p>Measured physical characteristics including natural resonance frequency for the paddle are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1754337111420649">Table 2</xref>. The natural resonance oscillation characteristics as measured in the laboratory are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1754337111420649">Fig. 3</xref>. This graph shows the relative magnitude and phase relationship of the accelerations recorded along the length of the paddle with respect to the accelerometer located at the middle of the blade. Resonance nodes were located near the tip of the blade, 18.3 cm from the tip, adjacent to the blade tip shaft to blade transition, 67 cm from the tip, and also at the upper grip for this grip configuration. Resonance in the paddle as recorded using the accelerometers and two-hand grip was 55 Hz. The paddle’s resonance point was determined using the audio-based equipment to be 52 Hz for a conventional two-hand grip and 68 Hz for the single-hand grip. The lower hand position in the two-hand grip was observed to have a strong impact on the resonant frequency.</p>

<p>Typical open water testing results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1754337111420649">Fig. 4</xref>. The paddle’s resonance characteristics vary dramatically with knifing velocity. Below a 3.5 m/s knifing velocity, only short duration vibration occurs at approximately 1 m/s. Mid-shaft motion for this resonance is primarily parallel to the blade (<italic>x</italic>-axis direction) with some lesser accelerations normal to the blade and a minimal shaft rotational acceleration. The paddle’s resonance behaviour for higher knifing velocities involves motion both parallel to and normal to the blade in concert with rotational accelerations. The symmetry apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1754337111420649">Fig. 4</xref> indicates the close relationship between knifing velocity and resonance point.</p>

<p>At knifing velocity values above those normally encountered during canoeing, an alarming amount of flow-induced vibration occurs. This observed behaviour can be divided into three distinct phases. Between approximately 3.90 and 4.35 m/s the paddle experiences accelerations that are normal to the blade, parallel to the blade, and rotational, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1754337111420649">Fig. 6</xref>. These large magnitude accelerations all occur at 35 Hz although a phase shift of 180° exists between the normal accelerations and the other two. Between knifing velocities of 4.45 and 4.56 m/s the mid-shaft accelerations become predominantly normal to the blade and rotational, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1754337111420649">Fig. 7</xref>. Both of these accelerations occur at 7 Hz; however, the normal acceleration lags the rotational component by 90°. Both accelerations also contain a superimposed 90 Hz component. At the highest knifing velocities used in the study of between 4.60 and 4.63 m/s the mid-shaft accelerations were predominantly normal to the blade and rotational, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1754337111420649">Fig. 8</xref>. Both of these accelerations oscillate at 8.6 Hz and the rotational accelerations also contain a superimposed 90 Hz component.

<p>The simulation results indicate that there are a series of resonance modes with specific characteristic shapes for the paddle being studied. Details of the different modes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1754337111420649">Fig. 9</xref>. In each mode, the deformation required to create the characteristic shape provides evidence as to the acceleration direction accompanying each mode. This information combined with the frequency of each mode allows a direct comparison to the experimental results. All modes resulted in characteristic shapes that were two-dimensional; no complex, three-dimensional modes were observed in the modelling studies.</p>

</fig>
<p>Modes 1 and 2 both occur at approximately 4 Hz. These modes require accelerations normal and parallel to the plane of the blade, respectively. The open experimental results are in close agreement with this modelled behaviour, indicating that these modes occur simultaneously for knifing velocities between 1.08 and 1.14 m/s and at a resonance frequency of 4.2 Hz.</p>
<p>Mode 3 would commonly be termed as a simple bend with two nodes. This would require accelerations normal to the blade. Mode 4 is the second partial to mode 2 (similar to but higher in frequency than mode 2, requiring an additional node in the paddle structure). Mode 5 is the third partial of mode 1 and corresponds to the mode excited during the laboratory experiments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1754337111420649">Fig. 3</xref>. This mode requires the paddle to accelerate normal to the blade, and contain three nodes, all of which were observed experimentally. In addition, the results of the laboratory measurements that were all performed at a resonant frequency of 68 Hz are in reasonable agreement with the results of the modelling studies performed at a frequency of 60 Hz. Mode 6 is a purely rotational 90 Hz oscillation about the shaft. This behaviour was seen superimposed on the paddle’s resonance for knifing velocities above 4.45 m/s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1754337111420649">Figs 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1754337111420649">8</xref>.</p>

<title>4 Discussion</title>
<p>A comparison of the experimental and modelling results highlights several points of interest. The resonance mode excited by holding the paddle with a single-hand grip and bumping the blade with the heel of the hand is equivalent to mode 5 in the modelling results. The measured resonance frequency for a single-hand grip is 68 Hz using the audio equipment which compares favourably with the modelled mode 5 frequency of 60 Hz. Resonance results obtained for the two-hand grip using both the audio and accelerometer-based instrumentation are also in agreement with values of 52 and 55 Hz, respectively. The discrepancy in these values appears to be the result of the positioning of the lower hand and its impact on the resulting resonant frequency. Moving the lower grip hand closer to the node brings about a corresponding increase in resonant frequency.</p>
<p>The only paddle resonance to occur during normal use conditions is the 4.2 Hz resonance at approximately a 1 m/s knifing velocity. Accelerations measured for this resonance are in reasonable agreement with respect to both direction and frequency with the results obtained for the modelled resonance characteristics of modes 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Above a 4 m/s knifing velocity, the paddle resonates aggressively. This is indicative of large amounts of energy from the flow over the blade being available in the paddle to excite resonance. The effect of this energy appears to be that multiple modes of resonance are simultaneously excited in the paddle. Examining the frequencies modelled for modes 3, 4, 5, and 6 it is evident that modes 3 and 4 are approximately half the frequency of mode 5 and mode 5 is almost half of mode 6. The accelerations measured for this phase of the resonance indicate that more than one mode is involved in the paddle’s resonance. In particular it appears that for velocities starting at 3.90 m/s, modes 3 and 4 are both excited and that their combined action induces a rotational aspect into the paddle motion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1754337111420649">Fig. 6</xref>. Further increases in speed create a consistent 90 Hz rotational acceleration that is superimposed on all the other accelerations. This is in agreement with the modelled characteristics for mode 6. The source of the 7 and 8.6 Hz accelerations normal to the blade above a 4.45 m/s knifing velocity appears to be related to the result of simultaneous excitation of modes 3, 4, and 5. The numerical difference in the associated mode frequencies may create an environment in which lower frequency beats are observed at the mid-shaft location due to the combined, simultaneous excitation of the modes. The exact interrelationship that produces this behaviour is beyond the scope of this study as it is well outside the conditions of normal use for the paddle, and with the amount of energy available in the paddle to excite resonance the paddle behaviour will be extremely complex.</p>
<p>The paddle used in this study was chosen because of its smooth and near vibration-free characteristics. Testing did show that knifing velocities in the 1 m/s range would excite resonance in the paddle, but anecdotal evidence from use indicated that this resonance was rarely encountered. A reason behind this apparent discrepancy appears to be that at 1 m/s, there is only a limited amount of energy available to excite vibration in the paddle and as such resonance is slow to establish itself. Another reason is that the resonance only occurs over a very narrow range of velocities, making the conditions necessary for resonance unusual during normal use.</p>
<p>Vibration and resonance in a canoe paddle involves a complex interrelationship between paddler, paddle, and water. In this relationship, the water, specifically the movement of water over the blade, is the mechanism needed to excite the resonance modes of the paddle. If the paddle were perfectly isolated from the paddler and the rest of its physical environment then some simplification would be possible with regard to its behaviour. This was not the case in this study nor will it ever be the case for a paddle in normal use. As a consequence, the paddler and physical environment will have an impact on the paddle’s behaviour. Specifically, in normal use the paddler may act as a damping aspect to the paddle since both hands of the paddler are located away from the observed resonance nodes. When paddle vibration occurs, the hands need to be excited along with the paddle grips. The hands will then undoubtedly add mass to the paddle system in addition to a visco-elastic element that will remove energy from the paddle.</p>
<p>In its simplest form, paddle resonance could be compared to resonance in a simple beam of uniform cross-section. For the part of the reported study where the paddle was grasped at the blade to shaft junction and resonance was created by bumping the heel of the hand against the blade, the resonance can be compared to the second partial of the resonance in a beam where both ends of the beam are free to oscillate. Under these conditions beam oscillation would be symmetrical about a node at the centre of the beam, with additional nodes approximately 12 per cent of the overall beam length in from each end [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1754337111420649">13</xref>]. With a paddle, the blade is typically thin, with a corresponding lower stiffness and natural frequency of resonance when compared to the paddle shaft. To allow the entire paddle to resonant with a uniform frequency, in the paddle studied in this paper at 68 Hz, the central node must move towards the tip of the paddle. For the paddle studied in this paper the central node was located almost 10 per cent closer to the blade tip than the centre of mass. The importance of this in paddle design should not be underestimated. Movement of the central resonance node away from the centre of mass also moves it away from the lower hand of the paddler. When this hand is not located near a node, it is available to act as a damping element to the paddle. If the hand is located so that it can remove even small amounts of energy from the paddle, this may delay the onset of resonance in the paddle. This may be one of the reasons that this paddle is remarkably smooth and free of vibration in use.</p>
<p>The paddler may also add a directional element to paddle motion due to a reduced stiffness in one direction over another. Under conditions of normal use, paddle motion would also require hand motion. It is not unexpected then that with paddle motion some gross limb motion may occur, thereby linking different directions of motion in the paddle. The result would be that simple planer excitation of the paddle may result in a more complex pattern of paddle motion when the effects of the paddler are considered.</p>
<p>An optimal paddle design strikes a balance between the often competing functional requirements of a paddle. Specifics of the intended use may bias this balance; the paddle used in this work was seen by the paddlers who used it to be a good choice for long distance open water paddling. This is a result of it having a light structure which is advantageous for use over long time periods in which a paddler may perform as many as 10 000 strokes in a day. The paddle has a blade that is only 6 mm thick at its mid-point; such a thin blade has the effect of minimizing frontal area and associated fluid-based drag while being knifed through the water. A flexible paddle also tends to be easier on the paddler and have historically been considered a good alternative for canoeing where control strokes are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1754337111420649">14</xref>]. The thin blade therefore results in a very flexible blade with minimal water resistance while performing control and steering strokes. Intuitively, it would be expected that a thin blade would resonate undesirably during use but for this paddle this was not the case. A thin blade also would also:</p>
<list id="list2-1754337111420649" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>lower the natural frequency of at least some of the paddle resonance modes;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>raise the vortex shedding frequency for a given knifing velocity;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>move the central resonance node away from the lower grip of the paddle.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The combination of all these effects is a paddle that offers the advantages of reduced mass and frontal area while inhibiting the interaction between flow and structure that leads to fluid-induced structural resonance and its associated penalties.</p>
<p>Despite the best attempts of the authors to limit unwanted uncertainty in this study, it should be recognized that relating structural characteristics to fluid-based resonance is a complex task and doing so for a structure as complex as a canoe paddle in an open water environment is even more problematic. During the execution of the work reported in this paper it was noted that the behaviour of the paddle appeared to be consistent between sessions and various testing modalities. The instrumentation used in this study also showed a high level of repeatability in this and in other related studies performed by the current authors. Whenever possible the experimental conditions were chosen to replicate normal paddle use. Of note was the choice to not use a tow tank and engineered paddle mountings for the authors’ water-based experiments. After much consideration it was felt that the open water boat set-up with the paddle held in a manner similar to that used during normal use would provide a more realistic environment to study complex paddle resonance behaviour. The limitations incurred by this choice, such as a lack of detailed yaw, pitch, and roll information, while unavoidable, was not deemed significant for this study.</p>

<title>5 Conclusions</title>
<p>This study examined the characteristic resonance behaviour of a desirable open water canoe paddle. Flow-induced structural resonance was investigated and its effects measured and modelled for the paddle.
