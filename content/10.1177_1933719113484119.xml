Thus, not surprisingly, the mechanism of crossing-over occurs in a tightly regulated process that is known to ensure proper chromosome segregation and at least 1 crossover event per chromosome pair. Failure to accurately complete meiotic recombination leads to aneuploidy, which is a leading cause of spontaneous abortion and developmental disease.</p><p>Although several genes and their associated proteins have been shown to be involved in meiotic recombination, the mechanism is not yet completely understood.</p><p>Reynolds et al have focused their attention on RNF212, a putative regulator of crossing-over due to its homology to meiotic pro-crossover factors in yeast and nematodes. Their work, which has been recently published in <italic>Nature Genetics</italic> (<italic>Nat Genet</italic>. 2013;45(3):269-278), shows that mammalian RNF212 is essential for crossing-over, as it couples chromosome synapsis to the formation of crossover-specific recombination complexes.</p><p>The authors demonstrate that in mice, at least as early as zygonema, RNF212 selectively localizes to a subset of recombination sites to stabilize meiosis-specific recombination factors, including the MutSγ complex (MSH4-MSH5). Reynolds and colleagues infer that this selective stabilization of key recombination proteins is an essential feature of meiotic crossover control, as RNF212 null mice are sterile, both male and female.</p><p>The happloinsuficiency studies performed by the authors evidenced that mice with only one working copy of RNF212 are fertile but show fewer crossovers formed when compared to wild-type mice. This further indicates that RNF212 is a limiting factor for crossover designation and/or reinforcement, suggesting that when RNF212 levels fall below a certain threshold, general binding to the synaptonemal complex central region leaves insufficient molecules available to accumulate at recombination sites, leading to crossover failure.</p><p>Interestingly, in humans the rate of crossing-over varies significantly between individuals and has been shown to have a strong heritable component. Moreover, higher maternal crossover rates have been associated with greater fecundity. Therefore, it is possible that RNF212 defects might be on the etiology of some human infertility cases and aneuploidy conditions.</p><p>Altogether, the results presented by Reynolds et al not only provide key insights into the meiotic crossover control process where RNF212 plays a central role, but also suggest that this protein may be involved in some cases of unexplained infertility.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1933719113484119"><title>BRAC1 Impairment and Ovarian Aging</title><p>Understanding the age-related decline in women’s reproductive performance while thousands of primary oocytes remain in these women’s ovaries has remained somewhat a mystery. The urge to solve it comes hand in hand with a higher demand to preserve fertility, as more and more socioeconomic and cultural forces lead women to delay their childbearing attempts to later in life. </p><p>A recent publication by Titus et al (<italic>Sci Transl Med</italic>. 2013;5(172):1-12) sheds light on this issue, by providing a plausible explanation on how age plays a key role in ovarian aging.</p><p>Titus and colleagues had previously observed that women who carry germ line mutations in the <italic>BRCA1</italic> gene show a poor response to ovarian stimulation when undergoing fertility preservation through oocyte or embryo cryopreservation. In addition, recent evidence suggested that women with <italic>BRCA</italic> mutations may experience an earlier menopause. These observations led Titus et al to suspect that DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) repair could be involved in the maintenance of ovarian reserve, which would justify a prematurely diminished ovarian reserve in humans with <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations, as this protein plays a key role in the DSBs repair machinery.</p><p>Using both mouse and human samples, the authors show that with age DSBs accumulate in primordial follicles. In addition, Titus and colleagues determine that with age the expression of important DNA DSBs repair genes such as <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>MRE11</italic>, <italic>Rad51</italic>, and <italic>ATM</italic> declines in the oocytes. </p><p>Study of <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutant mice led Titus and colleagues to determine that the reproductive capacity of the animals was impaired due to the lower counts of primordial follicles compared to the wild-type mice. Additionally, DSBs increased with age and were higher in the remaining follicles of the mutant group when compared to the controls.</p><p>When oocyte-specific knockdown of <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>MRE11</italic>, <italic>Rad51</italic>, and <italic>ATM</italic> was performed, the authors observed an increase in DSBs and a reduced oocyte survival that were both rescued by <italic>BRCA1</italic> overexpression.</p><p>Importantly, the authors also looked at ovarian reserve in young human with <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutations by serum concentrations of anti-Müllerian hormone and show that there is a diminished reserve.</p><p>Thus, altogether the work presented by Titus et al very thoroughly indicate that DSBs play a major role in oocyte aging in humans, suggesting that future treatments that can enhance or maintain an efficient DNA repair machinery would be a proper tool to fight or slow down ovarian aging.</p></sec></body></article>
