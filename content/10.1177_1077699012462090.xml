<p>Fonts greet us everywhere. Names on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial appear in Optima. President Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign materials used Gotham. The U.S. editions of the Harry Potter series were published in Garamond. And there’s the ubiquitous Helvetica—the world’s most familiar font—in logos for American Airlines and Crate&amp;Barrel, as the title of the television show <italic>The Office</italic>, and on signage throughout New York City’s subway system, among other places.</p>
<p><italic>In Just My Type: A Book about Fonts</italic>, British author Simon Garfield takes the reader on a lively romp through the history of fonts, aka typeface styles. Anecdotal rather than encyclopedic, the book combines entertaining stories with detailed research to show how certain typefaces were created and how fonts can affect our lives. The book also doubles as a cultural history, exploring, for instance, the golden age of font design in the 1920s; illustrating samples of more than two-hundred fonts and explaining their backgrounds; and examining the Nazi party’s embrace of traditional gothic text, which led the typeface Fraktur to be nicknamed “the jackboot gothic.”</p>
<p>When Johannes Gutenberg launched the mass production of books with the invention of mechanical movable type in the mid-1400s, he also created the world’s first font, Textura—a Gothic type resembling hand-written script, since that’s what people back then were used to seeing. More than 560 years later, font creation has exploded to the point that the encyclopedic go-to FontBook lists more than 100,000 typefaces, ranging from the classic Times New Roman to BANANA.strip Regular, with letters made from drawings of banana skins.</p>
<p>A modern milestone in font history was the 1984 unveiling of Apple’s Macintosh computer, which, unlike primitive computers before then, offered a variety of fonts. These font options, writes Garfield, marked “the beginning of something—a seismic shift in our everyday relationship and with type.” IBM and Microsoft soon had their own font offerings, and computer users’ ability to change typefaces at will marked “a creative move towards expressiveness, a liberating playfulness with words.”</p>
<p>Garfield says the overriding principle in type design is that “typefaces should mostly pass unrecognized in daily life; that they should inform but not alarm.” Among the world’s most legible fonts are the serif Bembo, Bodoni, and Garamond, all of which have existed for hundreds of years. Yet the aesthetics of typeface creation are as important as practicality. Today, Garfield says, “the most important questions when selecting or appreciating type have become: Does it fit the role it was intended for? Does it get its message across? And does it add something of beauty to the world?”</p>
<p>Thus, are form and function intertwined in ways that can evoke strong emotions? Garfield writes that the London Underground’s Johnston Sans, which first appeared in 1916, is “one of the most iconic, enduring and best-loved fonts in the world.” Many IKEA customers became furious when, in 2009, IKEA changed its catalog typeface from the elegant Futura to the modern Verdana, creating an online “fontroversy.” The childlike Comic Sans offended some readers enough that they launched a “Ban Comic Sans” campaign. And the practical Helvetica has inspired a cult-like following that includes a documentary. “Like no font before or after it, Helvetica achieved a tipping point, and it shows no sign of waning,” Garfield writes. “Wherever you go, there it is.”</p>
<p>Garfield is an engaging and witty writer, at once funny, lyrical, and descriptive. His description of the ill-fated typeface Doves (whose letters were thrown in the Thames) describes “the bottom bowl of its g set at an angle, giving it a sense of motion, like a helicopter tilting at take-off.” He at times anthropomorphizes typefaces, as when he derides the jagged London 2012 Olympic Typeface as being the world’s worst font, referencing a critic who deemed it the graphic equivalent of “‘dad-dancing’—namely a middle-aged man who tries so hard to be cool on the dance floor that he fails.” And his amusing backstories include descriptions of watchdogs for typographical anachronisms, such as the movie <italic>Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid</italic>, which was set in the 1940s but used the 1970s-era typeface Blippo for a cruise brochure.</p>
<p>Garfield is not a font specialist. A journalist and nonfiction author, he has written a dozen books about topics as wide-ranging as wrestling, the color mauve, and a history of the Mini automobile. Here, he has penned a unique page-turner about a topic many people might otherwise consider boring. Beyond its writing, the book is strong on research; though there are no endnotes, Garfield includes an extensive bibliography and list of online sources, along with a comprehensive index. Perhaps the only drawbacks are the lack of attribution throughout, along with what seems to be a whimsical ordering of chapters.</p>
<p><italic>Just My Type</italic> is relevant not just for font enthusiasts but for those interested in the future of reading. New typeface designs continue apace in the digital age, created for maximal legibility on all manner of electronic screens. Old favorites also co-exist, with the first five typeface choices on the iPad’s iBook in its 2010 debut including Baskerville, Times New Roman, and Palatino. Even the iPhone has a WhatTheFont app for identifying typefaces. Explaining the continued interest in designing fonts, self-described “typomaniac” Erik Spiekermann notes that “that’s the challenge for all of us—to create warmth in a digital world. … We’re still analogue beings.”</p>
