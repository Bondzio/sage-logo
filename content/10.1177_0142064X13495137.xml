<abstract>
<p>The account of the healing of Peter’s mother-in-law (Mt. 8.14-15; cf. Mk 1.29-31) has been rewritten and recontextualized by Matthew so as to recall speciﬁc stories about Elisha, speciﬁcally, the prophet’s raising of the Sunammite woman’s son (2 Kgs 4.18-37) and the prophet’s call by Elijah (1 Kgs 19.19-21). This editorial activity enhances the Gospel’s characterization of Jesus as a prophet, its characterization of those he heals as disciples, and its characterization of the Christian household as a center of ritual healing.</p>

<p>In the ideology of the ancient (male) mind, mothers-in-law were as untrustworthy as they were ill-tempered.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0142064X13495137">1</xref></sup> The resilience of such stereotypes (together with the terseness of the episode) is perhaps to blame for the limited attention that has been paid to the story of Peter’s mother-in-law in the history of biblical scholarship. An exception to this is an essay by the famous French Catholic scholar Xavier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0142064X13495137">Léon-Dufour (1965)</xref>, who took the differences between Mt. 8.14-15 and the parallel accounts in Mk 1.29-31 and Lk. 4.38-39 as evidence that the author of the ﬁrst Gospel relied on a separate, now-lost tradition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0142064X13495137">2</xref></sup> In what follows, I adopt a more conventional approach, namely, that in fashioning this story Matthew draws on Mark, but that in utilizing his source material he exhibits his typical freedom as a redactor. Indeed, Mt. 8–9 is one of the places where Matthew departs most noticeably from Mark’s narrative outline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0142064X13495137">Luz 1995</xref>: 8). In so doing he has left us with a truly distinct literary composition,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0142064X13495137">3</xref></sup> the contents of which can be summarized as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-0142064X13495137" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A triad of miracle stories (8.1-15) followed by a summary statement plus instructional material (8.16-22);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A second triad of miracle stories (8.23-9.8) followed by the call of Matthew plus instructional material (9.9-17);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A third triad of miracle stories (9.18-34) followed by a summary statement plus instructional material (9.35-38).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0142064X13495137">4</xref></sup></p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The focus for this investigation is the ﬁrst of these units, Mt. 8.1-22. As we shall see, here the evangelist has not only gathered together a particular cluster of stories, but also organized these stories in a particular order. For those interested in spelling out the implications of this literary activity, there are no doubt various ways of entering into the discussion. The approach adopted here frames the question in a speciﬁc way, namely, by focusing on how Matthew has reworked and recontextualized the story of Peter’s mother-in-law (8.14-15). I begin by analyzing the narrative dynamics of 8.1-15, especially as they relate to matters of space and gender. Next, I identify similarities between Mt. 8.14-15 and 2 Kgs 4.18-37 (Elisha’s raising of the Sunammite woman’s son) and between Mt. 8.14-15, 19-22 and 1 Kgs 19.19-21 (Elijah’s call of Elisha). I conclude by exploring some of the study’s implications for understanding how the evangelist conﬁgures the house as a symbolic and social space.</p>

<title>Narrative Scope and Social Dynamics</title>
<p>In 8.1-22, Matthew draws for material not only on Mark but also on the Q source:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0142064X13495137">5</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>In Mark, the healing of Peter’s mother-in-law and the accompanying summary statement comes ﬁrst (Mk 1.29-34), followed by a scene in which Jesus departs from Capernaum (Mk 1.35-39) and then the healing of the man with a scale-disease (Mk 1.40-45). Matthew reverses the order of the two healing episodes, drops the intervening material (Mk 1.35-39),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0142064X13495137">6</xref></sup> and then in 8.5-13 inserts between the two episodes a text derived from Q, the story of the centurion and his servant (cf. Lk. 7.1-10).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0142064X13495137">7</xref></sup> After Mt. 8.16-17, which is based on Mk 1.32-34, at Mt. 8.18-22 the evangelist inserts another Q text (cf. Lk. 9.57-60), though it appears that this material, consisting of two discipleship apophthegms, comes from a different location in his source, that is, after the material in Q(Lk.) 7.18-35 (cf. Mt. 11.2-19).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0142064X13495137">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In evaluating the results of this redactional activity, it is important to recognize that in Mt. 8.1-15 (i.e., in the ﬁrst triad of miracle stories) the evangelist has altered the flow not only of the narrative’s <italic>structure</italic>, but also of the narrative’s <italic>scope</italic>. Speciﬁcally, as they transition from the ﬁrst two stories of the unit (Mt. 8.1-4, 5-13) to the third (Mt. 8.14-15), the readers encounter various forms of what we might call ‘narrowing’ or ‘contraction’ in terms of how the narrative is conveyed. This progression in the means of storytelling can be detected in four areas.</p>
<p>The ﬁrst form of narrowing concerns the composition’s mix of action and dialogue. As commentators note, in the ﬁrst two stories of the triad, Matthean redaction has the result of emphasizing the role of verbal exchange in the flow of the narrative.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0142064X13495137">9</xref></sup> In the case of Mt. 8.5-13, the dialogue has been expanded to such an extent that it is possible to categorize the episode formally as a hybrid of healing story and pronouncement story.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0142064X13495137">10</xref></sup> In Mt. 8.14-15, by contrast, there are no pronouncements. In fact, this is the only healing story in Matthew in which no dialogue of any kind occurs. Even Mark’s report that the disciples informed Jesus ‘at once’ about the woman’s condition has been dropped. The form of narration has contracted to sheer action. As a consequence, Mt. 8.14-15 is the only healing story in the Gospel where the initiative for the healing comes from Jesus rather than from the person in need of healing or from some third-party character.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0142064X13495137">11</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>καὶ ἐλθὼν ὁ ‘Ιησοῦϛ εἰϛ τὴν οἰκίαν Πέτρου εἶδεν τὴν πενθερὰν αὐτοῦ βεβλημένην καὶ πυρέσσουσαν· καὶ ἥψατο τῆϛ χειρὸϛ αὐτῆϛ, καὶ ἀφῆκεν αὐτὴν ὁ πυρετόϛ, καὶ ἠγέρθη καὶ διηκόνει αὐτῷ.</p>
<p>When Jesus entered Peter’s house he saw his mother-in-law lying there with a fever; and he touched her hand and the fever left her. And she got up and served him.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The unit consists of three actions associated with Jesus (he enters the house, he sees the woman, and he touches her hand) followed by three actions associated with the woman (the fever leaves her, she gets up, and she serves Jesus).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0142064X13495137">12</xref></sup> In the absence of dialogue, there is no supplication, even from the sick woman herself. In the ﬁrst two stories of the unit the supplicants had initiated their conversations with Jesus by addressing him as ‘Lord’ (Mt. 8.2, 6). Here, by contrast, no such indication is given as to the woman’s attitude toward Jesus as a healer. Evidently, neither her condition nor her beliefs are matters about which Jesus needs to be informed. He simply knows and acts.</p>
<p>Second, contraction also takes place in the number of characters. In the ﬁrst two stories of the unit, the presence of crowds is explicitly mentioned (Mt. 8.1, 10). Indeed, up to this point in the Gospel Jesus’ healing (like his teaching) has been very much a ‘public’ practice, large numbers of people having been present either to be healed or to witness healing (cf. Mt. 4.23-24). Here not only are the crowds gone but the disciples—even Peter—have been written out of the story as well. In fact, there are no third-party characters at all: no advocates to petition on behalf of the afflicted, no opponents to contest what Jesus is doing, no onlookers to marvel and spread the news.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0142064X13495137">13</xref></sup> Even the fever is envisioned as leaving (ἀφῆκεν) the house.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0142064X13495137">14</xref></sup> If we were to imagine a stage production of the scene, it would be carried out with only two actors and entirely in silence, all attention being focused on the actions of the healer and the one healed.</p>
<p>Third, with each successive story in our unit the reader is presented with an increased level of speciﬁcity with regard to the location of Jesus’ healing activity. The action moves from an unspeciﬁed area outside of Capernaum (Mt. 8.1) to somewhere in Capernaum (Mt. 8.5) to a speciﬁc place within the city, the home of Peter (Mt. 8.14). This narrowing appears to be signiﬁcant with regard not only to the particular place, but also to the particular kind of place, the enclosed space of the οἰκία. While in the story of the centurion it was Jesus’ healing power that entered into this space (note οἰκία in Mt. 8.6), here—for the ﬁrst time in the Gospel—it is the healer himself who enters into this space (Mt. 8.14). The sequence of events, then, creates a spatial contraction in the venue of Jesus’ activity as well as a focusing in the direction of Jesus’ movements, so that the house, this particular house, takes on added signiﬁcance.</p>
<p>Fourth, a similar dynamic of increasing speciﬁcity can be observed with regard to the principal individuals with whom Jesus interacts as healer. The ﬁrst petitioner is an anonymous person known only by his ailment (Mt. 8.2), the second is an anonymous person known by his profession, his status as a slave-owner, and by his (likely) place of residence, while the beneﬁciary of Jesus’ healing in the third story is a speciﬁc individual linked to a speciﬁc, named character. This narrowing appears to be signiﬁcant with regard not only to the particular person, but also to the particular kind of person. Corresponding with the healer’s ﬁrst entry into a house is the ﬁrst healing story in the Gospel that involves a woman (cf. 9.18-26; 15.21-28).</p>
<p>Even as it is critical to recognize the nexus of silence, gender and domestic space in our healing story, it is also important not to overstate its signiﬁcance. After all, in Matthew’s Gospel neither the space of the house nor the receipt of healing is coded for gender. Both men (9.28-30) and women (9.23-25) are reported as receiving healing inside of a house, just as both men (9.32-33) and women (9.20-22) can receive healing outside of a house. This parity applies to the technique of healing as well, with Jesus healing both men (20.34) and women (9.25) by means of mere touch, just as he heals both men (8.13) and women (15.28) with just a word. In assessing the evidence, we can turn for guidance to Elaine Wainwright’s ground-breaking study <italic>Women Healing/Healing Women: The Genderization of Healing in Early Christianity</italic>. Wainwright begins her analysis of the episode in Mk 1.29-31/Mt. 8.14-15 by eschewing the sort of model-driven approaches (endorsed by social-scientiﬁc critics like Bruce Malina and John Pilch) that presuppose a strict alignment between gender and ‘the cultural code of the public/private’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0142064X13495137">15</xref></sup> Rather than operating according to rigid dichotomies, she suggests that in the Gospels the gendering of both healing spaces and healing practices is subject to constant negotiation through the artful reconﬁguration of authoritative narratives.</p>
<p>Such an approach would seem to be relevant to the investigation of our story, where the mutability of explanatory categories like ‘public’ and ‘private’ is signaled in part by the speciﬁc actions associated with Peter’s mother-in-law in Mt. 8.15. The ﬁrst of these is indicated by the verb ἐγείρω, which elsewhere is used in the passion predictions (Mt. 16.21; 17.23; 20.19; cf. 17.9; 28.6-7). The same eschatological power by which God will raise Jesus’ cruciﬁed body from the dead is, by implication, at work in this woman’s healed body, just as it will be at work in the raising of the ofﬁcial’s daughter in Mt. 9.25 (cf. 10.8; 11.5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0142064X13495137">16</xref></sup> The second of these is indicated by the verb διακονέω, which elsewhere describes the service rendered to Jesus not only by women, but also by men and even angels (4.11; 25.44; 27.55) as well as the ‘service’ that Christ himself renders to humanity through his life and death (20.28). Thus the woman’s response in Mt. 8.15 can be understood not only as referring to a speciﬁc act of service, but also as intimating a connection between healing and discipleship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0142064X13495137">17</xref></sup> That Peter’s mother-in-law is shown resuming her domestic duties, then, ‘is not an afﬁrmation of ﬁxed gender and spatial categories’ but indicates that her domestic space has been ‘transformed’ so as to ‘encompass male and female activities of both a public and private nature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0142064X13495137">Wainwright 2006</xref>: 111).</p>
<p>As for the physical conﬁguration of the domestic space in which this transformation occurs, Wainwright suggests that the evangelists probably had in mind a courtyard house (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0142064X13495137">Wainwright 2006</xref>: 107). In support of this suggestion, she refers to archaeological evidence reviewed by Eric Meyers indicating the prevalence of such houses during this era in Syro-Palestine, especially in urban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0142064X13495137">Meyers 2007</xref>). A visitor to such a dwelling would have to pass through a single entranceway and then through a central courtyard in order to gain access to the rooms surrounding it, rooms which, like the courtyard itself, served multiple functions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0142064X13495137">18</xref></sup> In some cases, the complex would have been large enough to accommodate as many as three or four (presumably related) families.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0142064X13495137">19</xref></sup> Imagining such a setting, Wainwright surmises that it would have been necessary for Jesus to traverse not just one but a number of social and spatial ‘boundaries’ in order to reach Peter’s mother-in-law lying in one of the rooms of the house.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0142064X13495137">20</xref></sup> Such a reconstruction certainly seems to be applicable in the case of Mark’s version of the story, since there Jesus does not proceed immediately to the woman upon entering the residence but does so only after being informed of her condition by the disciples accompanying him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0142064X13495137">21</xref></sup> Whether the reconstruction applies to Matthew’s version of the story is more difﬁcult to say, although we can infer from Mt. 26.3, 58 and 69 that the evangelist was familiar with courtyards,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0142064X13495137">22</xref></sup> while Mt. 6.6 and 24.26 project an organization of domestic space that includes not only ‘inner’ rooms, but also rooms separated from the rest of the house by doors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0142064X13495137">23</xref></sup> If we were to imagine Jesus entering the sort of ‘pastas-style’ houses found throughout the Greco-Roman world, then it would have been necessary for him to traverse even more symbolic boundaries insofar as such domiciles would have included a ‘transverse hall’ adjacent to the courtyard and facing a suite of two or more inner rooms, thereby functioning as an ‘intramural zone’ mediating ‘between the semipublic space of the courtyard and the fully private sanctum’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0142064X13495137">Ault 2005</xref>: 66-67).</p>
<p>However we are to envision the space, it is probably correct to assume that the movement depicted in Mt. 8.14 involved ‘stages of entry into the house’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0142064X13495137">Wainwright 2006</xref>: 144). What remains uncertain, however, is how best to assess the meaning of this entry in light of the various forms of narrative ‘contraction’ identiﬁed above. Regardless of how many social and spatial boundaries the Matthean Jesus may be envisioned as traversing in order to reach Peter’s mother-in-law, in the absence of third-party characters or a request for healing, he is represented as doing so not only unaccompanied, but also uninvited. Mark’s version of the story may have Jesus entering a cultural ‘borderland’ where a ‘public’ healer performs in a ‘private’ venue, but in Matthew’s retelling of the story, ‘the entry of Jesus alone into the very presence of a woman lying sick seems a breach of even the most carefully nuanced construction of public and private space in ﬁrst-century imaginations’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0142064X13495137">24</xref></sup> Wainwright’s investigation, however, does little to explain the signiﬁcance of this breach for understanding either the distinctive character of the story or its contribution to the literary and thematic proﬁle of Mt. 8.1-22. In order to address these issues, it is necessary to expand the scope of analysis beyond Matthew’s redaction of Mk 1.29-31 to include the manner in which the evangelist has situated the story both within its immediate literary context and in relation to possible biblical precedents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0142064X13495137">
<title>In the Name of a Prophet</title>
<p>As we have seen, Mt. 8.1-22 constitutes a literary unity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0142064X13495137">25</xref></sup> Further unifying this material are thematic features that ground its story of Jesus in the story of Israel. For example, at three different junctures reference is made to one or more heroes from salvation history: Moses in Mt. 8.4, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in Mt. 8.11, and Isaiah ‘the prophet’ in Mt. 8.17. On a more subtle level, some scholars have suggested that the ﬁrst two stories in the unit recall the exploits of another great ﬁgure from Israelite history, the prophet Elisha, speciﬁcally his healing or ‘cleansing’ of Naaman the Aramite.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0142064X13495137">26</xref></sup> The former episode, Mt. 8.1-4, parallels 2 Kgs 5.1-14 in that both of the supplicants in question suffer from a similar affliction (‘leprosy’, i.e., a scale-disease), while the latter, Mt. 8.5-13, parallels 2 Kgs 5.1-14 in that both of the supplicants in question have a similar status and profession (Gentile military ofﬁcer). Matthew’s redactional activity in constructing this three-part section, then, has the result of drawing together two healing stories that evoke the activities of the prophet Elisha. Given this, as well as the fact that Matthew interprets what transpires in the unit as the fulﬁllment of a prophetic oracle (Mt. 8.17), it is worth asking if the same can be said of the third. After all, as Raymond Brown has observed, it ‘is in respect to miracles that we ﬁnd the closest similarities between Jesus and Elisha’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0142064X13495137">Brown 1971</xref>: 89).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0142064X13495137">27</xref></sup> As he further observes, these similarities are based not so much on speciﬁc verbal parallels as on ‘general similarities in the <italic>type</italic> of miracles’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0142064X13495137">Brown 1971</xref>: 92; emphasis original), a point worth bearing in mind as we proceed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, an inspection of the commentary literature is of little assistance in addressing this question. In fact, most commentaries do not posit much of an Old Testament background for Mt. 8.14-15 at all. An exception in this regard is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142064X13495137">W.D. Davies and Dale Allison (1991</xref>: 34), who suggest that ‘perhaps we should recall the OT texts in which the prophets Elisha (2 Kgs 5.9; 6.1-2, 32) and Ezekiel (3.24) stay in houses’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0142064X13495137">28</xref></sup> A somewhat better parallel, one that also occurs in a house, comes from the story of Elisha’s raising of the Shunammite woman’s son (2 Kgs 4.18-37). Of particular interest are the following texts:</p>

<p>Matthean redaction produces a statement, one unique to his version of the story, that parallels 2 Kgs 4.32 in terms of the basic narrative sequence: the healer enters the house, attention is drawn to the one in need of healing, and then there is a brief description of the latter’s posture and condition. Note that the incident described there occurs in an upper room of the house (2 Kgs 4.10, 21; cf. 1 Kgs 17.19), the door of which Elisha closes in order to ensure privacy (4.33), and that the healing technique he subsequently employs also involves physical contact (4.34-35). Note further that at one point the Shunammite woman is identiﬁed as the prophet’s ‘servant’ (2 Kgs 4.16), with which we can compare the ‘service’ offered to Jesus by Peter’s mother-in-law after her healing. If Matthew drew on this prophetic story for inspiration in reshaping his own story, it would help to explain why his account seems to be more ‘private’ than the one provided by Mark. It may also be signiﬁcant that the miracle performed by Elisha involves bringing someone back from the dead (cf. 1 Kgs 17.17-24). Readers who recognized similarities between the two episodes would be more likely to appreciate not only the prophetic character of Jesus’ person and actions, but also the symbolic undercurrents of ἠγέρθη in Mt. 8.15. Finally, it should be noted that a similar ‘privatization’ of healing can be detected elsewhere in the Gospel, speciﬁcally in the redaction of Mt. 9.18-19, 23-26, the story of the raising of the ofﬁcial’s daughter. In contrast to the report in Mk 5.40 (which has him accompanied by a group of witnesses), the ﬁrst Gospel has Jesus enter her room alone (Mt. 9.25), just as Elijah (1 Kgs 17.19) and Elisha (2 Kgs 4.33) had done when they raised dead youths to life (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0142064X13495137">Theissen 1983</xref>: 60-61).</p>
<p>While such comparisons help to bring the biblical character of our story into relief, they do not exhaust the intertextual possibilities that it presents. In order to clarify these possibilities, however, it is necessary to proceed by comparing our passage not with another Old Testament text but with two pericopes found elsewhere in Matthew:
<disp-quote>
<p>As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw (εἶδεν) two brothers, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea—for they were ﬁshermen. And he said to them, ‘Follow me, and I will make you ﬁsh for people.’ Immediately they left their nets and followed him. (Mt. 4.18-20; cf. 4.21-22)</p>
<p>As Jesus was walking along, he saw (εἶδεν) a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth; and he said to him, ‘Follow me.’ And he got up and followed him. (Mt. 9.9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both of these pericopes (as well as 4.21-22) belong to the literary genre of the ‘call’ or vocation story. The structural elements of the form can be outlined as follows: (1) appearance of Jesus, (2) Jesus sees the prospective disciple(s), (3) observation on the location and activity of the one(s) called, (4) the call to discipleship, (5) positive response to the call. A re-examination of Mt. 8.14-15 indicates that its contents correspond with this basic structure (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142064X13495137">Benoit and Boismard 1972</xref>: 97), except for element 4, where in lieu of a call to discipleship we have a healing, although it is worth noting that the association between calling and healing is one that ﬁgures in the analysis of miracle stories elsewhere in the Gospel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0142064X13495137">29</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>(1) When Jesus entered Peter’s house (2) he saw (εἶδεν) his mother-in-law (3) lying there with a fever; (4) and he touched her hand and the fever left her. (5) And she got up and served him.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Note further how the particular term that Matthew uses for ‘saw’ in 8.14 (εἶδεν), a word unique to his version of the narrative (cf. Mk 1.30), is also used in element 2 of all three of the call stories (Mt. 4.18, 21; 9.9).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0142064X13495137">30</xref></sup> Commenting on such stories, Joel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0142064X13495137">Marcus (2000</xref>: 183) suggests that the vision involved should be interpreted not as passive observation, but as an active ‘possessive gaze’ and, as such, an expression of the viewer’s prophetic acuity. The parallels identiﬁed above suggest that the same can be applied to the interpretation of our passage as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0142064X13495137">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>On both the formal and verbal levels, then, it appears that Matthean redaction has transformed Mark’s rather standard healing story into a healing story with features of a call story.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0142064X13495137">32</xref></sup> This development would help to account not only for the absence of third-party characters in Mt. 8.14-15, but also for the fact that here, in contrast to the other healing stories in the Gospel, Jesus is the one who initiates the narrative action, doing so in a manner consistent with the general pattern of the New Testament ‘call’ genre.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0142064X13495137">33</xref></sup> Readers who recognized similarities between our story and this genre would also be more likely to understand διηκόνει αὐτῷ in Mt. 8.15 as an anticipation of Mt. 27.55: ‘Many women were also there, looking on from a distance; they had followed Jesus from Galilee and served him (διακονοῦσαι αὐτῷ).’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0142064X13495137">34</xref></sup> Healing calls Peter’s mother-in-law to a form of service that is appropriate to one who follows the Lord.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0142064X13495137">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>As commentators often note, the basic genre of the call story did not originate with the evangelists themselves but has its roots in Old Testament prophetic narratives, especially the story of Elijah’s call of Elisha.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0142064X13495137">36</xref></sup> Comparison with 1 Kgs 19.19-21 is appropriate for the analysis of Mt. 8.14-15 as well, especially when we take into account the way in which the two stories conclude:
<disp-quote>
<p>καὶ ἀνέστη καὶ ἐπορεύθη ὀπίσω Ηλιου καὶ ἐλειτούργει αὐτῷ. … and he stood up and followed after Elijah and ministered to him. (1 Kgs 19.21)</p>
<p>καὶ ἠγέρθη καὶ διηκόνει αὐτω῀ͅ.… and she got up and began to serve him. (Mt. 8.15)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Elisha’s positive response to Elijah’s call has two components, following and serving. In Matthew, we have the former in 4.20, 22, 9.9, the latter in 8.15, and both (interestingly enough) only in 27.55. Looking at our story, given the nature of the ‘call’ genre, it is not surprising that the ﬁrst Gospel has Peter’s mother-in-law serving ‘him’ and not ‘them’ as in the Markan version (Mk 1.31).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0142064X13495137">37</xref></sup> For Matthew, all that matters is her response to Jesus.</p>
<p>In addition, the story of Elijah’s call of Elisha has influenced the shape not only of the pericopes cited above, but also of two pronouncement stories on discipleship in the New Testament, stories that (as we have seen) Matthew appears to have repositioned from their original context in the Q source to a location immediately following the material in Mt. 8.14-17. There is a consensus among interpreters that Mt. 8.21-22 in particular entails an allusion to 1 Kgs 19.20, where Elisha requests permission to take leave of his father and mother.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0142064X13495137">38</xref></sup> Indeed, it is comparison with the Elijah–Elisha typology that makes Jesus’ response to the would-be disciple in Mt. 8.22 seem so shocking.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0142064X13495137">39</xref></sup> Like the story of Peter’s mother-in-law, this pair of discipleship apophthegms has no third-party characters, Matthew’s redaction of 8.14-15 having the effect of creating formal alignment with 8.18-22 in this regard.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0142064X13495137">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>It appears, then, that the different ways in which Mt. 8.14-15 alludes to the ﬁgure of Elisha correspond to the different ways in which the passage relates to its literary environment. Speciﬁcally, the passage serves both as the third of three stories that evoke the prophet’s healings as well as the ﬁrst of three stories that evoke the prophet’s call. Similarities between Mt. 8.14-15 and 2 Kgs 4.18-37 help to align the former with the stories in Mt. 8.1-13, which recall 2 Kgs 5.1-14, while similarities between Mt. 8.14-15 and 1 Kgs 19.19-21 suggest that the former can be interpreted as a transition to Mt. 8.18-22, which, as we have seen, is also rooted in 1 Kgs 19.19-21. Within this trio of stories in Mt. 8.14-22, Peter’s mother-in-law compares favorably, since she is the only one reported as responding positively to Jesus.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0142064X13495137">41</xref></sup> Matthew 8.18-22, in turn, segues to Mt. 8.23-27 and the second triad of miracle stories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0142064X13495137">42</xref></sup> An appreciation for these intertextual features provides a perspective from which to explicate more fully the results of the evangelist’s literary activity in Mt. 8.1-22, contributing as they do not only to the section’s thematic unity, but also to the revelation of Jesus’ prophetic identity,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0142064X13495137">43</xref></sup> one that extends to his disciples as well, who in their ministry of healing (Mt. 10.1) are sent out as prophets in the name of a prophet (Mt. 10.41).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0142064X13495137">44</xref></sup></p>

<title>Healing and Houses</title>
<p>The explication of Jesus’ prophetic identity ﬁgures as well in the text accompanying Mt. 8.14-15, which consists of two elements: a summary statement (Mt. 8.16), followed by a fulﬁllment quotation attributed to Isaiah ‘the prophet’ (Mt. 8.17). With the latter, the author reminds his readers that the acts of Jesus are not self-interpreting, that is, they do not by themselves provide sufﬁcient evidence of his true identity and mission: ‘It is not the miracles that attest, rather they themselves must ﬁrst be attested.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0142064X13495137">45</xref></sup> As for the former, Mt. 8.16 is of particular interest for the various shifts that it ushers into the narrative. To begin with, we see that here Jesus resumes his usual, more reactive role as healer, with the afflicted being ‘brought to him’ (cf. 4.24; 9.2, 32; 12.22; 14.35). In addition, the silence accompanying the healer’s actions in Mt. 8.14-15 is broken, with Jesus now casting out spirits ‘with a word’, an expression that links this episode with the one that precedes it (cf. Mt. 8.8). Most important, the house, which had been the space of private healing, now opens up as a space for public healing. Note that while 8.16 indicates a change in time, it does not indicate a change in setting. It is therefore not just the state of Peter’s mother-in-law that is transformed, but also the state of Peter’s home. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0142064X13495137">Davies and Allison (1991</xref>: 40) imagine the crowds of 8.16 as gathering ‘around’ the house, but this reading seems to reflect Mark’s version of the story (Mk 1.33) more than Matthew’s. As Eric <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0142064X13495137">Meyers (2007</xref>: 118) points out, in a typical courtyard house, the space created by the courtyard was not ‘a convenient barrier between public and private domains’, but rather permitted ‘multiple connections with neighbors and multiple relationships among people residing within the domicile’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0142064X13495137">46</xref></sup> This fact raises the possibility that the courtyard (or perhaps also the transverse hall) of Peter’s house was the place in Mt. 8.16 where people were being brought to Jesus.</p>
<p>A domestic setting for the action of Mt. 8.16 would also accord with subsequent texts in the Gospel that draw attention to the house as a venue of healing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0142064X13495137">47</xref></sup> To effect the cures in Mt. 9.27-31, for example, Jesus is presented as entering a house (οἰκία) with the supplicants,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0142064X13495137">48</xref></sup> an item not found in the story’s Markan counterparts (Mk 8.22-26; 10.46-52), while Mt. 9.10-12 presents Jesus ‘the physician’ teaching ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ (cf. Mt. 13.36; 17.25).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0142064X13495137">49</xref></sup> Houses also ﬁgure prominently as physical and social centers for the disciples’ missionary work (Mt. 10.11-14, again with οἰκία), which includes healing the sick (Mt. 10.1, 8).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0142064X13495137">50</xref></sup> The narrative connection between houses and healing may be based in part on the experience of Matthew’s original readers, for whom the house-church would have served as a place of ritual healing, an institutional role reflected in other early Christian texts as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0142064X13495137">51</xref></sup> In the evangelist’s narrative world, this space can be seen to contrast symbolically both with the ‘house’ (οἶκοϛ) of the Jerusalem temple (Mt. 12.4; 21.13; 23.38), which can serve as a venue for ritual healing only after Jesus has ‘cleansed’ it (Mt. 21.14; cf. 2 Sam. 5.6-8), as well as with the ‘house’ (οἰκία) of the ‘strong man’ (Mt. 12.29), which Jesus ‘plunders’ by healing those possessed of demons (Mt. 12.22-28).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0142064X13495137">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>In evaluating the import of such texts for Matthew’s original readers, it is worth remembering that early Christianity was not the ﬁrst or only movement to situate healing practices within domestic spaces. In Tob. 3.10-17, for example, an agent of divine healing is said to enter such a space while one supplicant is in an upper room and another is in the house’s courtyard (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0142064X13495137">Schüngel-Straumann 2000</xref>: 87-93). Hippocratic physicians sometimes operated out of their own homes, carrying out ‘public’ work in the ‘private’ realm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0142064X13495137">Nutton 1992</xref>: 49), while charismatic healers were not unknown to operate in domestic settings as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0142064X13495137">53</xref></sup> There is also evidence that devotees of the Asclepius cult would sometimes consecrate their homes to the god’s service.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0142064X13495137">54</xref></sup> The household could even serve as the location for a ‘healing as call’ experience. The author of a second-century <sc>ce</sc> papyrus, for example, recounts how, in response to his prayers, Asclepius appeared to him one night while he was sleeping in his home: after curing the man of his fever, the god demanded that he fulﬁll his previous pledge to translate a sacred book into Greek.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0142064X13495137">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>Against such a backdrop, a narrative like Mt. 8.14-17, grounded as it is in various prophetic texts, can be interpreted as providing needed legitimation for the Christian ‘house’ as a center of ritual healing,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0142064X13495137">56</xref></sup> a need that would have taken on added urgency if the ‘house’ of prayer (i.e., the synagogue) in the evangelist’s milieu was also seeking recognition as a center of healing in its own right.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0142064X13495137">57</xref></sup> For Matthew’s readers, who themselves worshipped in house-churches, such descriptions of Jesus’ prophetic activity would have had both spiritual and social relevance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0142064X13495137">58</xref></sup> The same power manifested in houses during his earthly ministry is now manifested in house-churches through his continued presence ‘with’ the community (Mt. 1.23; 28.20).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0142064X13495137">59</xref></sup> The healing narratives are not just illustrating theological themes like discipleship or resurrection, then, but also authorizing and eliciting the personal experiences that believers have of Christ in their time of need, including the role of such experiences in establishing and sustaining the life of faith.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0142064X13495137">60</xref></sup> In support of this, stories like ours project the ‘house’ as both the social and the symbolic space in which such experiences are given expression. With regard to the latter, an instructive connection can perhaps be drawn between Mt. 8.14-15 and Mt. 6.6, a passage that similarly combines imagery of vision with imagery of domestic space (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0142064X13495137">Wilson 2010</xref>). It is not just that the heavenly Father ‘sees’ the faithful when they pray in ‘the inner room’, that is, in the private, quiet places of life, but that Christ ‘sees’ them there as well and, moreover, enters into this space to transform the believer with a healing touch.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>According to Vitruvius, ‘into the private rooms no one can come uninvited’ (<italic>Arch</italic>. 6.5.1). As we have seen, the various forms of narrative ‘contraction’ evident in Matthew’s manner of rewriting and recontextualizing the story of Peter’s mother-in-law draw attention both to the private nature of her encounter with Jesus and to the domestic setting in which this encounter occurs. The seeming breach of cultural norms attending the evangelist’s re-envisioning of the scene lends the story a distinctive character, one that recalls stories about Elisha in 1 Kgs 19.19-21 and 2 Kgs 4.18-37. From this perspective, Mt. 8.14-15 can be seen to function as a narrative hinge, operating both as the third of three stories (Mt. 8.1-4, 5-13, 14-15) that evoke healings performed by Elisha (2 Kgs 4.18-37; 5.1-14) and as the ﬁrst of three stories (Mt. 8.14-15, 19-20, 21-22) that evoke his call by Elijah (1 Kgs 19.19-21).</p>
<p>As we have also seen, it is possible to identify ways in which this study relates more widely to other research on Matthew’s Gospel. For example, by aligning the action of 8.1-22 with such biblical narratives, Matthew dramatizes the prophetic nature of Jesus’ person, reinforcing the place of his ministry in salvation history, and legitimating the house as the venue of such ministry. Our ﬁndings also have a bearing on the evangelist’s view of discipleship, especially insofar as the type of healing experience represented by Mt. 8.14-15 can be said to ‘call’ people—women in particular—to participate not only in ‘rising’ with Christ, but also in ‘serving’ Christ. Finally, this investigation has also shed some light on the function of the house as a symbolic space in the Gospel’s narrative world. Insofar as the households of the evangelist’s community serve as a venue for similar types of healing experiences, they can be understood to have a place in salvation history as well.</p>

The evangelist demonstrates an interest in private healing elsewhere in Mt. 9.25, which has Jesus entering the house alone to raise the ofﬁcial’s daughter, in contrast to Mark, who has him entering with the child’s parents ‘and those who were with him’ (Mk 5.40). Mt. 9.28 seems to present a similar scenario (cf. Mk 8.23). For the privacy motif, see also 1 Kgs 17.19; 2 Kgs 4.33; Mk 7.33; Acts 9.40. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0142064X13495137">Theissen (1983</xref>: 60-61) notes similarities in this regard with the Asclepius cult: referring speciﬁcally to <italic>SIG</italic><sup>3</sup> III, 1173, he observes that when it comes to the healing itself, ‘the activity of the deity is supposed to take place in secret’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0142064X13495137">Theissen 1983</xref>: 154-58).</p>

Cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142064X13495137">Held 1963</xref>: 229, 265, 281-90.</p>
