<p>The French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan presents contemporary psychoanalysis with a challenge for the clinic of psychosis. Lacan sustained a critical engagement with the problematics of psychosis that proposed a new concept of the subject. Unlike bio-psycho-social models that see psychosis in terms of deficit in the brain or brain dysfunction, Lacan postulated three logical subject positions (neurotic, perverse, and psychotic) that are each determined by the response of the being of the subject to the Other of language. Lacan’s work supports the analyst’s desire-to-know and listen to the subjective stakes at work in the speech of the patient suffering from psychosis and is therefore indispensible in the formulation of a psychoanalytic approach to the clinic of psychosis that makes way for the subject in our contemporary societies. Yet Lacan stopped short of creating an application or treatment of psychosis that derived from his concepts and theory. Instead, his work on psychosis remained “prior to any possible treatment of it” as the title to his seminal essay of 1959 suggests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354313483030">Lacan, 1959/2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Stijn Vanheule’s <italic>The Subject of Psychosis: A Lacanian Perspective</italic> reorients students of Lacan to the central place the clinic of psychosis holds in Lacan’s work and to its subjective stakes. Vanheule’s comprehensive explanation of major Lacanian concepts during the evolution of Lacan’s thinking (which contradict themselves over time) will serve as an introduction to Lacan and will lead those more versed in his work to reconsider analytic practice in the face of the psychotic’s experience.</p>
<p>The Lacanian perspective is unique in that it differentiates subjective structure from illness. Neurosis, psychosis, and perversion are three structures that correspond to the Other of the address. The advent of the Other introduced by language makes a rupture in the logic of the organism, separating a libidinal body from the organism—a body subjected to the excess energy of the drives that circulate around objects that are aimed at but never attained. Psychosis concerns a response to an all-powerful, invasive Other—a “mad Other” (p. 121) as Vanheule describes it—and carries with it a knowledge regarding the nature and status of the Other that will be elaborated according to the singular logic of the subject inhabiting a specific place and time in history and society. The analytic experience gives the subject a place to speak about its knowledge regarding the Other, and supports the subject’s creation of a path to bring something new from this knowledge into the social link. If we refer illness, sickness, or discontent to a psychotic subjective structure, illness concerns the individual’s subjective collapse in the face of a “question of existence” (p. 79) that cannot be answered by signifiers that anchor the subject’s position in the social link or in relation to the symbolic order. For example, a signifier that would represent the mental representation of “being a father” is foreclosed or radically excluded and lacking, so that the question of being is experienced as coming from the outside in the form of messages that aggress, overwhelm, and fascinate the subject with their obscurity. By orienting treatment to subjective stakes to which psychotic phenomena respond, it is clear that Lacanian practice offers something different from other clinical approaches that aim to remove psychotic symptoms: psychoanalysis invites the subject of psychosis to speak in the face of the analyst’s desire-to-know what is censored in the form of the social and society in that speech.</p>
<p>Vanheule divides Lacan’s teaching into four phases or “eras” (p. 2) as he tracks the development of the concept of the subject in his work. He elucidates key concepts such as the mirror stage, the signifier, the voice as object, and the concept of <italic>jouissance</italic> in terms of their importance not only for the clinic of psychosis but for post-Lacanian psychoanalysis. The chapter “Delusions Scrutinized” defines the status of psychotic phenomena (in this case the delusion) as “speech events” (p. 96) that function as a “mental reorganization” for the subject who confronts an inassimilable representation that causes subjective collapse. Rather than approach the delusional as a sign of illness, Vanheule shows how Lacan’s reading of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354313483030">Daniel Paul Schreber’s (2000)</xref> <italic>Memoirs</italic> promotes a psychoanalytic methodology that “pays particular attention to the role played by questions of existence at the level of the unconscious and to the way the individual deals with his mad Other” (p. 122).</p>
<p>Throughout his text, Vanheule underscores the impossibility of generalizing a treatment approach beyond the individual case. He defines the limits of his text by indicating that he will “not address theories of other authors working with Lacanian psychoanalysis” and confines himself to elaborating “the logic articulated within Lacan’s oeuvre” (p. 2). But by limiting itself to Lacan’s theory of psychosis and the subject, Vanheule’s text leaves out significant advances made by contemporary Lacanian analysts in the clinic of psychosis. If Lacan’s ability to listen to psychosis yields concepts that push the practice of psychoanalysis further, the question of what psychoanalysis offers the subject of psychosis is less clear and this is the direction I suggest the clinic after Lacan must take if it is to make way for the subject of psychosis. Theory remains “prior” to any treatment of psychosis. It explains psychotic phenomena and the spontaneous solutions the psychotic produces (the enterprise of the delusion, or the <italic>sinthome</italic>), without considering how the analyst’s maneuver in the transference (a position of wanting-to-know rather than of knowing) places a limit on the all-powerful Other to whom the psychotic is subjected. For example, the implications of working with the dream are not considered. According to contemporary analysts who work closely with the psychotic’s experience, the dream produces signifiers that create a space for the subject to dismantle or call into question the delusion (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354313483030">Apollon, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354313483030">Bergeron, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354313483030">Cantin, 2002</xref>). As the contemporary analyst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354313483030">Lucie Cantin (2002)</xref> argues, “dreams treat the real with signifiers in a way the delusion is doomed to fail” (p. 90), because the “delusion does not follow the laws of language that structure the real at work in the formations of the unconscious” (p. 90). The analyst’s maneuver proposes the dream as an unconscious production that questions the certitude of the delusion and supports the transference of something of the subject’s truth and history into the social link. While respecting the singularity of each particular case as Vanheule repeatedly underscores, such a maneuver offers the dream as a frame for the work of the subject’s singularity.</p>
<p>This text offers an excellent reading of Lacan’s development of a theory of the subject of psychosis that should serve as a springboard into the practice of the psychoanalytic clinic today.</p>
