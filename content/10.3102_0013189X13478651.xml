<p>Durlach spent most of her career concerned with military training; and Lesgold, Dean of the School of Education at the University of Pittsburgh, is also well known in the training community. They are ideal editors of this stimulating volume spanning both education and training. These fields have substantial similarities in methods, procedures, and technology—although they differ in objectives. Training is usually concerned with preparing individuals for a specific task, whereas preparation for life is often the ultimate goal of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013189X13478651">Tobias &amp; Fletcher, 2000</xref>). Both fields have a lot to learn from each other; and because adaptive systems apply to both, it seems an ideal place to forge stronger relationships.</p>
<p>Adapting instruction to student characteristics has a long history in education and education research. Teachers have been urged to adapt their instruction to students for more than 4000 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013189X13478651">Corno &amp; Snow, 1986</xref>), and the ancient Hebrew Passover Haggadah urges that retelling the Exodus story should be adapted to individual’s prior knowledge and personality. In education research, such adaptations were advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013189X13478651">Cronbach (1967</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013189X13478651">Cronbach &amp; Snow, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013189X13478651">Gustaffson &amp; Undheim, 1996</xref>). As an advocate of adaptations to students’ prior knowledge, rather than aptitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013189X13478651">Tobias, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013189X13478651">2009</xref>), it was nice to see that this book deals principally with such adaptations.</p>
<p>Urging teachers to adapt instruction during thousands of years indicates that these suggestions have been ineffective, probably because it is difficult to do with large classes. Therefore, the chapters in this book, and related research, have tried to program computers to make such adaptations. Rather than focusing on students’ aptitudes or entry level knowledge, the adaptations described in the book are made from a student model where the intelligent instructional or tutoring system infers what students know from their prior learning in the same course. An advantage of focusing on models derived from current learning is that contemporary concerns about situative effects are minimized because the student model is developed from learners’ reactions to the same material in a highly similar situation for which predictions of optimal paths for future instruction are made.</p>
<p>Shute and Zapata-Rivera open the book by defining adaptive systems as those “that monitor important learner characteristics and make appropriate adjustments to the instructional milieu to support and enhance learning” (p. 7). They go on to present a model of adaptivity and an overview of present thinking in the area. Van Lehn and Chi’s chapter reports a study suggesting that learning a principle-based strategy in one domain transfers to accelerated learning in another. Evidence of transfer is all too rare and, therefore, welcome. Their chapter indicates that accelerated learning is an important indication of adaptive expertise because such experts will have to master new knowledge at an ever-accelerating pace.</p>
<p>In Aleven and colleagues’ chapter on assisting students to become better help seekers, an important issue is when do students need help? In our research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013189X13478651">Tobias &amp; Everson, 2009</xref>), learner estimates of knowing various items were compared to their performance. Help was considered unneeded when participants estimated knowing items and performed correctly on them. Whereas when items were estimated as unknown and then failed on the test, help was clearly needed—as it was when estimates were that an item was known yet performed incorrectly, because that was clearly a misconception requiring correction. Less clear were cases when an item was estimated as unknown yet performed correctly; we assumed that was an input error in responding and judged help to be unneeded. The authors might consider using similar estimates and performance in their research to help determine when help was needed.</p>
<p>Conati’s chapter provides evidence that adaptive instructional support for students’ metacognitive skills, particularly self-explanations, can be improved and that it enhanced learning. In their chapter, D’Mello and Graesser present their research on emotions and learning and point out that affect “forestallers” are required to predict and prevent the occurrence of persistent negative states, whereas affect “anticipators” are needed to facilitate identification of positive affective states to enhance learning. In their chapter on developing lifelong learner models, Kay and Kummerfeld describe the problems of connecting islands of available data on people’s learning to form a life-long student model to guide learning throughout the life span.</p>
<p>A set of chapters is devoted to difficult problems for adaptive systems, such as decision making, where most existing research deals with one-shot decisions rather than the situations in adaptive systems where decisions are made continuously by reusing prior decisions or outcomes. Similarly, a chapter on problem solving in ill-defined domains, probably those occurring most often, describes the difficulties such domains present for adaptive systems because they require unique skills, and experts can reasonably disagree about acceptable solution paths. Another chapter describes learning with and from pedagogical agents, virtual humans, in order to acquire the social skills of another culture. Such contexts present problems because the instructional domain is potentially vast and interactions with the virtual human are difficult to anticipate.</p>
<p>Further chapters on difficult problems for adaptive systems include one on natural language processing. A chapter on developments in semantic adaptive training outlines what might be expected from progress on the semantic Web that would enable computers to “understand” the meanings of communications. The ability to communicate successfully in both language and awareness of local customs with other cultures is addressed in another chapter. There, adaptations can occur in a number of categories, such as the learners’ roles, their range of jobs, and the regions in which they will be working; these categories make it possible for learners to receive any one of 156 possible tailored versions of a course. Another chapter demonstrates that training experiences prescribed from a partially observable Markov decision process enhanced learning compared to two other methods of selecting the experiences. The problems and (interim solutions) in these chapters are not easily summarized; and the chapters should be read to understand both the problems and the tentative solutions, which may change with further research.</p>
<p>Lesgold’s excellent chapter reviews what was learned from experiences developing adaptive system to train people for complex electronic jobs; it summarizes some important data yet is mercifully free of the jargon and abbreviations littering many other chapters. “One of our systems produced the same amount of improvement in skill after twenty-five hours of training as occurred on average in four years on the job. . . . [Furthermore,] the savings from one trainee using the trained knowledge once equaled the entire cost of developing the system” (p. 290). Finally, Lesgold indicates that the cost of the first generation system was about $2 million; by the fifth generation, costs had dropped to $70,000. In view of the steep start-up costs, such systems are more prevalent in training than in education. Educators should be more forceful in making the argument that despite steep start-up costs, the payoff in increased learning and ultimate cost reductions makes it worthwhile to develop more adaptive systems for education.</p>
<p>In the concluding chapter, Durlach summarizes recommendations by groups convened at the meeting that gave rise to the volume. The groups recommended collecting lots of data to enrich student models. However, they add, to the relief of future “volunteer” research participants, “as a rule of thumb, intrusiveness should be avoided” (p. 332). As to training efficiency, the groups suggested that “sometimes all we need is performance support, not training” (p. 339). Such performance support (i.e., job aides) is widely used in training to enhance performance but much less so in education. Can job aides be used more widely in education? Calculators come to mind as one example, but it may be worthwhile to think about developing others to help carry the instructional burden in very complex fields. The groups also recommended that instruction in education and training prepare individuals to adapt to a rapidly changing world, a theme also sounded in a number of other chapters.</p>
<p>Adapting to change is critical for training, where practices change very rapidly. Because school learning becomes outdated by new knowledge quite rapidly, education must be equally concerned about adapting to change. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013189X13478651">Federation of American Scientists (2006)</xref> indicated that leadership in technology “can only be accomplished if American workers are prepared to move quickly in response to technical change, and be ready for new jobs and careers as they emerge” (p. 3). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013189X13478651">Fletcher and Wind (2011)</xref> discussed the importance of adapting to change in the military and analyzed the likely components of that construct, and its trainability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013189X13478651">Clark (2009)</xref> described a research agenda for dealing with unexpected events.</p>
<p>If future editions of the book are planned, the editors might consider adding two new chapters, such as one on adapting to the unexpected, perhaps one of the hot research areas in the future. Another chapter might deal with the identification of both common and unique problems and possibilities for adaptive systems in education and training. Although the book has a good representation of adaptive systems from both fields, chapters stay within their fields; and an integrative chapter forging stronger relationships between education and training would be welcome. Finally, summative evaluation results of the ambitious systems described might be included to determine how closely they achieved their objectives.</p>
<p>There is a very high level of abstraction in most chapters. A more plentiful use of examples would often have helped to reduce the cognitive load imposed by the complexities of adaptive systems. Some chapters use examples of screenshots to deal with this problem; unfortunately these are printed so indistinctly that they often fail as adequate illustrations. Nevertheless, this is a very good book. It should be required reading for all of us who have wished that instructional psychology could effectively use the numerous affordances provided by computers and computer science. Every chapter is worth reading because it demonstrates that the gap between these fields is narrowing.</p>
