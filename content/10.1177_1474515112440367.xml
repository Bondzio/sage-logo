<title>Background:</title>
<p>The nurse’s role as educator has become very crucial in heart failure management; thus, nurses must be adequately prepared to undertake this task.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1474515112440367">
<title>Aim:</title>
<p>The main objective of the study was to estimate the level of Cypriot nurses’ knowledge on basic heart failure self-care principles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1474515112440367">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A questionnaire measuring knowledge on heart failure self-care principles was administered among cardiology nurses working in five public urban hospitals of Cyprus. Data were analysed by using descriptive statistics, t-test and analysis of variance for categorical variables (such as gender and working setting) and correlation tests (Pearson’s) plus simple linear regression for continuous variables (such as working experience).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1474515112440367">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Participants were 143 nurses. The mean heart failure self-care knowledge score was 13.57/20 (SD 2.33). Gender, hospital and cardiac clinical experience do not significantly affect scoring. Significant difference in the knowledge score was observed among critical care, cardiology and medical unit nurses (f=4.1, p=0.018). Post hoc analysis showed that this significant difference originated from the comparison of critical care nurses with cardiology unit nurses (14.1, SD 2.3 vs. 13.0, SD 2.1 respectively). Correlation and linear regression analyses yielded only weak negative correlation between correct scoring and duration of nursing practice (r=−0.262, p=0.002), with 6% of the total variation in scoring being explained by this relationship.</p>

<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Results are consistent with previous findings and it is thus under question whether cardiology nurses are properly educating their heart failure patients. Consequently, there is an urgent need for nurses to update their knowledge and enhance their educational skills.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Heart failure (HF) is a chronic condition affecting both the quality of life of the patients as well as health care systems’ expenditures as a result of subsequent readmissions. A study conducted in Europe posed that one-third of HF patients is readmitted within 1 year,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112440367">1</xref></sup> while in people over 65 years of age chronic HF is the first cause of hospitalisation in the US.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112440367">2</xref></sup> It is estimated that annual HF admission cases will rise by 12–34% during a period of 20 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112440367">3</xref></sup> Hospitalisations comprise roughly two-thirds of all HF costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112440367">4</xref></sup> In 2009 the estimated cost of chronic HF in the US reached US$30.2 billion while in the UK HF directly accounts for 1.9% (£905 million) of the National Health System’s total expenditures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112440367">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112440367">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Management of HF is a challenging process. Disease management programmes are widely implemented to improve HF clinical outcomes (mortality, readmissions, length of hospital stay).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112440367">7</xref></sup> Most of the patients’ readmissions can be prevented as they do not reflect the progress of the disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112440367">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112440367">9</xref></sup> The most common leading causes of readmissions is the exacerbation of symptoms because of the non-compliance with the therapeutic regimen as well as a lack of timely treatment seeking after the onset of decompensation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112440367">10</xref></sup> Hence, patients’ education along with motivation for developing self-care skills is an essential component in the management of HF.</p>
<p>Nurses have an important role to play in educating and counselling patients and their families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112440367">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474515112440367">12</xref></sup> Clinical randomised trials suggest that the recruitment of a multidisciplinary team for the management of HF is effective in improving outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112440367">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112440367"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112440367">15</xref></sup> Such programmes give a great emphasis on the patient’s education and promotion of self-care practices. Existing guidelines for HF management place considerable importance on non-pharmacological interventions and self-management. For HF patients, self-management involves key self-care skills and behaviours, which include symptoms recognition, weight monitoring, dietary salt restriction, exercise, medication adherence and course of action in the event of exacerbation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112440367">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112440367">17</xref></sup> Both American and European guidelines recommend that health care professionals provide education and counselling to symptomatic patients on several HF topics: aetiology; definition; symptoms and signs of HF; pharmacological treatment; modification of risk factors; diet restrictions; exercise; sexual activity; immunisation; sleep and breathing disorders; adherence to treatment; psychological aspects and prognosis.</p>
<p>There are only a few published studies regarding nurses’ knowledge of HF self-management principles. In Albert et al.’s (2002) study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112440367">18</xref></sup> 300 registered nurses (RNs) and licensed practice nurses (LPNs) working in a Midwest hospital in the US were asked to complete a true–false questionnaire, developed by the investigators. The questionnaire is a 20-item survey producing a summative score ranging from 0 to 20 for each individual. Higher summative scores are indicative of greater knowledge. The mean HF self-management knowledge score was 15.2 ± 2.0 (SD). Washburn et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112440367">19</xref></sup> confirmed the previous findings. The same questionnaire was administered among 51 RNs and LPNs in a small community hospital in the US and the mean HF self-care knowledge score was 14.6 ± 2.0 (SD). A recent study of 2007<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112440367">20</xref></sup> showed similar results. A sample of 49 nurses working in a south-eastern US hospital were assessed by the same questionnaire and found an only slightly higher score of 15.97 ± 1.9 (SD). The latest study of Delaney et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112440367">21</xref></sup> examined home care nurses’ knowledge of four local home care agencies in an urban area of the US by using the specific tool; home care nurses achieved a mean score of 15.78 ± 1.69 (SD). These studies’ results suggest that nurses might not be adequately educated or trained to provide information to patients. There is not much evidence from similar settings in Europe, while the nurses’ knowledge on HF self-management knowledge in Cyprus has not been previously investigated.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section8-1474515112440367">
<title>Aim</title>
<p>The aim of the present study was to investigate Cypriot nurses’ HF self-care knowledge for the first time. The study examined the extent to which nurses in public hospitals in Cyprus are aware of the basic principles (symptoms recognition, weight monitoring, dietary salt restriction, exercise, medication adherence and course of action in the event of exacerbation) for HF self-management and whether they are providing education to their HF patients. Factors influencing the level of knowledge (gender, hospital, years of clinical experience, working setting) were also examined.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1474515112440367">
<title>Study design, setting, sample</title>
<p>This study reports the results of a cross-sectional survey performed in all five public urban hospitals on the island. Inclusion criteria pertained to all RNs in public hospitals who provide care for patients with HF. Three different work settings were considered: (a) cardiology wards and (b) general or coronary care intensive care units (ICUs), which provide care to patients with cardiovascular problems like HF. Two of the five hospitals do not have an independent cardiology ward. In this case, HF patients are treated in an internal medicine ward; thus, nurses of this ward were asked to participate. A total number of 252 nurses were considered eligible for participation.</p>
<p>The necessary approvals from the Ministry of Health and the hospital authorities were sought and granted. The study qualified for an exception by the Cyprus Bioethics Committee. The investigation conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1474515112440367">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>In the present study, the tool developed by Albert et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112440367">18</xref></sup> was used to evaluate the HF self-care level of knowledge of Cypriot cardiology nurses. Participant nurses providing care to HF patients in five public hospitals were asked to anonymously fill out the questionnaire. All 252 nurses working in the target wards and units were approached through their managers by the research coordinator and were requested to participate after they were informed about the aim of the study. Details of the study were given to all nurses of the target group through a cover letter. Participants were given instructions to complete the questionnaire during their free time at their working place (i.e. during their break). Managers had the responsibility to administer the questionnaire to the nurses who were not present at that time. All managers were asked to supervise the completion procedure, when possible, to ensure that participants did not cross-check answers or collaborate. Given a period of time of 2 weeks, the managers were responsible for the collection and sealing of the filled questionnaires and handing them to the research coordinator. Data collection took place between January and April 2010.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1474515112440367">
<title>Tool</title>
<p>The ‘Nurses Knowledge of Heart Failure Education Principles Survey’ was used after the necessary licence was obtained from the authors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112440367">18</xref></sup> Translation and a cultural adaptation of the questionnaire in Greek followed published standards for such a procedure (comparison between original and back translated version and revision). Two specialist nurses translated the questionnaire from English to Greek and then another academic nurse from Greek to English. Finally, an expert panel of four academic nurses checked its suitability and reviewed the Greek translation.</p>
<p>The original questionnaire includes 20 true–false items referring to statements, measuring nurses’ knowledge on five important educational topics of HF self-management: diet (three questions); fluids or weight (seven questions); signs or symptoms of worsening condition (six questions); medications (two questions); exercise (two questions). In the present study, the questionnaire was formatted into four sections: (a) the cover letter carrying information about the aims of the study and instructions for filling out the questionnaire; (b) five questions on demographic characteristics: gender, years of working experience in general and with cardiac patients, working setting, education). In order to enhance participation in the study we focused on the years of experience instead of age, which might have implied participants’ identity; (c) the generic questionnaire of 20 questions; (d) an additional set of two questions posed by the researchers to explore possible barriers in initiating education by asking individuals: (1) whether they are educating HF patients and, in the case of a negative response, (2) the reasons that discourage them (participants were given five possible answers and a choice to note any other reason through an open-ended sub-question). For each of the generic questions, participants could also check a box indicating that they need more information on the topic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1474515112440367">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Consistent with previous applications,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112440367">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112440367"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112440367"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112440367">21</xref></sup> individual total scores (i.e. the summative of correct responses) were calculated and were used to describe data both as frequencies as well as means and standard deviations of total scores. Mean scores were tabulated and compared using appropriate statistical tests to explore possible associations between participant characteristics and the total score. Total scores (with a maximum of 20), consistent with previous studies, were also expressed as percentage out of 100% of correct answers. Total correct response rates of each individual question were also assessed; questions with high response rates (&gt;85% response rate) and low response rates (&lt;35% response rate) were identified. The cut-off points of 35% and 85% differ from those used by the instructors of the tool (30% and 90%);<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112440367">18</xref></sup> all of the previous studies did not use the precise cut-off points of Albert et al. and we thus moved the threshold from 30% to 35% (to label the low scored questions) and from 90% to 85% (to label the high scored questions) in order to make our results comparable to their findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112440367">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112440367"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112440367">21</xref></sup> After verifying the equality of variances across comparison groups using Levene’s test of homogeneity of variance, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to detect possible differences in mean scores categorised by hospital (five groups) and by working setting (internal medicine, cardiology, ICU). Where statistical significant differences were observed, Bonferroni’s post hoc test was run for multiple comparisons of group means. In the case of violation of the assumption of homogeneity of variances, Welch and Brown-Forsythe tests were used instead of ANOVA. For the dichotomous variable of gender, results were extracted by the independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test. Duration of nursing clinical experience and duration of cardiology nursing experience (continuous variables) were assessed by Pearson’s correlation and simple linear regression analysis for each variable to further investigate associations with HF self-care knowledge scores. Missing values were counted as false responses, assuming that any intention for not responding reflects lack of knowledge. However, analyses were re-run without counting missing values as negative responses to assess to what extent this would affect the results. Pearson’s correlation was also used to investigate whether the primary scores are associated with the revised scores (missing values ignored). The last question was added by the authors to investigate whether participants provide education to their HF patients and the reasons that discourage them; participants had the chance to choose from a list of five possible answers or note any other reasons through an open-ended question. Statistical significance level was set at 0.05. Analyses were performed in PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS Inc.).</p>

<title>Participants’ characteristics</title>
<p>A total of 143 nurses completed the survey; this yielded a response rate of 56.7%. Distribution of nurses by hospital reflected the distribution of staff in the five hospitals: hospital A 29.3%; hospital B 29.3%; hospital C 16%; hospital D 13.9%; hospital E 11.1%. Most of the participants were females 101 (70.6%) vs. 39 (27.3%) males, while in three cases the gender was not reported. Referring to the working setting, 73 (51%) were ICU nurses, 58 (40.6%) cardiology ward nurses and 12 (8.4%) internal medicine ward nurses. A percentage of 2.8% (four persons) of the participants had a master’s degree and 8.3% (12 persons) were university graduates (BSc). The majority (127 persons – 88.9%) of the participants had a diploma in nursing.</p>
<p>Reported duration of nursing clinical experience and cardiology nursing clinical experience ranged from 1 month to as many as 38 years. Approximately half (48.9%) of the participants had been practising nursing for 8 years or less and almost 25% had more than 20 years of nursing experience. The majority (77%) had up to 10 years’ experience with cardiac patients. The mean duration of nursing experience was 12.3 years (SD 10.54) and mean duration of cardiology nursing experience 7.2 years (SD 7.29).</p>

<sec id="section15-1474515112440367">
<title>Overall score</title>
<p>Since the questionnaire included 20 statements to be marked as true or false, a fully correct response would have resulted in a total score of 20/20 (100%). The observed mean HF self-care knowledge score was 13.57, SD 2.33, equivalent to 67.8%, and the range of individual scores was 6–19. A percentage of 11.2 (16 individuals) had a total of correct responses equal or less than 10 (≤ 50% correct answers) and a percentage of 38.5 (55 individuals) responded correctly to 15 statements or more (≥ 75% correct answers). The distribution of scores was reasonably symmetrical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1474515112440367">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Differences between groups based on nurses’ characteristics</title>
<p>No significant difference was found in relation to gender, although females scored slightly higher than males (means (13.67, SD 2.3) vs. (13.44, SD 2.4) respectively, <italic>t</italic>=-0.54, <italic>p</italic>=0.523). Differences among hospitals were evaluated by the Welch and Brown-Forsythe tests instead of ANOVA since there was evidence of heterogeneity of variances (Levene’s statistic <italic>p</italic>=0.001); differences were not found to be significant (Whelch test <italic>p</italic>=0.699, Brown–Forsythe <italic>p</italic>=0.718). A statistical significant difference was observed among ICU nurses, cardiology and internal medicine unit nurses (ANOVA: <italic>f</italic>=4.11, <italic>p</italic>=0.018). Participants employed in ICUs generally achieved higher scores than cardiology unit nurses and internal medicine unit nurses. Bonferroni’s post hoc analysis showed that a significant difference emerged from the difference in scores between ICU and cardiology unit nurses (14.11, SD 2.34 vs. 13.02, SD 2.14 respectively, mean difference=1.09, <italic>p</italic>=0.02). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1474515112440367">Figure 2</xref> presents the distribution of scores across the work setting considered. Surprisingly, the duration of nursing clinical experience in years was found to be negatively correlated with scoring.

<p>The main results did not differ after re-running the analyses without counting missing values as negative responses. In 71 cases, the statements remained unanswered and these count for 2.48% of the total responses. The mean HF self-care knowledge score retrieved, after this analysis, was 13.97, SD 2.24 (69.8%) and mean scores did not significantly differ between groups (hospitals, gender). This second analysis for comparing mean scores by working setting similarly showed a significant difference and Bonferroni’s post hoc test again tracked the difference between ICU and cardiology ward nurses (mean difference 1.04, <italic>p</italic>=0.22). Still the negative correlation of scoring with nursing experience was weak but significant (<italic>r</italic>=−0.56, <italic>p</italic>=0.002, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.62] and nursing experience with cardiac patients was not significantly correlated with scoring (<italic>r</italic>=−0.1, <italic>p</italic>=0.22).

<title>Responses per question</title>
<p>None of the statements was answered correctly by all participants. The correct response of individual questions ranged between 16% and 95.1%. The most high scored question was the one concerning the new onset of worsening fatigue and if the physician should be informed, with 95.1% of the participants giving a correct answer to this statement. The question with the lowest success rate was the one asking whether the weight results should be compared with the previous weight or the dry weight of the patient (16%). Low correct response rates (i.e. &lt;35%), were also noted in two questions: whether HF patients should decrease activity (25.1%) and if the physician should be informed in asymptomatic hypotension (29.3%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112440367">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Each participant could specify for each of the true–false questions whether he/she needs more information on the topic. Requests for more information were, in total, 137 (out of a possible 2860). A total of 90 individuals (62.9%) did not ask for further information in any question. Seven participants (4.8%) quoted five or more requests and one participant requested information for all the questions. Each question had at least two requests for more information. Those with a large number of requests for providing more information were: if the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is recommended (13 requests) and whether fluid restriction can be withdrawn when the patient is feeling thirsty (21 requests). Questions with the lowest rate of requests were: about the return of the HF condition even if the patient adheres to the treatment, whether in the case of new onset of worsening fatigue the physician must be informed and whether the physician should be informed in the case of decreased ability to exercise (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112440367">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1474515112440367">2</xref>).</p>
<p>The last question was additionally posed by the researchers aiming to examine whether nurses are routinely educating their patients and explore possible barriers where participants could specify multiple reasons. A percentage of 15.4 avoided answering this question, 71.3% claimed that they are educating their patients while the remaining 13.3% answered that they are not providing education to the patients. The reasons mentioned were: it is not considered to be a routine practice (12 participants), lack of time (11 participants), physicians do not give such orders (four participants), nurses are not properly trained or prepared to do so (two participants), lack of nursing staff (one participant), lack of communication between nurses and patients (one participant), absence of educating protocols (one participant) and underestimation of the importance of this subject (one participant).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>

<title>Main findings</title>
<p>The present study aimed to document the level of Cyprus nurses’ knowledge on main HF self-management principles and to trace variations explained by the working setting as well as nurses’ characteristics, such as duration of nursing practice, duration of cardiology nursing practice and gender. A secondary goal was to examine whether nurses are educating their HF patients and to identify possible barriers in initiating the education procedure.</p>
<p>The mean self-care knowledge score was 13.57, SD 2.33 (67.8% on a scale to 100%). Most of the participants (~71%) claimed that they are providing education to their HF patients. The majority of participants that are not initiating education claimed that education is not considered to be a daily routine practice. Low knowledge score suggests that nurses are not likely to provide accurate information during education; it can be thus stated that there is a gap between evidenced and applied nursing practice. It is possible that the present results reflect general practice issues in cardiology nursing in Cyprus.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1474515112440367">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The questionnaire tool utilised in this study does not address basic topics on HF self-management concerning the definition, pathophysiology, aetiology and prognosis of HF and it may not fully correspond to European culture in nursing practices. Furthermore, the target population was nurses working in public hospitals that are routinely providing care to HF patients. The private sector was not considered, thus generalisation of the findings to all nurses providing care to HF patients is not appropriate. However, the majority of patients in Cyprus are treated in public hospitals while there is only one private cardiology hospital and few others with independent cardiology wards. The extent to which a higher response rate could have resulted in different finding is not clear. In fact, it is possible that scores might have been even lower if the voluntary nature of the study meant that non-participants avoided entering the study due to lack of knowledge. An additional consideration was the absence of control upon the questionnaire completion procedure. Nurses were asked not to collaborate and managers were appointed to supervise the questionnaire completing procedure, it is possible though that managers may have allowed cross-checking, aiming to hide possible deficiencies of their staff. In this case, the results are even more discouraging. Finally, missing values in this study were taken to be incorrect responses. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken by re-running the analyses without counting missing values as incorrect responses and the main findings did not differ.</p>

<sec id="section21-1474515112440367">
<title>Interpretation of the findings</title>
<p>The mean self-care knowledge score found in this study is lower yet comparable to those seen in previous studies. Albert et al found a mean score of 15.2 (76%), Washburn et al. 14.6 (73%), Willette et al. 15.97 (79.85%) and Delaney et al. 15.7 (78%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112440367">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112440367"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112440367"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112440367">21</xref></sup> The observed lower mean score in the present study can be possibly explained by the fact that universities and nursing schools in Cyprus do not offer post graduate courses in cardiology nursing. It should be mentioned that in Cyprus only in the last 4 years has nursing become a 4-year university degree while the former nursing school, which operated until 2008, awarded a 3-year diploma. Thus, previous generic undergraduate nursing education did not adequately prepare future nurses to provide specialised care or had certain limitations. Furthermore, other than the general hospital in the capital, there is no other university hospital on the island. The majority of nurses are not provided with unit specific training such as those in the previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112440367">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112440367">20</xref></sup> The promotion of specialised care regarding HF patients in Cyprus, although necessary, is absent because the current situation may not be receptive to such innovations due to the lack of independent HF clinics.</p>
<p>Nurses scored lower in questions dealing with weight assessment and the need to compare daily weights to dry weight, the necessity of activity and asymptomatic hypotension. Similarly, all of the previous studies noticed a lack of knowledge on the topics of asymptomatic hypotension and monitoring differences from dry weight. Nurses achieved better scores (&gt;85%) in questions related to: notifying the physician in the case of new onset of worsening fatigue, drinking plenty of fluids, return of HF in the case of proper prevention, abdomen swelling as an indication of fluid retention and notifying the physician in the case of worsening ability to exercise. These questions likewise earned high scores (&gt;90%) in at least two of the previous studies. Details are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1474515112440367">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1474515112440367">2</xref>. No specific theme (signs/symptoms, medication, exercise, diet, fluids/weight) was found to be dominant neither in high scored questions nor in low scored questions. The above similarities among previous studies and the present study further support the lack of appropriate continuing education on HF management topics among nurses.</p>
<p>It was found that gender, hospital and duration of cardiology nursing practice do not influence knowledge. Nurses employed in ICUs scored higher than cardiology unit nurses, probably due to the increased demands of such units on both knowledge and skills. However, this significance does not necessarily indicate clinical significance since the difference is not substantial. Washburn et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112440367">19</xref></sup> also examined this parameter as a possible predictor of scoring but their results did not reveal significant differences between ICU and other nurses’ knowledge.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, higher knowledge deficiencies are observed across increasing years of nursing practice. Nurses with longer nursing experience tended to score lower than nurses with less experience, although the correlation was quite mild. This may reflect the effect of age of the participants with younger (yet fewer years of experience) scoring higher. This finding raises questions as to the quality of continuous education; consequently, there is an absolute need for older nurses to update their knowledge and integrate it into practice.</p>
<p>In chronic conditions such as HF, health care professionals try to put a special emphasis on education and promotion of self-management. However, patients diagnosed with HF do not clearly understand HF symptoms and prognosis; neither do they discuss these topics with their heath care providers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112440367">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112440367">23</xref></sup> Therefore, education and counselling should not be ignored. Systematic or extended attempts to educate HF patients, even single educational interventions, have proven to be beneficial in improving HF clinical outcomes and enhancing self-care activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112440367">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112440367">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Education should be provided in a structured and protocol driven way (assessment of previous knowledge, assess learning needs, planning, education delivery, evaluation).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474515112440367">26</xref></sup> In several countries (UK, US, Sweden, Nederland), education in HF clinics is given to well-trained nurses with academic and clinical qualifications, since the role of HF nurse demands advanced clinical and communicational skills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474515112440367">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are no protocols for patient education in Cyprus’ hospitals and there is a lack of supervision regarding the initiation of the education procedure; thus, commencing patient education depends on the willingness of the individual nurse. The lack of protocols in units that systematically accommodate HF patients may reflect the underestimation of the importance of this procedure. Whatever the difficulties, adequately educating HF patients remains a big challenge for nurses. If these duties are neglected or improperly provided, it would be futile to expect patients to undertake their responsibilities in handling their condition and adhere to the treatment. Nursing educational interventions should keep track of existing guidelines and nurses working with cardiac patients are expected to at least possess fundamental knowledge of HF self-management principles and cultivate their skills in providing quality education.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>HF is a chronic clinical syndrome that has a major impact on the quality of life of patients. Patients with HF are encouraged to adopt self-care practices for handling their condition. It is already recognised that educational interventions have the potential to improve clinical outcomes, it is therefore proper that HF patients receive individualised, accurate and standardised information. The present study reveals that cardiology nurses in Cyprus have weaknesses in the field of HF self-management; consequently, they may have limited ability to provide adequate education to their patients. The fact that nurses with long experience generally display poorer knowledge on several HF educational topics means that current knowledge needs to be updated. On the other hand, hospitals ought to offer HF-oriented training to their cardiology nurses and develop protocols for HF education, in line with the scientific guidelines, so that patients’ education procedure is embodied in daily routines.</p>
