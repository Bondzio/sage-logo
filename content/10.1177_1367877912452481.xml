<abstract>
<p>This study interrogates whether popular journalism – in this case music journalism – can contribute to a productive discourse on issues of public concern. We conducted a textual analysis of the discourse on cultural globalization in the coverage on world music in the US popular press over the last 30 years. We found that music journalists developed a new cultural sensibility in several distinctive phases. The first phase was marked by a firm West/non-West dichotomy and ‘othering.’ A brief second phase denoted the confusion of prior assumptions. The third phase indicated the dissolution of traditional dichotomies and the integration of dynamic and hybrid ideas of global cultural exchange. Along with significant modifications in journalistic style and a different representation of global others, the position of music reviewers as popular journalists eventually helped their acceptance of global cultural transformations. At their best, the reviews created relevant and productive texts on the cultural dimensions of globalization.</p>

<p>Popular music has been an important site for cultural-critical scholars to study how commercial media culture is articulated in the arenas of production, distribution and consumption. Much of this work has focused on the political economy of popular music and its commodified and political dimensions, or on the importance of music in creating audience experiences, and youth or fan cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367877912452481">Grossberg, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367877912452481">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367877912452481">Lull, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367877912452481">Oberacker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1367877912452481">van Dijck, 2006</xref>). Increasing attention has also been paid to the role of music critics in creating and sustaining music markets and taste cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367877912452481">Jones, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367877912452481">Shuker, 1998</xref>). In this study, we analyse music journalism in yet another dimension – as a site for the popular discourse on cultural globalization.</p>
<p>In particular, we focus on media coverage of the <italic>world music</italic> or <italic>world beat</italic> genre. As Erlmann argued: ‘World music is a new aesthetic form of the global imagination, an emergent way of capturing the present historical moment and the total reconfiguration of space and cultural identity characterizing societies around the globe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877912452481">1996</xref>: 468). We examine the discourses created in reviews and articles by music critics in the US popular press. As we demonstrate, over the course of 30 years world music reviewers were produced in three distinctive phases. The journalistic attempts to define and describe the genre world music over the years were entangled in issues of race, ethnicity, colonialism and cultural imperialism but moved slowly to an appreciation of hybridity and global cultural exchange.</p>
<p>We argue that the fact that music reviews are a type of popular journalism first hindered but later facilitated the endorsement of hybrid cultural globalization. Overall, the reviews created a ‘relevant’ and ‘productive’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877912452481">Fiske, 1989</xref>) discourse on globalization.</p>
<sec id="section1-1367877912452481">
<title>Academic perspectives on world music</title>
<p>Defining the broad categories of <italic>world music</italic> or <italic>world beat</italic> – as it is also called at times – has been a challenge both for musicologists and cultural scholars. In fact, much of the scholarship on this topic mainly concerns itself with categorization. Despite Bohlman’s somewhat exasperated announcement that ‘there’s ample justification to call just about anything world music’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367877912452481">2002</xref>: xi), over the years, several areas of definition have emerged.</p>
<p>World music was often defined economically as ‘a typical product of consumer society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367877912452481">Erlmann, 1996</xref>: 47), as a brand developed by the marketing departments of major music labels, or ‘as simply the music sold in the world-music sections of major record stores throughout the western (and partly nonwestern) capitalist world’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1367877912452481">Roberts, 1992</xref>: 231). The economic framing of world music was often tied to a negative evaluation of its cultural impact. Feld criticized the genre for ‘shaping a kind of consumer-friendly multiculturalism, one that follows the market logic of expansion and consolidation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367877912452481">2000</xref>: 168).</p>
<p>Scholars also regarded world music as a new form of cultural imperialism, or as what Colista and Leshner called ‘asymmetrical interdependence,’ which is characterized by a low degree of ‘egalitarian exchange’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367877912452481">1998</xref>: 187) between musicians and audiences. Top-selling international collaborations, such as Paul Simon’s <italic>Graceland</italic>, faced criticism as an example of neocolonial exploitation of local musicians by pop superstars (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367877912452481">Feld, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, scholars also stressed the diversity within the world music genre and often situated the music phenomenon historically as ongoing cultural exchange because ‘the process of absorption and adaptation in music has been going on for a very long time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1367877912452481">Schnabel, 1998</xref>: 6). Work in this area utilized the intricate flows of world music as a way to complicate narrow understandings of cultural imperialism and neocolonialism (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367877912452481">Garofalo, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Many critics essentially included three dimensions in their conceptualizations: exchanges beyond national borders, the artists’ location on the margins, and a position within the popular music genre (as opposed to field recordings or art music) (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367877912452481">Bordowitz, 2004</xref>). At times, this music choice is even described as resistance to the global recording industry. Implicit in this choice is usually also a wider political position, signifying the ‘‘‘one world, one people” orientation that some young listeners embrace’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367877912452481">Lull, 2007</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>Overall, the academic debate on world music pointed to the problematic aspects of the genre connected to its commercial underpinnings in a potentially homogenizing global music industry, but also emphasized the promise of the genre to transcend nation-bound cultural divides and the west-versus-the-rest outlook of dominant cultural flows. For many scholars, world music became an artistic site that exemplified major contemporary cultural debates and allowed scholars to theorize globalization (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367877912452481">Lipsitz, 1999</xref>). Reverberating with these theoretical concerns, our focus is on how world music journalism, as a <italic>popular</italic> discourse with distinctive professional rules, economic underpinnings and target audiences, created a discourse on the cultural impact of globalization.</p>

<title>Cultural globalization and (music) journalism</title>
<p>Any analysis of popular discourses on globalization relates to a complex set of phenomena. A concept as much as an actual process, globalization entails political, economic, social and cultural aspects. In this study we focus on the cultural dimensions of globalization. The previous section illustrated how academic views on world music connected to many debates that govern the discussions of cultural globalization: for example, global cultural exchange and flows; representation of the ‘Other’; cultural imperialism; typical vs. hybrid cultures; and the economic dominance of western cultural industries. The goal of this study is to understand how concerns about cultural globalization are narrated in popular media. Two arguments prompted our study’s focus on music reviews: the shortcomings of traditional international news journalism and the acknowledgement of music reviews as a form of popular journalism.</p>
<p>Many journalism scholars have found traditional news journalism lacking when explaining the complexity of international relations and globalization (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367877912452481">Bennett, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367877912452481">Galtung and Ruge, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367877912452481">Gans, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367877912452481">Lule, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367877912452481">Moeller, 1999</xref>). News journalism and especially foreign reporting is often considered a problematic ethnocentric force that reinforces hegemonic representations of the non-western Other.</p>
<p>While music journalism operates on the fringes of traditional journalism, its cultural position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367877912452481">Hamm, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367877912452481">Jones, 2002</xref>) make it an appropriate site for studying the relationship between journalism and global cultural transformations. Our approach sees music reviews not as trivial journalistic output, but understands reviewing as a form of popular lifestyle journalism that negotiates wider societal concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367877912452481">Fürsich, 2012</xref>). As, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367877912452481">Jones (2002)</xref> argued, US popular music journalists since the 1950s did more than just analyse music; instead, ‘this criticism essentially recovered the aesthetic and cultural values of postwar youth and asserted the validity of their experience’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367877912452481">2002</xref>: 2). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367877912452481">Jensen (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367877912452481">2002)</xref> similarly explained that music criticism ‘is a form of cultural and <italic>social</italic> criticism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367877912452481">2002</xref>: 195, italics in original).</p>
<p>Our project follows a long line of cultural scholars who have successfully challenged the prioritization of traditional journalism as fundamental for civic engagement. These scholars (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367877912452481">Bird 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367877912452481">Dahlgren and Sparks, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877912452481">Fiske 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367877912452481">Hartley 1996</xref>) championed the democratic aspects and ‘public quality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367877912452481">Costera Meijer, 2001</xref>) of popular journalism such as talk shows or tabloid newspapers at a time of ‘DIY citizenship’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367877912452481">Hartley, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Our goal is to investigate in a specific context whether music reviewers (as popular journalists) offered distinctively different perspectives on cultural dimensions of globalization and if their writing invited audiences to engage with complex issues in pragmatic ways.</p>

<title>Textual analysis</title>
<p>The basis of this study was a textual analysis of 30 years of journalism on world music in the U.S. from 1978, when we found the term first used by journalists, to 2008. Included in the sample were music reviews and informational pieces in newspapers such as the <italic>New York Times</italic>, the <italic>Boston Globe</italic> or <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic>; general and trade magazines such as <italic>Village Voice, Billboard</italic> and <italic>Rolling Stone;</italic> and other, smaller music magazines. We searched the comprehensive print database LexisNexis, as well as the International Index to Performing Arts (IIPA) and the International Index of Music Publications (IIMP) as two specialized databases for content from performing arts periodicals. We specifically searched for the term ‘World Music’ as a way to locate stories that engage with this term and possibly engage in genre-demarcating statements. Parallel searches sought articles on major world music phenomena such as the Buena Vista Social Club, <italic>Graceland</italic> or Youssou N’Dour, and influential world music labels such as Putumayo and Luaka Bop.</p>
<p>The range of stories was wide: from more than 3000-word feature stories to 90-word album reviews. Before 1990 the coverage was selective, and we included all relevant articles found. By 1990 world music coverage increased dramatically, so we randomly sampled 10 percent of the more than 1700 articles found. Overall we closely analysed 350 articles. We followed the strategies of ideological critique by interrogating patterns of binary oppositions in the text, the preferred reader, the construction of common sense, as well as the spectrum of ideological positions encouraged. We used qualitative coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367877912452481">Denzin and Lincoln, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367877912452481">Lindlof and Taylor, 2002</xref>) to organize the complexity of the texts and substantiate our readings.</p>

<sec id="section4-1367877912452481">
<title>The discourse of world music reviews</title>
<p>The music reviews initially echoed many of the same themes expressed by scholars. Our close reading of decades of reviews illustrates a flexible integration of these issues into everyday journalistic writing. Over the years the music reviewers’ discourse proceeded from the intention to categorize or discriminate between these new art forms, towards an approach that focused on making this music familiar and popular. The discourse on cultural globalization in these reviews materialized in three distinctive phases: the first phase lasted from approximately 1980 into the mid 1990s, followed by the shorter second – or ‘reorientation’ – phase, of about five years. The longer, third phase emerged around 2000 and lasted until 2008.</p>
<p>These phases ran in tandem with significant changes in the music industry and recording technology. The first phase was marked by the introduction of CD players in the early 1980s, improved recording technology, later record-breaking CD sales, the dominance of the big box music stores such as Tower Records, and an oligopolistic structure in the global music industry. The third phase overlapped with economic and technological trends such as the invention of increased digital storage, .mp3 files and file-share software, the success of Napster (1999–2001) and later the iPod, the resulting radical decline of profits for traditional music labels, individualization of music sales as downloads, and the search for new business models for artistic production.</p>
<p>While attentive to these economic, technological and aesthetic shifts, the three-phase categorization presented here is derived from our <italic>textual</italic> examination. Shifts in these phases were marked by significant changes in the journalistic writing style and underlying cultural assumptions. As in any cultural discourse, shifts and breaks in the text were emergent and not radical, and there were always examples of reviewers who hung on to the past or foretold future textualizations. Nonetheless, the material analysed presented a discursive consensus significant enough to demarcate these three phases. In all phases the reviewers obviously critiqued specific musical acts. However, by contextualizing various artists and music acts they also engaged in a discussion of the transformation of culture as art, as product, and as a ‘whole way of life’ in an era of intensifying globalization.</p>
<sec id="section5-1367877912452481">
<title>Phase one: authenticity check</title>
<sec id="section6-1367877912452481">
<title>Roots</title>
<p>In the first phase, music reviews were clearly marked by a neocolonial/modern approach. The reviewers judged how original, unique or authentic the music is. Authenticity was established as a moment of difference not just in location (e.g. from somewhere in Africa), but also framed as temporal distance – as a distinctive pre-modern alternative to the contemporary, commodified cultural production and general lifestyle in the West. Echoing the discourse of travel journalism (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367877912452481">Fürsich, 2002</xref>), reviews emphasized the uniqueness and the difference from the West. They criticized world music artists who they considered westernized. Difference was established along dichotomies such as West/Third World, present/past, rational/irrational, serious/emotional, civilization/nature and commercialized/authentic. For example, music was praised for how it can ‘evoke a natural world of wind-rustled grasslands and grazing animals’ (#213).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1367877912452481">1</xref></sup> Terms that connect the music to pre-modern enchantment (i.e. spiritual, mythical, magical) were especially abundant. Up to the mid 1990s, reviewers wrote about ‘haunting organ swirls’ (#208) and ‘sensual flutes’ (#213). Terms commonly used to describe the music were ‘hypnotic’ (#2), ‘soulful’ (#23) and ‘otherworldly’ (#63), or more medical terminology such as ‘intoxicating’ (#11), ‘feverish’ (#241) or ‘infectious’ (#18) was used. The physical aspects of the connection were overemphasized as, ‘rubberish rhythms dare you to stand still’ (#30). Audience reaction was almost involuntary. Listeners were expected ‘to fall under its sway’ (#112).</p>
<p>In this phase, musicians were often silenced as Others. Their expertise as artists was ignored or pushed into a non-rational realm by framing the sound as magical. Music was created by a ‘wizard’ (#33) or by a musician who ‘casts a spell on her sixth album’ (#57). There was a problematic objectification/de-personification of the music creation process; music was a ‘cross-pollination’ (#14) resulting in a ‘tasty gumbo’ (#229). The music, while obviously created in the present, was textually placed in the past.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1367877912452481">
<title>Cultural exchange</title>
<p>The argument that positioned world music opposite western, commercialized pop music necessitated that reviewers advocated for the purity of the genre. Some reviewers followed the then typical academic argument that the collaborations with African and Latin Amercian musicians by western musicians, such as Paul Simon or later Ry Cooder, were exploitative. <italic>Boston Globe</italic> critic Fernando Gonzalez lamented the one-sidedness of exchanges, as world music is ‘after all, not a meeting ground among equals.’ He criticized what he saw as watered-down versions of world music CDs by performers that adapt to a western market. In this assessment, culture becomes a zero-sum game: ‘As identities blur, someone’s culture is being depleted’ (#224). Watrous (#266) similarly distinguished between <italic>world</italic> music as superficial pop music and <italic>ethnic</italic> music with roots and authenticity. In a review of an ethnic music festival, he favored distant roots of the performers and denigrated mixed and adapted music. He upheld a static conception of a pre-colonial pure culture, even if that required some major historical assumptions: Ethnic music ‘is one of the last remnants of a way of life that predates the Industrial Revolution’ (#266).</p>
<p>Another authenticating strategy was to position the artists as of a lower social class. One review of Russian folk musicians suggested: ‘They’re country people, they are not slick … and because the Soviet Union is such an enormous country its folk cultures are intact’ (#214). The main means of legitimizing the music’s uniqueness was by emphasizing the artists’ genealogical difference (not from western countries), connecting them to a past (‘Music from the Middle Ages,’ #214) and its emotional appeal as ‘music that’s technically demanding and emotionally wide open’ (#214).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1367877912452481">
<title>Audience</title>
<p>The reviewers created and evaluated the audience of this music genre. While there were moments where writers ironically distanced themselves from affluent, white, liberal audiences of this music, the reviewers mostly positioned themselves as educators of the audience. The didactic approach is especially strong in the 1980s and 1990s. Reviewers spent much time defining and categorizing – creating knowledge – what world music was, where this music was from and why it was important to listen to it. For example, one <italic>Billboard</italic> article started with: ‘If you’re curious as to what constitutes world music these days …’ (#110). This approach positioned the readers as students who needed to learn about the music first before being able to enjoy it. Paradoxically, the music was simultaneously praised for appealing not to the intellect but to the emotions of readers. The authentic listening position asked readers to intellectually approach (i.e. rational) a music that would help their emotional (i.e. non-rational) development.</p>
<p>At times, readers were addressed as a special elite, erudite and with a better than average understanding of global connectedness. The word play ‘worldly’ was common. While listeners were supposed to use the music as an entry into a de-intellectualized world, it remained an elite cultural choice. The reviewers favored sophisticated intellectual engagement beyond the mundane form of escapist music enjoyment. As the clarinetist Andy Statman was quoted as saying: ‘People want to be moved in a deeper way these days, rather than just being rocked out with a beat’ (#112).</p>
<p>Overall, the audience was positioned as white, non-migrants of higher class status (e.g. #109). The artists were positioned in a clear us/them frame, even as this otherness was signifying positive, ‘exotic’ capital.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1367877912452481">
<title>Politics</title>
<p>Closely connected to this understanding of audiences is the reviewers’ treatment of politics and political lyrics. While many foreign artists were connected to political movements and many western sponsors/producers came out of the politicization of rock music in the 1980s (e.g. Peter Gabriel), reviewers tended to minimize the political connection or even criticized it for disturbing the purity of the music. Since you don’t have to understand the story behind the music to understand its feeling (#101), to truly connect could even mean to ignore the political meanings. A 1998 <italic>Billboard</italic> article mentioned that Brazilian artist Tom Zé’s music included a theory of his about ‘First World’ domination. Simultaneously, he was praised because ‘the artist is careful not to let his serious subject matter bog down him or his listeners’ (#120).</p>
<p>Political activism by artists was only tolerated as long as ‘the music is as poignant as their politics’ (#108). Several reviews very openly dismissed political activism by artists. A <italic>Rolling Stone</italic> reviewer commented on the Haitian band Rara Machine: ‘Now if only they’d ditch the political trappings of their live set and wise up to their true identity as a cool Caribbean party band’ (#93).</p>
<p>This clear us/them dichotomy was supported by a journalistic style that emphasized explanation and included few direct quotes from musicians. If anyone was quoted at all it would be western producers and record executives. The artists were only the objects of the reviews – often textually out of sight behind the actual musical act.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section10-1367877912452481">
<title>Phase two: reorientation</title>
<sec id="section11-1367877912452481">
<title>Tradition versus fusion</title>
<p>Around the mid 1990s, the launching of increasingly hybrid music forms and commercial successes of diaspora artists challenged essentialized rootedness as the obligatory genre signifier. Early attempts at hybrid musical forms were mostly reviewed negatively; however, we found a more intensified engagement with the roots/hybrid dichotomy between 1995 and 2000, a sort of reorientation phase. A surge of articles re-evaluated world music, such as <italic>Billboard</italic>’s ‘World music: what in the world is it?’ (#116) and ‘When worlds collide’ (#110) or <italic>The Village Voice</italic>’s special issue on ‘What is world music?’ (#118). Two contextual trends influenced this identity crisis. First, world music itself moved from a niche market to a very lucrative part of the music business. During that time pop, rock or country could not sustain the exponential growth rates of the early years of the CD business. In contrast, the world music label Putumayo, for example, saw its sales revenue increase from $350,000 in 1993, its launch year, to more than $9 million in 1999 (#125). Second, an increasing number of diaspora groups and second-generation migrant musicians were forming groups, emphasizing pop and fusion that resonated with world music labels and younger audiences.</p>
<p>The economic success and creative transformations of the genre towards fusion required reviewers to reconsider earlier established definitions of world music. In this time of confusion, journalists notably changed their style of writing. More reviews integrated other voices in direct quotations, first of producers and record executives but eventually of artists themselves. Reviewers used long interviews and quotations to clarify the debates surrounding world music. These articles typically acknowledged the new-found popularity of the genre (economic and audience interest), and included various voices on the new reality of the music. In this coverage, producers and artists were often in agreement on two major aspects: the new popularity of this music is positive and not a ‘selling out’ of musical roots. And, related to this argument, fusion and hybridity are healthy developments because they update the genre, reflect a post-national cultural sensibility and reflect how music has all along depended on inspirations from many sources. It seems to have been difficult for reviewers to find support for the contrasting argument that fusion and popularity may threaten the authenticity of the music. Thus, it was left to journalists to take up this argument in a professional ritual paying homage to objectivity. Reviewers in this phase remained resistant to the new cultural exchange. Fusion, dynamic music development, and hybridity were only reluctantly accepted as long as the artists didn’t lose sight of their roots and traditions – which were defined by the critics.</p>
<p>A quintessential example of this strategy is a <italic>Village Voice</italic> interview in 1997. The famous music critic Robert Christgau assembled a group of experts (a world music promoter, another critic, an archivist/producer, and calypso artist David Rudder) to discuss ‘What is world music? Exploring the meaning of a genre in formation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1367877912452481">‘What is world music? …’, 1997</xref>: 57). Here Christgau somewhat skeptically probed questions about cultural globalization such as the levels of distortion, the idea of cultural purity, crossing over and even ‘appropriate economic aims for musicians’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1367877912452481">1997</xref>: 57). While the world music promoter worried about fusion and the dissolution of established (branded) music formats, the others described a more dynamic approach toward culture. The following somewhat asynchronous exchange at the end of the interview is an example:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>[Music archivist/producer:]</speaker>
<p>The process that one might call dilution has been going on in music since the beginning of time.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>[World music promoter:]</speaker>
<p>There is this guy who is always trying to sell me the Pan-African orchestra, which consists of 40 different traditional instruments from different parts of Africa. But I keep thinking, what does that have to do with anything? It doesn’t sound nearly as powerful as any of the Afro-pop music, which has evolved through other means.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>[Calypso artist David Rudder:]</speaker>
<p>We have a new form called rapso. Which is because of rap music. But it’s not rap. It is like rap calypso.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>[Music critic Robert Christgau:]</speaker>
<p>It seems to me, if I may sum up what everyone is saying, that it can be fine for a musician from anywhere to hear another sound and try to incorporate it into his or her own music. The problem occurs when you try to adapt instead of being autonomous. Forty African musicians getting together and doing something wonderful, it’s possible. But probably the best way to do it is to stay where you are, gather it in, and make it work from what you know best. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1367877912452481">1997</xref>: 57)</p>
</speech>
<p>Christgau ignored the insights of the musicians and the archivist who championed fusion, but connected to the skepticism of the New York music promoter. Musical development and hybridization became acceptable only within closely defined limits if artists stayed close to their roots. Christgau (as a modernist) defended the enforcement of categories against a seemingly chaotic, postmodern, hybrid cultural process.</p>

<sec id="section13-1367877912452481">
<title>Musicians</title>
<p>The most striking change during the next phase concerned the representation of musicians. With the growing popularity of world music an increasing number of artists were interviewed directly, not through their producers. While during the first phase emotional appeal was valued over performers’ artistry, reviewers were now spending more words on defining the expertise and unique musical contributions of individual performers. Even short reviews bowed to the artists’ musicality. A review of Susheela Raman, for example, praised the ‘brilliant stuff from a vocalist who has never failed to challenge herself and her audience’ (#158). While the female singer of US Latina descent is still described as ‘willowy’ and the ‘sweet center of the band,’ echoing the typical objectification of female artists in music reviews (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367877912452481">Feigenbaum, 2005</xref>), the majority of the article allowed her to reflect in detail on her artistic and musical development in the New York DJ scene (#293). Artists became less essentialized symbols of a national culture but appreciated as creating a ‘sound of his own’ (#167). Diaspora artists are praised for the ability to ‘embody many sounds and styles at once’ (#293).</p>
<p>While first phase reviews displayed an ambivalent attitude towards economic success as ‘real artists are not just trying to make a dance hit to turn a buck’ (#116), in the third phase the genre’s new popularity is acknowledged. Its economic successes (e.g. ‘Manu Chao sells 7 million DVDs, Buena Vista Social Club at least 5 million’, #296) were no longer seen as detrimental to the ‘roots’ of the music. Global appeal became an interesting new ‘business opportunity’ (#138) for a music industry in shambles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1367877912452481">
<title>Dissolved dichotomies</title>
<p>The rupture of the previous phase led to a phase of accelerating dissolution of previous dichotomies. By the late 1990s, reviews gave more voice to the producers and artists who challenged the idea of world music as ‘roots’ (i.e. pre- modern), static or distant. The British/Indian diaspora band Cornershop’s lead singer countered the genre’s supposedly spiritual/magical components: ‘Me, I really don’t care being lifted up in this way. I’m much more interested in experimenting’ (#108). The didactic perspective of reviewers and music audiences was challenged as missing the point of art, which is supposed to be ‘pure pleasure and not education’ according to David Byrne (#131). While he and others were still privileged as western producers, they often acknowledged local knowledge and local agents abroad who select music (#137). Echoing the academic critique of the 1990s, reviewers acknowledged and favored ‘non-imperialistic collaborations’ (#134) and other anti-colonial productions (#82).</p>
<p>Moreover, the duality between commercialization and authentic musicality was dissolving: ‘Music making has its basis in society and religion <italic>and commerce</italic> and the travelling of different people from place to place’ (#277). Commercialization of art was increasingly accepted, perhaps registering the intensified commodification of postmodern life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1367877912452481">
<title>One world</title>
<p>Instead of rootedness a ‘one world’ approach was reinforced in a shift of location relating to music and artists. Increasingly, comparisons were made between world music and U.S. music: ‘Who says world music has to be exotic?’ (#173). Similarities were found/created to overcome access thresholds as listeners didn’t need to be ‘afraid of African music’ (#82). Peruvian music was related to ‘how American slaves developed tap dancing’ (#297). Music from Mali was ‘strangely familiar’ with ‘fingerpicking patterns that sometimes resemble Celtic rock’ (#273).</p>
<p>In a significant turn, the success of diaspora bands made it difficult for reviewers to uphold categories based on a nation-state framework. The earlier strategy to define artists mainly by national origins became complicated. The New York group Si*Sé explained: ‘Except for Neil, who’s from Venezuela, we all hail from the New York City area, [the singer’s] parent’s migrated from the Dominican Republic, hence the set’s Spanish and English lyrics’ (#281).</p>
<p>World music’s location also shifted from the remote to include the West: ‘World music becomes music made all over the world, including here’ (#277). Notably, diaspora became the new authentic location. For this, the US was reframed as a location of the always-already hybrid. A place to consider was ‘New York especially, as a mirror and microcosm of the world beyond its borders, as a place to hear echoes of nearly every human culture’ (#287). <italic>Billboard</italic> magazine praised the diasporic genre of US <italic>Rock en Español</italic>: ‘Long considered something of an ugly duckling among its Mexican, Argentine and Spanish cousins, U.S. <italic>rock en español</italic> seems to be finally coming of age – if not in sales, then in sheer numbers and tenacity’ (#283).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1367877912452481">3</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1367877912452481">
<title>Acceptance of hybridity</title>
<p>Another <italic>Billboard</italic> article in 2001 (#284) seemed to take on the earlier authenticity check, except that now it clearly answered this question in favor of a dynamic idea of culture. A series of music executives and producers advocated: ‘if the musicians are in control of hybridization and have the final say about the music, it’s a pretty good thing.’ Hybridization became an enhancement of music. Acknowledging the need for musicians to react to new technology and influences, a producer was quoted as saying: ‘all musicians are saying the same thing right now. It’s the way forward’ (#284).</p>
<p>This dynamic approach to culture was echoed in a subtle shift in the frequently encountered travel metaphors. No longer were western producers traveling to discover remote acts, now musicians were framed as travelers, explorers, and constantly on the move.</p>
<p>Reviewers who outright defended tradition and roots became the exceptions, while most modified the idea of global cultural exchange to a more complex endeavor. A typical example of this textual struggle were the dialectics of the <italic>New York Times</italic> critic Jon Pareles (2002b), who in annual reviews of world music continued to hold on to categorization along national categories, and wearily observed that DJs ‘hear the sounds of unfamiliar cultures providing a fashionably exotic, even spiritual lift, just the thing for a dance floor or a chill-out lounge’ (#287), but hoped that, despite global homogenizing of culture, ‘traditions … aren’t about to go away quietly’ (#287). While he criticized ‘nutty pastiches of ancient and current styles,’ he nevertheless dissolved his own static nation-state categorization. For example, he highlighted the ‘multitude of local and hybrid traditions with Andean and Afro-Caribbean roots’ in Colombia, or the influence of Bob Marley and Bob Dylan on the Mali band Tinariwen that was founded in a refugee camp (#287).</p>
<p>In more recent articles, the transformation was endorsed even further, for example, by praising the musicians of Blip Hop (a hybrid-techno release by world music label Luaka Bop) as ‘not tethered to distinct cultural identities’ (#289). In another article, world music fusion signified ‘the sound of the future’ (#284).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1367877912452481">
<title>Audience</title>
<p>The third phase also indicated a different attitude toward audiences. While earlier reviews implied a higher-educated, progressive and mature niche, by 2000 reviewers increasingly acknowledged a younger and broader audience. Several articles mentioned that digital technology and the popularity of music downloads improved the chances for audiences to be exposed to world music. The fact that DJs were using world music in dance mixes was first seen as a problem for disconnecting young audiences lost in dance who fail to understand (i.e. rationally access) the music. Very soon, however, reviewers were appreciating the increased access to world music, and expected that this would lead new audiences to the genre. By 2007, the <italic>New York Times</italic> commented on the increased downloading of music from abroad and applauded online selection’s ‘kaleidoscopic not didactic’ approach (#173). The reviewers’ approval shifted to a wider, younger audience willing to listen to fusion, hybrids, and experimental collaborations between western and non-western artists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1367877912452481">
<title>Politics</title>
<p>After the reorientation phase, the relationship of politics to world music changed as well. In the late 1990s and early 2000s political engagement became a ‘personal’ affair of the musicians. The political aspects were no longer disturbing the musicality of the acts but dealt with in half sentence. Groups are ‘fittingly political’ (#149) or ‘hard-hitting political’ (#155), yet reviews still often ignored further details (see also #146). The idea that listening to world music is a political act (through the purchase of CDs) was invoked throughout all phases. For example, in 2000, the <italic>Philadelphia Inquirer</italic> featured a story recommending that parents play world music for children: ‘Learning music from other countries, cultures helps broaden experience – and tolerance … a first step towards eradicating prejudice and racism’ (#274).</p>
<p>While these attempts to establish a global civic consciousness through buying commercial products may be belittled as somewhat naive, they gained a different urgency after September 11, 2001. In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 tragedy, world music moved into the news section or reviews followed routines of news journalism. Many articles dealt with international artists being denied visas and music festivals being cancelled. While the British paper <italic>The Guardian</italic> at that time declared world music as, ‘the soundtrack of the pro-peace and anti-globalization’ movements internationally (#294), US journalists more cautiously scanned US audience reactions to international artists as signs of resistance to jingoistic tendencies in their own country. Reviewers positively commented on the continued popularity of acts from Muslim countries or the successful launch of an album of Arab music. One reviewer quoted a series of producers who praised the genre’s ‘climate of tolerance and curiosity’ and highlighted the refusal of world music audiences to ostracize migrant or international groups. Listening to Middle Eastern music became a political act – to support the liberal artistic and creative forces in the Middle East and beyond ‘because they present the good side of society. Consider the Taliban: They went out of their way to ban music’ (#299). Listening helped ‘against American ignorance’ (#299). After all, ‘it’s hard to hate people when you’re dancing to their music’ (#299).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1367877912452481">
<title>Looking in – from the outside</title>
<p>In specific moments this new attention to the politics of international understanding even led to a turn in focus by having outside voices reflect on US American cultural isolation. Singer Mohammed Abdul, for example, reflected on his exposure to other music such as from India while growing up in Morocco: ‘It stimulated my curiosity. Americans just now seem to be enjoying the same experience’ (#290). This article turned the then often addressed foreign policy concern ‘Why do ‘they’ hate us?’ to pragmatic advice: the article implied that, to overcome their cultural isolation, US Americans had to catch up with the rest of the world, which was open to outside influences and non-essentialized notions of culture. Journalists used quotes from artists to provide a perspective from the outside on the US in times of national crisis. This journalistic strategy disrupted the conventions of political reporting that tends to use internal elites to comment on international issues from an ethnocentric perspective.</p>

<sec id="section20-1367877912452481">
<title>Authenticity, popular journalism, and global cultural change</title>
<p>Critical-cultural journalism research tends to emphasize the regressive/reactionary ideological positions of media workers. With regard to the many transformative dimensions of globalization, textual analyses of journalistic content and media work accordingly affirmed the limited potential of media texts produced in commercial media systems to explain changes such as new global social movements (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367877912452481">DeLuca and Peeples, 2002</xref>) or complex geopolitical developments (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367877912452481">Kavoori and Fraley, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In our study, journalists also faced a change of significant proportions – the complexities of cultural globalization – a problematic area often framed by scholars between the poles of homogenization and heterogenization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367877912452481">Rantanen, 2005</xref>). While the popular discourse examined here is often tied into dominant ideological positions on the West/Rest relationship, we also discovered how, in the struggle over defining the role and place of world music, reviewers continually worked towards an acknowledgement (if wearily and slowly) of a new cultural sensibility: hybrid global cultural production moved from being considered non-authentic to ‘hip’ over the course of 30 years. This journalism necessitated not only the gradual acceptance of a specific new music genre (which would be a typical reaction for art critics who review something new). More importantly, this acceptance demanded a significant shift in underlying ideological assumptions on cultural exchange: from authentic to hybrid; from essentialized/dehumanized ‘Others’ to creative ‘One World’; and from elite to popular. This journalism had to develop a different attitude – not just toward artistic production but also toward audiences and geopolitical norms, such as the position of the nation-state and the representation of the Other.</p>
<p>The question is how this discursive change was accomplished. There were two features that journalists used to work through the cultural transformation: A change in the location of authenticity along with the re-ethnification of ‘America,’ and the acceptance of the popular.</p>
<sec id="section21-1367877912452481">
<title>Authenticity and place</title>
<p>The important connection between music and authenticity has been established in various studies. Musicians, fans and critics invoke authenticity for legitimation or to evaluate artistic sincerity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367877912452481">Frith, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367877912452481">McLeod, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367877912452481">Peterson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1367877912452481">Thornton, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>The authenticity discourse in the music reviews underwent transformations in significant ways. Early on, authenticity was established in a discourse reminiscent of travelogues and colonial aspirations by emphasizing distant, unspoiled roots. World music was the fulfillment of an intensified search for genuine experiences, in reaction to living in the mediatized spheres that make up postmodern everyday life. Listening to world music meant ‘keeping it real’ as a counter-strategy to a hyperreal world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367877912452481">Huyssen, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Later, however, authenticity was constructed in the collaborations and inspirations of skilled musicians from around the world and audiences ‘who look beyond their comfortable points of reference’ (#280). The new place of authenticity was not Africa, Asia or ‘other’ countries but diaspora communities in the West. Notably, however, reviewers long held on to the category ‘non-white’ as a racial signifier of authenticity.</p>
<p>Yet ultimately the ethnic demarcations were pushed even further, partly triggered by the addition of the non-metropolitan US genre Americana in the catalogues of world music labels. The shift in authentic location necessitated a significant shift in ideological position: the re-ethnification of white ‘American’ music. After music reviewers (almost always from a non-minority US perspective) ‘discovered’ the ethnic diaspora acts in their own neighborhoods, the emphasis on migrant neighborhoods further dissolved and the category of world music could even include white North American artists. For example, a 2002 <italic>Billboard</italic> article described the popularity of US alternative country (‘alt-country’) or Americana bands such as Lambchop that filled concerts halls across Europe, but hardly registered in the United States. A quote explained the ‘growing interest in Americana … because it’s music that is honest, unpretentious, heartfelt, and unmanufactured’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1367877912452481">Williamson, 2002</xref>: 64) – a statement that 20 years earlier could have been used to describe any world music act. Reviewers who were looking for alternatives to mainstream, hyper-commercialized music had ethnicized white US music.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1367877912452481">
<title>Accepting the popular</title>
<p>It is significant that music reviewers did not overcome their reluctance towards a more dynamic idea of global cultural production through their own effort, but rather, because the artists and audiences moved in this direction. The new popularity of hybrid music compelled the reviewers to explain a new diasporic world to their readers.</p>
<p>There are two possible reasons why music reviewers did this: for one, their modernist/didactic attitudes as critics had them searching for the avant-garde, always trying to be at the forefront of a new creative development. Hybrid music could be considered ‘the new thing.’ However, hybridity in world fusion as a postmodern pastiche (unabashedly recycled, playful and commercial) challenged the impetus of avant-garde to reject earlier traditions. It was more likely another reason that triggered the eventual engagement with hybridity and a redefinition of cultural assumptions: the critics’ connections to the commercial music industry made them look out for the newest markets and appreciate sound new business strategies. Put simply, if something sold well and generated enough audience interest, there had to be something to it. Embracing the commercial popularity of the genre helped journalists to engage with the transformation, even if that meant reassessing global cultural exchange. This argument, of course, challenges political economists who would reject a transformative potential of commercial cultural industries and their affiliated cultural intermediaries. However, our argument reaffirms the potential of the popular including popular journalism to recalibrate hegemonic positions. In this case, dominant ideologies on ‘authentic’ cultural production and ethnic musical distinction had to be adjusted, which ultimately required a different approach to representing the Other. The text changed from a de-humanizing and objectifying attitude towards non-white musicians (phase one) to an integration of global/local musicians’ expertise and their creative opinions (phase three).</p>
<p>Importantly, this change demanded a considerable discursive effort: (1) a difference in journalistic style and (2) a new orientation towards the readers. From phase one to phase three the use of quotations or interviews with artists increased significantly. As explained above, these musicians were personalized and evaluated for their specific musical skills, not their exotic ‘otherness.’ Especially around 9/11, some reviews were used to provide a non-jingoistic perspective – a distinctive break from the ethnocentric news values of international reporting.</p>
<p>Moreover, the journalists also modified their attitude to the audience. While they originally addressed an affluent, mostly white western elite that needed to be educated about the genre, the preferred reading position over time changed to a younger, digitally savvy, multicultural crowd that enjoyed a variety of music produced away from the imploding corporate music industry. The reviewers followed popular pleasure.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section23-1367877912452481">
<title>The politics of world music reviews</title>
<p>In addition to the content-related and stylistic elements of the analysed text there are formal aspects that promote audience engagement. Music reviews became what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367877912452481">Fiske (1989)</xref> called ‘relevant’ and ‘productive.’ He suggested that traditional objective news often failed to connect to audiences in meaningful ways; instead, using more popular, open formats adopted from quiz shows or soap operas could engage audiences more successfully. In our case, reviews were productive because their opinionated stance encouraged readers to take a position. The level of popular expertise used was non-intimidating especially when the writers avoided a didactic know-it-all attitude (as they eventually did). The productivity was amplified by a physical dimension. By inviting audience to listen to music that was not necessarily familiar these reviews disturbed common western expectations.</p>
<p>But how effective are these experiences? Lipsitz, for example, soberly pointed to the potential superficiality of the cultural politics of world music: ‘The popularity of <italic>rai</italic> music among French and ‘world beat’ audiences may mean little for children of immigrants facing massive unemployment and racist attacks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367877912452481">1997</xref>: 125). Yet this quote may underestimate the potential of the popular. Reading these reviews meant that world music fans engaged in central issues of cultural globalization within their own lifeworlds. Readers were invited to consider issues such as (unequal) cultural exchange, cultural imperialism, hybridity, migration, racism and diaspora. The transformation to actual political action is another step, of course. This concern is not new: as a ‘cultural forum,’ this type of popular journalism did not ‘present firm ideological conclusions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367877912452481">Newcomb and Hirsch, 1983</xref>: 64) but surely helped to mainstream important questions about the cultural dimensions of globalization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1367877912452481">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>We end this study at a time of great disruption in the music industry. Not only is music itself increasingly distributed online, music criticism similarly has moved online. A future study needs to analyse whether the breakdown of the traditional music business and the vanishing impact of producers and A&amp;R personnel moves more interpretive agency to independent critics or even fans.</p>
<p>Our contribution was to test the often-claimed empowering potential of popular journalism by analysing music reviews as a text in which cultural globalization is negotiated. The fact that the coverage is popular journalism by itself did not guarantee the ‘public quality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367877912452481">Costera Meijer, 2001</xref>) of this coverage. More precisely, music reviewers’ direct connection to popular tastes and the commercial underpinnings of this type of journalism stipulated a transformation that had to be accompanied by changes in journalistic practices that revised the representation of global Others: positioning musicians and artists of varied national and ethnic backgrounds as creative experts and sources who explained and exemplified global cultural transformations gave this coverage a public quality.</p>
<p>The hundreds of articles analysed for this study present a complex text involving not just a discourse on cultural globalization but also (an often problematic one) on issues of race and gender. These issues were explored here peripherally, and warrant critical analysis in their own right. Our focus was on the question of whether world music criticism, as lifestyle journalism, has the potential to engage audiences in a meaningful discourse surrounding cultural globalization. We conclude that in a transformative process over 30 years, world music reviews made the complexities of globalization increasingly relevant and offered an important alternative to mainstream news journalism that overwhelmingly continued to rely on the ideology of national distinctions.</p>
