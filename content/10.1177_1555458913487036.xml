<abstract>
<p>This case is based on real-life experiences of community school members within Horner School—an inner-city public school. Specifically, the case explores challenges faced by Cathleen, a 1st-year, White, female principal, who was hired by central office to “revamp a charter school” to promote a quality education for all children. The case raises questions about how school leaders might work in conjunction with school community members to understand to what extent, if any, issues of poverty impact school policy, curriculum, and pedagogy.</p>

<title>Case Narrative</title>
<p>Cathleen was the fifth principal hired in 4 years at Horner School. The first four principals either voluntarily resigned from their positions or were fired before the end of their 1st year. According to central office personnel, the first principal resigned after 3 months, because he “feared the neighborhood.” The other principals were described as “incapable of understanding the needs of the community” and “did not know how to make significant changes to improve test scores.” Cathleen came to Horner with 15 years of administrative and teaching experience in urban schools. She was informed by central office personnel to “boost school community morale,” “raise student test scores,” “bring the school community together,” and “do whatever it takes to change Horner around.” Cathleen requested the past 3 years of school community surveys collected from students, teachers, support staff, families, and community members. She also reviewed standardized test data, student attendance trends, policies, and school practices. Cathleen recognized the need to conduct a needs assessment to better understand the Horner School community that included assessing strengths, challenges, and vision for the future.</p>
<p>Approximately 700 elementary and middle school students attended Horner School, which was located on the west side of a major metropolitan city. More than 70% of children rode public city buses between 60 and 120 min to arrive at school, including kindergarteners escorted by siblings in the upper grades. Ninety-nine percent of children were students of color, with 65% of students identifying as Latino/a and 34% identifying as Black. One percent of children identified as White. More than 95% of students received free/reduced lunch, which is an indicator for children living in poverty. Seventy-six percent of Latino/a students identified as first-generation U.S. students whose families came from Peru, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Columbia, and Mexico. Several families informed Cathleen that they came to the United States with no more than an elementary education, but shared hopes of affording their children with educational opportunities beyond what their native countries could offer. Many families spoke their native languages at home and expressed insecurities communicating in English. They grew concerned about school policies being implemented by central office personnel that prohibited their children from speaking their native language in school as well as a policy in which communication between school and home was to only be written in English.</p>
<p>Horner School did not make Annual Yearly Progress within the past 4 years. Overall, between 11% and 19% of students were exceeding/meeting state standards in reading and math across grade levels. Within 4 years, not one teacher was placed on probation or dismissed for low student achievement scores. For nine teachers, standardized test scores decreased between 10% and 15% each year when they received the same group of students from a lower grade. These same teachers also received “above average” or “outstanding” ratings on their formal teacher evaluations.</p>
<p>Approximately 27% of students were identified as needing special education services. More than 65% of students received disciplinary referrals with an average of 226 out-of-school suspensions, 437 detentions, and 359 in-school-suspensions per academic year. Average daily student attendance ranged from 80% to 85%. More than 50% of children were tardy 15 to 35 min to school. Approximately 35% of children were signed out of school by family members between 2 and 3 hr before the end of the school day. More than 15% of students missed more than 10 days of school in the first 3 months. During Cathleen’s 1st year as principal, within the first 2 months of school, children missed more than 2,000 min of school due to tardies; more than 4,000 min due to absences; and more than 3,500 min due to early dismissals. Five percent of teachers worked at Horner since its doors opened 4 years ago. More than 80% of teachers had 1 to 2 years of teaching experience and informed Cathleen during personal interviews during the first 2 months of school about their preference to work within a White, upper/middle-class surrounding suburban school district. Several of these teachers perceived Horner School as their “only option for employment,” “great training ground for working with ‘these’ kind of kids.”</p>

<title>Insights Gathered</title>
<sec id="section3-1555458913487036">
<title>Children</title>
<p>More than 70% of Horner School children identified the school as “ghetto” on surveys collected by central office administration. Some children described Horner as “a dump,” “a grave yard,” or said “there’s nothing here.” Several children noted mass amounts of garbage along the school yard, broken classroom windows, lack of air conditioning, broken or missing locker doors, bathrooms smelling of urine, no toilet paper or soap in bathrooms, and rodents throughout the building. One child wrote, “I don’t live like this at home so why do I have to live like this at school?” Several children were concerned about “playing in the street for recess,” “not having any balls or jump ropes,” and “not having a playground.”</p>
<p>Children in the elementary grades (K-5) overall rated their teachers as “average” or “above average” while children in the middle school grades (6-8) as “average” or “below average.” Overall, children in Grades K-5 believed their teachers were “good”; however, they emphasized a desire to spend more personal time with them versus engaging in test-taking strategies. In the middle school grades, some children who identified their teachers as “average” noted them as “doing their job.” For those who rated teachers as “below average,” some wrote teachers “yell at them,” “acted like bullies,” “think they are stupid,” and “do not really care about them.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1555458913487036">
<title>Families</title>
<p>Family surveys indicated parents did not feel welcome at Horner. Several families noted school policies restricted their access to the building. They also complained of limited contact with teachers and administrators. One parent wrote “we don’t feel like we belong there.” Another parent wrote, “It’s like they look at us and realize we don’t belong. It makes me feel like my children don’t stand a chance.” Other comments included feeling as though “they don’t know our children,” “we are outsiders,” and “I don’t know if I can trust them to look after my child.”</p>
<p>Sixty-three percent of parents rated the school as “poor” in communication between home and school and in providing their children with a quality education. Approximately 57% of parents noted teachers did not seem concerned about the welfare of their children. One parent noted, “These are all good kids. They have no choice which neighborhood they live in.”</p>
<p>The student transfer rate (parents choosing to take their student[s] out of Horner and enroll their student in another school) ranged from 35% to 47% over the past 4 years. Parents expressed low academic expectations for their children, lack of understanding regarding how parents could help their child at home, and feeling intimated by teachers to discuss their concerns.</p>

<sec id="section5-1555458913487036">
<title>Faculty and Support Staff</title>
<p>Cathleen met with 65 employees individually at Horner (i.e., teachers, secretaries, aides, custodians, security officer, counselor, and nurse). She asked questions centered on how they understood the strengths and challenges facing the school, the strengths and knowledge brought to the school by the children and families served, how they understood issues of poverty, and approaches they incorporated in their teaching to make school a better place for all children. White teachers emphasized how often they followed and encouraged the implementation of school policies such as tracking students, ability grouping, scripted curriculum, and strict disciplinary practices. One teacher noted, “This isn’t complicated. These kids are poor and have no future, so I can’t just bring this great future to them by coming to this school. They are just going to repeat what has already been done.” Another teacher expressed concerns regarding her capacity to improve student learning.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know what you want me to do with these poor kids. They are so far behind, and I just don’t have time to teach them everything they need to know. I can’t change their families . . . I mean, this stuff stems from somewhere, like their impoverished neighborhoods . . . it’s not like they are going to get anywhere in a year.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>More than 90% of White teachers believed knowledge presented at school took precedence over family cultural knowledge shared at home.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I came to this school because I couldn’t find anywhere else to work. I am buying my time here. I figure, if I could work here with these poor kids, then I can work anywhere. This is a great place for training teachers how to work with those kinds of kids.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Teachers also expressed their concerns with developing ways to overcome the extreme levels of poverty experienced by children at Horner. Some teachers identified themselves as feeling “powerless” in addressing how to overcome their assumptions about children and families who live in poverty.</p>
<p>Two teachers of color and support staff, who also identified as people of color, provided another perspective. For these adults, growing up in impoverished neighborhoods and “making something of themselves” was critical to their work at Horner.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There is definitely a divide here. The White teachers aren’t here because they love our children as though they were their own. It’s like it’s just a job to them. They clock in and then check out. Almost all of the teachers here are White, and only two of them are Hispanic and Black. But you see how all of the workers are either Mexican, Puerto Rican, or Black. We don’t work here for the money. There is no money to be made. We come here every day because of the children. They need to know someone cares about them, because most of these teachers are young and inexperienced and don’t look at the world the way we do. It’s a sin to act as though our children do not matter. These people act like there are no children here.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section6-1555458913487036">
<title>Community</title>
<p>In early August, some school personnel volunteered to walk with Cathleen throughout the local community to meet with local residents, business owners, and community organization leaders. They inquired about how community members understood the neighborhood as well as the relationship between themselves and Horner School. Community members shared feelings of pride, which centered on the belief to do what is necessary to help their children be successful, especially in school. They also expressed feeling excluded from Horner. More than 80% of community members noted this was the first attempt made by the school to engage with the community at large. Community members shared challenges they faced. These challenges included gangs, local drug deals, prostitution rings, crack houses, and violent crimes committed within a four-block radius of Horner School. Local police officers shared similar information with Cathleen at school about gang territories, recent gun fire, and neighborhood crime statistics.</p>
<p>Local tenants shared stories with school personnel during the beginning of the year during community walks. They described weekly drive-by shootings and tensions between gangs that resulted in violence and sometimes death. Children and school personnel demonstrated the “drive-by drill” to Cathleen during her 1st week, which directed students to sit under their desks and cover the heads to protect themselves from shattered window glass.</p>

<sec id="section7-1555458913487036">
<title>Condition of Horner and School Grounds</title>
<p>Neighbors wondered why the school had several broken windows, weeds reaching more than 3-feet high, and no playground or equipment for the children. Inside the school, more than half of the locker doors were broken or missing. The school was infested with mice, roaches, rats the size of small dogs, and ants. In the middle of a school day, secretaries noted how often they receive a call over the intercom system requesting a visit from the principal because “mice are everywhere and frightening the children.” Many window shades were broken. Children and teachers noted how often snow came in through the windows due to gaps between the frames and glass. Parents and children also complained bathrooms had no privacy due to prior school personnel removing stall doors. Children often requested paper towels, soap, and toilet paper.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1555458913487036">
<title>School Policies and Practices</title>
<p>Central office personnel mandated a scripted curriculum, ability grouping, English-only written communication between home and school, and daily 30-min test-taking sessions for students. More than 38% of students were placed in low-level reading groups and 43% of students were placed in low-level math groups. Learning for these students often took place in hallways and in the gymnasium. Children in low-level reading groups were often instructed by the least experienced teachers who ranged from 1 to 2 years of classroom experience as well as specials teachers (i.e., art, physical education, music, and technology). These teachers expressed concerns to Cathleen that although they received prior professional development, they did not have appropriate certification to teach literacy or specifically, English Language Learners.</p>
<p>One teacher said,
<disp-quote>
<p>I know some of these kids are smart, but they just don’t care about school, Cathleen. They have unmotivated parents and then the kids are just lazy. No one comes to school for meetings and so many are just unprepared for school.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, a central office administrator shared similar beliefs about children at Horner. She said, “These kids are just not capable of doing high-level work, so we keep it simple for them.” Several teachers identified the scripted curriculum as “appropriate,” because “these” children “aren’t smart enough,” “lazy,” and “a waste of their time.” Many White teachers attributed children’s low standardized test scores to “inability to learn,” “lack of motivation,” “poor neighborhoods,” and “messed up families.”</p>
<p>Support staff and Teachers of Color emphasized the consequences of implementing low expectations at Horner School.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The teachers don’t understand who we are, why we are here, and what we will do for our children. As parents, we want the best for our children. I don’t understand why they can’t see that. I only had a fifth-grade education. That was only how far I could go, but I want my children to have it better than me. I work hard. My wife works three jobs, and we do this to make a better life for our family. We make sacrifices for our children to come to school every day, but these teachers look down at us because we don’t have what they have.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<title>Case Analysis and Teaching Notes</title>
<p>This case explored how educators and school leaders understood what it meant to work and serve in an inner-city school. As the United States becomes increasingly segregated by race and class, those who work in schools will continue to be faced with how to better serve those who often bear the burden in society. School leaders, teachers, and community members may reconsider what it means for a child to live in poverty. The authors of this case spent thousands of hours in urban classrooms talking with teachers, meeting with students, observing teaching, and helping teachers navigate the complexities of urban elementary classrooms with a growing percentage of students in poverty. They also observed moments of teaching, learning, caring, and support. As both authors witnessed moments of internal conflict with teachers and school leaders at Horner as well as other urban schools, what some teachers and school leaders wanted to believe about the children and families they served seemed to collide with their prejudices.</p>
<p>Like many school leaders and teachers at Horner School, they were determined to create a school to improve student learning, and like many educators with good intentions, sometimes good intentions are not enough because they tend to believe the most common myths about poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555458913487036">Shields, 2003</xref>). Chief among these myths is an idea presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1555458913487036">Oscar Lewis (1961)</xref>, who promoted a culture of poverty, or the belief that poor people share common, predictable beliefs, values, and behaviors. This work promoted a debate centered on the nature of poverty. With the age of data-driven decision making in U.S. public schools, understanding the culture of poverty concept is critical. Scholars studied the validity of the culture of poverty (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1555458913487036">Billings, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1555458913487036">Jones &amp; Luo, 1999</xref>) as well as others who analyzed the findings regarding the culture of poverty (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1555458913487036">Ortiz &amp; Briggs, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555458913487036">Rodman, 1977</xref>). They all concluded the culture of poverty does not exist. Rather, there are as many differences in values and behaviors among people living in poverty as there are between those who are wealthy and those who are among the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1555458913487036">Compton-Lilly, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1555458913487036">Iversen &amp; Farber, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Educators may want to reconsider how belief systems influence life chances or opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1555458913487036">hooks, 2000</xref>). They may discover how often scholars attribute destructive attitudes and behavior toward people living in poverty, not to inherent moral character, but to sustained racism and isolation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555458913487036">Small, Harding, &amp; Lamont, 2010</xref>). Reconsidering the systemic nature of poverty, its connectedness with educational opportunities, and the U.S. economic system provides educators with spaces to understand the need to respond to the plight of the poor in schools (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1555458913487036">hooks, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1555458913487036">Rodriguez, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1555458913487036">Valenzuela, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1555458913487036">Yosso, 2005</xref>). This need may encourage educators to not only engage in meaningful dialogue centered on meeting the needs of disenfranchised populations in schools but also reconsider the promotion of action-oriented practices to address such issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555458913487036">Shields, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In an effort to improve student learning for children who live in poverty, sometimes educators, like those at Horner School, promote curriculum, pedagogies, and school policies that dismiss the lived experiences of children and focus on teaching mainstream beliefs, norms, and language to redefine school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1555458913487036">Valenzuela, 1999</xref>). If such considerations are not made, teachers and school leaders might run the risk of promoting culturally unresponsive practices that cause more harm than good. Sensitizing school personnel to the lived realities of children living in poverty, relationships between disparate levels of education and poverty, and educational achievement along racial lines are all contextual dimensions to be considered when challenging myths about the culture of poverty.</p>
<p>This critical stance suggests that educators reflect on how they understand poverty, its impact on student learning, and their capacity to create learning environments within economically diverse school communities to make schools better places for all children (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555458913487036">Berliner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1555458913487036">Howard &amp; Grogan Dresser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1555458913487036">MacLeod, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1555458913487036">Oakes, 1985</xref>). Responses toward children living in poverty may play an essential role in promoting student learning, which tend to go unrecognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1555458913487036">Gonzalez, Moll, &amp; Amanti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555458913487036">Moll, Amanti, Neff, &amp; Gonzalez, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1555458913487036">Yosso, 2006</xref>). These opportunities include acknowledging and building upon community networks, both formal and informal, building bridges between self and others, and valuing familial and social ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1555458913487036">Boske, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>This case study reflects complicated issues aligned with understanding how to address the marginalization of children living in poverty in U.S. schools. The following action points were created for school leaders to consider, especially in creating safe, equitable spaces for all children to learn. Ask school leaders to reflect on how they might respond to the dilemmas presented in the case, and take into account the cultural, social, cognitive, and emotional needs of children living in poverty.</p>
