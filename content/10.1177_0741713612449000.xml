<p>The publisher’s notes celebrate this volume as “Providing the first comprehensive study of the subject, this innovative book will be required reading for CPD professionals and researchers and will be useful supplemental reading for all those involved with human resources development and management/leadership development” (inside jacket). Presented in three parts, each with extensive tables, figures, exhibits, and notes, <italic>Continuing Professional Development</italic> appears to be as advertised; a comprehensive study of the field from prehistory to various visions of and challenges to future development. As such this book may well serve to engage scholars, directors, and professionals alike in the process of further defining and adding value to the process of Continuing Professional Education (CPE) as we refer to it in North America. The author, Andrew Freidman is a professor of management and economics at Bristol University, England, and managing director of PARN (Professional Associations Research Network), an agency he helped develop and whose prior work he credits as the foundation for this volume. While acknowledging that “Professional Development” has taken place since the advent of professions and professionals in human society, Friedman presents continuing professional development (CPD) as a field and field of study that are both extremely new and undefined.</p>
<p>The overarching theme of this work is that CPE underwent a rebirth in the 1980s as the “question authority” baby boomers came of age and entered the professions creating the need to rebuild trust in both those professions and the practitioners within them. Background for this emergence is outlined in pages 67-71 of the text and included recognition that meeting the entry requirements was no longer sufficient and that sources of authority were suspect as framers of questionable values held by the previous generation. Prior to the 1980s organizations such as the American Medical Association, American Dental Association, and Bar associations were largely operating on the model of setting benchmarks for entry into their respective fields and disciplining those who went afoul of the rules rather than maintaining or updating knowledge or skill, which now is part of their missions.</p>
<p>Definitions of CPD/CPE are described as widely varied both between professions and associations within professions, as are the standards by which such programs are assessed. A uniform system of determining continuing development value (CDV) based on outputs or outcomes is therefore suggested as a means to facilitate both the strengthening of the field and to make it more transparent to secondary or outside stakeholders such as regulatory agencies, media, and the general public. Freidman brings this last point up throughout the book. CPE/CPD most often enters the media spotlight on occasions where professionals are being disciplined, generally through the courts. The lack of positive visibility in popular media is not helpful to either professionals or the field of continuing professional development. Positive attention makes an argument for partnerships between professional associations, employers, and institutions of higher education that can systematically celebrate and market the public benefits of CPD.</p>
<p>While professing to provide a review of the global state of CPD/CPE, Friedman’s work is notably centered on the activity and organizations in his native England and its associated countries within the United Kingdom. It does provide some insight into work in the United States, including an interesting discussion of the differences in organizational philosophy in the work of Drucker and Senge but is largely silent with regard to the balance of Europe and the large growing economies of Asia. The author does, however, acknowledge this Anglocentricity. I chose to interpret this as in invitation to practitioners and researchers in those regions, such as readers of this journal, to engage in dialogue with him and his colleagues in order to fill the gaps in knowledge and provide additional answers to the questions posed. In an unorthodox manner for a “history” book, Friedman presents the challenges he perceives to each model described or prescribed within this volume. I believe that to be the key to its value as there is no pretense to having all the answers but rather a sense of reframing the issues and asking questions that call out for answers.</p>
<p>I recommend this volume for use by its intended audiences; to professors and students of continuing education as a textbook, and to researchers and practitioners alike as reference manual. I find this volume to be a concise history and handbook of the field, and its 20-page bibliography provides a rich roadmap for further inquiry and dialogue.</p>
