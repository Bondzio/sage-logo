<abstract>
<p>In this research we examined how the conditions of Haiti’s tent communities, inhabited by those displaced by the January 10, 2010, earthquake, shaped access and adherence to highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) for Haitians with HIV. Conditions in the encampments were marked by unhygienic and cramped living spaces, exposure to the elements, a lack of privacy, unavailability of food and clean water, and a dependence on poorly functioning aid agencies. These conditions shaped access and adherence to HAART by (a) exacerbating the stigma of being HIV positive and undermining mental health; (b) presenting logistical challenges to accessing medical care, storing pills, and ingesting them safely and privately; and (c) sustaining a political economy of aid characterized by unequal treatment in major HAART-dispensing centers, unequal circulation of international funds, and the emergence of alternative medical institutions within encampments that could improve future treatment. Policy and intervention implications are discussed.</p>

<p>Haiti’s HIV prevalence of 2.2% is one of the highest outside of sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312469463">Malow, Rosenberg, Lichtenstein, &amp; Devieux, 2010</xref>). The earthquake on January 12, 2010, dealt a critical blow to HIV intervention efforts by crippling the health service system in the country and severely undermining the state of HIV service provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732312469463">Rencoret, Stoddard, Haver, Taylor, &amp; Harvey, 2010</xref>). The disaster claimed the lives of almost 10% of Haiti’s medical staff and destroyed almost 60% of the health facilities in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732312469463">Médecins Sans Frontiéres, 2010</xref>). Moreover, it is estimated that almost 1.5 million, or more than 10% of Haitians were displaced by the earthquake, most of whom, at the time of the study, lived in temporary tent communities that had sprung up across the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732312469463">Jordan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732312469463">Montgomery, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The unstable housing situation in these encampments, combined with the disruption in health services, presented difficult hurdles for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Access and high adherence to highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) is critical to successful treatment and to preventing the emergence of resistant strains of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732312469463">Bangsberg et al., 2000</xref>). Consequently, the conditions after the earthquake could pose a significant public health challenge for the country. However, little is known about how PLWHA were coping with the challenges of living in these tent communities. Specifically, there is a dearth of research on how postearthquake conditions affect HIV treatment for PLWHA. Whereas some preliminary reports documented the manner in which the health care system was hamstrung after the disaster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312469463">Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS [UNAIDS], 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312469463">Malow et al., 2010</xref>), few researchers have examined the manner in which PLWHA were coping in Haiti’s encampments. In this qualitative study we sought to address this gap in our knowledge about postearthquake Haiti by examining the manner in which the living conditions of the tent communities shaped access and adherence to HAART for PLWHA.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732312469463">
<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section2-1049732312469463">
<title>HIV Care in Haiti</title>
<p>A sharp rise in HIV prevalence in the early days of the epidemic peaked at 5% in 1994, subsequently declining gradually to its current prevalence of about 2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732312469463">Gaillard et al., 2006</xref>). Scholars have documented several reasons for the decline in prevalence, including a drop in vertical transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312469463">Malow et al., 2010</xref>), a rapid progression of the disease in the early days of the epidemic that resulted in high mortality rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732312469463">Deschamps, Fitzgerald, Pape, &amp; Johnson, 2000</xref>; Gaillard et al.), and government policies that increased access to care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312469463">Mukherjee, Ivers, Leandre, Farmer, &amp; Behforouz, 2006</xref>) while making blood transfusions safer (Gaillard et al.).</p>
<p>Several studies conducted before the earthquake established the salience of structural factors in successful HIV care in Haiti. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732312469463">Castro and Farmer (2005)</xref> documented the manner in which economic hardship and difficulty accessing health services posed serious challenges to HIV treatment. They found that interventions addressing these structural challenges not only allowed PLWHA more access to the health care system, but also reduced HIV-related stigma and increased HIV knowledge among Haitians. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312469463">Mukherjee and colleagues (2006)</xref> found that high adherence could be maintained through structural interventions such as waiving medical fees, making available free medicine and nutritional support, and establishing a network of health care workers providing psychosocial services. In 2002, the Haitian government launched an initiative to expand HIV care in the country, which led to the establishment of 68 sites providing antiretroviral therapy, 117 sites addressing the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, a national HIV monitoring system, and a national network of PLWHA to serve as advocates, peer counselors, and advisors to the government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312469463">UNAIDS, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>A major HIV care initiative was implemented by the Haitian Study Group on Kaposi’s Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections (GHESKIO), which was initiated by U.S. scholars as the world’s first study on AIDS-related opportunistic infections. GHESKIO and Partners in Health (PIH), the organization started by the prominent HIV scholar and advocate Paul Farmer, became the government’s principal partners in HAART provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732312469463">Cohen, 2006</xref>). Scholars have documented a reduction from 30% to 10% in mother-to-child HIV transmission in response to interventions implemented among clients attending GHESKIO clinics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312469463">Malow et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, a significant increase in people accessing HAART in rural public clinics was attributed to PIH’s initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312469463">Mukherjee et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these advances, HIV care in Haiti was hampered by several challenges even before the earthquake. In 2007, UNAIDS estimated that only 41% of those who needed HAART were actually receiving it, with almost 32,000 who needed treatment not receiving the medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312469463">UNAIDS, 2010</xref>). The proportion of untreated PLWHA in Haiti was still among the highest in the Western hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312469463">President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, 2008</xref>) and was hampered by poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312469463">Mukherjee et al., 2006</xref>), food insecurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732312469463">Fawzi et al. 2010</xref>), and violence directed against PLWHA, especially women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732312469463">Malow et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1049732312469463">
<title>Postearthquake HIV Care</title>
<p>Communities affected by natural disasters are often characterized by severely compromised HIV service systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732312469463">Clark et al., 2006</xref>), as well as high rates of mental illness and substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732312469463">Reilly, Clark, Schmidt, Benight, &amp; Kissinger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732312469463">Wagner et al., 2009</xref>), all of which have been found to reduce adherence to HAART among PLWHA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732312469463">Altice, Kamarulzaman, Soriano, Schechter, &amp; Friedland, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732312469463">Bruce &amp; Altice, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732312469463">Starace et al., 2002</xref>). Reports on the success of HIV care efforts in postearthquake Haiti have been mixed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312469463">Pape and colleagues (2010)</xref> reported that in GHESKIO’s Port-au-Prince clinic, 85% of the 6,000 AIDS patients receiving care before the earthquake had returned for care. A report put out by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated that antiretroviral procurement and distribution had been working effectively in Haiti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732312469463">CDC, 2010</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732312469463">President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (2008)</xref> partners reported providing services to more than 90% of their clients, despite constraints such as operating out of tents and mobile clinics (CDC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732312469463">Koenig et al, 2010</xref>). One year after the earthquake, UNAIDS reported that HIV prevention and treatment services were “back on track” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312469463">UNAIDS, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Other reports, however, painted a grimmer picture. Though provisional tent clinics were established in various communities, 2 months after the crisis, Haiti’s Ministry of Health estimated that less than 40% of the 24,000 who were in treatment prior to the earthquake had resumed care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732312469463">UNAIDS, 2010</xref>). In GHESKIO’s clinic, an average of only 32 HIV tests were being conducted every day, compared to 120 preearthquake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732312469463">Pape et al., 2010</xref>). There is, however, a dearth of knowledge about HIV care in communities finding it hard to access institutional care centers operated by GHESKIO and the government. In particular, very little is known about how PLWHA are accessing and utilizing care in Haiti’s encampments.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>We conducted an ethnography of an encampment community in Port-au-Prince. A Haitian member of the research team (Edner Boucicaut) had been living in a tent in one of the encampments since the earthquake. Two of the U.S. investigators (Charles King and Toorjo Ghose) stayed in the encampment at different times during the research for periods ranging from 2 weeks to 4 months. For the analysis we drew on our field notes as well as in-depth, semistructured interviews conducted with 33 HIV-positive encampment residents receiving HAART, and 12 HIV service providers working in a community HIV clinic serving the encampment. Interviews were conducted in 2010–2011, about a year after the earthquake. Institutional review board approval was obtained from the organization managing the clinic and the relevant U.S. university.</p>
<sec id="section5-1049732312469463">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Given that we were interested in studying the needs of PLWHA and the state of services in the tent communities in which they were residing, we utilized purposive sampling to recruit the first wave of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 10) from the HIV community clinic serving the encampment. We used snowball sampling methods to recruit the next wave of PLWHA residing in the encampment, whereby participants referred other tent residents with HIV receiving HAART to the study. The final sample included 19 women and 14 men among PLWHA, as well as 8 women and 4 men among clinic staff. The average age of participants was 26 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1049732312469463">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>Participants were interviewed in Creole (by a trained Haitian researcher) and English (by Haitian and U.S. researchers). Interviews in Creole were translated into English and transcribed for textual analysis. The computer software application N6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732312469463">QSR International, 2007</xref>) was used to analyze the data. We utilized a grounded theory approach to code the interviews and notes, with concepts that emerged from the data informing the coding of subsequent interviews and data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732312469463">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967</xref>). We terminated data collection when theoretical saturation was reached; i.e., when new analytical concepts ceased to emerge from interviews (Guest, Bunce, &amp; Johnson, 2009). Primary codes were identified by the first author and verified by the other authors. Axial codes were then identified by each of the authors and verified by the team. Four primary and 15 axial codes emerged from the data.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We found that living conditions in the tent communities presented multiple challenges to PLWHA, and posed serious barriers to their ability to adhere to their medication regimens.</p>
<sec id="section8-1049732312469463">
<title>Conditions in the Encampments</title>
<p>The earthquake resulted in a significant proportion of Haiti’s population becoming homeless overnight, leading to high levels of crisis in the urban tent communities in Port-au-Prince. Discussing the challenges of the tenuous financial situation in which they found themselves, two participants noted the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>People who financially supported me died in the earthquake. I have two kids I can no longer provide for, not even the basic stuff they need. This makes them frustrated at me, and I start to get angry at them. At the end of the day, this situation often becomes unmanageable.</p>
<p>I am a single mother of two and the only one who can provide [my children] with what they need. Those who used to help me, including my husband, have all died in the earthquake. Living in such conditions makes me feel so frustrated and defeated.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The crisis of becoming suddenly homeless was compounded by the poor living conditions in the tent communities. Cramped and temporary conditions with few utilities or amenities severely undermined the quality of life of participants. Echoing the feelings of almost everyone in the sample, three participants described the hardships they faced in the tents:
<disp-quote>
<p>This small tent can only accommodate two people, but six of us are packed like sardines inside because we have nowhere else to sleep. It’s like being trapped in a jail cell. This is certainly not how human beings should live.</p>
<p>There are so many mosquitoes, no electricity, no drinking water, no nothing. When I was living under my own roof, I had a radio, a TV to entertain myself a little bit. Now every day is a boring day. The day just does not end.</p>
<p>If I could find a word more appropriate than “hard,” I would use it to describe my life after the earthquake. I am not used to being homeless, to living like this. And I see no end in sight.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Given the temporary nature of tents and their poor quality, exposure to the elements was a major challenge for participants. The risk of infection associated with this level of exposure was particularly worrisome for participants, given their HIV-positive status. One participant noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>An HIV-infected person shouldn’t sleep under the stars because of the unpredictable weather. When it rains, the entire tent floods. I spend the whole night sitting outside, and it is very dangerous for my health. If I catch a cold, it could be deadly for me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The lack of permanent shelter also exposed PLWHA to the scrutiny of fellow encampment residents. The resulting lack of privacy was a significant challenge for women in the camps, who were routinely forced to complete their ablutions in public. Complaining about the indignity of being exposed to public scrutiny, one woman stated, “There’s a space behind my tent to take a shower in the open. My children and I use this pot you can fill with water and stand in, in the absence of a real bathroom.” Mirroring her discomfort, another woman noted, “You stand anywhere with a bucket of water. It’s shameful for a woman to have to do this. You lose your dignity and your privacy, but you have no choice.”</p>
<p>The lack of privacy was particularly difficult for participants who had historically struggled with being stigmatized as PLWHA and being part of the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community. One participant noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>When HIV symptoms started to show up, like pimples, diarrhea, hair loss, weight loss, people became suspicious in this encampment. Even though I look healthier now because of my medications, they still look at me with such disdain, as if my HIV status were as contagious as leprosy. I feel so embarrassed, so humiliated.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Describing the harassment he faced for self-identifying as gay, one HIV-positive camp resident complained,
<disp-quote>
<p>Everyone knows everyone’s business here. There’s no hiding. They know I’m HIV positive and gay. If I participate in any sports or cultural activities in this camp, I become the main attraction and people fling abuse at me. They even throw stones, alcohol, or dirty water at me. It’s hell.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such behavior was not restricted merely to camp neighbors. Complaining about the stigma she was subjected to in hospitals, one participant noted, “They keep people apart based on their health status. Those who are HIV infected don’t sit down in the same row with those who are not.” Unequal treatment in the health service agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) then operating in Haiti was a major concern for participants, given their dependency on these facilities for medication and basic provisions. Echoing the thoughts of many participants concerned about the dwindling services received in these facilities, one participant noted, “Right after the earthquake, some NGOs provided this camp with basic food, water, and even some cash through the cash-for-work activities. Unfortunately, it didn’t last long.”</p>
<p>A significant number of participants described coercive interactions with relief workers. Recalling their experiences immediately following the earthquake, two participants noted:
<disp-quote>
<p>It wasn’t easy at all to find this tent. Sometimes, women had to prostitute themselves and have sex with aid committee members or have contacts with powerful guys in the aid organizations to find a tent. We have no choice.</p>
<p>As a woman you have to either have sex or pay the relief committee member to get food distributed by the NGOs in this camp. It’s too humiliating. I would rather starve to death than prostitute myself for some grains of rice.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Encampment residents thus negotiated significant challenges that included postearthquake trauma, a heightened exposure to the elements, a lack of privacy, harassment at the hands of camp neighbors and agency workers, and an inability to have basic needs met by NGOs and other agencies. We found that these elements posed significant challenges to accessing and adhering to HIV medication. PLWHA described three types of challenges to accessing and staying adherent in the camps: (a) the psychosocial challenges of attempting to survive in the tent communities, (b) the logistical problems associated with postearthquake living conditions, and (c) the structural challenges linked to the postearthquake political economy of health care and aid in Haiti.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732312469463">
<title>Psychosocial Barriers to Access and Adherence</title>
<p>The stigma associated with being HIV positive, combined with the lack of privacy in the camps, posed considerable hardships for PLWHA attempting to take their medication. Participants were often driven out of their original camps because of their HIV status. Two of them recalled the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>I had to unexpectedly move out [of my tent] because the person who owned the tent realized that I had become skeletal and made frequent visits to GHESKIO. He said he couldn’t live with an HIV-infected person. I felt totally helpless.</p>
<p>People who know or have their suspicions about me are always pointing fingers at me. It makes me feel bad and worthless. I was in another camp before moving here. I left it because of constant stigmatization from people around me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This forced itinerant status amplified levels of chaos in the lives of PLWHA and undermined their access to medication, significantly increasing their risk of nonadherence. Later in this article we document the logistical challenges posed by the stigma directed at PLWHA in our study. Here however, we call attention to the feelings of helplessness, worthlessness, and depression expressed by the participants. Stigma, harassment, and the trauma of living in the camps combined to pose a serious threat to the mental health of PLWHA. Describing the toll on her mental well-being that her living conditions had extracted, one participant stated, “I can’t think. I feel myself small, shriveled, reduced to an insignificant human being.” Feelings of hopelessness and despair were common themes in the narratives of participants. One evocatively summed up her depression by stating, “My life has become a no-life after the earthquake. My life looks like an empty desert. I sometimes think about suicide.”</p>
<p>Scholars have noted the barrier to adherence that mental illness—and specifically depression—poses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732312469463">Mugavero et al., 2006</xref>). We found evidence of this in our study, with participants enunciating their lack of motivation to access or stay adherent in the face of debilitating life circumstances. One woman participant noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>I often don’t even want to get out of this tent. I don’t have any motivation most days to do anything, leave alone walk to the center to get my meds [medications]. What’s the use of meds when your life is lived like this [gesturing to the tents]?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mirroring this sense of despair, another participant stated, “I cry a lot. I get lost in my head and often forget to keep to the recommended schedule. I often miss doses.” In fact, missing doses became a way to fulfill some participants’ suicidal ideations. One participant noted, “I know missing doses will eventually kill me. I don’t want to live anyway, and I deliberately miss doses now so the end can come sooner.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732312469463">
<title>Logistical Challenges to Access and Adherence</title>
<p>While psychosocial challenges undermined participants’ motivation to remain healthy, material barriers posed logistical hardships that threatened access and adherence to their medication regimen.</p>
<sec id="section11-1049732312469463">
<title>Transportation</title>
<p>In a city where roads remained severely mangled by the earthquake, and the burden of public transportation fell on the few small-engine minibuses called tap-taps, transportation posed a serious challenge to PLWHA attempting to reach clinics. Describing the difficulties they encountered in keeping appointments to pick up their medicine, two participants noted:
<disp-quote>
<p>I am often late for my HAART medication appointments because I have no money to pay for transportation. I then walk and it’s very far to the center. It’s not feasible for me to do this, so I end up missing appointments.</p>
<p>When I have money and I am tired, I do the best I can to go on public transportation even though it sometimes takes me two hours just to find a seat in a bus. But most of the time, I walk, and on the days I just can’t, I miss my appointments.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At a time when the enterprise of survival was hard enough for most encampment residents, walking long distances to fill their prescriptions became a major barrier that many PLWHA were unable to negotiate. One participant stated with resignation, “It takes all my energy. I’d rather preserve it to get food and water every day.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1049732312469463">
<title>Food insecurity</title>
<p>Participants struggled to secure food and water on a daily basis. Given the fact that HAART pills need to be ingested with food, the inability to eat regularly was a major barrier to adherence. Describing the risk of taking the medicine on an empty stomach, one participant noted, “When you take HAART, you need to eat normally. When I take the meds without eating, I feel dizzy, and fall down and faint sometimes.” Many participants admitted to not taking their medicine when they went hungry, which was often. For some, even securing water was a challenge. A participant stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes it is very difficult to find drinking water to be able to take the meds with. When you’re lucky enough to find some water, it’s not clean and can jeopardize your health. You can still buy drinking water in this area, but finding money is another story.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Adherence, therefore, was intimately intertwined with the threats to basic sustenance that participants faced daily. Describing this relationship, a nurse at one of the community HIV clinics recalled,
<disp-quote>
<p>We had this patient who refused to take his meds. All of us were getting frustrated, thinking it was a matter of communication—that he just didn’t understand the importance of adherence. Then we found out that he didn’t have food to take the meds with. We really need to address malnutrition and food security simultaneously with HIV care here.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Scholars have found that food insecurity is one of the most significant challenges to successful HIV care in resource-poor settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732312469463">Fawzi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312469463">Sylvie et al., 2011</xref>). Providing further evidence of this, our results indicate that making food and potable water available to encampment residents was crucial to maintaining adherence among PLWHA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732312469463">
<title>Exposed conditions</title>
<p>The exposed living conditions and the lack of privacy that were features of tent life presented significant barriers to HAART adherence. Even the simple task of storing medicine became difficult for PLWHA. One participant noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>I share my tent with four others and keep my pills in an unmarked bag so that no one knows what they are. The bag gets thrown out often because people just think it is junk. I’m left without medicine then.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Recounting the difficulty of protecting the pills from the elements, another participant stated, “In the rain, when everything gets flooded, we sit outside the tents. Everything inside gets wet. My pills have often become soggy and impossible to take.”</p>
<p>The constant exposure to the scrutiny of others, combined with the stigma of being HIV positive, posed additional barriers for participants. Pill ingestion forced PLWHA out of the HIV “closet,” leaving them vulnerable to stigma and discrimination. One participant said,
<disp-quote>
<p>One of my kids once told me that our neighbors started asking him questions about why I take so many pills. This puts me in a very embarrassing situation about taking my pills. I have to hide somewhere or go inside the latrines.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Several participants expressed a similar sense of frustration about the lack of privacy in the camps and the barrier it posed to adhering to their regimen. Describing the manner in which this exposure exacerbated the stigma of taking pills, one participant noted, “I can’t take my medications freely. I have to hide like a leper, even though I’m not contagious, and cannot easily contaminate people.” Describing the sense of being on display because of the exposed conditions, another stated, “I always feel like somebody is watching me when taking my medications. I don’t feel comfortable at all taking them. There are so many people around me. It’s really frustrating.” The camp environment had shorn PLWHA of basic elements that helped them stay adherent to their regimen: the ability to store their medicine properly and ingest it in private. HAART pills became a problematic identifier in an environment where PLWHA faced discrimination and worse. Far from keeping them safe, adherence in these exposed conditions exacerbated the risk environment for PLWHA.</p>

<title>The Political Economy of Aid: Barriers and Facilitating Factors</title>
<p>We found that structural barriers undermined access to care for PLWHA in the tent communities. The systemic barriers to access that emerged from our data were rooted in the political and economic structure of aid and health care in the country, a system we refer to as the political economy of aid in postearthquake Haiti. Analyzing the humanitarian and developmental interventions implemented by NGOs in Haiti during its transition to democracy in the early 1990s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312469463">James (2010)</xref> enunciated the contours of a political economy of trauma, whereby those with particular types of trauma narratives benefited from the aid dispensed by NGOs and the state. James noted that the logic of legitimacy inscribed into this system of aid dispensation differentiated between classes of citizens and amplified iniquity among Haitians.</p>
<p>We argue that the political economy of aid in postearthquake Haiti had similar characteristics and spawned significant consequences. First, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732312469463">James’s (2010)</xref> account, existing social inequalities were exacerbated through the favoring of privileged Haitians connected to personnel in dispensing agencies, and the simultaneous marginalization of unconnected patients, many of whom resided in tent communities. Second, the aid circulated in certain sectors of Haitian society, bypassing communities such as encampment residents who were in most need of help. Finally, we found evidence of an emerging resistance to this system through the development of local, community-based institutions of care that had the potential to become an important element of the postearthquake political economy of aid in Haiti.</p>
<sec id="section15-1049732312469463">
<title>Challenges of bias and favoritism</title>
<p>The lack of responsiveness of major aid agencies to the plight of camp residents documented earlier in the article was reflected in the manner in which medical institutions engaged with PLWHA. Describing the way they were targeted because of their HIV status, two participants stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>There are a lot of difficulties with receiving meds at GHESKIO. We are despised and poorly treated by the nurses. Sometimes, they yell at us and humiliate us for being HIV positive—and all because they are giving us something that belongs to us, HIV infected people, not to them.</p>
<p>Often, I have problems, particularly at GHESKIO. Going there for my medication is like knocking on hell’s door. People look at you as if you were an animal. Some nurses, not all of them, talk to me and others with HIV with disdain.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732312469463">Sylvie and colleagues (2011)</xref> found that in resource-poor settings, a dearth of staff with the ability to provide psychosocial support or medical follow-ups significantly reduced adherence among clients at medical centers dispensing HAART. Significant barriers to accessing HAART were created by biased staff who subjected PLWHA, who were already struggling with the trauma of the earthquake, to further indignities.</p>
<p>Participants routinely expressed the suspicion that in the calculus of worth at institutional centers, they seldom scored highly. One participant noted, “We really don’t matter to them. Sometimes I spend the entire day waiting in line at GHESKIO.” Describing the manner in which favoritism at institutions dispensing HAART had affected them, two participants stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>I am always on time but they don’t give the medications on a first-come, first-served basis. Favoritism rules there, and since I don’t know people on the inside, I am a victim and often don’t get my medications, or get them really late.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get there at six a.m. and stay until two p.m. No one gives you your medication. Services are not provided on a first-come, first-served basis at the center. If you have a friend or someone in your family working for them, you get served first. I’ve got used to this system, but there are many days when I can’t stay all day and can’t get my medicine.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Among tent residents we interviewed, there was a palpable sense of being treated as second-class citizens in these institutions. Access and adherence were thus undermined by the manner in which institutions engaged with PLWHA in encampments.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1049732312469463">
<title>Segregation of aid</title>
<p>A year after the earthquake, most relief and aid organizations were reporting that they had spent only about a third of the money that came pouring in immediately after the disaster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732312469463">Bello, 2010</xref>). Although we observed the presence of many local and international NGOs in Port-au-Prince, their lack of engagement with the encampments was noticeable. With the possible exception of an initiative implemented by PIH in collaboration with the Haitian Ministry of Health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312469463">Adams, 2010</xref>), medical services did not appear to be reaching refugee settlements. Giving voice to our own observations, one clinic client asked, “Where are all the HIV agencies, all the funds? Look around you in this camp. Apart from this clinic, you won’t see one bit of aid helping those of us who have HIV.” Criticizing the processes of this aid economy that had sprung up in postearthquake Haiti, a physician in the clinic noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>Most of the foreign money goes to organizations such as Red Cross and GHESKIO, which employ upper-class Haitians who have little knowledge of, or sympathy for, the poor. Not only does this ensure poor care for community members, it also means that all that aid is just being restricted to those who can access these centers. Very little benefits our camp residents.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A leading HIV advocate living in an encampment, and one of the founders of the community coalition described later in this article, voiced similar reservations about institutional care and aid agencies:
<disp-quote>
<p>People have to wait six to seven hours just to pick up their meds at these hospitals. GHESKIO has no primary care or psychosocial services. The bank that the Global Fund used to deposit its aid in was just involved in a scandal—bank officials were buying SUVs [sport/utility vehicles] and making loans to people with that money. The Global Fund had to stop using the bank. We know that only about thirteen percent of the aid actually reached people. Most of it goes into overheads and salaries.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A clinic staff member described the manner in which tent residents were barred from care in institutional settings funded by international aid:
<disp-quote>
<p>All that money just goes to help people with money—not those living in these camps. The other day, a client in this clinic was about to deliver and needed to be seen immediately. They wouldn’t even let us into the hospital, forget about seeing her. And this is the hospital with all the aid, all the foreign volunteer doctors. I had to drive the clinic car up on the pavement, barricade the entrance so no one else could get in, and make a scene about this unfair treatment before they let her in.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Haitian government was cast as a collaborator in this process, colluding with international aid agencies and relinquishing the task of developing health service capacity within the country. Broken walls all over Port-au-Prince were painted with graffiti criticizing the government and the various bodies of the United Nations that were operating in the country. One clinic staff member angrily declaimed, “The Ministry of Health needs to stop working only with these foreign aid agencies and the U.N. [United Nations], who are getting fat while people are dying in the camps.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1049732312469463">
<title>Creating alternative institutions</title>
<p>The critiques voiced by the participants fueled efforts to establish community-based coalitions seeking to develop local institutions of care within encampment communities. We were able to witness one such effort at community resource development in the encampments we were studying. When initially assessing the tent communities involved in this research, we found that the clinic where we eventually recruited some of the participants was one of the few located in the neighborhood providing medical as well as psychosocial services to tent residents, and the only one providing HIV services. The clinic was operated by a community coalition that comprised 15 HIV service providers, residents of tent communities in the two hardest-hit cities of Port-au-Prince and St. Marc, and two United States-based HIV service providers with extensive experience working with Haitian communities in the United States.</p>
<p>Initially started by the coalition as a tent-based clinic immediately after the earthquake, it had moved into a more permanent facility and was staffed by a medical doctor and nurses. It was one of two run by the coalition, with the other catering to a similar clientele of tent residents in St. Marc. While we were in Haiti, the coalition organized a week-long workshop where the staff members of the two clinics were trained by service providers from Haiti and the United States in providing HIV services and adherence support to PLWHA. Describing her experience in the workshops, a clinic staff member stated,
<disp-quote>
<p>As a nurse I’ve been trained in primary care settings. This is the first time I am receiving HIV-specific training. It’s different that this clinic is in the community. I notice how together and united everyone is. I feel like I can ask questions here and discuss HIV situations because everyone here in this room is a community member.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As a research team, we lived in tents in one of the encampments along with most of the clinic staff and the community. During the training workshop, when staff members of both the clinics were gathered together in the Port-au-Prince site, we noticed that some of the most illuminating discussions about HIV care occurred in the evenings, when people congregated socially outside their tents. Conversations among nurses, physicians, and community advocates often focused on the difficulty of serving the needs of women who had been sexually abused; sex workers operating in the “red light” areas that had emerged in the tent communities; children (known as <italic>Restaveks</italic>) who served as indentured servants for some tent owners; and gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered clients in the encampment communities. Referring to the manner in which the clinic and its operation was embedded in community life, one staff member pointed out, “These stigmatized social issues are not addressed outside these tents. They are real for us because we see them around us.” Similarly, another staff member argued,
<disp-quote>
<p>There’s a real need for HIV resources in the community. People living here do not have access to the hospitals or the Red Cross centers. . . . They have no idea what we’re dealing with here. Our coalition came together to address those needs.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Members of the coalition attended meetings with international organizations such as the Red Cross and government agencies to communicate to them the importance of addressing the health issues of encampment communities. The coalition had approached the Ministry of Health to secure permission to make HAART available in its clinics; however, it did not find a willing partner in the government. One staff member noted,
<disp-quote>
<p>The Ministry of Health is worried about community clinics actually being managed by PLWHA. We submitted registration papers to supply HAART to them six months ago and have been given the run-around [have not received a straightforward answer] constantly. They have now started to register us—but that’s only because we have openly challenged what they are doing for HIV-positive people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the initial resistance from the government, the coalition persevered in seeking licensing to dispense HAART locally, and at the time of writing this, believed it was close to being granted. The emergence of locally operated centers of service provision has been documented by other scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312469463">Adams, 2010</xref>), and is a feature of the postearthquake political economy of aid that might become vital to the success of future interventions for PLWHA in Haiti’s encampments.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The living conditions in encampments posed significant psychosocial, logistical, and structural challenges to accessing and staying adherent to HAART (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732312469463">Figure 1</xref>). The complex environment of tent communities called for the implementation of interventions at multiple levels to ensure access and adherence. Specifically, policies and clinical interventions needed to focus on individual-level hurdles, logistical challenges, and structural barriers to HIV care.</p>

<title>Confronting Individual-Level Barriers</title>
<p>Mental health support needs to be provided to tent communities to address the trauma, isolation, depression, and suicidality documented in this research. Interventions need to address the psychosocial fallout of the earthquake as well as the consequences of being marked as diseased residents of tent communities. An effective first step might be to extend to the tent communities the network of trained community health workers that proved to be crucial to successful HIV care in preearthquake rural Haiti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312469463">Mukherjee et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, future collaborations between Haitian community-based organizations and U.S. research and service institutions need to focus on translating mental health interventions to the Haitian context, as well as developing the capacity in these encampment communities to implement them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1049732312469463">
<title>Confronting Logistical Barriers</title>
<p>Transportation hurdles, a lack of privacy, limited access to food and clean water, as well as the difficulty of storing medicine in small tents presented significant logistical challenges to adherence. Interventions need to prioritize the material conditions of encampments. Given that adherence was tied inextricably to stable and permanent shelter, a long-term goal would be to move tent residents into stable housing. Recently, the research team witnessed initiatives by the Haitian government to reduce the size of refugee encampments by relocating residents to other neighborhoods, many of which had been reduced to rubble, without simultaneously providing housing for them. This has had the effect of breaking large encampments into several smaller ones and redistributing tent residents to areas that are less safe, and more inaccessible to care. Ultimately, many of the logistical barriers to adherence documented in this research can only be adequately addressed by rebuilding the housing infrastructure of the county.</p>
<p>Many of the adherence challenges for PLWHA can be addressed at the point of HAART distribution. Clinics, hospitals, and centers distributing HAART currently need to reestablish the services offered under the HIV Equity Initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732312469463">Farmer et al., 2001</xref>) in preearthquake rural Haiti, including safe spaces for PLWHA to take their medication and participate in directly observed therapy, transportation subsidies, nutritional food supplements, and peers as case managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312469463">Mukherjee et al., 2006</xref>). Otherwise, the success of initiatives to restore HAART access will be illusory, because adherence will continue to be impeded by logistical factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1049732312469463">
<title>Confronting Structural Hurdles</title>
<p>The political economy of aid that emerged in postearthquake Haiti presented significant challenges to access and adherence through iniquities in service provision and distribution of aid. Although international aid and medical agencies have undoubtedly been influential in fighting the epidemic, the results sound a warning about the manner in which they are perceived by marginalized tent residents. Scholars have critiqued the manner in which the international welfare regime steps in to manage the basic needs of people in resource-poor settings, noting that the move allows the government to retreat from providing services, undermines civil society processes, and promotes dependency among marginalized communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732312469463">Chatterjee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732312469463">Glick Schiller &amp; Fouron, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In Haiti, in particular, scholars have argued that the proliferation of NGOs has undermined the state’s governance capacity, created high-paying jobs for educated middle-class citizens, widened class divides between NGO workers and their clients, and created institutional barriers against local participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732312469463">Louis-Juste, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732312469463">Schuller, 2009</xref>). Our results indicate that the prominent role of NGOs and international aid agencies in the distribution of scarce resources such as HAART might have created a system of patronage that exacerbated existing iniquities in Haitian society. Stigmatized and impoverished PLWHA appeared to be at a disadvantage when accessing care through these agencies.</p>
<p>The emergence of initiatives to develop resources within encampments was a positive feature of the political economy of aid and services in postearthquake Haiti. The discourse framing these efforts was critical of institutional aid and services, and as a result, might lead to increased monitoring of institutional processes to ensure fairness in care provision in the future. Given the barriers faced by PLWHA at institutional health care centers currently, efforts to make HIV care locally available would significantly improve the context of care for PLWHA in encampments. The community-based initiative that operated the clinic described in this research mirrored the postearthquake efforts of an organization such as PIH, which initiated efforts to build community resources by hiring locally and training community members to provide HIV services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732312469463">Adams, 2010</xref>). Moreover, prior to the earthquake, PIH had partnered with the Ministry of Health to marry HIV services (including HAART provision) with primary care at public clinics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732312469463">Mukherjee et al., 2006</xref>). The success of this initiative, and the effective adoption of similar measures in the encampment clinic studied in this research, speaks to the need to support efforts to expand the number of community-run public clinics operating in encampments.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Haiti’s postearthquake encampments faced several challenges, including unhygienic and cramped living spaces, exposure to the elements, a lack of privacy, unavailability of food and clean water, and being underserved by poorly functioning aid agencies. These conditions posed several barriers to accessing and staying adherent to HAART. The stigma of being HIV positive was amplified in the camps, undermining participants’ mental health and their motivations to stay adherent. The camp conditions presented logistical challenges to accessing medical care, storing pills, and ingesting them privately. Finally, camp residents were subjected to biased and unfair treatment at major HAART-dispensing centers, while international aid and government interventions failed to address the compromised health conditions in the encampments. A positive feature of the camps was the emergence of alternative local medical service provision that expanded the treatment options available to camp residents. Our results indicate that interventions need to address the psychosocial, logistical, and structural challenges facing PLWHA in the encampment communities, and build on initiatives to increase local HIV service provision capacity.</p>
