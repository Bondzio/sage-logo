<p>“<italic>FAS</italic> is based on clinical research, but we also recognize that surgical and clinical practices change rapidly and clinical research appropriately lags 1 to 2 years behind new techniques.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Since its inception, <italic>Foot &amp; Ankle Specialist</italic> (<italic>FAS</italic>) has been dedicated to delivering interesting content to our readers beyond the very important clinical research that is the foundation of the journal. <italic>FAS</italic> has provided controversial and pertinent clinical information with our columns: Roundtable Discussion (which has been consistently our most popular column), Evolving Techniques, Master Surgeon, International Perspectives, and Technology in the Profession.</p>
<p>Greg Berlet and I recognize that there is an opportunity in a foot and ankle peer-reviewed journal for a column to reflect current techniques in the foot and ankle clinical practice. As already pointed out, <italic>FAS</italic> is based on clinical research, but we also recognize that surgical and clinical practices change rapidly and clinical research appropriately lags 1 to 2 years behind new techniques. Nonetheless, those changes and innovations can provide great benefits and advantages to practitioners and their patients today. We have decided to introduce a column, “Current Trends in Foot and Ankle Surgery.”</p>
<p>We feel that this will be a hugely popular component of <italic>FAS</italic>, for both submitting authors and readers. It is our belief that <italic>FAS</italic> will provide an outlet for surgeons to share their evolving wisdom with colleagues from around the world, which can only advance foot and ankle surgery as a whole in this uniquely peer-reviewed and Pubmed-indexed column.</p>
<p>Anand Vora, MD, has accepted our invitation to serve as the Section Editor for Current Trends in Foot and Ankle Surgery. Dr Vora brings great intellect and experience to this position. He is a fellowship-trained orthopedic surgeon who practices in Chicagoland with Illinois Bone and Joint Institute. Dr Vora is well published and regularly lectures in the United States and worldwide and is extremely enthusiastic about the opportunity to develop this new aspect of <italic>FAS</italic>. On the following page, Dr Vora will introduce and share his vision for the column.</p>
<p>We are extremely excited to take this new angle at <italic>FAS</italic>. Our enduring commitment to you, our readers, is to provide not only the best in clinical research but also interesting content that is provocative, thought provoking, and ultimately improves the care of the foot and ankle patient. We hope that you will enjoy this new aspect of <italic>FAS</italic> and invite those of you who have new and interesting clinical practices or surgical techniques to submit your work for this column.</p>
