<abstract>
<p>Since the introduction of parental leave in Sweden a more gender-equal division of such leave has been targeted. In 1995 one month was reserved for each parent, implying that the month was forfeited if not used by the same parent. A second month was reserved in 2002. In 2008, a gender equality bonus was introduced, meaning that tax credits were given to parents who shared the leave equally. This study investigates the effects of these reforms on parental leave use by means of a difference-in-difference approach with parents of children born just before and just after the introduction of each reform. We use register data from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, which include all parents residing in Sweden. The results indicate a strong effect on parental leave use resulting from the introduction of the first reserved month, a more modest but clear effect resulting from the second reserved month and, so far, no effect resulting from the gender equality bonus. Possible interpretations of the results are that (1) reserved time may be more effective than an economic bonus, (2) change from low levels of use may be easier and (3) reforms may matter most when they are first introduced.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>An overarching goal of the Swedish parental leave system has been to enable shared care of and economic responsibility for children; in other words, these policies promote gender equality in the division of parenthood. A number of reforms of the leave policies have attempted to strengthen this goal by encouraging fathers’ use of leave. In this study we compare the impact of three reforms in the parental leave system aiming at gender-equal leave use on men’s and women’s parental leave use, but through different means. Our ambition is to draw conclusions regarding which policies were effective in changing the leave use in a more gender-equal direction. The question of how to involve fathers in childcare is highly relevant in Sweden but also in Europe, where, among other things, EU directives in this area are debated.</p>
<p>Fathers in Sweden are encouraged to take an active role in childcare by state intervention, and an earner–carer model is dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0958928712440201">Gornick and Meyers, 2008</xref>). The motives behind the goal of gender equality in parental leave use are long-term gender equality regarding the division of household work (including childcare) and an improved position of women in the Swedish labour market. Lately, the importance of children’s access to both parents has been emphasized as well. In addition, gender equality regarding the use of parental leave is sometimes seen as a way to enable men and women to have the number of children they desire. Gender-equal parental leave use may thus be seen as part of policies that are associated with higher fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0958928712440201">McDonald 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0958928712440201">Neyer, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the introduction of parental leave the goal of a more gender-equal division has been largely unquestioned and various strategies to meet the goal have been implemented. In 1995, one month was reserved for each parent and was forfeited if not used by the same parent. The reservation of one month was followed by the reservation of a second in 2002. In 2008, a gender equality bonus was introduced, meaning that tax credits were given to parents who shared the leave equally. There are differences in how these reforms were introduced, which may lead to different expectations as to the effects of the reforms. Furthermore, it should be kept in mind that even if the reforms aim at the same goal they are part of political compromises where other goals are also taken into account. For example, two of the reforms are introduced together with a homecare allowance, aiming at more choice for parents. One reform is introduced together with increased generosity in leave length for both parents, thus not challenging the mother’s time at home. The reforms are also cumulative in that the second reserved month can only be introduced after the first, and the gender equality bonus builds on the two reserved months. All three reforms emphasize working parents’ equal rights whereas non-working parents are, to a large extent, excluded, indicating the importance of labour market participation for all groups in Sweden. The reforms, furthermore, strive for a gender-neutral responsibility for children by strengthening fathers’ right to leave.</p>
<p>This study investigates and compares these reforms’ impact on the division of parental leave with the intention of contributing to knowledge on the consequences of various gender-egalitarian incentives. We therefore see the conclusions from this study as relevant to other countries’ goals of gender equality regarding childcare. The paper will start by introducing the Swedish parental leave system and its use, as well as a broader discussion of the three reforms, before data and methods are presented. The outcomes of the three reforms will be analysed and a discussion will follow on possible interpretations of the results.</p>

<sec id="section2-0958928712440201">
<title>Parental leave in Sweden</title>
<p>In 1974 Sweden introduced parental leave with earnings-related benefits paid for six months after childbirth, entitling parents to share leave as they prefer. The scheme is compulsory and covers everyone residing in Sweden. All employers contribute to the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0958928712440201">Duvander et al., 2010</xref>). The leave can be used until the child is eight years old. The specific aim was to facilitate the combination of work and caring for children. The question of fathers’ participation in leave use was part of the debate from the beginning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0958928712440201">Klinth, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The earnings-related benefit was set at 90% of previous earnings, but if the parent had no previous earnings he or she received a low flat rate. The set-up works as an incentive, especially for mothers, to enter the labour market before embarking on parenthood.</p>
<p>In the 1980s leave rights were extended by stages to 12 months, and, in addition, a further three months were paid at a flat rate. Cutbacks in earnings-related benefits, from 90% to 75%, were made during the economic crisis in the 1990s and were later raised to the current level of 80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0958928712440201">E.-A. Johansson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In 1995, one reserved month for each parent was introduced, which meant that one month would be forfeited if not used by the designated parent. At the same time, the additional leave was formally made individual, implying that the parent who wanted to use more than half of the leave needed the consent (by signature) of the other parent (except the reserved months, which are not possible to sign over to the other parent). The reform applies to all parents with joint custody, which is the absolute majority of parents in Sweden, and also to cases of separated or divorced parents. The liberal conservative government also introduced a flat-rate homecare allowance for children up to the age of three in the second half of 1994. The homecare allowance was abolished by the new social democratic government half a year later, but the reserved months, often called ‘daddy’ month and ‘mummy’ month, were kept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928712440201">Ferrarini and Duvander, 2010</xref>). Note that the reserved month is also the only reserved time for mothers, making it comparable to a maternity leave. The reserved month in Sweden came after a Norwegian equivalent daddy month in 1993, both considered radical at the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0958928712440201">Ellingsaeter, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2002, another reserved month for each parent was introduced, at the same time as the leave was extended by one month to 16 months (including flat-rate leave) by the social democratic government. The main difference between the first and second reserved months is that in 2002 a month was added to the leave length, meaning that an increase in one parent’s leave did not necessarily mean a decrease in the other parent’s leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928712440201">Ferrarini and Duvander, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2006, Sweden elected a new liberal conservative government, which, on 1 July 2008, introduced a gender equality bonus with the message to parents that the more the leave is shared, the more bonus they will receive. The bonus is a tax credit paid to parents’ tax account the year after the parental leave is used. The parent who has used the most parental leave days is entitled to the bonus if he or she works or studies when the other parent is using parental leave. For every day that the parents share the leave equally, a tax credit of 100 SEK (approximately 10 euros) will be received. It does not apply to the reserved months or the flat-rate days, and thus can be paid for a maximum of 4.5 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0958928712440201">Swedish Social Insurance Agency, 2010</xref>). The bonus is gender-neutral in its regulation but hardly in its implication as it encourages women to shorten their leave and men to extend their leave. Parents who have used the leave in a way that may entitle them to the gender equality bonus receive a letter from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency encouraging them to apply for the bonus. Simultaneously, the government also launched a homecare allowance for children up to three years old; its adoption by municipalities was voluntary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928712440201">Ferrarini and Duvander, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The first and second reserved months are similar in construction in that days are forfeited if parental leave is not shared, while the gender equality bonus gives the incentive of a tax credit for parents who use the leave in a gender-equal way. All three reforms stand out as forerunners in aiming for gender equality in the European setting. When the first month was introduced, there was an economic crisis in Sweden and unemployment had been increasing during the previous years. Fertility was decreasing and there was still variation in availability and quality of public daycare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0958928712440201">Andersson et al., 2004</xref>). When the second month was introduced the economic crisis of the 1990s had passed. A guarantee of daycare availability was set and the price standardized at a low level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928712440201">Ferrarini and Duvander, 2010</xref>). Fertility was increasing after the 1990s and since the mid 2000s it has been hovering around 1.8. The gender equality bonus was introduced when the financial crisis of 2008 hit Sweden as well as the rest of Europe. These different circumstances should be remembered when comparisons across reforms are made.</p>

<sec id="section3-0958928712440201">
<title>Use of parental leave</title>
<p>Parental leave is used by practically all mothers and by around 9 out of 10 fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0958928712440201">Duvander, 2008</xref>). For many parents, state-legislated benefits are complemented by extra benefits from the employer on the basis of collective agreements. The considerable flexibility of parental leave use is often exploited by parents; for example, by saving parts of leave to extend summer vacations or reduce working hours during the child’s preschool years. Also, leave may be extended by accepting a lower replacement level, a strategy used especially by mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0958928712440201">Eklund, 2004</xref>). When parental leave was introduced in 1974, men used 0.5% of all days. Since then, men’s share has increased, reaching 23.1% in 2010 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0958928712440201">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>When asked, parents often claim that economic considerations are most important for the division of leave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0958928712440201">Duvander, 2008</xref>). Also, large-scale studies show that both parents’ incomes are positively correlated to fathers’ leave use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0958928712440201">Hobson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0958928712440201">Sundström and Duvander, 2002</xref>). Workplace characteristics, such as men working in female- dominated workplaces and in workplaces where other fathers have used a lot of parental leave, have a positive impact on fathers’ leave (Bygren and Duvander, 2005). Employers’ attitudes are also influential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0958928712440201">Haas et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, individual factors such as age and education, the children’s birth order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0958928712440201">Sundström and Duvander, 2002</xref>) and parents’ country of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0958928712440201">Duvander and Eklund, 2006</xref>) are found to be influential.</p>
<p>Earlier studies indicated an increase in fathers’ use of parental leave after the introduction of both reserved months, but more so after the first reserved month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0958928712440201">Ekberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0958928712440201">Eriksson, 2005</xref>). An earlier study indicated no effect on fathers’ leave use 18 months after the introduction of the gender equality bonus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0958928712440201">M. Johansson, 2010</xref>). In this study, the effects of the three reforms are analysed at the same point in time, 24 months after the introduction of each reform. A majority of the parental leave days are used when the child is young (in this study 79–96% of the days with income-related benefits are used during the first 24 months, depending on when the sample is drawn). Analysing the effect of the reforms after the same duration, with the same sample selection and with the same control variables, may thus provide insights into how reforms operate and affect parents’ patterns of parental leave use.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0958928712440201">
<title>What is an efficient policy?</title>
<p>The above-mentioned three reforms aim at changing the incentives in the parental leave insurance to increase gender-equal use. Even if the question of parental leave division is clearly a question of social relations in which the father, the mother and their respective workplaces are influential, the stage is set by the institutional possibilities and political decisions to change the conditions. The response to the reforms will be coloured by the idea that care work is a female activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928712440201">England, 2005</xref>) as well as the prevalent forms of family life where and when the reforms are situated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928712440201">Strohmeier, 2002</xref>). We will use a free interpretation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0958928712440201">McDonald’s (2006b)</xref> principles of good family support for a broader discussion of the three reforms.</p>
<p>Perhaps, above all, all three reforms are part of a <italic>gender-neutral</italic> insurance encouraging childcare by both parents regardless of gender. However, in the typical case, the conditions of use of policy may make a gender-neutral legislation have gender-typical implications. All three reforms give incentives to counteract separate male and female activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928712440201">England, 2005</xref>). Reforms may change the division of parental leave, as well as have long-term effects on preferences for the same division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0958928712440201">Orloff, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Regarding <italic>fiscal costs</italic>, all three reforms involve larger costs for the insurance as fathers have higher earnings than mothers and therefore claim higher benefits. The later reforms are likely to cost more as they encourage the father to take a larger share of the leave. The anticipated returns are more abstract: child well-being and gender equality. Direct costs are, however, rarely brought up as an argument against the reforms, but administration costs are more likely to be targeted when the bonus is evaluated.</p>
<p>A common argument against reforms that encourage gender equality in parental leave insurance is that it encroaches on free choice. Introducing the reforms as part of packages including homecare allowance and extended leave means they have largely been <italic>politically accepted</italic> and not perceived as too radical. They may also be seen as political compromises, which may impact on the efficiency of the reforms. In addition, to add reforms to a system already in operation may limit the <italic>simplicity</italic> and <italic>transparency</italic> of the same system. Indeed, survey results tell us that sufficient knowledge of the system is lacking among parents, especially fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0958928712440201">Svensson, 2010</xref>). The idea of the reserved months is, nonetheless, easy to grasp whereas one of the major criticisms of the gender equality bonus is that it is difficult to disentangle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0958928712440201">Ferrarini and Duvander, 2010</xref>). If changes in the leave system occur often it may be perceived as unreliable and there may be less reason to believe the changes will last (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928712440201">Strohmeier, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>It should also be mentioned that the reforms target parents at different levels of use: the first reserved month encourages fathers to take any leave, the second reserved month encourages fathers to take more than one month and the bonus encourages fathers to take more than two months. The target group has thus changed over time in line with change in usage, but probably also in line with the change of the social norm of fatherhood.</p>
<p>In addition, the bonus increases <italic>horizontal equity</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0958928712440201">McDonald, 2006b</xref>: 219) between parents and other men and women, especially when we compare mothers with women without children, as it encourages mothers to go back to work earlier. Mothers’ earlier return to work is also beneficial to their <italic>lifetime earnings.</italic> The first reserved month and the bonus are more efficient in this respect as the second reserved month was added on and did not challenge mothers’ time at home. It remains to be investigated whether the reforms influenced the wage gap between mothers and other women, as well as between fathers and other men. However, men and women without work are practically left out, meaning that horizontal inequality may increase. Parents without custody are another group not benefiting from the reforms.</p>
<p>Lately, family policy in Sweden has been generally motivated by the <italic>importance of children</italic>. Even if parents’ care work is not generally stated as leading to a public good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928712440201">England, 2005</xref>), father involvement is generally seen as positive in terms of <italic>child development</italic>. Some studies lend support to the association between early father involvement and later father engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0958928712440201">Haas and Hwang, 2008</xref>) but the causality and selection aspects are rarely disentangled. Nevertheless, the importance of fathers’ care is strengthened by all three reforms, counteracting a devaluation perspective where care work associated with women is badly rewarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0958928712440201">England, 2005</xref>). Reserving months for each parent also meant that fathers’ capability to claim those months increased, in negotiations with both the mother and the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0958928712440201">Hobson and Fahlén, 2009</xref>). The gender equality bonus does not indicate increased ability to claim in the same way, as time with the child is not forfeited if the bonus is not used.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0958928712440201" sec-type="methods">
<title>Data and methodology</title>
<p>For the empirical analysis, register data from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency are used. Data are assembled from records obtained from local insurance offices and cover the entire Swedish population. They contain detailed information on the start date of parental leave, the number of days (parts of the day if not a full day) and the amount of benefit per day. They also include parents’ individual characteristics such as gender, date of birth, birth order of the child, geographical location, earnings, educational level and country of birth.</p>
<p>We make use of the fact that all three reforms were introduced for children born after a specific date. The first reserved month is applicable to children born on or after 1 January 1995; the second reserved month to children born on or after 1 January 2002; and the gender equality bonus to children born on or after 1 July 2008. Thus, children born within a few days of each other are treated under different regulations, which makes all three reforms examples of natural experiments (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0958928712440201">Rosenzweig and Wolpin, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>All parents with children born from two weeks before to up to two weeks after each reform are sampled and subsets of parents of children born before (control group) and after (treatment group) each of the reforms are constructed. To control for potential seasonal variation in the use of parental leave, we also include parents with children born one year before the introduction of each of the reforms in the statistical analysis. In practice, the effect of the reforms will be estimated by the change between the control groups and the treatment groups related to the change between parents with children born at the same time one year earlier. This approach is usually called difference-in-difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0958928712440201">Angrist and Krueger, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>As the reforms affect only children of parents with joint custody, children whose parents did not have joint custody during the entire period of observation were excluded from the sample. Multiple births and foreign-born and adopted children are also excluded as there are special regulations for these children. As the focus in this paper is on the division of parental leave between women and men, children whose parents are of the same sex are also excluded. Finally, children who died or emigrated during the period of study are excluded from the sample. The final samples consist of 11,000–15,000 children for each reform studied (see details and descriptive statistics in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928712440201">Duvander and Johansson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>We will present parental leave days in the control and treatment groups 24 months after the introduction of each of the three reforms. We restrict our analysis to the earnings-related parental leave days and exclude the three months of flat-rate days as they are not relevant to any of the reforms. Note that we include only parental leave days received for the children in the sample in this study and in the cases where a younger sibling is born within 24 months we do not take into account the added parental leave days.</p>
<p>As no other substantial events occurred at the time of reforms, we conclude that the reforms are exogenous. As the homecare allowance was abolished on 1 January 1995, it does not influence the leave use of either control or treatment group for the first reserved month. The homecare allowance introduced in 2008 has been used to only a minor extent during the study period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0958928712440201">Statistics Sweden, 2010</xref>). We also controlled the number of children born before and after each reform and whether there were any differences between the children in observed characteristics but found nothing worth noting (see details in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928712440201">Duvander and Johansson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>We want to point out that we have analysed the immediate response to the reforms. If a reform changes parents’ behaviour gradually, but nevertheless initiates a change, it may be missed if we focus on the first parents to meet the reform.</p>

The introduction of the first reserved month had a large impact on both fathers’ and mothers’ use of parental leave days. Fathers’ use increased from an average of about 25 days before the reform to 35 days just after the reform. Mothers’ use of parental leave instead declined, from almost 320 days before the reform to 294 days just after the reform. The obvious explanation is that the first reserved month restricted the maximum days any of the parents could use by 30 days.</p>

<p>Also, the introduction of the second reserved month shows a significant effect on fathers’ use of parental leave. The reform increased fathers’ use of leave by an average of seven days. As the parental leave was extended by 30 days at the same time as the second reserved month was introduced, mothers’ use also increased.</p>
<p>In contrast to the changes relating to the first and second reserved months there are no statistically significant changes in used parental leave days after the introduction of the gender equality bonus. There is, however, a general trend of increasing days of parental leave for fathers, and decreasing days for mothers, which is visible when comparing the reforms. Fathers’ mean number of days increased by about five days between 1995 and 2002, and also between 2002 and 2008, while mothers’ decreased by over 20 days. The leave use is thus changing regardless of the reforms studied here, although at a slow pace.</p>
<p>Another way to evaluate the potential impact of the reforms is to compare the proportion of users at various levels of use. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0958928712440201">Table 2</xref> presents the percentage of fathers and mothers with children born just before and just after the three reforms who used any parental leave days, the percentage who used more than 30 days and the percentage who used more than 60 parental leave days. As the reforms have negligible impact on the proportion of mothers who use parental leave, we restrict the analysis to the proportion of fathers at different levels of use.</p>

<p>The proportion of fathers using any parental leave within their child’s first two years increased sharply from two-fifths of all fathers whose children were born just before the first reserved month to three-quarters of all fathers whose children were born just after. The proportion of fathers who used more than 30 days increased by almost 10%, whereas the change in the group using more than 60 days is negligible.</p>
<p>Also, after the introduction of the second month the proportions of fathers using leave increased. The largest change took place in the group using more than 30 days where the percentage of fathers increased from 38% in the control group to 52% in the treatment group.</p>
<p>It seems that the gender equality bonus did not lead to any statistically significant changes in the proportions of fathers using parental leave at different levels.</p>
<p>Note also the changes between the reforms. The proportion of fathers using any leave decreased <italic>between</italic> the first two reforms, from 75% to 70% (when comparing the treatment group for the first reserved month with the control group for the second reserved month). There are no changes in regulations that can explain the decrease, and therefore we interpret the decrease as caused by a strong initial response to the reform that wears off somewhat with time. At the same time, the group using more than 30 days and the group using more than 60 days increased substantially between reforms. Also, the proportion using more than 60 days increased between the second reserved month and the introduction of the gender equality bonus. There thus seems to be a tendency towards polarization in fathers’ use over time.</p>

<title>Logit models</title>
<p>To test the potential effects of the three reforms further we conduct logit models, where the dependent variable expresses fathers’ ‘risk’ of using more than a certain number of parental leave days. The dependent variable is categorized into different groups indicating the risk that the father is using any earnings-related parental leave days, using more than one week of earnings-related parental leave days, using more than two weeks of earnings-related parental leave days, and so on, up to the risk that the father is using more than 13 weeks of earnings-related parental leave days. For each reform, the independent variables and samples are identical in all models. The models are specified as:<disp-quote>
<p>Logit(Y<sub>1/0</sub> | X, γ, δ, λ) = α + <bold>X</bold><sub>i</sub> β + γ Year + δ Month + λ Treatment</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>where <bold>X</bold><sub>i</sub> is a vector of individual characteristics of the father and the mother, including parents’ age, country of birth, educational level, earnings, sector of work, living location and the child’s sex and birth order. The variables ‘Year’ and ‘Month’ are dummy variables indicating the time of birth of the child, where ‘Year’ is one for children born around the introduction of each reform and zero for children born a year earlier. The variable ‘Month’ assumes the value one for the month where each of the reforms were introduced and zero for the month before the reform. The potential impact of the reforms is measured by the variable ‘Treatment’, an interaction variable of Year × Month, indicating that the father belongs to the treatment group. It is the estimated values of this variable for each of the models that are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0958928712440201">Table 3</xref>. As all three reforms aim at a more equal use of parental leave, the focus in the analysis is on all parents with children born around the reforms. Sensitivity tests have been conducted for subgroups. The results in these analyses points in the same direction as the main results.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0958928712440201">Table 3</xref> presents the ‘Treatment’ variable from the logit models, that is the effect of reform on fathers’ risk of using more than a specific number of parental leave days, expressed in odds ratios. The results from the first reserved month in the first column show that there is a clear, significant effect of the first reform. The odds ratio of using more than zero days is 4.65 for fathers to children born just after the first reserved month was introduced compared with before the reform’s introduction. The risk is higher for any usage up to more than 30 days, but not for more than five weeks of parental leave days. The effect is, to a large extent, dependent on a shift from fathers not using any or only a few days of parental leave before the reform to using approximately 30 parental leave days, that is the reserved month.</p>
<p>The results for the second reserved month show that after the reform the risk is higher for any usage up to more than 60 days, but not more than nine weeks of parental leave days; thus, the two reserved months. Similarly, after the introduction of the first reserved month there is a clear shift, but instead of using approximately 30 days, the fathers use more than 30 days and up to about 60 days of parental leave.</p>
<p>Turning to the gender equality bonus, we do not find any shift and there is no statistically significant higher risk of more usage at any point in time when we compare the fathers before and after the reform.</p>
<p>For sensitivity analysis, we conducted logit models with only the year, month and treatment dummy included and logit models with children born one month, one week and three days around the reform cut-offs, as well as separate analyses for various subgroups. In neither case did the results differ significantly from the main results. The results tend in the same direction and strengthen the conclusions drawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0958928712440201">Duvander and Johansson, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study focuses on the effects of three reforms aimed at encouraging an equal division of parental leave use: the first and second reserved month (1995 and 2002) and the gender equality bonus (2008). While gender equality policy is a much wider area than family policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0958928712440201">Neyer, 2011</xref>), parental leave use is often considered one of the most important indicators of gender equality in Sweden, and therefore effectiveness of reforms is crucial. The results show that the first reserved month clearly has the largest effect on both fathers’ and mothers’ use. Mothers’ use of parental leave days decreased by 26 days whereas fathers’ days increased by 10 days. Also, the proportion of fathers using any leave at all increased from 43% to 75%. The reason that fathers’ leave days do not increase as much as mothers’ days decrease is probably that fathers, to a greater extent, take their leave later in their children’s life, but we observe only the first 24 months.</p>
<p>The second reserved month has a more moderate effect, increasing fathers’ days by six days and mothers’ days by seven days. Remember that the leave was extended by 30 days at the same time and this extension could also be used by mothers. Here we find that the dominant pattern is that fathers’ use of around two months increases, whereas other lengths of leave are less affected.</p>
<p>We do not find any effects on parental leave days from the introduction of the gender equality bonus. The analysis also indicates that the bonus has not yet shifted the usage among fathers.</p>
<p>When we compare the effects of the three reforms it seems that the effectiveness of the first reform, the first reserved month, is higher than that of the two other reforms, and that the second reserved month clearly has more impact than the gender equality bonus. It is not possible to conclude that the first month is a reform that is superior to the other two, as the reforms can be seen as stepping-stones towards the same goal. It is possible that the economic encouragement through the bonus is less obvious to parents than the threat of a reduction of leave days if they are not shared. To have more time with your child at the expense of work seems to be a more valid claim than earning a bonus (or losing less income).</p>
<p>Whether the same would hold in other European countries aiming for fathers’ participation in parental leave is hard to say, as the results for Sweden are probably dependent on the initially generous benefit, as well as other contextual factors, such as available daycare and a generally strong labour-market law on gender equality. The common culture of a country shapes not just how families live and the reasons for their choices but also the policy setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0958928712440201">Strohmeier, 2002</xref>). However, given the development towards more generous family policy in many European countries (encouraged by EU directives), as well as increased female labour-force participation and perhaps also increased consensus regarding the importance of gender equality, similar responses to reforms are possible in many other countries. A generous parental leave length is probably one of the important reasons the reserved months are not perceived as ‘taking time’ from the mother to the father. A comparison can be made to Iceland, where the leave was extended to nine months at the same time as three months were reserved for the father in the early 2000s, and where the absolute majority of fathers use the three months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928712440201">Duvander and Lammi-Taskula, 2010</xref>). The Icelandic comparison also questions the strategy of slow step-wise reforms to encourage fathers’ leave, especially as the last reform in Sweden has had no effect so far. It is possible that a reform encouraging gender equality in parental leave may have the most effect the first time it is introduced, but that it is hard to reach the same effect when it is repeated. It is also possible that it is easier to get an effect starting from lower levels of use.</p>
<p>The absence of an effect of the gender equality bonus may also be the result of a complicated system, lack of transparency, lag in tax credit and less attention in the public sphere. In addition, other factors influencing the leave division between the mother and the father may be so strong that a bonus at the economic level of the present one is too marginal to have any influence. A reference should also be made to the Finnish parental leave with a bonus system that, although in days, is rarely used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0958928712440201">Duvander and Lammi-Taskula, 2010</xref>). Reasonable conclusions are therefore that reforms need to be intuitively easy to grasp, as well as substantial in size, to have an effect.</p>
<p>All three reforms have been politically accepted by being introduced as part of packages, another possible reason why the effects of the reforms are in some cases limited. By comparing the use of leave of fathers of children born in 1995, 2002 and 2008 we see that the effects of the reforms have largely endured for the first and second reserved months and the trend of fathers’ increasing leave has not stopped. Even if the reforms, at least the first two, have had a positive impact on this trend, they are not the sole reasons for the trend. The reforms may be described as accelerating a process already under way.</p>
