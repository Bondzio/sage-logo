<p><bold>Background:</bold> Because socioeconomic and cultural factors contribute to where one dies, it is important to document place of death determinants in diverse societies.</p>
<p><bold>Aim:</bold> The purpose of this study was to describe where persons in an Aotearoa New Zealand hospice die, and to identify factors that are associated with place of death.</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> A retrospective chart review was conducted.</p>
<p><bold>Setting/Participants:</bold> Data were extracted from the charts of all patients receiving services from one hospice (i.e. secondary care) for whom death occurred during 2006–2008; 1268 cases for whom place of death was recorded comprise this sample.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> For close to half (47%), death occurred in the hospice inpatient unit, whereas 29% died at home, 8% died in an acute hospital setting, and 17% died in an aged/residential care facility. Bivariate analyses showed that persons who die in an aged/residential care facility are more likely to be aged 65 or older, unmarried, have a non-cancer diagnosis, and are likely poorer. Asians, those aged less than 65, those with cancer, and those admitted initially to hospice for respite care tended to die in the hospice inpatient unit. Multinominal logistic regression indicated that dying at home was only predicted by being from a Pacific Island.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Age, economics, diagnosis, ethnicity, marital status, and whether one enters a hospice service for (at least in part) respite were all associated to a certain extent with where one dies. These findings contribute to the growing evidence linking various factors, especially ethnic groups, with place of death.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Across many cultures, evidence suggests that 50–90% of patients with a life-limiting illness prefer to die at home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311412229">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311412229">5</xref></sup> However, only 3–66% of hospice patients have a home death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311412229">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311412229">7</xref></sup> Research findings show substantial incongruence between preferred and actual place of death for patients. For example, a Taiwanese study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311412229">2</xref></sup> of 46 dying patients found 43% of the time these patients died where they wanted. Findings from a Canadian study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311412229">4</xref></sup> of 216 informal carers’ perceptions of the where the deceased had wanted to die suggest that 30% did not die in their preferred place. In contrast, family carers are fairly satisfied with where their loved one died (e.g. 67% in Italy<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269216311412229">1</xref></sup> and 79% in Taiwan<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0269216311412229">2</xref></sup>). The analysis by Holdsworth and Fisher<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311412229">8</xref></sup> of the congruence between patients’ preferred and actual place of death (62% in three English hospices) revealed 58% did not have a preference. Research is beginning to corroborate what clinicians have undoubtedly observed: When there is a choice regarding where to die, it is a decision fraught with uncertainty and influenced by numerous factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311412229">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Factors potentially influencing where a terminally ill patient dies have been identified in numerous studies. In a systematic review of 58 studies (representing over 1.5 million persons from 13 countries, mostly living with cancer), Gomes and Higginson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311412229">6</xref></sup> identified 17 factors with strong evidence regarding an association with place of death. The factors most strongly associated with dying at home were: low functional status, expressed preference for home death, receiving home care and receiving it frequently, living with relatives, and having extended family support available.</p>
<p>More recently, Murray and colleagues’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311412229">9</xref></sup> synthesis of 33 studies about ‘where the dying (i.e. cancer patients) live’, observed that persons who are married, of higher socio-economic status, have family carers that seek support, and are geographically close to a hospice are those most likely to utilize hospice care at the end of life. While this synthesis did not examine place of death, its findings do contribute to understanding who accesses hospice services. Although persons who enter hospice are more likely than non-hospice recipients to die at home or their usual place of residence, not all do.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311412229">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311412229">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Multiple factors appear to contribute to where a patient with life-limiting illness will die. Recent American findings link ethnicity with place of death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311412229">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311412229">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311412229">13</xref></sup> Pertinent to this study is evidence from a large audit (<italic>N</italic> = 184,081) of Asian- and Pacific-American elders that indicated this ethnic cluster enrolled in a hospice less than whites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311412229">14</xref></sup> In general, minority ethnic groups in the USA tend more than whites to die in hospital rather than at home.</p>
<p>Because socioeconomic and cultural factors contribute to where one dies, it is important to document place of death determinants in diverse societies. Each society, ultimately, needs to support care at the end of life that best befits persons of that society. Studying where hospice patients die can naturally control for some service delivery variables; that is, when patients enter a hospice service they begin to receive care that reflects a common philosophy and access resources, generally regardless of socioeconomic criteria. Thus, the purpose of this study was to describe where persons in an Aotearoa New Zealand hospice die, and to identify factors that are associated with place of death.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216311412229" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A retrospective chart review was conducted to describe not only who used Mary Potter Hospice’s (MPH) services, but what services were used. Because this project is a secondary analysis of data for the purpose of resource review (an audit) using data collected for normal care that involved minimal risk, ethics committee approval was unnecessary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311412229">15</xref></sup> However, standard practices for assuring responsible research conduct were instituted (e.g. data collection form de-identified patients as much as possible, data collectors were instructed regarding confidentiality and signed confidentiality agreements, data extraction occurred on site and was always monitored by the investigator, charts were kept in locked storage and data generated were filed in a secured computer).</p>
<sec id="section3-0269216311412229">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Data were extracted from the charts of all patients who died while on service during 2006–2008. The sample for this study comprises those cases for which place of death was recorded.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216311412229">
<title>Setting</title>
<p>Mary Potter Hospice (MPH), like the other 28 full hospice services in New Zealand (NZ), is a charitable trust that provides all of its services free to any person needing care during the last 12 months of a life-limiting illness. Although it is unknown where people in the Wellington region die, unpublished data from the NZ Ministry of Health (Personal Communication, Chris Lewis [NZ MOH analyst], 17 February 2011) reveals that of the 28,601 registered deaths during 2007, 34% occurred in a hospital, 31% in a residential care facility, 22% in a private residence, and 6% in a hospice.</p>
<p>New Zealand hospices collaborate with the local District Health Boards to provide services. MPH serves those in the DHB catchment area of the country’s capital Wellington, an area with roughly 70% of the inhabitants being of European descent, 13% being Maori, and 8% each Pacific Islander and Asian.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311412229">16</xref></sup> Less than 12% of this region’s population are 65 years or older.</p>
<p>MPH’s multidisciplinary team includes professionals trained to provide: medical, nursing, and spiritual care; social work and counselling; music, massage, occupational, and physio-therapies. Care is provided primarily in the community (during home visits), but also in in-house day units and an 18-bed inpatient unit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216311412229">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The data extraction consisted of a chart review conducted by a team of 12 MPH volunteers who were trained and closely supervised by the first author. The variables age, ethnicity, gender, marital status, and religion were coded using a schema developed for the New Zealand Census. Diagnosis was defined (as that ‘chiefly responsible for occasioning the patient’s palliative care’) and coded using the Australasian Palliative Care Medicine coding scheme.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311412229">17</xref></sup> The author developed additional items to collect data on whether the patient had a Community Services Card (with having one being a crude indicator of lower socio-economic status), number of inpatient unit stays, reasons for acceptance as noted by palliative care nurse coordinators admitting patients to service, dates of acceptance and death, and place of death. Place of death was coded as home, MPH inpatient unit (IPU), acute hospital, or other community institution (e.g. aged/residential care [ARC] facility).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269216311412229">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Data were entered and analysed using SPSS version 17. After cleaning and transforming data, measures of central tendency were used to learn about the sample and major study variables. Kruskal–Wallis testing and Chi square were run to analyse how major variables were associated. Finally, multinomial logistic regression (using home as a reference category) was employed to determine how significant variables contributed to a model predicting place of death (see note 1 at the end of the paper). A minimum significance level of 0.05 was chosen. Potential two-way interactions were examined using likelihood-ratio tests.</p>
<p>The ethnicity data was transformed by collapsing ethnicities into four categories: European descent (known in Aotearoa New Zealand as ‘Pakeha’), Maori, Pacific peoples, and Asian. Because only a very few patients were of another ethnic background—and these were diverse backgrounds—these patients were omitted from analyses studying ethnicity. Pakeha included not only New Zealand-born of European descent, but immigrants from other countries where the dominant ethnic group is also of European descent per the NZ Ministry of Health Ethnicity Data Protocols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311412229">18</xref></sup> (see note 2 at the end of the paper). Per the protocol, those who self-identified as of more than one ethnicity were coded as of the ethnicity that is more a minority. For analyses, marital status categories also collapsed to include married (including <italic>de facto</italic>), and unmarried (including single, widowed, separated, divorced).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The sample of 1268 is described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311412229">Table 1</xref>. This sample can be characterized as predominantly of European descent, Christian, married, and with an average age of 71 years. A total of 12% were either Maori or Pacific Peoples. Cancer was the cause of death for 82%. To place these data in context, note that Maori and Pacific comprise over 20% of the region’s population, and Asian/Others make up more than 9%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311412229">16</xref></sup> Likewise, cancer is the leading cause of death in NZ, with 30% dying of it.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311412229">19</xref></sup></p>

</table-wrap>
<p>Close to half (47% of 1230 for whom we had this information) died in the IPU, whereas 29% died at home, 17% died in an ARC, and 8% died in an acute hospital. The median number of visits to the hospice’s inpatient unit was one (38% never visiting, and 19% staying for two or more visits). Half of the sample received services (length of stay from admission to death) for less than 48 days, with a quarter of the sample receiving services for 14 days or less, and the top quartile receiving services at least 129 days.</p>
<p>Chi square tests were conducted to explore relationships between place of death and other categorical variables. The data revealed associations between ethnicity and place of death, <italic>Χ</italic><sup>2</sup> (9, <italic>n</italic> = 1180) = 30.6, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> = 0.09. That is, 42% of Pacific peoples (and Maori to a lesser extent [36%]) died at home, in contrast to 20% of Asians and 27% of Pakeha who died at home. Pacific peoples were also more likely to die in an acute hospital than others (18% compared with 6–11% amongst the other ethnic groups). Asians were much more likely than others to die in the IPU (63% did so), compared to 48% of Pakeha and 46% of Maori who died there.</p>
<p>An association was also observed between marital status and place of death, <italic>Χ</italic><sup>2</sup> (3, <italic>n</italic> = 1087) = 38.1, <italic>p</italic> = &lt; 0.001, Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> = 0.19. Those dying in ARCs were disproportionally unmarried (64%), while the percentage of those who died in all other settings favoured those who were married (60–64%). Those who died in an ARC or an acute hospital were also more likely to hold a Community Services Card (79% and 74%, respectively, compared to 58% of those dying at home and 56% of those in IPU), <italic>Χ</italic><sup>2</sup> (3, <italic>n</italic> = 868) = 13.2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004, Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> = 0.12. It is instructive also to note that gender (<italic>Χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.71, <italic>p</italic> = 0.87, Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> = 0.02) and whether a patient was religious or not (<italic>Χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 2.3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.51, Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> = 0.05) were not found to be related to place of death.</p>
<p>Reasons for initial acceptance into hospice service were also examined in relation to place of death. While an association between place of death and admission to hospice to receive care that included respite was found to be significant, <italic>Χ</italic><sup>2</sup> (3, <italic>n</italic> = 1063) = 11.7, <italic>p</italic> = 0.008, Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> = 0.11, there was no association with admission for terminal care (<italic>p</italic> = 0.13) or for symptom management (<italic>p</italic> = 0.07). More specifically, of those who were admitted to service for respite, 51% died in IPU (compared with 41% of those who were not admitted for respite). When comparing those with cancer against those with other terminal illnesses, a similar pattern was observed: 50% of the cancer patients died in IPU (in contrast with 34% of non-cancer patients), and 25% of non-cancer patients died in ARCs (compared to 15% of cancer patients), <italic>Χ</italic><sup>2</sup> (3, <italic>n</italic> = 1219) = 23.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Cramer’s <italic>V</italic> = 0.14.</p>
<p>Kruskal–Wallis testing indicated age was significantly linked to where a patient died: <italic>Χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 85.4, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Those who died in an ARC had a median of 80 years, while those who died in home, IPU, or acute hospital had median ages of 71 or 72 years.</p>
<p>As one would expect, there was also a significant association between number of IPU visits and place of death: those who were admitted to the IPU were more likely to die there, <italic>Χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 364.5, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. The median number of visits for those dying in the IPU was 1.0, while those dying in other settings had a median of zero visits. Kruskal–Wallis testing to determine if length of stay on service was associated with place of death showed no relationship (<italic>p</italic> = 0.11).</p>
<p>The multivariable, multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the interplay of several important factors in place of death. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269216311412229">Table 2</xref> indicates the multiple predictor factors that were included in the analysis (on an <italic>a priori</italic> basis), along with likelihood ratio chi-square statistics indicating whether the overall factor was associated with differential patterns in place of death. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269216311412229">Table 3</xref> reports the results of the multinomial logistic regression to examine where people died. The results can be considered akin to three separate logistic regression models comparing the reference category of dying at home to each of the three other locations.</p>

<p>None of the examined factors appeared to distinguish whether people were more likely to die in acute hospital than at home: the odds ratio for Asian ethnicity compared to NZ European was quite high (2.29) but with a very wide confidence interval (95% CI 0.644 to 8.16), due to the small number of Asian individuals in the study group. For looking at factors associated with dying in aged care/residential relative to at-home, the point estimates for Pacific and Asian individuals were both lower than 1 (Pacific OR relative to Pakeha = 0.396, 95% CI 0.154 to 1.02). While both confidence intervals included the null value (1), this evidence suggests that members of these groups may be more likely to die at home than in ARCs. Perhaps unsurprisingly, people were more likely to have died in ARC than at home if aged 65 or over (OR = 3.28, 95% CI 1.82 to 5.91), or unmarried at time of death, relative to married (OR = 3.35, 95% CI 2.196 to 5.11). Looking at the differences between dying in IPU or home, people of Pacific ethnicity were significantly more likely to die at home than in the IPU (OR = 0.376, 95% CI 0.198 to 0.711). Furthermore, people with a diagnosis of cancer were also more likely to die in the IPU than at home (OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.37).</p>
<p>Evidence from the smaller model (68.5% of total study group) that included Community Services Card information as a predictor variable can be summarized as follows. Relative to those people without a CSC, people with a CSC were more likely to die at acute hospital than at home (OR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.096 to 3.996). There was no significant difference between those with/without a CSC regarding likelihood of dying in ARC relative to home (OR = 1.50, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.565). Likewise, there was no evidence for CSC status to differentiate between likelihood of dying in the IPU relative to home (OR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.42). Potential two-way interactions were tested with likelihood-ratio chi-squared tests; no interactions were found to be significant (values of <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.117).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The univariate findings show that even on a hospice service providing free support in the community, most patients (71%) did not die at home. Closer examination suggests some factors that are associated with where the death occurs for these hospice patients. Persons who die in an ARC are more likely to be older (65+), unmarried, not have cancer, and are likely poorer. Asians, those less than 65, those with cancer, and those admitted initially to hospice for respite care tend to die in the hospice IPU. The strongest evidence from this study (from the multinomial regression) is the finding that dying at home was only predicted by being of a Pacific ethnicity.</p>
<p>Our finding that only 29% of MPH patients died at home is similar to the national estimate of 22% of deaths being at home, and the middle of the range identified in Gomes and Higginson’s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311412229">6</xref></sup> international literature review. Previous research about patient preferences to die at home is currently balanced by literature suggesting that at the time of active dying, home is not always the preferred place of care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311412229">20</xref></sup> These results support this. Although patients accept hospice service that supports care in the home, the majority still die in an institution. These data do not explain why. It is unknown whether family carers become emotionally or physically unable to care at home, whether patients prefer to leave home for whatever reason when they anticipate their death is near, whether needs requiring IPU care correlate with time right before death, or whether members of the health care team inadvertently foster transfer from home to IPU just prior to death. Regardless, such evidence showing that even the best of planned end-of-life care may not mean dying at home. Indeed, length of time receiving care (whether to be well prepared for death at home or to become exhausted by caring at home) did not relate to where death occurred.</p>
<p>The data do suggest culture plays a significant role in where one dies. Pacific patients were more likely to die at home. While roughly a third of the Maori hospice patients died at home, the multivariable regression model showed only Pacific ethnicity to predict dying at home. This finding parallels statistics reported by the New Zealand Ministry of Health in a Palliative Care Strategy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311412229">21</xref></sup> which revealed that the most common place for death among Maori and Pacific is home (53% and 42%, respectively, for those with cancer; 41% and 39% for those with a non-cancer death), in contrast to 31% (for cancer deaths) and 24% (non-cancer) of other ethnicities. It is likely these findings are explained by the strongly communal societies of the Pacific, who take care of their own at the time of death. Given these study findings, future research may explore if the rate of Maori dying at home is declining, and if so what social factors contribute to this shift.</p>
<p>In contrast, Asians were more likely to choose the IPU as the place of death (univariate analysis). This may be surprising given the non-individualist societies from which these patients likely immigrated. While this audit did not collect data about family support, it is possible that these patients were often immigrants who had the minimal family support that would otherwise have allowed more deaths at home. It is also possible that Asians perceive the best way to respect their elders is to place them in an institution where they will receive professional care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311412229">22</xref></sup> This finding may parallel a Californian study of ethnicity and death place which found Asian immigrants as those with the highest proportion of hospital deaths (54% versus 41% among USA-born Asians)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311412229">12</xref></sup> and a English study which documented Chinese cancer patients were more like to die in hospital than home or hospice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311412229">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The factors related to whether a hospice patient died in a hospital or ARC may indicate a cluster of interrelated predictors: being older, unmarried (likely widowed), more dependent on governmental financial support, and dying with a disease that is often very long-term, necessitating institutionalization even before death is imminent. These patients may have weaker family support or live in an impoverished household that cannot support the needs of a dying person, hence are placed in institutions that can provide more long-term management.</p>
<p>These findings showing an association between older age and lower socio-economic status and institutional places of death corroborate previous studies. Several recent studies observe a similar linkage between age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216311412229">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216311412229">27</xref></sup> although in some countries this linkage is reversed, with more wealth and youth being associated with institutional dying (e.g. Mexico<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269216311412229">28</xref></sup> and Korea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216311412229">29</xref></sup>). Likewise, there is evidence that suggests living alone or without the presence of informal family carers is associated with not dying at home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216311412229">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216311412229">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216311412229">31</xref></sup> Other studies examining end of life diagnosis and place of death provide similar evidence indicating that those with certain chronic non-malignant diseases are less likely to die at home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216311412229">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269216311412229">33</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In spite of hospice care promoting choice of where to die, this chart review showed dying away from home to be the most frequent place of death for a sample in New Zealand. Age, economics, diagnosis, ethnicity, marital status, and whether one enters a hospice service for (at least in part) respite all are associated to a certain extent with where one dies. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence linking various personal, social, environmental, and medical factors with place of death.</p>

<p>Including Community Service Card (CSC) status in the model was problematic as 31.5% of the sample did not have this data. Therefore a second model was developed that added CSC as a predictor to the existing model (and analysed just the restricted dataset). To maximize power for the analysis, the principal results for the regression are presented for the analysis without CSC. Odds ratios are presented for CSC status in the restricted model that included CSC as a predictor. This model was also compared with a model based on the same restricted dataset but excluding CSC as a predictor variable; point estimates and confidence intervals for odds ratios for other predictors were similar between the two models, suggesting minimal confounding of other factors by CSC status.</p></fn>
