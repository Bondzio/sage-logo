<abstract>
<p>Source localization technology (SLT) for impact loads in a plate structure has been used for health monitoring, damage identication, fatigue analysis, human-interaction technology, etc. Much research on source localization has been focused only on the localization of single impacts. This article presents novel research into the source localization of multiple impacts. It is difficult to localize the sources of multiple impacts using current SLT because of the overlapping of dispersive waves induced by multiple impacts and the reflection of those waves from the edge of the plate. The new method functions by solving the overlapping problem and the reflection problem. These two problems are solved by adopting pre-signal processing based on band pass filtering and linear-prediction filtering. The method is applied to the localization of multiple impacts on an isotropic plate. Results from numerical simulation and from experimentation are presented and these verify the capability of the proposed method.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406211414113"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Elastic plates are used extensively in aircraft, aerospace, automotive, industrial, and power plant structures. One of the major concerns related to the use of these plate-like structures is the localization of impact sources. The localization of impact sources is applied to the identification of impact damage [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211414113">1</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211414113">3</xref></bold>], to loose part monitoring in nuclear power plants [<bold>4</bold>,<bold> 5</bold>], to crack analysis in non-destructive evaluation [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211414113">6</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211414113">7</xref></bold>], and to human-interaction technology in electronic devices [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954406211414113">8</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954406211414113">9</xref></bold>], etc. Thus far, mostly single-impact source localization technology (SLT) has been used in those applications. SLT for a single impact on a plate is mostly based on the estimation of arrival time of the elastic wave from the impact location to three sensors that are attached to the plate. These arrival times are obtained from time-frequency analysis (TFA) for the elastic wave generated by the impact load on the plate. The elastic wave detected by the three sensors has dispersive characteristics, and TFA is a useful signal processing tool for the analysis of a dispersive wave [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211414113">1</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211414113">3</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211414113">5</xref></bold>]. However, when multiple impacts are loaded on the plate, it is difficult to localize the sources of multiple impacts by using the current SLT because of the overlapping of the elastic waves and the reflection of those waves from the edge in a plate [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211414113">2</xref></bold>]. In a nuclear plant, for example, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211414113">Fig. 1</xref>, a loose part such as bolt and nut is often left inside the steam generator by mistake after a periodical maintenance process. This loose part impacts the wall of steam generator with the different impact occurring at different times. When multiple impacts due to a loose part occur in sequence, this loose part may result in a catastrophic problem by impacting the wall of steam generator. Thus, the monitoring of such a loose part is important in a nuclear power plant. In this article, a new method is suggested for the source localization of multiple impacts. The proposed method uses pre-processed signal processing to solve the overlapping and reflection problems. The pre-processed signal processing is developed by using a band pass filter and a linear-prediction filter. This pre-processed signal processing is applied to the elastic wave measured by the sensors installed on the plate. The pre-processed waveforms are analyzed by the TFA method to obtain the arrival time. At the sensors, the arrival time differences of the wave front are used for the estimation of impact source using triangulation. In the second section, SLT for single impacts is explained to identify the problem that should be considered for the source localization of multiple impacts in a plate. In the third section, the problems of and solutions for the source localization of multiple impacts are demonstrated. The fourth section presents the procedure for the source localization of multiple impacts and its application in a plate. Conclusions are given in the section 5.

<sec id="sec3-0954406211414113"><title>2.1 Numerical results</title>
<p>The theoretical solution to the response of a homogeneous, isotropic plate of infinite dimensions in the <italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>x</italic><sub>2</sub> directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211414113">Fig. 2</xref>) subject to surface sources is well explained in references [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211414113">10</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211414113">11</xref></bold>] and will not be repeated here. A major objective of this section is to determine the impact location throughout the measurement of the acoustic signal at the arbitrary point <italic>r</italic> in the plate, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211414113">Fig. 2</xref>. The material properties of the aluminum plate used for this numerical analysis are given by <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954406211414113">Table 1</xref>. The phase velocity of this plate can be calculated with exact plate theory [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954406211414113">12</xref></bold>], Mindlin’s approximate shear deformation plate theory (SDPT) [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954406211414113">13</xref></bold>], and classic plate theory (CPT) [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406211414113">14</xref></bold>]. An important wave mode in the impact testing of structures is the Lamb wave. This wave mode is named after Horace Lamb, an English acoustician who in the 1920s developed the mathematical theory of sine waves propagating in finite plates [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211414113">15</xref></bold>]. This kind of theory seeks to describe wave propagation in terms of wave modes – patterns of oscillatory motion that can propagate in a stable way, maintaining their shape as they travel. In plates, Lamb identified two families of wave modes [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211414113">15</xref></bold>]. In the first family, the motion is symmetrical about the median plane of the plate, and in the second family, it is asymmetrical. The parent members of these families are called the s<sub>0</sub> and a<sub>0</sub> modes, respectively. The s<sub>0</sub> mode, often called the “extensional mode,” is a rippling movement in which the plate is alternately stretching and compressing in the direction of the wave motion. The a<sub>0</sub> mode, often called the “flexural mode,” is a mode in which the body of the plate bends with the two surfaces moving in the same direction. Most of the motion is transverse to the plate; there is relatively little motion in the plane of the plate. Exciting forces perpendicular to the plate produce this kind of wave motion. The theoretical solution to the response of a plate subject to surface or subsurface impact sources is a topic of considerable current research interest. The solution of three-dimensional problems involving homogeneous or multilayered isotropic and anisotropic plates of finite thickness and large lateral dimensions subjected to various types of surface loads has been given earlier in reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954406211414113">10</xref></bold>] and will not be repeated here. For a homogeneous, isotropic plate of infinite dimensions in the <italic>x</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>x</italic><sub>2</sub> directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211414113">Fig. 2</xref>), the elastodynamic field can be conveniently expressed in terms of a six dimensional, stress-displacement vector {Ŝ} in the frequency domain, as

<p>For the source localization of a single impact, the response to impact load is simulated numerically. The delta function <italic>δ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is used for the impact load at point “O” in a plate, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211414113">Fig. 4</xref>. The displacements at positions S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, and S<sub>3</sub> are numerically simulated by using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-0954406211414113">equation (3)</xref>. The location of the impact source can be obtained through triangulation (see Appendix 1) using the difference of the traveling times of the waves from the source to the three sensors [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954406211414113">11</xref></bold>]. It is difficult to measure the arrival time difference of dispersive waves using traditional methods such as the correlation method [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211414113">1</xref></bold>], which is useful for non-dispersive waves. The time-frequency method is an effective method for determination of the arrival time of dispersive Lamb waves propagating across a plate in an impact test [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211414113">2</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211414113">5</xref></bold>]. In the present article, as the time-frequency method, the sliced Wigner fourth order moment spectrum (SWFOMS) is employed (see Appendix 2). The SWFOMS has high time and frequency resolution, compared to other time-frequency methods. The generalized versions of the SWFOMS are given by reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954406211414113">16</xref></bold>]

The SWFOMS is applied to the simulated waveforms, which are the displacements at positions S<sub>1</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>, and S<sub>3</sub>. The contour map and image analysis for results of the SWFOMS for the displacement waveform are presented in the time-frequency space as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211414113">Fig. 5</xref>. In the figures, the horizontal axis presents time and the vertical axis presents frequency. The bottom figure is time history of the displacement wave. The left figure shows the total energy at each frequency, which is normalized by the maximum total energy. The dashed lines in the center part of each map correspond to the peak amplitude. The arrival time difference for the waveform is obtained from three dashed lines, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211414113">Fig. 6(a)</xref>. The theoretical group velocity is defined as the derivative of the angular frequency with respect to the wave number [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0954406211414113">14</xref></bold>]. The theoretical group velocity for the simulated wave form is calculated and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211414113">Fig. 6(b)</xref>. For this calculation, only the A<sub>0</sub> mode is used. The group velocity of the simulated waveform can be also estimated by dividing the distance between the sensor and the impact source by the arrival time, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211414113">Fig. 6(b)</xref>. From these results, the theoretical group velocity corresponds well with the group velocity obtained by using arrival time. The location of the impact load is estimated by triangulation (see Appendix 1), using the theoretical group velocity and the estimated arrival time difference. This is the current SLT for source localization of a single impact. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211414113">Figure 7</xref> shows the source location of a single impact load estimated by this SLT. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211414113">Figure 7(a)</xref> shows the estimated location of the source and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211414113">Fig. 7(b)</xref> shows the distance error percent between the true location and the estimated location. According to these results, the estimation of the location of a single impact load using the current SLT is effective since the distance errors are within 1 per cent.

<sec id="sec5-0954406211414113"><title>3 SOURCE LOCALIZATION OF MULTIPLE IMPACTS IN A PLATE</title>
<p>In the previous section, the source location for a single impact load in a plate is identified successfully by using the current SLT based on TFA for a Lamb wave with dispersive characteristics. However, it is difficult to localize the sources of serial multiple impacts by using the current SLT because of the overlapping of the serial impact waveforms and the reflection of those waves from the edge of a plate. In fact, research on the source localization of multiple impacts based on TFA for Lamb waves has not previously been presented in a research article. In this section, a novel method for the source localization of serial multiple impacts is proposed by solving the overlapping problem and the reflection problem.</p>
<sec id="sec6-0954406211414113"><title>3.1 The overlapping problem and solution for localization for multiple impact waves</title>
<p>When five multiple impact loads excite the surface of a plate, the loads are given from number 1 to number 5 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211414113">Fig. 8</xref>. The waveform generated by the second impact load is interfered with by the waveform generated by the first impact. The third, fourth, and fifth waveforms are also interfered with by waveforms from previous impacts. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211414113">Figure 9</xref> illustrates this interference with four impacts as an example. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211414113">Fig. 9</xref>, the symbol Δ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is the time interval of <italic>i</italic>th multiple impact. The measured signal for a sensor is the sum of four impact waves and has overlapping problems that prevent the localization of impact sources when using the current SLT based on TFA. Thus, the time history of the signal measured for one sensor is very complex. This problem of overlapping waveforms from multiple impacts is caused by the dispersive characteristics of waves. Since, at a low frequency, the group velocity of the waves is small, the wave having a low frequency component arrives at the sensor late. This slow wave is overlapped by the wave generated by the next impact. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211414113">Fig. 10(a)</xref> illustrates the overlapping phenomenon. To avoid this overlapping problem at low frequencies, it is necessary to employ a band pass filter. When an impact wave is propagated to the sensor, the distance between the point of impact and the sensor is S, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211414113">Fig. 10(b)</xref>. For example, if two serial impacts excite the plate, the arrival time difference of the two waves is obtained by TFA. The result of the TFA for two waves measured at the sensor is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211414113">Fig. 10(c)</xref>. Two dispersive wave signals overlap at a frequency less than the low frequency f<sub>L</sub>. Therefore, if the low frequency limit of the high pass filter is selected at this frequency f<sub>L</sub>, then the low frequency overlapping can be avoided because the group velocity <italic>v</italic><sub>g</sub> of the wave above this frequency is fast, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211414113">Fig. 10(d)</xref>, and the wave arrives at the sensor within time <italic>t</italic><sub>L</sub>. For the simulated wave generated by a single impact in an infinite aluminum plate, the time <italic>t<sub>L</sub></italic> is around 0.15 ms, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211414113">Fig. 5</xref>. Therefore, the time <italic>t<sub>L</sub></italic> should be less than the time Δ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> which is the time interval between the current <italic>i</italic>th impact and the next <italic>i</italic> + 1 th impact. When multiple impacts occur in sequence, the one condition necessary to prevent overlapping is that the impact interval Δ<sub><italic>i</italic></sub> should be longer than time <italic>t<sub>L</sub></italic>, and the mathematical expression of this condition is given by

Since the amplitude of the acceleration is calculated by multiplying the amplitude of the displacement by the square of the frequency, at very high frequency, the amplitude of the acceleration is too high compared with that of the displacement. Therefore, in this application, a displacement sensor that uses piezoelectric material is useful. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0954406211414113">Figure 11</xref> shows a displacement sensor designed with piezoelectronic materials for this research.

<sec id="sec7-0954406211414113"><title>3.2 Reflection problem and solution</title>
<p>A wave generated by an impact load is propagated through the sensors attached on the finite plate to the edge of the plate and then reflects from the edge, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0954406211414113">Fig. 12</xref>. Therefore, the sensors detect the direct wave and the reflected wave. Since the reflected wave is also dispersive, it has a high group velocity at high frequency and affects the direct wave generated by the next impact. Fortunately, the magnitude of the reflected wave is smaller than that of the direct wave generated by the next impact load since it travels along the plate for a relatively long time and is damped by the structure of the plate [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954406211414113">15</xref></bold>]. However, since the magnitude of the end segment of the direct wave is not sufficiently large, by comparison with the magnitude of the reflected wave, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954406211414113">Fig. 13(a)</xref>, it is difficult to discern the reflected wave from the direct wave at the end segment of the direct wave. In order to avoid the effect of the reflected wave at the end segment of the direct wave, only the direct wave should be retained by truncating the signal before the reflection arrives. The time <italic>t</italic><sub>c</sub> for chopping is determined by using the information obtained from the simulated waveform for the infinite plate, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211414113">Fig. 5</xref>. For the simulated waveform, the time length of the waveform with wave energy is around 0.15 ms. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0954406211414113">Figure 13(b)</xref> shows the chopped signal with only the direct wave. In this process, some of the direct wave has the high frequency component due to the chopping at the end of the chopped signal. This high frequency component causes some difficulty in analyzing the dispersive wave in the time frequency domain. Therefore, it is necessary to smooth the chopped signal in order to predict the continuation of the end segment of the truncated direct wave. To smooth the chopped wave, a linear-prediction filter is employed [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954406211414113">18</xref></bold>]. The optimal linear-prediction filter is designed by using the Wiener-Hopf equation (see Appendix 3) and is given by

<sec id="sec9-0954406211414113"><title>4.1 Procedure for source localization of multiple impacts</title>
<p>In the previous section, the problems for source location of multiple impacts in a plate are discussed. Novel solutions for those problems were also proposed in section 3. This section presents the procedure for the source localization of multiple impacts with the pre-signal processing method developed in the previous section, and this procedure is applied to source localization in a steel plate. There are two major problems in the source localization of multiple impacts in a plate. One is the overlapping between waveforms generated by multiple impacts, and the other is the reflection at the edge of a plate. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0954406211414113">Figure 14</xref> shows a flow chart of the procedure for the source localization of multiple impacts by solving these two problems. First, the displacement of the waveform should be measured. The waveform is affected by both the overlapping and the reflection problems. A band pass filter should be employed to prevent the overlapping problem at low frequencies. The band pass filtered signal still has the reflection problem at high frequencies. In order to avoid the reflection problem as mentioned in section 3.2, only the direct wave should be chopped at the interface region between the direct wave and the reflected wave. The chopped signal includes high frequency components which should be smoothed to get an exact arrival difference in the time frequency domain by using the time-frequency method. The optimal linear-prediction filter is designed by using the chopped direct wave signal. In order to obtain the arrival time difference at each sensor, the time-frequency method should be applied to the pre-processed waveform throughout the band pass filter and the linear-prediction filter. As a next step, the theoretical group velocity should be calculated by using the Lamb wave theory in a plate and the material properties of the plate. By using this group velocity and the arrival time difference, the sources of multiple impacts can be localized based on triangulation.
<fig id="fig14-0954406211414113" position="float"><label>Fig. 14</label><caption><p>Flow chart of the procedure for source localization of multiple impacts by solving these two problems in a plate</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414113-fig14.tif"/>

<sec id="sec10-0954406211414113"><title>4.2 Application in an isotropic steel plate</title>
<p>Application of the proposed technology to an isotropic steel plate for the source localization of multiple impacts is described in this section. The steel plate was attached to a firm structure, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0954406211414113">Fig. 15</xref>. Five impact loads were applied serially to the points marked on the plate. The waves generated by the five impacts propagated to the four attached piezo-electronic displacement sensors, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0954406211414113">Fig.16</xref>, which detected the direct and the reflected waves. Impact tests were carried out on a plate 6 mm in thickness with lateral dimensions of 1500 mm <italic>×</italic> 1500 mm. The material properties for the steel plate used in this test are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954406211414113">Table 2</xref>. The impact load was excited by an instrumented impact pencil. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0954406211414113">Figure 17</xref> shows the time histories measured by four sensors attached to the plate. The sampling frequency was 50 kHz and the cut-off frequency was 25 kHz. The upper frequency limit of antialiasing filters should be less than half the sampling frequency. Four impact loads were applied to the plate, and the impact phenomena were not clear in the measured signal because of overlapping and reflection. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954406211414113">Figure 18(a)</xref> shows the spectrogram for the raw signal measured at the one of the sensors. In order to prevent the overlapping problem, the band pass filter with a low frequency limit of 10 kHz and a high frequency limit of 20 kHz was applied to the measured signals. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954406211414113">Fig. 18(b)</xref> shows the spectrogram for the signal filtered using the band pass filter. According to these results, the heavy overlapping problem was solved by applying the band pass filter to the raw signal. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18-0954406211414113">Figure 18(b)</xref> shows the clear impact waveform. Next, the reflection wave should also be removed. In order to observe the reflection phenomena, for example, the signal generated by the fourth impact was cut and the cut signal was plotted as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0954406211414113">Fig. 19</xref>. There are two or three wavelets that can be seen in these signals. The first wavelet is the direct wave due to the fourth impact and the second wavelet or the third wavelet is a reflected wave from the edge of the plate. In order to remove the reflected waves from these signals, except for the first wavelet of the four signals, the other part of the signals was chopped as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-0954406211414113">Fig. 20</xref>. The chopping time <italic>t<sub>c</sub></italic> can be determined using the waveform which is obtained by the numerical analysis for the infinite plate, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211414113">Fig. 5</xref>. For the steel plate, the chopping time <italic>t<sub>c</sub></italic> was specified as 0.15 ms. The waveforms in the upper row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-0954406211414113">Fig. 20</xref> are the chopped signals which have the high frequency component at the end. This high frequency component hinders the successful application of TFA to get the arrival time difference. In order to smooth the high frequency component, the optimal linear-prediction filter was designed and applied to the chopped signal. The waveforms in the bottom row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-0954406211414113">Fig. 20</xref> represent the direct wave as smoothed by the linear-prediction filter in which the number of tap size <italic>M</italic> is 10. The number of tap size is changed until the envelope of predicted waveform is similar to that of chopped data. The smoothing of the direct waves due to the other impacts was obtained in the same fashion as that of the direct wave due to the fourth impact. The time-frequency method was applied to the smoothed direct waves to obtain the arrival time difference. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig21-0954406211414113">Fig. 21</xref> shows the results of TFA for the first three smoothed direct waves due to the fourth impact (which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig20-0954406211414113">Fig. 20</xref>). The SWFOMS time-frequency method was applied to these signals. In the figures, the horizontal axis presents time and the vertical axis presents frequency. The dashed lines in the center part in each map correspond to the peak amplitude. The arrival time difference for the waveform measured by the sensors was obtained from the time difference of the three dashed lines shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22-0954406211414113">Fig. 22</xref>(d). The time differences due to other impacts were obtained in the same fashion as in the case of the fourth impact, and their results are plotted serially in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig22-0954406211414113">Fig. 22</xref>. The theoretical group velocity and phase velocity for the A<sub>0</sub> mode in a steel plate were obtained by reference to elastodynamics theory. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig23-0954406211414113">Fig. 23</xref>. The locations of impact loads were estimated by using triangulation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig24-0954406211414113">Figure 24</xref> shows the locations of the impact loads as estimated by triangulation based on the arrival time difference, which was obtained by using the SWFOMS for the pre-processed signal and the theoretical group velocity. The circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig24-0954406211414113">Fig. 24</xref> indicate the true impact locations and the numbers indicate the serial impact locations estimated by the novel method proposed in this article. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954406211414113">Table 3</xref> explains the comparison between true value and estimated value. There was some discrepancy between the true locations and the estimated locations. This error was caused by the theoretical group velocity and by some experimental error due to impact location and sensor position. The theoretical group velocity is not exact due to the properties of the tested material.

<p>This article presents a new approach for the source localization of multiple impacts in an isotropic plate structure. The proposed approach is based on a pre-processing method. The pre-processing method is to filter the measured waveform by using a band pass filter conditioned to select for low frequency <italic>f<sub>L</sub></italic> and a linear-prediction filter designed using Wiener-Horf optimization theory. Two major problems must be overcome to achieve source localization of serial multiple impacts: the overlapping of dispersive waves induced by multiple impacts and the reflection of those waves at the edge of the plate. The overlapping problem can be solved by adapting a band pass filter. The low frequency limit <italic>f<sub>L</sub></italic> is suggested for the band pass filter by reference to the relationship between impact interval Δ and the arrival time <italic>t<sub>L</sub></italic> of the dispersive waves at that low frequency <italic>f<sub>L</sub></italic>. The selection of the sensor to measure the Lamb wave in the plate should be carefully considered because of the high frequency limitation. If an accelerometer is selected, a high frequency limit is required because of its resonance frequency. In this study, a piezo-electronic displacement sensor was designed for the measurement of displacement without limitation at high frequencies. The reflection problem can be solved by chopping the filtered waveform to get only the direct wave and by smoothing the chopped wave through a linear-prediction filter in order to smooth the high frequency component at the chopped segment. The chopping time <italic>t<sub>c</sub></italic> is determined by using the time history of the simulated wave, which is numerically calculated. Details of the procedure for the source localization of multiple impacts are illustrated in this study by applying the proposed method to an isotropic steel plate. The method successfully localized the sources of five serial impacts.</p>

<title> APPENDIX 2. SLICED SWFOMS</title>
<p>The general Wigner higher order moment spectra (WHOMS) of order <italic>n</italic> + 1 for signal <italic>x</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is defined by Fonollosa and Nikias [20] as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula12-0954406211414113"><label>(12)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211414113-eq12.tif"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>where <italic>n</italic> = 1 and <italic>n</italic> = 3 are the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) and the Wigner fourth order moment spectrum (WFOMS), respectively. Although the WHOMS has significant resolution advantages over other time-frequency methods, its application is obstructed by problems associated with cross/interference terms. In general, the <italic>n</italic> + 1th order Wigner distribution for two-component signals is the sum of 2<sup><italic>n</italic>+1</sup> distributions, of which two are auto-terms and 2<sup><italic>n</italic>+1</sup>−2 are cross-terms. To reduce these cross-terms, it is common to consider a subset of the WHOMS called the principal slice. The principal slice is defined as the only plane in which a single complex exponential appears as a Dirac delta. This plane for the WFOMS is obtained by setting <italic>f</italic><sub>1</sub> = −<italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub> = <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub> = <italic>f</italic> and <italic>n</italic> = 3 in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula12-0954406211414113">equation (12)</xref>. This is called the SWFOMS. This slice generally includes both auto-terms and cross-terms, and the number of cross-terms is significantly reduced. The remained oscillating cross-terms are smoothed via conventional smoothing, which is processed by multiplying the ambiguity function of the SWFOMS by the kernel function. However, conventional smoothing fails to reduce the non-oscillating cross-terms [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954406211414113">21</xref></bold>] since these non-oscillatory terms are difficult to distinguish from the auto-terms. In order to effectively smooth the non-oscillating cross-terms in the SWFOMS, consider the frequency version of the WVD</p>

To evaluate <italic>J</italic>, a third quantity is required, the variance of <italic>x</italic>(<italic>n</italic>). We now consider these three quantities, one by one:</p>

<p>The tap inputs <italic>x</italic>(<italic>n</italic> − 1), <italic>x</italic>(<italic>n</italic> − 2),…, <italic>x</italic>(<italic>n</italic> − <italic>M</italic>) define the <italic>M</italic> by 1 tap input vector, <bold>x</bold>(n - 1), as shown by

<list-item>
<p>The cross-correlation vector between the tap input <italic>x</italic>(<italic>n</italic> − 1),…, <italic>x</italic>(<italic>n</italic> − <italic>M</italic>) and the desired response <italic>x</italic>(<italic>n</italic>) equals

<list-item>
<p>The variance of <italic>x</italic>(<italic>n</italic>) is equal to <italic>r</italic>(0), since <italic>x</italic>(<italic>n</italic>) has zero mean.</p>
<p>By using these three quantities, the Wiener-Hopf equation to solve the forward linear prediction problem is obtained and given by
