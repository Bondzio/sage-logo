<abstract>
<p>Carl Henry Alstrom first described the syndrome in 1959.<sup>1</sup> It is a rare autosomal recessive, single gene, multi system disorder characterised by early onset retinal (progressive cone rod) dystrophy with profound visual loss, childhood obesity with insulin resistance, hyperinsulinaemia and diabetes, sensorineural hearing loss, dilated cardiomyopathy as well as progressive renal and hepatic dysfunction. We present a case of Alstrom syndrome diagnosed in a 34 year old male subject followed by a brief review of its clinical presentation</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 34 year old male referred by ophthalmology to our diabetes clinic with poor metabolic control. He was diagnosed to have type 2 diabetes at the age of 27 years when he presented with abdominal pain and osmotic symptoms with an HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 11.2 %. There was no family history of diabetes and he was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 25 years along with a severe mixed dyslipidaemia. All investigations for secondary hypertension were negative.</p>
<p>On physical examination, he was noted to be significantly overweight with a BMI of 36 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and central adiposity. He did not have any evidence of micro or macrovascular complications. He wore hearing aids in both ears and was noted to have nystagmus with perception of light in both eyes. He had normal anterior segments apart from bilateral early sub capsular cataracts with normal intraocular pressures. A fundus examination showed the presence of bilateral pigmentary retinopathy with a slightly pale optic disc. There was no evidence of poly- or syndactyly suggestive of BBS.</p>
<p>His diabetes was initially treated with metformin and then pioglitazone. His glycaemic control continued to be suboptimal due to his poor diet and reduced mobility. He was intolerant to GLP-1 therapy and was eventually commenced on insulin.</p>
<p>He was also treated with ezetimibe and nicotinic acid as he was intolerant to statins &amp; fibrates. His liver enzymes were slightly abnormal with an isolated elevated γGT .There were no stigmata of chronic liver disease and an ultrasound scan was normal apart from fatty infiltration. He was also found to have hypogonadism and commenced on testosterone therapy.</p>
<p>His prior history included poor vision since the age of 8 when he was registered blind. His vision continued to deteriorate and by the age of 12 he just had perception of light with sensorineural deafness diagnosed at fifteen. He was also previously considered to have ocular albinism. Various ocular diagnoses were suggested including the possibility of Usher’s Syndrome (type 2). The diagnosis of Usher’s was questioned following a recent audiology appointment which led to the eventual diagnosis of AS.</p>

<p>He was noted to have a number of features which were not compatible with Usher’s. It was felt that the hearing loss was not typical. Furthermore he had nystagmus and profound visual loss in both eyes which are indicative of a very early onset of visual loss and the pattern of visual loss was also atypical in that his central vision was affected first and then his peripheral vision.</p>
<p>Usher’s syndrome presents typically with deafness and night blindness. Patients are generally hard of hearing rather than deaf, and their hearing does not degrade over time. They have retinitis pigmentosa with loss of peripheral fields causing tunnel vision and later generally progresses to complete blindness.</p>
<p>The ophthalmologic presentation and the characteristic cluster of clinical signs that include sensorineural hearing loss, severe cone rod dystrophy along with diabetes and hyperlipidaemia raised the possibility of Alstrom syndrome and the patient was referred for genetic analysis which confirmed a mutation in the ALMS1 (2p 13) gene.</p>
<p>A diagnosis of Alstrom syndrome was confirmed at the age of 34, 7 years after the initial diagnosis of diabetes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Alstrom syndrome is a rare disorder inherited in an autosomal recessive manner with varying range of clinical features. It is caused by mutation of a single gene called ALMS1 located in the region 13 of short arm of chromosome 2 (2p13) encoding a 461 KDa protein of unknown function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474651413478639">2</xref></sup> ALMS1 is widely expressed and localises to centrosomes and the base of the cilia. Cilia and flagella are evolutionally conserved organelles that project from cell surfaces and are found in a wide variety of cell types.</p>
<p>Ciliary motility is required for example for brain development and function, sexual reproduction and mucus clearance in the respiratory tract. In addition sensory cilia have been shown to play an important role in signal transduction. They are also involved in a wide range of cellular actions such as locomotion, chemo taxis and fluid movement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474651413478639">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recent evidence indicates that mutation in the ALMS1 gene causes ciliopathy which is an emerging class of human genetic disorders due to ciliary dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474651413478639">4</xref></sup> Evidence also suggests that Alstrom syndrome results from impaired ciliary function rather than abnormal development. BBS is thought to be caused by centrosome/basal body dysfunction which explains the significant overlap with Alstrom syndrome.</p>
<p>Endocrinological manifestations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474651413478639">6</xref></sup> include obesity which is an early and consistent feature observed in nearly all affected children. Excess weight gain does not usually begin until approximately 6 months to 1 year of age and may moderate after puberty. Although the precise cause of obesity is unknown, weight gain in these subjects is likely to be multifactorial. It could be due to the direct effects of gene alterations often accentuated by reduced physical activity as a consequence of associated sensory impairments. Hyperphagia and food obsession are usually seen and based on the expression pattern of ALMS1 in the mouse brain, a hypothalamic origin is thought to be possible. Abnormalities in leptin metabolism have also been reported. Subjects with Alstrom tend to have stunted growth. Birth weight is usually normal with normal growth velocity in the early years. However advanced bone age with premature epiphysis closure, along with a drop in growth velocity later in childhood predisposes to adult short stature. Growth hormone deficiency in isolation or in combination with other pituitary hormone deficiencies has been reported and may account for the short stature in some subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474651413478639">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474651413478639">8</xref></sup></p>

<p>Sexual development is often reported to be normal although infertility is likely in these patients. This could be the result of alterations in the gonadotrophic axis secondary to obesity or gonadal resistance to the action of gonadotrophins with hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism.</p>
<p>Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, have been observed in patients as young as 1 year of age, before the child develops obesity, with most going on to develop type 2 diabetes. Diabetes may be present as early as the age of 4, with the median age of onset being 16 years. Patients with Alstrom syndrome are more likely than those with BBS to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus in childhood, suggesting that ALMS1 might have a specific role in β-cell function and/or peripheral insulin signaling pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474651413478639">9</xref></sup> Acanthosis nigricans, a dermatological condition associated with insulin resistance has been observed in a proportion of subjects with Alstrom syndrome. Severe hypertriglyceridaemia can occur in association with various conditions including type 2 diabetes, obesity, renal and hepatic dysfunction and hypothyroidism, many features present in Alstrom syndrome. Both overt primary hypothyroidism and sub-clinical hypothyroidism have been noted in a proportion of subjects. The mechanism however, remains unknown.</p>
<p>Due to variable phenotypic expression, subjects affected with the disease rarely manifest all the symptoms at the same time but develop them throughout childhood and adolescence, making it difficult to diagnose the condition.</p>
<p>Early diagnosis of the condition remains a challenge not only because symptoms develop over a period of time but also the similarity with other syndromes.</p>
<p>It remains important to distinguish Alstrom syndrome from other disorders characterized by childhood obesity and retinal dystrophy, such as the Laurence-Moon and BBS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474651413478639">10</xref></sup> Normal mentation and lack of poly/syndactyly help to distinguish Alstrom syndrome from BBS, while deafness and the absence of spastic paraparesis help to differentiate Alstrom syndrome from Laurence-Moon.</p>
<p>There is no specific therapy and individuals are monitored and treated on the basis of their symptoms.</p>
<p>This case accurately describes Alstrom syndrome. Our patient had retinal dystrophy, sensorineural deafness, obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, and hypogonadism. Once the diagnosis was confirmed by gene identification, the patient was seen and supported by Alstrom syndrome UK support group.</p>
