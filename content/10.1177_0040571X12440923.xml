<p>I love sport. Few of my memories of theological education are as strong as playing cricket fairly well (and losing) or playing football very badly (and winning). Yet what mattered in both cases was less the sport than the friendships that I made and enjoyed through it. Though the online lottery by means of which tickets were sold for the London Olympics and Paralympic Games did not result in any tickets being available to my household, I’ll be following the Games with real pleasure.</p>
<p>The essays in this issue of <italic>Theology</italic> all relate to sport. The reason for this is, of course, the coincidence of this issue with the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games. That is a good pretext; but we could just as appropriately have run this issue at any time because sport is so rarely out of the headlines. As I write this editorial the British media is full of the resignation of the England football manager and of the clearance by an English court of another prominent football manager on charges of tax evasion. Next week the stories will have changed and so too may the particular sport: but we can be pretty sure that sport will feature somewhere in both the news and the sporting sections.</p>
<p>As Parker and Weir make clear in this issue, the relationship of Christianity and sport in the modern era, for all that it has undergone development, has been a consistently important one. For a significant period Christians were instrumental in promoting sport at home – and abroad. Today, the Olympics in particular and sport in general continue to present the churches with challenges, to which British churches have responded thoughtfully and imaginatively, as David Cornick shows. In addition to historical and missiological questions, however, does sport also provoke theological questions? From a Christian point of view is sport good, bad or indifferent? What, in short, does God make of sport?</p>
<p>In Hugh Hudson’s 1981 film <italic>Chariots of Fire</italic> we are afforded one positive example of a Christian sportsman. The film portrays real characters and events leading up to and including the 1924 Paris Olympic Games. At the centre of the story are two athletes with what we are given to believe are rather contrasting characters. What makes the film work, however, is that both men share a commitment to athletic excellence, and both men are equally admirable. Harold Abrahams, in Colin Welland’s well-researched script, is utterly determined – if he can’t win he won’t run. This leads him to a ‘professional’ attitude towards his ‘amateur’ sport that attracts criticism. Eric Liddell is, by contrast, modest, self-effacing and deeply Christian. In the film Liddell’s sister Jennie is critical of her brother’s determination to compete. But in her case her doubts are driven by a sense that Liddell’s running is distracting him from his true calling to be an evangelist. In a key scene Eric Liddell tells his sister, ‘I believe that God made me for a purpose. But He also made me fast, and when I run I feel his pleasure.’</p>
<p>Liddell is played in the film by the late Ian Charleson who succeeds brilliantly in the difficult job of making a kind and modest man likeable on screen. In another scene, one that in less capable hands could have become sickly sweet, we see Liddell reading from Isaiah 40 on the Sabbath on which his principles kept him from competing: ‘they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint’. It’s powerful stuff (and its emphasis on the everlasting strength of youth is a reason it features frequently in Remembrance Day liturgies). Yet when this passage last cropped up in the Common Lectionary it was accompanied by another reading that could cast a rather different light on the question of what view God takes of sport. In Psalm 147 the Psalmist tells us as unequivocally as he may that God ‘delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man. The Lord takes pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy’. It is a view Paul understood, for all his use of athletic imagery, as Bradley Arnold shows. What Paul intends for the Christians at Philippi to whom he writes is not that they should take up sport but that they should align their lives to the life of Christ Jesus.</p>
