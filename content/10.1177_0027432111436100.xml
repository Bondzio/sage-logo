<p>In the Reston, Virginia, headquarters of the National Association for Music Education, there’s a huge picture of a band, chorus, and orchestra at the MENC Golden Anniversary bash in St. Louis, Missouri, dated April 16, 1956. I’m the clarinet player in the third row on the left front with the shocking white shoes—the only male so attired. Why the white shoes? There’s a story here.</p>
<p>As a high school musician, I was chosen to play in the first ever all-American band. Dad and Mom didn’t have what’s now termed the “disposable income” to send me. I was a senior, still riding my bike to school. It was 1956, and singer Pat Boone was big on the pop music charts. Every kid on the block wanted a pair of shoes called “white bucks” just like Pat wore.</p>
<p>Being the sinister character I guess I was, and knowing that Dad was going to somehow find the money so I could get a round-trip train ticket to St. Louis for this stellar event, I convinced my folks that the entire band was going to be wearing the “white bucks” that were so popular, and I’d need a pair. It actually worked … to a point.</p>
<p>The wonderful memories of that breathtaking concert and its requisite rehearsals still reverberate in this aging head as I gaze up at my framed copy of that commemorative picture on the wall in front of my desk. I was the only guy in the whole concert of a thousand or so in white bucks. That little “white” lie bites me every time I look at it. But that picture is the icon of my entry into what I would later call professional music. My folks were really cool. They never mentioned my white buck duplicity. Instead, they took pride in my musical accomplishments. But it was MENC’s approval of my music skills that gave me the corroboration I needed to begin a serious pursuit of music.</p>
<p>My undergraduate years were accomplished at the SUNY (State University of New York) Fredonia, where I spent more time in a practice room (and enjoying the dating scene) than I did in front of my textbooks. In my senior year there, I auditioned for entry into the United States Military Academy (USMA) Band at West Point, New York. By the skin of my teeth I was accepted, and as an enlisted soldier there, I completed my military service. In the evenings, after duty hours, I’d drive to New York City, where at Teachers College, Columbia University, and the Juilliard School of Music, I earned a dual master’s degree in music and music education. I worked my butt off during those three years trying to become a real teacher of music. I had begun to realize that I didn’t know as much as I thought I knew. During that period, I married my undergrad sweetheart, Mary Ann Frasier, who was also my accompanist. She’s been both to me for more than fifty years now. Her accompanying didn’t end at the piano—she’s accompanied me in all my career endeavors.</p>
<p>In 1963, I began teaching instrumental music in a small central school district in western New York (grades 4–12) and three years later applied for the position of instrumental teacher at the Campus Lab Elementary School at SUNY Geneseo. I really wanted that job because it was connected to a university. Why I won out over the other candidates, I’ll never know, but I got the position, and even before I knew what it meant, I was anointed an assistant professor. When I began teaching there, only two kids in the fourth through sixth grades could read music. By my second year, I had a sixty-piece orchestra with winds (hey, nobody told me it couldn’t be done, and boy, was I naïve!), an eighty-member concert band, and a marching band comprising 120 students. How? I made my job my life, and my wife Mary Ann backed me up all the way. I was asked to also become director of the university’s band and, later, the marching band. Also, just because, I guess, my life wasn’t busy enough, and at the urging of my music department colleagues, I began giving periodic Sunday afternoon clarinet recitals.</p>
<p>It was sometime during those second and third years there that I realized that I really didn’t know as much about music, or teaching, as I should. I was doing way more “faking” than I wanted to. Where? Oh yeah—I forgot to mention—I’d also taken on the responsibilities of community orchestra director as well as leading a local church choir. Many of those folks asked musical questions to which I didn’t have the answers. I knew I needed more.</p>
<p>I inquired about doctoral programs at a few venerable universities, and soon I got a phone call from a very nice old professor at Florida State University (FSU) in Tallahassee. He told me that FSU would like to have me as a doctoral student. I was flattered, and they had me hooked—lock, stock, and clarinet. By now, we had two children and a mortgage. We sold our house and moved to Florida.</p>

<p>What the nice old professor had neglected to tell me (and I had neglected to ask) was that there was to be a barrage of entrance exams to take, and no, I had <italic>not</italic> been accepted into the university—or the School of Music. Also, the mobile home we were going to be living in and had put a down payment on had not yet been built. Oops. We were in a new city, homeless, clueless, and jobless. I was thirty-two years old, married, and the father of two preschool kids. So much for careful planning.</p>
<p>At the School of Music at FSU, I auditioned on clarinet and flute, took a theory placement exam, took a nasty “Name That Tune” serious music identification test (and if I may toot my own clarinet just once, it was rumored that I got the highest mark in the history of the school). Then, there was the music faculty interview, where I was given an open orchestral score, was told not to look at the cover and to tell them everything I could about what was on those two open pages—and could I also please tell them the musical period it represented. Oh, yeah—I still had to face the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). And I thought my previous gig had been a challenge!</p>
<p>I was finally accepted into the FSU doctoral program during that first semester, and I was working harder than I ever had. We finally started living in our cute mobile home, and with the able help of my lifelong accompanist, I earned a doctorate in music education. You bet Mary Ann Wagner gets partial credit for the pedigree I wear. In 1973, I was hired at Florida International University (FIU), the newest campus of the FSU System, which was, at that point, a single building in the middle of the former Tamiami Airport west of Miami. Our fledgling campus had 757 students enrolled when I arrived. FIU is where my real life’s work began.</p>
<p>Thirty-one years later at my retirement, FIU had 36,000 students. I had helped build a university, written two textbooks, published some thirty articles and research, raised two kids, and traveled all over the world lecturing, and I am the very proud possessor of countless former students everywhere, who, I hope, will emulate the values, skills, and information passed on to them. And still happily married—whew!</p>
<p>Who would have thought? It all started with a pair of white bucks.</p>
