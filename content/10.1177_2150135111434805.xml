<p>Foreign bodies in the heart are uncommon in children. These are often removed even if asymptomatic to prevent complications like erosion, embolization, bleeding, thrombosis, and endocarditis. We report the case of a one-and-a-half-year-old child with a hypodermic needle in the heart which was found incidentally and removed successfully by surgery.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Foreign bodies in the heart are uncommon in children, and only few cases have been reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111434805">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111434805"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111434805"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111434805"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111434805">5</xref></sup> Needles, bamboo sticks, glass pieces, retained catheter fragments, and metal pieces are the various foreign bodies that have been reported. We are presenting this case where a hypodermic needle, broken at the hub, was recovered from the heart of a child. Retrieval of a broken hypodermic needle from the heart has not been reported so far. Of special interest is the fact that it was possibly an iatrogenic event in the neonatal period that was incidentally detected at 18 months of age.</p>
<sec id="section2-2150135111434805">
<title>Case Summary</title>
<p>A one-and-a half-year-old-female child was alleged to have swallowed a button. A chest X-ray (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111434805">Figure 1A</xref>
) ordered by the primary physician revealed a metallic object in the mediastinum. Subsequently, chest computed tomography scan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135111434805">Figure 1B</xref>) revealed a 23 × 1.5 mm linear foreign body in the right ventricle. The motion of the object appeared to be the same with each cardiac contraction. There was no evidence of thrombus or pericardial effusion. The child was asymptomatic and stable. There was no history of trauma. Echocardiography revealed a structurally normal heart with a foreign body embedded in the right ventricle and mild tricuspid regurgitation.</p>

<p>Percutaneous retrieval of the foreign body was attempted since a right ventriculogram was suggestive of partial protrusion of the needle into the right ventricle cavity, but it failed. The baby was taken for surgery. The pericardium was normal and there was no pericardial fluid. There were adhesions in the region of the inferior surface of the heart, close to the acute margin. The tip of the needle could be palpated on the diaphragmatic surface of the heart. Initially an attempt was made to retrieve the needle without instituting cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The epicardial surface was incised between stay sutures. While dissecting further, it was realized that the needle was deeply embedded in the myocardium but not protruding into the ventricular cavity. Hence, the needle was retrieved by a deeper incision into the ventricular myocardium. Ultimately, CPB was established as we felt that an inadvertent entry into the right ventricle could lead to catastrophic hemorrhage. It was possible to grasp the foreign body with a needle holder, and it was extracted without entering the ventricular cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135111434805">Figure 2</xref>
). The retrieval site was closed with polypropylene sutures. The postoperative recovery was uneventful.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The passage of pointed objects, for example, pins and needles, into the heart wall is possible through 4 main routes: (<italic>a</italic>) insertion of the needle directly into a blood vessel and subsequent migration to the heart, (<italic>b</italic>) insertion of the object into soft tissues distant from the heart and subsequent slow migration through the tissues to the heart, (<italic>c</italic>) direct introduction of a pointed object through the chest wall into the heart, (<italic>d</italic>) penetration of a needle, imbedded in the distal esophagus, into the heart. Seven cases of foreign bodies in the heart have been reported so far in children below 12 years of age (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2150135111434805">Table 1</xref>
). The youngest case reported is that of a 40-day-old infant. Our case is the third case to be reported in the age group of less than two years.</p>

<p>Most often it becomes very difficult to know the time and portal of entry of these foreign bodies in pediatric patients. In our case, the retrieved foreign body was a broken hypodermic needle. The child had history of hospitalization during the neonatal period. She had undergone hematological investigations and received intravenous antibiotics during her hospital stay. There were no other hospitalizations or phlebotomies in the past. In some neonatal intensive care units, it is a practice to use a “broken needle technique” for collecting blood from a peripheral vein. This technique involves breaking the plastic hub cap off the hypodermic needle to allow easy dripping of blood into the collection tubes. This technique was perceived by Roberton and Rennie to facilitate blood sampling from neonates but was also noted by them for its obvious drawbacks. Despite the risks involved, this technique is still practiced in some peripheral hospitals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111434805">6</xref></sup> In this case, it was speculated that the hypodermic needle could have entered her heart accidentally during hospital stay either through the mechanism of intravenous migration as a result of phlebotomy or by direct entry through the thoracic wall.</p>
<p>Therapeutic intervention in an asymptomatic patient is controversial. In a retrospective analysis of iatrogenic foreign bodies in the heart, ActisDato et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111434805">5</xref></sup> had recommended that foreign bodies that are diagnosed immediately after injury should be removed, even if asymptomatic. But if diagnosed later, these foreign bodies may be treated conservatively, especially if they are completely embedded in the myocardium.</p>
<p>Retrospective review by Schechter and Gilbert<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111434805">7</xref></sup> of 157 cardiac wounds included three patients with a needle in the heart. They recommended the removal of all intracardiac foreign bodies, even if clinically silent, due to the theoretical risk of late embolic, inflammatory, and septic complications.</p>
<p>It is difficult to make definite recommendations for intervening in these patients as the data available is limited to single case reports or small series; therefore, we recommend that the management of these patients be individualized. We support the conclusions of LeMaire et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111434805">8</xref></sup> that observation without operation should be limited to cases that meet the following criteria: (<italic>a</italic>) the foreign body is small (less than 1 cm) and smooth, (<italic>b</italic>) contamination of the foreign body is minimal (ie, it has not traversed a viscus), and (<italic>c</italic>) the patient remains asymptomatic during close follow-up. Although nonoperative management is an option in selected patients, as mentioned above, early surgical removal remains a safe and effective approach in preventing complications, especially in children. In our case, although the child was asymptomatic, we opted for removal of the broken needle as it was &gt;1 cm in size, the route of entry was not known, and the parents preferred excision.</p>
