<p>What an honor and privilege it is to be installed as the next President of this great Association.</p>
<p>AADR has played a powerful role in shaping my academic career. As I reflect on my experiences of the past 26 years, I am grateful for all that I have learned from fellow AADR members and staff. Such reflection makes me realize how much I owe to the organization in which I literally grew up.</p>
<p>It was at the annual meetings where − as a graduate student and fledgling dental faculty member − I learned how best to organize and present research data and to deliver my first talk. I experienced the elation of being selected as a Hatton Award finalist and the intense disappointment of not being the one receiving the award. At AADR annual meetings, I built bridges to the outside world through a rich and diverse network of AADR members –bridges leading to life-long collaborations and friendships with colleagues whose guidance has sustained and enhanced my career. My service on various committees provided an understanding of how the organization is run and gave me first-hand experience in leadership, mentoring, and team-building.</p>
<p>As a whole, these experiences with AADR have greatly facilitated the fulfillment of my own career goals and passions, which are to advance research in the area of craniofacial biology and medicine and to train clinician-scientists for successful careers in academic research. Thus, it is with a deep sense of indebtedness, humility, and pride that I accept the responsibility of being the 40<sup>th</sup> President of AADR.</p>
<p>So I ask you today, what will the next 40 years be like for AADR? What can we do today to ensure a sustainable and bright future for this, our flagship organization? How do we continue to serve as the nation’s strongest voice for dental, oral, and craniofacial research and thus maintain dentistry as a learned profession? How do we inform our policymakers that good oral health is essential for good overall health? What can we do today to ensure a robust pipeline of biomedical researchers with interdisciplinary interests and leadership skills that will continue to transform AADR throughout the 21<sup>st</sup> century?</p>
<p>Over the past several years, AADR leaders have considered these questions and − based on your input − have adopted strategies to better integrate AADR’s missions into the fabric of dental schools while creating new and diverse services for our members. AADR’s mission is thus to advance research and increase knowledge for the improvement of oral health; to support and represent the oral health research community; and to facilitate the communication and application of research findings.</p>
<p>In the next year, the Board will launch three important strategic initiatives, the success of which will depend upon the involvement of you, our members.</p>
<p>The first initiative is to expand our membership on all fronts. It is evident that the future of AADR’s success lies not only in the elected leadership but also in its membership. Our Association is comprised of approximately 3,700 diverse individuals – the largest Division of the more than 11,000 member International Association for Dental Research (IADR). However, there has been a steady decline in membership in the past ten years, both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of overall IADR membership. In his 2002 Presidential address, Dr. Charles Bertolami stated: “Oral health and the oral health sciences are being taken seriously by a much broader audience of health practitioners and scientists than ever before. With that recognition, we have to expect that the number of non-traditional participants in oral health research will go up, possibly dramatically. Therein lies an opportunity for AADR: At the very least, every NIDCR grantee (a significant percentage of whom are not AADR members) needs to be approached and vigorously encouraged to become a member. After all, these are already scientists who have evinced interest and success in our field.” This call for action was followed by another from President Mary MacDougall in 2005 when she led the Board and volunteer members to increase membership in all categories, especially student researchers.</p>
<p>Since then, AADR has been strategic in its recruitment and retention efforts and has continued to increase its benefits and services to enhance the overall membership experience. All dental and craniofacial researchers should feel at home in AADR, no matter where they are based. Besides attracting faculty colleagues and students from within our departments and dental schools, what a difference it would make to attract colleagues who share our interests in craniofacial research who are based in Schools of Medicine, Public Health, Engineering, Pharmacy, and Nursing!</p>
<p>The second initiative is legislative advocacy, an activity that we, as members, tend to consider someone else’s responsibility. The leaders of AADR understand how critical it is to raise the profile of oral health research and advocate for additional resources, particularly NIH and NIDCR funding, and they currently play a strong advocacy role in this regard. However, as with new-member recruitment, advocating for the future of oral health research is most productive when coupled with the collective voices of AADR members. Through its online <bold>Action Center</bold>, AADR provides tools for members to contact elected officials about the latest issues that are important to the dental research community. This mechanism is just one way AADR is able to galvanize its membership through its advocacy programs.</p>
<p>AADR recently implemented additional methods to engage members and dental research professionals by launching its <bold>Government Affairs blog</bold>. If you sign on, you will have access to Capitol Hill news and updates, as well as to important funding opportunities to help you develop new research.</p>
<p>The third initiative recognizes that expanding the Association and shaping our future is contingent upon developing stronger coalitions with key stakeholders. By continuing to expand its partnership with NIDCR and NIH and by spearheading joint initiatives with ADEA and other dental organizations, AADR will maintain the profession’s science base. A priority continues to be to develop an active group of student members who eventually become lifelong members. I am so proud that our National Student Research Group, NSRG, now celebrating its 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary, represents almost 30% of our overall membership. The NSRG strives to foster an environment in every dental school whereby students interested in enriching their dental education through research are encouraged to do so. If we − as members − properly mentor our students and encourage them to join the NSRG, we will introduce them to the lifelong benefits of a research career and AADR membership, which in turn will help secure the future of oral health research.</p>
<p>From these closing ceremonies you will know that AADR affords students a plethora of opportunities and awards to advance and be recognized in their respective research professions. In addition, AADR keeps students abreast of NIDCR research training opportunities that can aid in making a research career more attainable.</p>
<p>Clearly, there are opportunities for members to be engaged at every level. Once you select a strategic initiative with which you can help, I offer two suggestions on how to channel your interests. One way is to volunteer to serve on a standing committee. Another is to play a role within your local AADR Section – crucial in the year ahead. Sections can keep our visibility and goals at the forefront as we engage all our stakeholders. Use the AADR Banner to co-sponsor a Research Scholars Day where all student and faculty researchers from within and outside your dental school can participate. By inviting district legislators, patient advocates, alumni, and practicing dentists, we can bring more visibility to the impact of our work on the public’s health and hence to AADR.</p>
<p>Before I conclude, there are special people whose support and encouragement in one way or another have made my life’s journey meaningful and fun: Richard, my husband of 33 years, and our two wonderful children, Neisha and Rohan, who give me everything in life I value; my mentors – Bar Levy, who was my PhD advisor; Charles Bertolami, Ron Billings, Edith Morrison, and Larry Tabak.</p>
<p>Second, the unflagging commitment of Dr. Christopher Fox, our Executive Director, in guiding the Board in these years of transition as we strategized a new governance model is greatly appreciated. Under Chris’s direction, the talented and devoted staff at Global Headquarters makes our annual meetings and other activities successful. It is this team that makes us look good every day of each year, all of the time. Finally, the outstanding work of the AADR Board of Directors, led by President Jeffrey Ebersole, provides a strong platform from which to launch some exciting initiatives in the coming year. A special acknowledgment also goes to Blake Warner and Kaitrin Baloue, whose hard work and commitment have helped advance the NSRG and its missions.</p>
<p>And last but not least, my students, past and present, who continue to inspire me, and an amazing group of faculty and staff in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at Baylor College of Dentistry whose loyalty and hard work make it possible for me to commit time and effort to this Presidency.</p>
<p>Thank you for attending the 41st Annual Meeting &amp; Exhibition of the American Association for Dental Research, held in conjunction with the Annual Meeting of the Canadian Association for Dental Research. We appreciate your participation and hope that you will benefit greatly from this opportunity.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with you over the next year to help our organization thrive through new membership, new science, new stakeholder relations, and new legislation. Driven by the passions we share for discovery and mentorship, let us together shape the brightest and most hopeful future for AADR.</p>
