<p>Frederick Wherry’s book <italic>The Culture of Markets</italic> provides an informative if brief account of cultural approaches to the study of markets as they’ve been developed in economic sociology. The book follows a narrative structure that while theoretically unintuitive, offers a comfortable tour through the ways that economic sociologists have examined the roles that culture plays in the structuring of behavior in markets. Rather than focus on a basic theoretical account of markets, followed by a critique of this account from the perspective of culturally minded economic sociologists, Wherry runs through a series of topics at the core of markets, and shows how research from economic sociology, behavioral psychology, and neighboring disciplines have shed light on phenomena thought to either have nothing to do with culture, or to be the underlying forces driving cultural practices in markets, namely demand, supply, and money/prices.</p>
<p>Wherry’s chapter on the role of culture in demand touches on social groups as incubators for tastes and consumptive behavior, on history and path dependence as forces shaping demand, and on marketing as the strategic use of culture to drive consumption. In each of these sections the author details the ways in which culture is important for understanding demand. Beginning with the shaping of consumption by social groups, Wherry focuses on status groups, circuits, and interaction ritual chains as drivers of consumptive behavior. After this account the author moves on to describe path dependent development and the role of ‘historical accident’ in structuring market demand, and finally on to marketing as a force shaping demand. The essential point of this section is that consumption carries meaning, defined within a situational social context. Appeals to accounts of identity formation are made throughout this section, and seem to be the thread holding these cultural accounts of market consumption together; however this is never drawn out explicitly.</p>
<p>Next Wherry turns to the ways that culture shapes supply. This section proceeds with a tour through three themes including national institutional logics, organizational culture, and categories. The central point of this section is that culture shapes the ways in which people and societies have approached solutions to problems and defined roles or developed expectations. Wherry quickly moves through industrial organization, national identity, the basic interactions of exchange, organizational roles and ethics, symbols and performance in exchange, and how categories shape expectations in economic interactions. Clearly this a vast range of topics to cover, made larger by the volume of research on them in the world of economic sociology. The sheer number of topics covered here makes this part of the book seem unfocused at times. For example, sociological work on traders in financial markets is fit into the subsection on organizational cultures, and while Wherry’s review does a nice job of highlighting the ways in which culture shapes the economic interactions between individual traders, without a larger organizational context, it seems ill fitting. Turning to money and prices, Wherry divides the discussion into national money, market money, and household money. This section revolves around the central point of Zelizer’s research into money (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580913477959">Zelizer, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580913477959">2001</xref>), that money is not a fungible medium for exchange, but rather is a carrier of meaning, a source and expression of identity. Here he covers the creation and uses of national currencies, the ways in which social convention, roles, and authority shape market prices in auctions and financial markets, and how social meanings shape the ways that money is treated differently by people based on their gender or class position and used differently depending upon its source. This section feels more directed than the previous sections; although this is not surprising as the sheer number of sociological studies in this area is relatively limited.</p>
<p>Overall, the tactic of forgoing a separate theoretical discussion <italic>ex-ante</italic> is inviting, but has some real consequences for the coherence of the text. As mentioned in the paragraphs above, the thematic forest of each section is sometimes lost for the trees of specific research examples. Often, this approach leaves the reader groping for links between currently disparate research programs which are often presented side by side. For example, research in the neoinstitutionalist tradition focusing on cognition and taken-for-granted approaches to problem solving is presented along with work in the Goffmanian tradition focusing on symbols and performance in exchange interaction and policy development. Clearly these approaches have things in common as well as areas in which they can learn from one another, but without drawing out their similarities and differences we are left wondering how they fit together. Each of Wherry’s three thematic sections could benefit from a clearer delineation of what the examples within them have in common and how they differ from each other.</p>
<p>Beyond the organization of the book, two core subjects are noticeably missing from the overall discussion. First, there is virtually no attention paid to the role power plays in the work of economic sociologists. While this is reflective of the difficulties that sociologists focusing on culture and cognition have integrating notions of power into accounts of the ways that culture shapes behavior, its absence is glaring nonetheless. Second, given the organization of the book into sections covering research in economic sociology addressing essential elements of markets (demand and consumption, supply and production, money and prices), the ways in which culture shapes competition in markets is notably absent. Wherry touches on this in the section on supply through the effects of national culture on the organization of production, but the ways in which culture shapes competitive processes like legitimate avenues of differentiation are missing.</p>
<p>The absence of competition and power from the discussion of research in cultural economic sociology is a reflection of the state of the discipline rather than an oversight by Wherry, but their absence should be called out. Untangling how a cultural economic sociology treats the exercise of power and the ways that market actors understand competition is crucial because they touch each of Wherry’s thematic groups including the organization of production, the forces of consumption, and the medium of exchange. These are explicit areas of weakness in the research program that need to be addressed in future work if the growing literature is to continue its developmental momentum.</p>
<p>Despite the issues laid out, this book is a success. The breadth of the issues being attacked is daunting. Even so, Wherry does a nice job of covering the terrain and focusing the reader on the essentials of the research program. Ultimately, this book serves as a nice introduction to a key research agenda in economic sociology and is eminently suitable for undergraduate initiation into the field. For more advanced scholars, it is valuable as an extended review piece summarizing a lot of existing research in the area. If you are looking for something breaking new ground, look elsewhere, but if you are playing catch up, are just breaking into the field, are in need of a signpost to orient your research, or just want a refresher, <italic>The Culture of Markets</italic> has something to offer.</p>
