<p><italic>Metamorphoses</italic> is mould-breaking, not only in subject matter, but also in its potential to change and develop our understanding of ancient Christian ideas about personal becoming and change, both in this life and the next. There are very few other recent substantial treatments of metamorphosis in Christian antiquity, and none that provides a more challenging problematisation of the scope and significance of the concept. It is the first volume in a new de Gruyter series edited by John Levison, whose purpose is to explore facets of religious experience in antiquity using a range of methods and kinds of evidence. Seim and Økland’s edited volume collects fifteen essays arising from the work of an international research group on ‘Metamorphoses: Resurrection, Taxonomies and Transformative Practices’, which was based at the Centre for Advanced Study in Oslo in 2006-07.</p>
<p>The essays cover a broad span of texts and interests. The editors are well aware that there is no ‘overarching theoretical model’; that the terminology, conceptions, dates and contexts are diverse, and that the scholarship stems from a ‘multifaceted ongoing exchange’ with a ‘wide-ranging outcome’. In many other essay collections such diversity would be deplored as incoherence, but in this collection it constitutes a strength. Individual essays provide close studies of texts and phenomena, while together they demonstrate the complexity of the topic, which resists analysis through a unitary taxonomy or evolutionary model of development. ‘Metamorphosis’ includes transformation, becoming, change and mutability; it touches issues of body, gender, selfhood, morality, identity and rhetoric.</p>
<p>Resurrection is the most prominent category of metamorphosis discussed, but the essays show that it was diversely understood. Økland’s bold and insightful reading of 1 Cor 15 and 2 Cor 12 argues that Paul was not concerned with continuity of the self, which later theology addressed with a post-Pauline concept of the soul; rather, he found continuity simply ‘in Christ’. Paul’s text, however, was diversely understood among his early readers, as several other papers in the volume underscore. The interpretation of the resurrection deeply divided early Christian groups, even though each of them claimed fidelity to Paul’s language. Several essays in <italic>Metamorphoses</italic> expand the horizon of the debate in unexpected and engaging ways. For example, Karen King discusses the problem of aging in early Christianity, arising from the apparent contradiction between manifest bodily decay and the immutability of eternal life. István Czachesz uses physiological analysis and psychological theory to explore how Christian images of the grotesque present unexpected shapes and transformations in order to contribute to the cognitive and emotional formation of their audiences.</p>
<p>This book is what a fine essay collection should be. It provides both a wealth of helpful case studies of individual texts, and many broader investigations of relevant concepts. The quality of individual contributions is high. Collectively, they draw out issues of significance to modernity and to antiquity, and indicate some of the relationships between the two. The book’s main title, shared with Ovid and Apuleius, recalls the problem of the connotations of ‘metamorphosis’ for Christians in a Greco-Roman world. Its contents, meanwhile, highlight the importance of the concept, and grapple engagingly with the terms, ideas, theologies and social histories in which it was enmeshed.</p>
