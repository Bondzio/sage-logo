<p>This is the last column I shall write for Australasian Psychiatry in my capacity as Honorary Secretary. By the time it is published the much vaunted changes to the College structure will have been implemented. There will undoubtedly be teething troubles, though the smaller Board will hopefully live up to the expectations of all who have sought change.</p>
<p>No longer will the RANZCP have an Honorary Secretary, this role having been split between the College Secretariat and the new Board.</p>
<p>In the last two years we have also given considerable thought to communication with the Fellowship, and whilst the periodic columns in Australasian Psychiatry may have fulfilled a valuable role previously, changes in technology mean that most communication is now via email.</p>
<p>The Psych-e bulletin and the regular President’s newsletter seem to have increasingly filled this need, and it has become easier to keep abreast of changes. In the future, you will notice substantial changes in the College Affairs section of this Journal. It will be shorter and there will no longer be the Honorary Secretary’s article. This should free up space for more clinical content and perhaps even for more lively correspondence.</p>
<p>The past couple of years have seen substantial changes in the College and it has been a privilege to be involved and at times caught up in the unfolding developments. I would like to express my thanks to the other members of the Executive and to all members of General Council during this time. The job could not have been done without the enthusiastic support of the CEO Andrew Peters, and the rest of his very able team.</p>
