<abstract>
<p>Test anxiety often interferes with a reliable evaluation of language learning, frustrating teachers and students alike. Most researchers have found a significant inverse relation between anxiety and written test performance. Although this situation leads to a distortion of test scores, suggestions for treating and coping with test anxiety have been sparse. Focusing on advanced reading comprehension in a foreign language, the present review summarizes the literature on anxiety connected with the language learning classroom, and offers recommendations for its alleviation.</p>
<p>This paper examines students’ suggestions for improving their feelings about tests. A nine-item questionnaire was administered to 265 students at the University of Haifa who were participating in three intermediate to advanced level reading comprehension courses in English as a Foreign Language (EFL). Students reported that they would like teachers to make two additions to the course: adding bonus exercises for extra points and giving more practice tests.</p>
<p>A Remedial Class of advanced reading comprehension in English as a Foreign Language is presented as an example of one way to apply these theories and recommendations.</p>

<title>Student Attitudes, Test Performance, and Test Anxiety</title>
<p>Test anxiety often interferes with a reliable evaluation of language learning, frustrating teachers and students alike. Most researchers have found a significant inverse relation between anxiety and test performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0033688212449511">Argaman and Abu-Rabia, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0033688212449511">Cassady, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212449511">Hembree, 1988</xref>: 48; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212449511">Kondo, 1997</xref>: 21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0033688212449511">MacIntyre, 1995</xref>: 96; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0033688212449511">Moutafi, Furnham, and Tsaousis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0033688212449511">Sarason and Sarason, 1990</xref>: 475). Between 15% to 35% of students are adversely affected by high test anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0033688212449511">Avinor, 2008</xref>: 8).</p>
<p>‘The classic example is the student who knows the material but “freezes up” on a test. Anxious students … may not be able to demonstrate the information that they have learned. Further, the cyclical relation between anxiety and task performance suggests that as students experience more failure, their anxiety level may increase even more’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0033688212449511">MacIntyre, 1995</xref>: 96-97). Highly anxious students tended to score about 12 percentile points below their low anxiety peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212449511">Hembree, 1988</xref>). The behavioral interpretation of text anxiety conceptualizes an interference model of test anxiety, where test anxiety disturbs the recall of prior learning and interferes with task-relevant activities by introducing preoccupations with worry, self-criticism, and somatic concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212449511">Hembree, 1988</xref>: 48). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0033688212449511">Stoeber (2004)</xref> describes four dimensions: worry, emotionality, interference, and lack of confidence.</p>
<p>Student personality traits have been found to affect academic examination performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0033688212449511">Zeidner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0033688212449511">Sarason and Sarason, 1990</xref>: 475; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0033688212449511">Spielberger, 1966</xref>). A list of six distinct, yet potentially overlapping, categories of anxious examinees is presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0033688212449511">Zeidner (1998)</xref>:</p>

<p>Ability, gender and ethnicity are also linked to test anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212449511">Hembree, 1988</xref>: 47). Language proficiency level has been found to have an inverse relationship with language test anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0033688212449511">Bensoussan and Zeidner, 1989</xref>: 45; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0033688212449511">Brantmeier, 2005</xref>: 67; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212449511">Horwitz, 2001</xref>: 121; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0033688212449511">Ipek (n.d.)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0033688212449511">MacIntyre, 1995</xref>: 91). Whereas females were found to exhibit higher test anxiety than males, this anxiety did not appear to affect test performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0033688212449511">Bensoussan and Zeidner, 1989</xref>: 47; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212449511">Hembree, 1988</xref>: 73; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0033688212449511">Ipek, n.d.</xref>). In the USA, black students in elementary school reported more test anxiety than did white students, a difference that declined to nonsignificance in high school. Moreover, Hispanic students across grade levels showed more test anxiety than did white students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212449511">Hembree, 1988</xref>: 73).</p>

<title>Language Learning Anxiety in the Classroom</title>
<p>Many students find language courses the most anxiety provoking ones that they take (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0033688212449511">MacIntyre, 1995</xref>: 90). ‘Language learning is a cognitive activity that relies on encoding, storage, and retrieval processes, and anxiety can interfere with each of these by creating a divided attention scenario for anxious students’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0033688212449511">1995</xref>: 96). Anxiety slows down the rate of vocabulary learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0033688212449511">1995</xref>: 91). It ‘consumes cognitive resources that might otherwise be applied to the task at hand’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212449511">Kondo and Yang, 2004</xref>: 258). Language learning anxiety is considered to be an unrealistic reaction to a particular situation. Anxious language learners feel uncomfortable with their abilities even if their objective abilities are good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212449511">Horwitz, 2001</xref>: 119). Language anxiety possesses cognitive elements (perceptions of test difficulty and fairness, and negative self-related cognition) and emotional components (anxiety and motivation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0033688212449511">MacIntyre, 1995</xref>: 91; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0033688212449511">Zeidner and Bensoussan, 1988</xref>: 102).</p>
<p>Six potential sources of language anxiety have been identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0033688212449511">Young (1991</xref>: 427):</p>

<p>Culture and ethnicity may also affect language learning anxiety, especially when topics are unfamiliar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0033688212449511">Saito et al., 1999</xref>: 214). According to Horwitz ‘some practices perceived by one group of learners as comfortable may prove stressful for learners from a different cultural group who are used to different types of classroom organizations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212449511">2001</xref>: 119). Moreover, it has been speculated that ‘students may have differential levels of reading anxiety based on their particular target language’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212449511">Horwitz, 2001</xref>: 121).</p>
<p>Differences between the orthography of the native and target language (English) may lead to interference and cause anxiety, especially at the beginner levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0033688212449511">Avinor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0033688212449511">Deutsch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0033688212449511">Saito et al., 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Reading Comprehension Tests</title>
<p>Many research studies focus on all four skills (reading, writing, listening and speaking), and researchers agree that of these, the main cause of language learning anxiety in the classroom centers on having to speak the target language in front of a group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0033688212449511">Young, 1991</xref>: 429). Moreover, higher anxiety has been reported about oral than written comprehension assessment tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0033688212449511">Brantmeier, 2005</xref>:76; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212449511">Horwitz, 2001</xref>: 116). Since spoken production includes factors extraneous to language learning, such as a student’s level of intro- /extroversion and social skills, the present study will be limited to an examination of anxiety connected with reading comprehension tests.</p>
<p>The link between reading test scores and anxiety is unclear. Two studies on Israeli university students taking a course in advanced English reading comprehension found that scores on written tests and oral questions on reading comprehension were determined by a variety of factors. Scores reflected not only task difficulty and examinee proficiency, but also extraneous stimuli such as examinees’ gender, ethnic affiliation, sociolinguistic and cultural background, motivational disposition and anxiety during the test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0033688212449511">Bensoussan and Zeidner, 1989</xref>: 45; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0033688212449511">Zeidner and Bensoussan, 1988</xref>:111). However, no significant interaction was found between gender and native language (i.e. cultural differences) on written test scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0033688212449511">Bensoussan and Zeidner, 1989</xref>: 47). Moreover, no significant differences were found between Hebrew-speakers and Arabic-speakers in reported levels of anxiety state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0033688212449511">Bensoussan and Zeidner, 1989</xref>: 47; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0033688212449511">Zeidner and Bensoussan, 1988</xref>: 108).</p>
<p>A consistent moderate negative relationship has been found between anxiety and reading achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0033688212449511">Argaman and Abu-Rabia, 2002</xref>: 156; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212449511">Horwitz, 2001</xref>: 116; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212449511">Kondo and Yang, 2004</xref>: 258; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0033688212449511">Saito et al., 1999</xref>). However, a decrease in the rate of errors in (second/ foreign language) L2 reading comprehension due to anxiety was found as proficiency increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0033688212449511">Brantmeier, 2005</xref>: 68).</p>
<p>Little research exists on advanced reading comprehension at this is the level of proficiency which deals with lengthy, authentic texts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0033688212449511">Brantmeier, 2005</xref>: 68). The role of affect in L2 reading is not completely understood. In fact, she shows that anxiety about reading at the advanced level may not be a function of reading itself, but rather a function of oral or written reading comprehension tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0033688212449511">2005</xref>: 67).</p>

<title>Proposed Treatments to Reduce Language Learning Anxiety</title>
<p>Because low grades lead to a downward spiral of anxiety and further low grades, it is important to deal with that anxiety. Researchers have explored treatments and interventions for teachers to carry out to reduce anxiety.</p>
<p>A variety of treatments have been proposed to effectively reduce language learning anxiety in the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212449511">Kondo and Yang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0033688212449511">Saito et al., 1999</xref>) and language test anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0033688212449511">Bensoussan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212449511">Horwitz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0033688212449511">Shohamy, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0033688212449511">Zeidner and Bensoussan, 1988</xref>). To be effective, emotion-focused treatments need to contain cognitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0033688212449511">Zeidner, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Most interventions are effective in reducing anxiety caused by test situations, but without assurance of performance improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212449511">Hembree, 1988</xref>: 50). Few studies have demonstrated significant performance improvement between treated and untreated students because an improvement of only about six points could be expected as a result of test anxiety treatment. Only 18% of the treated groups showed significant performance improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212449511">Hembree, 1988</xref>: 48). Because of these statistical limitations, ‘better performance could not be expected to accompany testing anxiety reduction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212449511">1988</xref>: 75). In the aggregate, however, Hembree argues that these effects possess a highly significant mean. Moreover, no treatment effect appears to decline with the passage of time after treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212449511">1988</xref>: 74).</p>
<p>The application of a combination of treatments appears to improve performance. A variety of treatments have been proposed to effectively reduce test anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212449511">Hembree, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212449511">Kondo, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0033688212449511">Sarason and Sarason, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0033688212449511">Scissons and Njaa, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0033688212449511">Zeidner, 1995a</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0033688212449511">1995b</xref>). Early interventions were behavioral in nature, stressing relaxation training and desensitization through counter-conditioning or extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212449511">Hembree, 1988</xref>: 48). The results of a research study on 930 American college students by Scissons and Njaa indicate the effectiveness of both individual desensitization and group desensitization in the treatment of high test anxiety. Desensitization consisted of an audiotape recording of multiple pairings of half-hour relaxation training exercises with half-hour periods of hierarchy concentration exercises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0033688212449511">Scissons and Njaa, 1973</xref>: 470).</p>
<p>Interventions have generally been classified as cognitive, affective, and behavioral approaches and combinations of these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212449511">Hembree, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212449511">Kondo, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0033688212449511">Sarason and Sarason, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212449511">Kondo (1997)</xref> classifies and synthesizes these approaches:</p>
<list id="list3-0033688212449511" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The cognitive approach (worry, preoccupations, concerns) tries to suppress or alter thought processes related to test taking.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The affective approach (emotional arousal, physiological responsiveness) attempts to change negative involuntary association between the test situation and anxiety, and to alleviate bodily reactions and tension.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The behavioral approach trains study skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212449511">Kondo, 1997</xref>: 204).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Behavioral and cognitive-behavioral treatments were shown to be effective in test anxiety reduction. Both styles operate within the interference model. The purely cognitive treatments, such as group counseling, did not seem as effective in test anxiety reduction as the purely behavioral treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212449511">Hembree, 1988</xref>: 74). Cognitive modification or study counseling combined with desensitization seemed more likely to reduce test anxiety and raise performance than only desensitization and other behavioral techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212449511">Hembree, 1988</xref>: 49). <italic>Study skills training</italic>, which included study training by itself or training combined with other forms of treatment, was not effective unless another treatment style was also present. <italic>Testwiseness training</italic>, which furthered academic test-taking skills, offered moderate test anxiety relief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212449511">Hembree, 1988</xref>: 67). It may be a matter of intervening in the appropriate order: once the anxiety that interferes with learning new study skills is removed, the following step would be to train the student in efficient study skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0033688212449511">Zeidner, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Hembree states that performance incentives can benefit students at all test anxiety levels. He suggests the following conditions:</p>
<list id="list4-0033688212449511" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>For high test-anxious (HTA) students – low-stress instructions (at the college level), provision of memory support, minimal distractions, and background music</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For low test-anxious (LTA) students – ego-involving instructions, an easy-to-hard test item arrangement, and no music during tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0033688212449511">Hembree, 1988</xref>: 73).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The list of interventions by Sarason and Sarason, intended to both reduce test anxiety and improve performance, also incorporates results from recent research studies: cognitive therapy, rational-emotive therapy, cognitive-behavioral treatments, systematic desensitization, relaxation training, biofeedback training, work on study skills and test-taking strategies, and a combination of all of the above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0033688212449511">Sarason and Sarason, 1990</xref>: 490).</p>
<p>Teachers have been the focus of suggestions for reducing student language anxiety. ‘It is suggested that attempts to reduce language anxiety may require some skills training as a supplement to anxiety reduction strategies in order to compensate for deficiencies created by anxiety arousal, native language problems, or both’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0033688212449511">MacIntyre, 1995</xref>: 97). To help students decrease language anxiety in the classroom, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0033688212449511">Saito et al. (1999)</xref> suggest that teachers engage in activities including selecting authentic texts, encouraging students during classroom discussions of attainable reading goals, teaching successful learning and reading strategies, and devoting class time to assessing reading objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0033688212449511">Saito et al., 1999</xref>: 217). In the essay questions, students reported a preference for authentic test-taking procedures (when form and content resemble real life communicative situations, i.e. tests that are also learning tools) as well as for tests that create low anxiety and a relaxed classroom atmosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0033688212449511">Shohamy, 1982</xref>: 17).</p>
<p>Learner beliefs and instructor beliefs need to be addressed. To reduce anxieties based on learner beliefs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0033688212449511">Young (1991)</xref> suggests that instructors hold brief discussions about the process of language learning periodically throughout the language learning experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0033688212449511">1991</xref>: 431). To decrease anxieties related to instructor beliefs, Young recommends that instructors need to be sensitized to their role as facilitators whose responsibility it is to provide students with input and opportunities to communicate in the language in authentic situations with authentic materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0033688212449511">Young, 1991</xref>: 431). She suggests that instructors reduce language anxiety by giving students positive reinforcement, by adopting an attitude that mistakes are part of the language learning process and can contribute to learning, by helping students to learn rather than making them perform, and by showing interest in their message rather than their mistakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0033688212449511">Young, 1991</xref>: 432-33).</p>
<p>A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0033688212449511">Deutsch (2005)</xref> found that after applying reading strategies, relaxation exercises and test-taking skills, and after practicing and drilling reading passages, students scored higher on their reading comprehension tests. Relaxed classroom atmosphere and teacher support were also found to decrease language anxiety. In fact, classroom atmosphere rather than specific instructional activities were thought to decrease student anxiety levels. ‘Classroom levels of affiliation among the learners, lack of competition, and clear task orientation were associated with reduced anxiety levels’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212449511">Horwitz, 2001</xref>: 120). Moreover, ‘the level of perceived teacher support was linked to the strongest relationship with students’ feelings of anxiety’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212449511">Horwitz, 2001</xref>: 119-20).</p>

<title>Proposed Student Coping Strategies to Reduce Language Learning Anxiety</title>
<p>As with test anxiety, research on language learning anxiety has also neglected students’ actual coping behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212449511">Kondo and Yang, 2004</xref>: 259). At present, there is no consensus about which coping strategies are most effective and adaptive in promoting positive outcomes in exam situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0033688212449511">Zeidner, 1995a</xref>).</p>
<p>Although relaxation and cognitive strategies reduce anxiety, they have not been clearly shown to improve performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0033688212449511">Sarason and Sarason, 1990</xref>: 490). Coping strategies in exam situations were found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0033688212449511">Zeidner (1995a)</xref> to work with modest effects and make a difference, mainly with respect to affective outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0033688212449511">Zeidner (1995b)</xref> found that exam performance was directly predicted by both problem-focused coping and the cognitive component of test anxiety.</p>
<p>Sarason and Sarason categorize three responses to stress. One is <italic>adaptive</italic>, a task-oriented attitude in which students seek a conference with the teacher and begin to study harder. The second is <italic>maladaptive</italic>, characterized by denial, doing nothing. Students may think: ‘So what if I get a low grade? I can’t have such bad luck next time. It was a dumb test.’ The third category is <italic>anxious</italic>, when students stew about the problem, engage in self-derogation, and anticipate future failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0033688212449511">Sarason and Sarason, 1990</xref>: 475).</p>
<p>Adaptive coping in exam situations involves a flexible repertoire and combined use of alternative coping strategies, including task-oriented and emotion-oriented forms of coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0033688212449511">Zeidner, 1995a</xref>). Coping strategies in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0033688212449511">Stoeber (2004)</xref> with 162 students included task-orientation and preparation, seeking social support, and avoidance.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212449511">Kondo (1997)</xref> posits a typology of five strategies that persons use to cope with test anxiety: Positive Thinking, Relaxation, Preparation, Resignation, and Concentration:</p>
<list id="list5-0033688212449511" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Positive Thinking – cognitive</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Relaxation – affective, emotional arousal</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Preparation – behavioral, task-relevant</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Concentration – behavioral, task-relevant</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Resignation – cognitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212449511">Kondo, 1997</xref>: 205)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212449511">Kondo (1997)</xref>, high test-anxious persons reported using preparation and concentration strategies to suppress thoughts of off-task matters such as worry about poor performance and loss of regard by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212449511">Kondo, 1997</xref>: 211). Moreover, if people perceive that their anxiety is too much to cope with, they may not invest enough effort to reduce the anxiety, and will experience resignation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0033688212449511">Kondo, 1997</xref>: 204-205).</p>
<p>As with general test anxiety, for language classroom anxiety Kondo and Yang found that cognitive, affective and behavioral strategy types as well as resignation characterize people’s anxiety coping behaviors in language classrooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212449511">Kondo and Yang, 2004</xref>: 259-60). From a list of 70 basic tactics for coping with anxiety in English language classrooms, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212449511">Kondo and Yang (2004</xref>: 258) arrived at a typology of five strategies:</p>
<list id="list6-0033688212449511" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Preparation (study hard, try to get good summaries of lecture notes).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Relaxation (take a deep breath, try to calm down).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Positive Thinking (imagine oneself giving great performance, try to enjoy the tension).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Peer Seeking (look for others having difficulty controlling their anxiety, ask other students if they understand the class).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Resignation (giving up, sleeping in class).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>For Japanese university students of English, however, no significant correlations were found between language anxiety and frequencies of strategy use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0033688212449511">Kondo and Yang, 2004</xref>: 258).</p>

<title>Proposed Treatments and Coping Strategies to Reduce Language Test Anxiety</title>
<p>From the 1980s, researchers in language testing have been concerned that teachers and test constructors were ignoring examinees’ test anxiety when planning and constructing language tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0033688212449511">Shohamy, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0033688212449511">Zeidner and Bensoussan, 1988</xref>: 113). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0033688212449511">Shohamy (1982)</xref> argues that when those involved in creating and administering tests misinterpret and undervalue the progress of test-anxious students, they challenge the validity of the entire testing process. She argues that since test anxiety harms performance, educational institutions need to review the test anxiety problem and seek its solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0033688212449511">1982</xref>: 17).</p>
<p>Teachers and researchers would do well to investigate ways to avert the problem of test anxiety (a learned condition) before it matures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0033688212449511">Shohamy, 1982</xref>: 17; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0033688212449511">Horwitz, 2001</xref>: 75). One way suggested by Shohamy is for tests to indicate what students can do with the language rather than what they cannot do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0033688212449511">Shohamy, 1982</xref>: 17). To offer effective relief during language tests, Shohamy lists an array of interventions. Under circumstances where performance interacts with ego-involvement (for example, during college placement testing), test anxiety effects may be compensated by grouping the students for separate tests according to their test anxiety levels, with the test instructions adjusted to accommodate each grouping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0033688212449511">Shohamy, 1982</xref>: 17).</p>
<p>To decrease language test anxieties, instructors and language programs as a whole need to develop and oversee the construction of fair tests that accurately reflect in-class instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0033688212449511">Young, 1991</xref>: 433). ‘Whatever the objective of a test item, pre-test exposure to the item [and the item-type – author] may help reduce student anxiety and frustration during a language test’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0033688212449511">Young, 1991</xref>: 434).</p>
<p>The test anxiety of 95 students taking advanced reading comprehension courses in English as a Foreign Language at the University of Haifa were investigated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0033688212449511">Avinor (2008)</xref>. She examined anxiety according to extrinsic and intrinsic locus of control. To alleviate anxiety, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0033688212449511">Avinor (2008)</xref> suggests including texts on the topic of test anxiety, and holding class discussions in which students, together with the teacher, could analyze possible causes for test anxiety and the links between anxiety and low scores.</p>
<p>Encouraging students to communicate and express their feelings appeared to provide them with an outlet for pent up aversive emotions and anxieties related to the exam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0033688212449511">Zeidner and Bensoussan, 1988</xref>: 101).

<title>A Study: Student Suggestions to Alleviate Test Anxiety</title>
<sec id="section8-0033688212449511">
<title>Context</title>
<p>The Department of Foreign Languages at the University of Haifa offers three levels of English comprehension courses (intermediate to advanced) in reading academic texts (up to 10 pages in length) to approximately 1,000 students each semester. In order to graduate, all students need to be able to read academic texts in English, which may be their L2, L3 or Ln. The population of students and teaching faculty is multilingual and multicultural. Although the language of instruction is Hebrew, native languages of the students include Hebrew, Arabic, Amharic, Russian and other languages from the former Soviet Union, and others. Most students have probably encountered difficulties in processing English phonology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0033688212449511">Saito et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the variety of treatments suggested in the literature, and the diversity of the student population, it was decided to ask the students directly about their preferences for coping strategies.</p>

<p>On a Likert-type scale between 1 (dissatisfied) and 7 (satisfied), mean responses about repair behavior and grades ranged between 4.05 and 6.39, displaying a positive set of attitudes ranging from neutral (close to the mid-point 4) to satisfied (7). Most students reported that they would like to improve their grades, even if they needed to do extra work: <bold>correct the test</bold> (6.39), answer a <bold>bonus</bold> question (6.23), take <bold>another test</bold> (5.69), or do <bold>at least one of the above</bold> suggested activities (5.43). There appeared to be consistent standard deviations (SD) ranging between 1.01 and 1.29.

Additional effort in learning without improved grades (<bold>class discussion of test, doing nothing</bold> since they were sure they would do better in the next test, and <bold>correcting mistakes without changing the grades</bold>) was given lowest preference (4.45, 4.43 and 4.05, respectively). That is, the objective of raising the grade appears to come before the objective of learning. For these three items there was less agreement (SD ranging between 1.64 and 1.73). No significant differences were found for either gender (z = -0.30, p = ns) or for native language (chi-square = 5.70 (2), p = ns).</p>

<p>This list does not follow the statistical findings of the previous hierarchies. Although the question ‘What else?’ was intended for students to add to the eight suggestions offered in the questionnaire, many students chose to repeat some of those eight, apparently for emphasis. Most students, however, chose to avoid answering this question.</p>
<p>In the context of advanced English reading comprehension courses, task-relevant, cognitive-behavioral coping strategies appeared to be preferred by students. When students perceived that they had the encouragement of their teachers and the support of the educational program (course, system) in the form of bonus questions and practice tests, they were willing to study harder and appeared to be less anxious. Then, with increased self-esteem, would follow satisfaction.</p>

<title>Application: Remedial Class for Students of Advanced Reading Comprehension in English as a Foreign Language (EFL)</title>
<p>The final English course grade depends on testing and written assignments: final exam (50%), mid-term exam (15%), homework assignments and projects (35%). At the end of each semester, a small but consistent percentage of students (approximately 3% of all students enrolled) repeatedly fail a reading comprehension course at some level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0033688212449511">Bensoussan, 2009</xref>). For the present study, the Remedial Classes on the most advanced level of Spring 2010 (n=18), Fall 2010 (n=7), and Spring 2011 (n=23) were observed.</p>
<p>To alleviate anxiety and to help serious students to pass the course, a special Remedial Class, at each of these levels, is offered to those students who have failed an English comprehension course more than once. Remedial Students have experienced repeated failure in language learning difficulties, motivation, and anxiety accompanied by low self-esteem. That is, in addition to difficulties with language learning and test taking, many Remedial Students have personal problems and feelings of anxiety and low self-esteem.</p>
<p>The Remedial Classes apply theoretical principles to address students’ anxiety as well as their advanced reading comprehension skills. In addition, applying the first five teaching and testing activities from the six summarized above, Remedial Classes have given students the tools to pass the course, some with high grades. The instructor is supportive by being sure to give clear instructions and giving more class time for discussion. Teaching metalinguistic strategies and schemata helps students cope with test taking skills as well as with language learning. Reading skills are reinforced by informal pre- and post-reading exercises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0033688212449511">Bensoussan, 2009</xref>). Students can work in the CALL (Computer Assisted Language Learning) Center on specially designed vocabulary and comprehension exercises with feedback and model answers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0033688212449511">Bensoussan et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>To increase students’ extrinsic motivation, teachers and students in the Remedial Classes spend time on practicing question formats that appear in examinations. Cognitive scaffolding (giving plenty of examples of exercises, quizzes and model practice tests) is used to improve test-taking skills.</p>
<p>The intervention of the <bold>bonus question</bold> for extra credit was a new addition to the English course, whereas <bold>practice tests</bold> were already part of the course and simply given more frequently. It is interesting that after answering <bold>bonus questions</bold> for two or three assignments, students stopped answering them even though they could have received higher grades. Students trusted that the grades would reflect their knowledge even without the extra credit. The benefit of the <bold>bonus question</bold> appeared to be psychological and affective. The willingness of the teacher to <italic>modify the testing and grading systems</italic> by awarding bonus points appeared to be what students appreciated, and what mattered.</p>
<p>What is special about the bonus question is that it is a <italic>modification in the test system</italic>, rarely given in courses, and optional for students who wish to put extra effort into their studies. The educational messages are that the teachers are flexible, encouraging student learning, and that students can have a measure of control over their grades by a little extra effort. Students indicated a willingness to work toward improvement and a desire to receive encouragement. These cognitive and affective components appeared to be significant in increasing motivation.</p>
<p>Whereas most students with extrinsic motivation usually blame the teacher for having failed a course (<italic>S/He failed me!)</italic>, the Remedial Class aims to shift the locus of responsibility to the student. Each student is accountable for his/her own work and grades while also encouraging work in pairs and small groups. Students are made to understand that they need to demonstrate effort and progress to pass the course and become autonomous learners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0033688212449511">Bensoussan, 2009</xref>). Soon this extrinsic motivation leads to higher grades and is followed by satisfaction linked to increased self-esteem and decreased anxiety.</p>

<title>Implications and Conclusions</title>
<p>Teachers and test constructors need to consider test anxiety and its alleviation when evaluating student language learning achievements, preparing a curriculum, designing a course, and constructing a reading comprehension test. The links between achievement and alleviation of anxiety need further investigation.</p>
<p>When teachers focus on students’ needs and coping strategies, anxiety can be reduced. Involving students in the testing process may increase their motivation and decrease anxiety in language learning. To encourage involvement from the beginning of a course, there could be a discussion of student expectations about evaluation and assessment in a course.</p>
<p>The roles of multilingualism and multiliteracy in language learning need to be explored further. Recommendations for future research could also include students of different languages other than English, or students of different areas of study other than reading comprehension.</p>
<p>Future research on the effectiveness of treatments and coping strategies in advanced reading examination contexts is needed to clarify the underlying processes, the extent to which a coping strategy can relieve emotional distress, and the increase of student motivation and progress in language learning. Such research would assess the effects of these measures on the students’ self-esteem, test performance, and motivation and progress in language learning. It is possible that such a program, providing high anxiety students with relevant coping skills as part of a primary prevention program before acute test-anxiety levels are established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0033688212449511">Zeidner, 2007</xref>), might be more efficient than providing a Remedial Program after such students have already failed.</p>
