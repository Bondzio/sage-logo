<sec id="sec1-0954410011418285"><title><italic>M. P. Sullivan</italic>, Library of Flight Series, AIAA Inc., 2008, 164 pp, $29.95 (paperback), (ISBN 978-1-56347-957-1)</title>
<p>I have already reviewed two books from the AIAA Library of Flight Series. They were of small paperback design with accompanying CD and were compelling reading and very educational. As with paperbacks, the image quality is not of the best although perfectly adequate for following the story - the CD provided the high quality supporting content. So when the parcel arrived for this particular review I was surprised by what came out of the wrapping, as this proved to be a totally different type of book. It is of large size and hard bound, and although the cover is monochrome, colour is used in the body of the book. The layout of the pages is very open with much use of white space. The printing is clean and I only discovered one typographical error.</p>
<p>The text is written in a conversational style, which took a little getting used to after having read the other books in this series. The author was a director of media relations for Pratt &amp; Whitney and also headed communications for Hamilton Standard; these associations gave him a wealth of material from which to choose, which enhanced the nature of the work. While I found the formatting rather busy, I enjoyed reading it and found the overall story of much interest. I particularly appreciated the author describing, at length, the manner in which other engine manufacturers, including their aims and aspirations, affected the work conducted at Pratt &amp; Whitney. It was interesting to see how hard-nosed competitors could come together as partners with the common interest of earning money! There were some nice anecdotes included that highlighted the personal nature of the business, i.e. the peculiarities of the human being and the absurdities of life that make the aerospace industry such a delight in which to have a career. I particularly liked the cafeteria in the factory based in Florida, close to the Everglades, that had the sign “Do not feed the alligators”!</p>
<p>It would take a very long article to address all of the issues raised in the book but I must be brief. The company was founded by Frederick Rentschler in the mid-twenties. It started life in Hartford, Connecticut and was based in an old Auto Plant full of tobacco that needed clearing before business could be started. The first engine of note was the Wasp and the issues of air cooling versus liquid cooling, the fuel used, the emergence of the gas turbine, and later developments – even into space - continue the story.</p>
<p>The book is a curious mix of technical development, the value of advanced science and technology, and the overarching need to make a profit. The dealings with governments, armed service chiefs, other engine suppliers, and of course aircraft manufacturers, guide the thread of the book. It would be nice to think that as the design phases of an aircraft take place, the end specification will be set in stone, but this book helps to dispel that notion!</p>
<p>I would advise the reader to read the book to get the full flavour of the complete story – this is not being lazy, it is just that it would be wrong and unfair to try and précis the book into a few paragraphs. Suffice it to say that I am much more informed after reading it myself.</p>
<p>On a personal note I have several comments. The use of white space is fine but there were instances of an aircraft being quoted when an image was not included and I felt that I would have much preferred sacrificing some white space for this to take place; I also would have valued this as it sets the situation in context. Occasionally the image was not placed close to the relevant piece of text which I found disruptive. Text boxes included highlighted quotes from the main text – these were rather annoying and again I felt the space for more aircraft images would have been better as in this type of book, images are very influential. In the vast majority of cases the images themselves are of good quality, I particularly like the earlier ones which show an older lifestyle now forgotten, where hairstyles, clothes (waistcoats and watch chains), spectacles and, above all, hats feature prominently! Promotional material normally includes one or two persons to give scale. However, in this book such images look rather posed and, in some instances, <italic>very</italic> posed! I have one gripe concerning three images: one image of an F15 bleeds out from the page and is poorly cropped; one of an assembly line fills a complete page, but the aspect ratio has been changed and the cross-sections of the inlets are noticeably elliptical; finally one of the PW 4000 fans is rather pixellated.</p>
<p>The book has a section on the company milestones; one section lists the products comprising a brief description and illustration for each engine. The book concludes with a good bibliography for future reference and a comprehensive index, however, in my case, I hardly needed the index as I read the book straight through. The author has worked hard, and put his heart into it. The final chapter looks to the future but with the 2008 publication date has some aspects that are already superseded, unfortunately this is unavoidable.</p>
<p>This book will not tell you how to design an aero engine, but it will give the reader a firm grasp of the more esoteric aspects of the aero-engine business. Looking at prices the book is not expensive. My copy is going into the archive of the local aviation museum – on the whole, I think it will provide useful reference material.</p>
