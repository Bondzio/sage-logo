<abstract>
<p>This study explored children’s secure attachment with both parents versus one parent, as well as the unique role of children’s patterns of close relationships with father and mother, for a deeper understanding of maladjustment problems among children with learning disabilities (LD). Specifically, this study identified subgroups of children with different individual profiles and examined whether these profiles associated differently with children’s self-rated loneliness, sense of coherence, hope, and effort, and with parent-rated externalizing/internalizing child behavior problems. Participants were 205 children (8–12 years of age), 107 with LD and 98 with typical development. Preliminary analyses indicated significant group differences on all but one of the children’s measures. Results from using <italic>k</italic>-means clustering methods indicated four distinct clusters. Scheffé procedure validated the clusters, revealing significant intercluster differences on all but one of the children’s socioemotional measures. Discussion focused on understanding different parent–child relationship patterns among these subgroups of school-age children with and without LD.</p>

<p>Over the past decades, data from a large number of studies connected parent–child quality of relationships with a variety of developmental outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731948712436398">Cassidy &amp; Shaver, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0731948712436398">K. E. Grossmann, Grossmann, &amp; Waters, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0731948712436398">Kerns &amp; Richardson, 2005</xref>). Such research considered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948712436398">Bowlby’s (1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948712436398">1988</xref>) attachment theory as a highly relevant framework for explaining individual variations in adjustment across the life span (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0731948712436398">Mikulincer &amp; Shaver, 2007</xref>). However, despite growing awareness regarding the role played by patterns of close parent–child relationships for typically developing children’s adjustment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0731948712436398">K. E. Grossmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0731948712436398">Kerns &amp; Richardson, 2005</xref>, for reviews), relatively few studies have scrutinized these relationships’ effects on children with learning disabilities (LD). Researchers of the rare attachment studies on this population have suggested that fewer of these children with LD might report secure attachment with mothers when compared with children with typical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948712436398">Al-Yagon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731948712436398">Al-Yagon &amp; Mikulincer, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948712436398">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0731948712436398">Murray &amp; Greenberg, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Most of the research literature on parent–child attachment relationships has primarily investigated mothers; few have examined fathers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731948712436398">Campbell, 2003</xref>, for a review). Due to the recent upsurge of interest in a father’s important role in children’s development and later adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0731948712436398">Lamb, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0731948712436398">Marsiglio, Amato, Day, &amp; Lamb, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0731948712436398">Parke, 2004</xref>), the current study focused equally on child–father attachment.</p>
<p>The role played by patterns of close relationships with the father and the mother may be of particular interest in understanding school-age children with LD because (a) these variables may act as risk or protective factors during this period, when trajectories are set that can lead to later difficulties in adolescence, and (b) children with LD are more likely to evidence diverse socioemotional problems than are children without LD (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731948712436398">Bryan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948712436398">Estell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0731948712436398">Weiner &amp; Schneider, 2002</xref>). Beyond documenting the effects of LD on academic functioning, studies have also demonstrated these children’s variety of maladjustment difficulties in the social and emotional domains, such as higher levels of peer rejection and loneliness, lower sense of coherence (SOC), lower self-concept, and higher levels of depression and anxiety compared with their nondisabled counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948712436398">Al-Yagon, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731948712436398">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731948712436398">Bryan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948712436398">Estell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0731948712436398">Lackaye &amp; Margalit, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0731948712436398">Morrison &amp; Cosden, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0731948712436398">Weiner &amp; Schneider, 2002</xref>). Thus, the risk or protective effect of attachment relationships merits particular attention for children with LD.</p>

<title>Children’s Attachment Relationships With Father and Mother</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948712436398">Bowlby’s (1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948712436398">1988</xref>) attachment theory highlights the role that interactions with significant others play in personality and socioemotional development. In their first year, infants develop specific and enduring relationships with their primary caretakers. Infants’ strong tendency to seek proximity to caregivers is the overt manifestation of the attachment behavioral system—an inborn system that is designed to restore or maintain proximity to supportive others in times of need. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948712436398">Bowlby (1973)</xref> labeled these supportive others as <italic>attachment figures</italic> and also suggested that infants internalize their interactions with attachment figures into “internal working models of attachment”—mental representations of the significant others and the self. These result in unique attachment styles, that is, stable patterns of cognitions and behaviors that are manifested in other close relationships and later social interactions.</p>
<p>Ainsworth’s observations of infants in the Strange Situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731948712436398">Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, &amp; Wall, 1978</xref>) led to her classification of attachment style into one secure style and two insecure styles (avoidant and anxious). This moderately stressful 20-min laboratory-based procedure, composed of two brief separations and two reunions with the caregiver, has been extensively used to assess the quality of child–parent attachment. Infants’ individual strategies for coping with this stressful situation, especially during reunion, are the focus of study. Behavioral manifestations of attachment security or insecurity in the Strange Situation are considered as reflecting infants’ underlying representation (i.e., “working model”) of the caregiver. Thus, children with a secure style hold positive working models of the self and others, exhibit skillful use of the support received from attachment figures, reveal confidence in the availability and responsiveness of these figures in times of need, and show a balance between proximity and exploration behaviors in both ordinary and emergency situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948712436398">Bowlby, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0731948712436398">Waters &amp; Cummings, 2000</xref>). Conversely, children with avoidant and anxious styles hold negative working models and demonstrate frustrating and painful interactions with unavailable and unresponsive attachment figures. Each insecure style (avoidant and anxious) represents a different strategy for regulating pain resulting from lacking a sense of a secure base. Avoidant individuals attempt to deactivate the attachment system, deny attachment needs, and distance themselves from attachment figures and close relationships. Anxious individuals attempt to hyperactivate the attachment system, developing hypervigilance, clinging, and overdependence on attachment figures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0731948712436398">Main and Solomon (1986)</xref> later added a third insecure pattern—disorganized style—reflecting a random mixture of the avoidant and anxious styles.</p>
<p>Large numbers of studies pinpointed the associations between children’s attachment style and socioemotional adjustment. For example, research on low-risk samples indicated that securely attached children clearly revealed higher levels of psychological well-being such as higher sociability with other children and adults, higher compliance with parents, and more effective emotional regulation compared with children with an avoidant or anxious style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731948712436398">Allen &amp; Land, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0731948712436398">Greenberg, Lengua, Coie, &amp; Pinderhughes, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0731948712436398">Waters &amp; Cummings, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, across a wide range of samples, the link between children’s insecure patterns of attachment and high levels of externalizing problems such as aggression was clearly evident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731948712436398">Greenberg, Speltz, &amp; DeKlyen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0731948712436398">Kerns, Schlegelmilch, Morgan, &amp; Abraham, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Data from the rare studies existing on attachment relationships of children with LD showed that these children reported a lower incidence of secure attachment with mothers than did their non-LD peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948712436398">Al-Yagon, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731948712436398">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731948712436398">Al-Yagon &amp; Mikulincer, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948712436398">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0731948712436398">Murray &amp; Greenberg, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0731948712436398">2006</xref>). These LD studies also emphasized the role of children’s insecure attachment as a risk factor in increasing maladjustment in the social and emotional domains.</p>
<p>Children’s patterns of attachment to fathers have been less studied. Some research on infants and toddlers revealed clear evidence of protest separation from fathers as well as mothers at 7 to 9 months and at 18 months (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0731948712436398">Lamb, 2002</xref>). In addition, 75% of these infants responded positively and enthusiastically when their fathers returned. However, between ages 10 and 20 months, toddlers seemed to prefer mothers as a more reliable source of comfort and security than fathers, although fathers were the more preferred partners for playful interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731948712436398">Clarke-Stewart, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0731948712436398">Lamb, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Research on the role of father–child attachment relationships for children’s adjustment in social and emotional domains has yielded inconsistent findings. Some studies linked secure attachment with fathers to children’s positive interactions with friends, but other studies failed to support such a link (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0731948712436398">Parke et al., 2004</xref>, for a review). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0731948712436398">K. Grossmann et al. (2002)</xref> argued that father and mother attachment relations derive from different sets of early social experiences, where mothers act as a secure base in times of distress, whereas fathers act as a challenging but reassuring play partner. Several studies supported these assumptions and also the unique role of children’s attachment to their fathers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0731948712436398">Lamb, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0731948712436398">Lieberman, Doyle, &amp; Markiewicz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0731948712436398">Verschueren &amp; Marcoen, 2005</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0731948712436398">Verschueren and Marcoen (2005)</xref> reported that secure attachment to mothers may best predict children’s functioning in more intimate groups or dyadic interactions, whereas secure attachment to fathers may best predict peer acceptance.</p>
<p>Of particular importance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0731948712436398">Verschueren and Marcoen’s (2005)</xref> study on associations between children’s attachment to father and attachment to mother revealed that, by middle childhood, children have constructed separate representations of their attachment relationships with each parent. As reported by Verschueren and Marcoen, no evidence was found for the development of one overall, generalized representation of attachment relationships during middle childhood.</p>
<p>Altogether, these findings raise some important questions calling for additional exploration. Would school-age children classified as having secure attachment with both parents manifest a higher level of socioemotional functioning compared with children classified as having secure attachment with only one parent? Would children with LD report a less secure attachment with their fathers and mothers compared with children with typical development? Would different subtypes or profiles of children with LD emerge regarding the association between their attachment relations with the father versus with the mother? How, if at all, would these different profiles associate with children’s social and emotional measures? Who, if anyone, among these different profiles would be more vulnerable to manifesting greater socioemotional difficulties?</p>
<sec id="section2-0731948712436398">
<title>Children’s Socioemotional and Behavioral Adjustment</title>
<p>The current examination of children’s adjustment focused on the following four dimensions.</p>
<sec id="section3-0731948712436398">
<title>Loneliness</title>
<p>This first measure of socioemotional adjustment was included as a global indicator of dissatisfaction from the quality and/or the quantity of individuals’ social interrelations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948712436398">Asher, Parkhurst, Hymel, &amp; Williams, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0731948712436398">Margalit, 2006</xref>). Prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731948712436398">Al-Yagon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0731948712436398">Margalit, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0731948712436398">Margalit &amp; Efrati, 1995</xref>) showed that, as a group, children with LD reported higher feelings of loneliness compared with nondisabled children as well as lower SOC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0731948712436398">
<title>SOC</title>
<p>Coined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731948712436398">Antonovsky (1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731948712436398">1987</xref>), SOC is the core variable within his health model, which he termed <italic>salutogenesis</italic> in contrast to <italic>pathogenesis</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731948712436398">Antonovsky (1987)</xref> defined SOC as a global orientation regarding one’s pervasive, enduring, though dynamic feeling of confidence that (a) the stimuli deriving from one’s internal and external environments are structured, predictable, and explicable; (b) resources are available to meet the demands posed by these stimuli; and (c) these demands are challenges worthy of investment and engagement. Thus, SOC refers to a global orientation or enduring tendency to see the world as comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful. Children’s SOC was included here in line with prior studies emphasizing this index of children’s coping resources and personal strength, with unique value in coping with stressors during crisis and distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731948712436398">Greeff &amp; Van Der Merwe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0731948712436398">Lindstrom &amp; Eriksson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0731948712436398">Margalit, 2006</xref>), and also may be associated with secure attachment relations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948712436398">Al-Yagon &amp; Mikulincer, 2004b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0731948712436398">
<title>Children’s hope and effort</title>
<p>This measure was included in line with previous studies revealing the association between feelings of hope and various adjustment measures as well as coping with stressful situations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0731948712436398">Parveen &amp; James, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0731948712436398">Snyder, 2002</xref>), whereas effort provided an index of child’s level of investment, intensity, and persistence in accomplishing tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0731948712436398">Lackaye &amp; Margalit, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0731948712436398">Meltzer et al., 2004</xref>). As presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0731948712436398">Snyder (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0731948712436398">2006</xref>), the construct of hope refers to a cognitive set consisting of pathway thinking—the perceived capacity to generate strategies for attaining goals—and agency thinking—perceptions involving one’s capacity to initiate and sustain movement along the chosen pathways.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0731948712436398">
<title>Externalizing and internalizing behavior problems</title>
<p>This measure was included in line with previous studies suggesting that maladaptive functioning in childhood falls into two categories of disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731948712436398">Achenbach, 1991</xref>). Internalizing maladjustment includes loneliness, anxiety, and social withdrawal, whereas externalizing maladjustment includes hyperactivity, aggression, and antisocial disorders.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section7-0731948712436398">
<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>The current study aimed to further explore attachment theory’s relevance and validity for understanding socioemotional maladjustment of children with LD. Specifically, this study attempted to expand on prior research by uniquely focusing on fathers, children with LD, and the simultaneous study of close relationships with one parent versus both parents. The study aimed to identify subgroups of children with different individual profiles of attachment classifications with mother and father and their possibly unique role in explaining children’s well-adjusted functioning. Corresponding with these objectives, this study tested the following three empirical hypotheses among school-age Israeli children with LD who attended general education classes and a comparison group of typically developing children:</p>
<list id="list1-0731948712436398" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Four profiles will emerge: children with a secure attachment classification for both parents, children with an insecure classification for both parents, children with a secure classification for father and insecure one for mother, and children with a secure classification for mother and insecure one for father.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>More children with LD than children with typical development will be assigned to the insecure attachment clusters (to one/both parents).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The different profiles will associate differently with children’s well-adjusted functioning.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>To be noted, children’s adjustment measures included internalizing aspects (loneliness, hope and effort, and internalizing behavior syndrome per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731948712436398">Achenbach, 1991</xref>) and externalizing aspects (externalizing behavior syndrome per Achenbach). Children’s adjustment was examined via self-report measures and parent ratings, based on prior studies that emphasized the higher reliability for children’s self-reports than parent-reports on internalizing characteristics, and the opposite outcomes for externalizing characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0731948712436398">Ronen, 1997</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section9-0731948712436398">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The sample consisted of 205 third to sixth graders: 107 with LD (52 girls, 55 boys) and 98 with typical development (56 girls, 42 boys). Children’s ages ranged from 8 to 12 years (<italic>M</italic> = 9.98, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.08). The children all attended seven public elementary schools, selected per the Ministry of Education’s recommendations for schools serving demographically similar neighborhoods in middle-class urban areas of central Israel.</p>
<sec id="section10-0731948712436398">
<title>LD group</title>
<p>All 107 children had been diagnosed with LD through previous psychoeducational evaluations. Via written questionnaire, their parents reported on (a) the kinds of diagnostic evaluations their child underwent (e.g., neuropsychological, psychodidactic), (b) the testing accommodations that the child consequently received from the school psychoeducational team, and (c) the specific interventions/treatments that the child received from school psychoeducational staff and from out-of-school resources. In line with the educational policy of the Israeli Ministry of Education, similar to the diagnostic features suggested by the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., text rev.; <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731948712436398">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>), all children receiving this diagnosis manifested an average IQ level and demonstrated substantially lower achievements on standardized tests (in reading, writing, and/or mathematics) than expected for age, schooling, and level of intelligence.</p>
<p>Parents also reported that children received the following extraschool interventions: 57 children (53.3%) received educational treatment outside school, 14 children (13.1%) received psychological treatment, 36 children (33.6%) received pharmacological treatment (e.g., methylphenidate), and 4 children (3.7%) received linguistic–communication intervention.</p>
<p>Parents in the LD group supplied demographic data. Of this group of parents, 101 were married couples and 6 were divorced.

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Approval was obtained from the Israel Ministry of Education and the school principals. Research team members entered each classroom to briefly explain the study and distribute letters to take home to their parents. Parents who volunteered their families’ participation signed and returned the written consent form to the teacher. The research team then contacted parents to provide more information on study aims and procedures, and to coordinate data collection. To match the two groups as closely as possible, after obtaining parental consent, the research team collected data from all of the children with LD but only from those families of children with typical development who matched the children with LD on age and gender.</p>
<p>Graduate students in educational counseling underwent training to recruit participants and to administer the test battery individually to parents and children in a quiet room during home visits. First, children completed the four questionnaires alone. The examiner read sample items aloud for each questionnaire to ensure children’s understanding and provided additional help if necessary (i.e., reading items aloud, administrative guidance). Requests for such help were rare and handled easily. Second, the examiner explained the instrument to parents, who completed it separately.</p>

<title>Preliminary Analysis</title>
<p>Two preliminary analyses were conducted before the cluster analysis. First, to investigate the distribution of children’s attachment classification types among this sample of children with and without LD, children were assigned either a secure or an insecure child–mother attachment classification as well as either a secure or an insecure child–father attachment classification, in line with the categorical cutoff point (score of 45) on the children’s self-reported <italic>Attachment Security Style</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0731948712436398">Kerns et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Chi-square analysis yielded a significant association between study group (with/without LD) and attachment style classification to father, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 7.07, <italic>p</italic> = .01. Although 75.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 74) of the typically developing third to sixth graders received a classification of secure attachment to the father, only 58% (<italic>n</italic> = 62) of the children with LD were classified as securely attached. In contrast, chi-square analysis showed no significant association between study group (with/without LD) and attachment classification to mothers, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 2.10, <italic>p</italic> = .09. Thus, 81% (<italic>n</italic> = 79) of the typically developing third to sixth graders received a classification of secure attachment to the mother, and 72% (<italic>n</italic> = 77) of the children with LD were classified as securely attached. In addition, Pearson correlations showed similar patterns of associations between children’s attachment scores with the father and with the mother among the LD group (<italic>r</italic> = .58, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and the typical development group (<italic>r</italic> = .60, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Second, to decrease the chance of Type 1 error, two-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) focused on group differences (LD Status × Grade), with the following seven dependent variables: SOC, loneliness, hope and effort, children’s self-rated and parent-rated child externalizing behavior, children’s self-rated and parent-rated child internalizing behavior, attachment with father, and attachment with mother. The MANOVA yielded a significant effect for the study group, <italic>F</italic>(7, 191) = 8.75, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .24. The main effect for grade and the interaction between study group and grade were not statistically significant.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731948712436398">Table 1</xref> presents the means, standard deviations, and <italic>F</italic> scores for the univariate ANOVAs of all the study variables, separately for children with LD and for children with typical development. Significant intergroup differences emerged for the two groups on all but one of the child outcome measures (attachment security with mothers). As a group, the children with LD reported higher loneliness, lower SOC, lower hope and effort, and less attachment security with fathers compared with their typically developing peers. Similarly, significant intergroup differences emerged regarding the two broadband CBCL syndrome scales (i.e., externalizing and internalizing), whereby children with LD were rated by their parents as having more externalizing and internalizing problems (i.e., withdrawal, somatic complaints, anxiety/depression, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, delinquency problems, and aggressiveness problems) compared with children with typical development.</p>

<p>Further chi-square tests were conducted to examine group differences regarding the prevalence of children’s typical, borderline-clinical, or clinical behavioral classification, based on their normalized <italic>T</italic>-scores for each of the two CBCL broadband syndromes scales.

<title>Cluster Analysis</title>
<p>These analyses aimed to examine the nature of the interrelations among identified profiles of children and the possible associations of these profiles to children’s well-adjusted functioning.</p>
<sec id="section25-0731948712436398">
<title>Subgroups of different profiles</title>
<p>To identify subgroups of children with different individual profiles, <italic>k</italic>-means cluster analysis was performed with two individual factors: children’s attachment style classification (secure/insecure) with father and with mother. The final cluster solution revealed four distinct profiles. Cluster A (<italic>n</italic> = 121; 54 LD, 67 typical; 59% of the overall sample) comprised children with secure attachment classifications to both father and mother. Cluster B (<italic>n</italic> = 35; 23 LD, 12 typical; 17% of the overall sample) comprised children with a secure attachment classification to mother but an insecure attachment classification to father. Cluster C (<italic>n</italic> = 34; 22 LD, 12 typical; 17% of the overall sample) comprised children with insecure attachment classifications to both mother and father. Cluster D (<italic>n</italic> = 15; 8 LD, 7 typical; 7% of the overall sample) comprised children with a secure attachment classification to father but an insecure attachment classification to mother.</p>
<p>To examine the internal validity of the cluster identification, a MANOVA was performed with the children’s attachment to father and attachment to mother scores as the dependent variables and with the cluster classification as the independent variable. The MANOVA (using Wilks’s Lambda) yielded a significant main effect for the clusters’ identification, <italic>F</italic>(6, 402) = 104.41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .61. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0731948712436398">Table 2</xref>, significant intergroup differences emerged for the four clusters on both attachment to father and attachment to mother scores, indicating that the cluster analysis identified four different clusters due to their defining variables.</p>

Thus, the two populations’ distribution among the clusters was as follows: Cluster A (secure attachment to both parents) was composed of 55.4% typical children and 44.6% children with LD; Cluster B (secure attachment only to mother) was composed of 66% children with LD and only 34% typical children; Cluster C (insecure attachment to both parents) was composed of 65% children with LD and only 35% typical children; and Cluster D (secure attachment only to father) was composed of 53% children with LD and 48% typical children.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study aimed to further explore the relevance and validity of attachment theory for understanding problems in the socioemotional adjustment of children with LD. This study undertook a unique focus on fathers, children with LD, and the concurrent examination of close relationships with one versus both parents. Specifically, the study aimed to identify subgroups of children with different individual profiles of attachment classifications with father and mother and their possibly unique role in explaining children’s adjustment.</p>
<p>Overall, the findings supported the study hypotheses, revealing four different profiles (secure attachment to both parents, to neither parent, to mothers only, and to fathers only), which were differentially associated with children’s socioemotional and behavioral functioning. The results also underscored that assignment to two of the insecure attachment clusters (mother/both parents) was more frequent in children with LD than in typical children. Before addressing these core findings, this section will first briefly discuss the preliminary set of analyses.</p>
<sec id="section32-0731948712436398">
<title>Preliminary Analysis</title>
<p>Preliminary analyses focused on the distribution of children’s attachment classifications toward father versus mother as well as on group differences (children with LD vs. without LD) regarding children’s socioemotional measures. Overall, considering the paucity of research on attachment relationships with fathers among children with LD, the present preliminary results may expand knowledge regarding two major dimensions of these children’s interpersonal relationships with fathers. First, the current findings showed that these children reported a significantly lower incidence of attachment security toward their fathers than did their typically developing peers. Second, the present results indicated that similar to the results of prior studies among children with typical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0731948712436398">Verschueren &amp; Marcoen, 2005</xref>), these children with LD reported feeling more secure with their mothers than with their fathers.</p>
<p>However, the current preliminary findings revealed no significant group differences regarding children’s classification of attachment relationship with mothers. These results differed from those reported in prior studies, where children with LD were reported to manifest a lower incidence of secure attachment with mothers than did children with typical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948712436398">Al-Yagon &amp; Mikulincer, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0731948712436398">Murray &amp; Greenberg, 2001</xref>). One possible explanation for the current surprising outcome may be, perhaps, that the current sample’s high incidence of extraschool interventions (i.e., psychological, educational, medical, and linguistic– communication) may have influenced these children’s relationships with their mothers. Among other directions of research, future studies should examine the possible contribution of such interventions to maternal level of stress and feelings of burden associated with children’s disabilities, which, in turn, may affect the mother’s ability to provide responsive care to her offspring.</p>
<p>The present preliminary results also indicated that these school-age children with LD manifested more self-rated socioemotional difficulties than did their typically developing counterparts, thus corroborating prior reports of higher loneliness, lower SOC, and lower feelings of hope and effort levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0731948712436398">Al-Yagon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948712436398">Estell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0731948712436398">Pavri &amp; Monda-Amaya, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0731948712436398">Weiner &amp; Schneider, 2002</xref>). The children with LD in this study were also evaluated by their parents as manifesting a higher level of both externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors, compared with parents’ evaluations of their typically developing children. Thus, children with LD received a higher prevalence of either borderline-clinical or clinical classifications for both broadband syndromes, compared with children without LD. Together, as described further below, it may be assumed that the internal neurological factors underlying children’s LD affect not only the academic skills that define the LD but also these children’s socioemotional perceptions and functioning (e.g., see review in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0731948712436398">Al-Yagon &amp; Margalit, in press</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section33-0731948712436398">
<title>Profiles of Close Relationships With Father and Mother</title>
<p>As hypothesized, the current results revealed four distinct profiles and also yielded significant differences between the two groups (children with/without LD), indicating that a higher frequency of children with LD than of children without disabilities was assigned to two of the insecure attachment clusters (to mother/both parents).</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, fewer research studies examined child–father attachment relationships than mother–child ones. Indeed, the few available studies that did include fathers mainly examined the unique role of children’s secure attachment to each parent separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731948712436398">Booth-Laforce et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0731948712436398">Lieberman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0731948712436398">Verschueren &amp; Marcoen, 2005</xref>) and rarely compared the role of these children’s secure attachment to both parents versus one parent. Thus, the current examination may extend understanding of children’s specific profiles of close relationships (i.e., secure/insecure attachment to both/one parents), especially among children with LD who manifest diverse socioemotional and maladjustment problems to a greater extent than their nondisabled peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948712436398">Al-Yagon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731948712436398">Culbertson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731948712436398">Estell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0731948712436398">Lackaye &amp; Margalit, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0731948712436398">Morrison &amp; Cosden, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0731948712436398">Weiner &amp; Schneider, 2002</xref>). Moreover, this study also targeted the middle childhood developmental period when family relationships remain crucial but peer interactions expand, offering new demands and opportunities for socioemotional growth (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731948712436398">Gifford-Smith &amp; Brownell, 2003</xref>, for a review).</p>
<p>Specifically, in the current study, the cluster exhibiting secure attachment classification with both father and mother was the largest subgroup, consisting of 121 children (54 with LD and 67 with typical development). As hypothesized, in the group of children with typical development, the current percentage of secure attachment to both parents (68% of the total typical subsample) was similar to that reported by prior studies (about two thirds) focusing on child–mother secure classifications (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731948712436398">Granot &amp; Mayseless, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0731948712436398">Kerns et al., 1996</xref>). In addition, in the group of children with LD, the current percentage of secure attachment to both parents (50% of the total LD subsample) was similar to that reported by prior studies focusing on child–mother secure classifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948712436398">Al-Yagon &amp; Mikulincer, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0731948712436398">Murray &amp; Greenberg, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0731948712436398">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A similar pattern of group differences emerged for Cluster B (secure attachment only to mother) and Cluster C (insecure attachment to both parents). The results for both of these insecure profiles resemble the rare studies on children with LD, which indicated higher reports of insecure attachment with mothers among children with LD compared with their non-LD peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948712436398">Al-Yagon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0731948712436398">Al-Yagon &amp; Mikulincer, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948712436398">2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0731948712436398">Murray &amp; Greenberg, 2001</xref>). However, the concurrent examination of insecure attachment with both father and mother here may add to a growing body of literature focusing on patterns of close relationships among this group of children with disabilities, calling for additional exploration.</p>
<p>The fourth and smallest profile (Cluster D) consisted of only 15 children (8 with LD and 7 with typical development) who exhibited a secure attachment only to the father and showed a similar frequency of children with LD versus children without disabilities. The nature of this profile may support previous findings reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0731948712436398">Verschueren and Marcoen (2005)</xref>, who found that children in middle childhood felt more secure with their mothers than with their fathers.</p>
<p>Taken together, it may be assumed that the internal neurological factors corresponding with LD (e.g., information-processing disorders, impulsivity, performance and production deficits) that affect these children’s academic skills may also affect their social and emotional perceptions and interpretations, which, in turn, may impair not only their social, emotional, and behavioral skills (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731948712436398">Bryan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0731948712436398">Culbertson, 1998</xref>) but also their specific and enduring relationship with their primary caretakers. Furthermore, attachment theory has emphasized the role of the caregiver’s quality of care in children’s individual differences in attachment patterns. In this context, it may be assumed that the difficulties experienced by these children with LD—such as attention, linguistic, and perceptual deficits—may affect their parents’ quality of care and ability to accurately interpret their children’s needs for comfort and exploration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section34-0731948712436398">
<title>Profiles’ Links With Adjustment</title>
<p>As hypothesized, these four different profiles held utility in understanding children’s differences in all but one of their socioemotional and behavioral measures, revealing a significant main effect for the clusters’ classification on their level of SOC, loneliness, hope and effort, and externalizing behavior problems. With regard to children’s internalizing problems as evaluated by parents (i.e., withdrawal, somatic complaints, and anxiety/depression behaviors), the findings were at odds with the current study hypotheses, indicating that these profiles did not play a significant role in explaining differences in internalizing problems among these children.</p>
<sec id="section35-0731948712436398">
<title>Loneliness</title>
<p>Regarding the first measure of socioemotional and behavioral adjustment—loneliness—children who felt securely attached to both parents reported lower loneliness than children who only felt securely attached to the mother or who felt insecurely attached to both parents. Interestingly, regarding their loneliness feelings, the children who felt securely attached to both parents did not significantly differ from the children who felt securely attached only to the father. The current results also clearly suggested that children who felt insecurely attached to both parents (Cluster C) seemed more vulnerable than children in the other three clusters to experiencing loneliness, a measure considered to be a global indicator of dissatisfaction with the quality and/or quantity of individuals’ social interrelations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948712436398">Asher et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0731948712436398">Margalit, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>These results are quite consistent with those of prior studies across a wide range of samples, indicating the association between children’s insecure attachment and high level of loneliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948712436398">Al-Yagon &amp; Mikulincer, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948712436398">Bowlby, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0731948712436398">Qualter &amp; Munn, 2002</xref>). As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948712436398">Bowlby (1973)</xref>, children’s “working models” provide a general expectation of what relationships are like and guide the children’s affect and behavior in close relationships later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0731948712436398">Waters &amp; Cummings, 2000</xref>). However, most of these prior studies focused on children’s attachment with the mother. Therefore, the present results may uniquely pinpoint the possible protective role of these children’s interpersonal relationships with fathers, calling for additional exploration. Furthermore, it should be noted that Cluster C, which reported higher loneliness feelings than the other three clusters, was composed of more children with LD than children without disabilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section36-0731948712436398">
<title>SOC</title>
<p>The SOC measure provided an index of children’s coping resources and personal strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0731948712436398">Antonovsky, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0731948712436398">1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0731948712436398">Greeff &amp; Van Der Merwe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0731948712436398">Lindstrom &amp; Eriksson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0731948712436398">Margalit, 2006</xref>). Children who felt securely attached to both parents reported a higher global orientation or enduring tendency to see the world as comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful (higher SOC) than children who felt securely attached to only one parent or to neither parent. In contrast, like the outcomes for loneliness, children who exhibited insecure attachment to both parents (Cluster C) appeared to be the most vulnerable in forming coping resources.</p>
<p>Although less examined than loneliness, the association between secure attachment relationships and SOC has been described in several prior studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731948712436398">Al-Yagon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731948712436398">Al-Yagon &amp; Mikulincer, 2004b</xref>), but these rarely focused on father–child relationships. Once again, Cluster C, which demonstrated lower levels of SOC, contained more children with LD than children without disabilities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section37-0731948712436398">
<title>Hope and effort</title>
<p>Similarly, the children who felt insecurely attached to both parents (Cluster C), two thirds of whom had LD, appeared most vulnerable to a lower sense of hope and effort. They perceived themselves as having lower pathway thinking (i.e., strategies for attaining goals) and agency thinking (i.e., capacity to initiate and sustain movement along the chosen pathways), as well as lower levels of investment, intensity, and persistence in task accomplishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0731948712436398">Lackaye &amp; Margalit, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0731948712436398">Meltzer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0731948712436398">Snyder, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0731948712436398">2006</xref>). Based on prior studies that emphasized the possible role of individuals’ feelings of hope for various measures of adjustment and coping with stressful situations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0731948712436398">Parveen &amp; James, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0731948712436398">Snyder, 2002</xref>), as well as the current study’s outcomes indicating significant differences in children’s level of hope and effort between children with secure versus insecure attachments, the present results may expand knowledge regarding the possible contribution of interpersonal relationships with both parents among these children with LD. This calls for additional exploration.</p>

<sec id="section38-0731948712436398">
<title>Externalizing behavior problems</title>
<p>Only one significant difference emerged for children’s externalizing behavior problems: Children who did not feel securely attached to either parent (Cluster C) were evaluated by their parents as manifesting significantly more externalizing maladjustment problems, such as hyperactivity, aggression, and antisocial disorders, compared with children who felt securely attached to both parents. These outcomes resemble those reported across a wide range of samples, suggesting the link between children’s insecure patterns of attachment with mother and high levels of externalizing problems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0731948712436398">Greenberg et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0731948712436398">Lyons-Ruth, 1996</xref>). However, recall that most past research on children with LD focused on internalizing rather than externalizing problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731948712436398">Al-Yagon, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731948712436398">Dyson, 2003</xref>). Thus, the current study offers some new knowledge on the characteristics of maladjustment problems among these school-age children with LD, specifically, the higher level of externalizing behavior problems among children with LD compared with their typically developing peers, and the higher frequency of these children assigned to the insecure Cluster C.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>The results of this study hold theoretical and practical implications. The theoretical contribution focused on further validating attachment theory for understanding problems in adjustment among children with LD by investigating distinct attachment security profiles with both parents/one parent and their links with children’s socioemotional and behavioral adjustment. In general, the current results demonstrated that secure attachment to both parents served as a protective factor, whereas insecure attachment to both parents served as a risk factor, in all of the adjustment measures studied. In contrast, it seems that secure attachment to only one parent (either mother or father) did not serve as a protective factor for any of the child adjustment measures, except the case of secure attachment to the father, which did serve as protection against loneliness. Inasmuch as a higher frequency of children with LD than children without disabilities was assigned to two of the insecure attachment clusters (to mother/both parents), children with LD may be considered at higher risk, thus underscoring the link between these distinct profiles and socioemotional and behavioral maladjustment among the LD population.</p>
<p>The practical implications concern the implementation of the current findings, especially when validated by further research, for designing effective interventions among children with LD who manifest insecure attachment with both parents/one parent. Previous studies indicated the effectiveness of interventions aimed at enhancing the quality of parent–child attachment relationships, both in childhood and adolescence, not only for improving attachment security but also for promoting children’s and adolescents’ adjustment measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0731948712436398">Berlin, Zeanah, &amp; Lieberman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0731948712436398">Diamond, Siqueland, &amp; Diamond, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0731948712436398">Moretti &amp; Obsuth, 2009</xref>). Based on these prior findings as well as in accordance with Bowlby’s clinical instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948712436398">1988</xref>), these interventions for children with LD can focus on several major therapeutic tasks, such as (a) helping parents gain insight into the possible effect of their own working models of attachment on their interactions with their children with LD as well as on their effectiveness in achieving their parenting aims and (b) targeting parenting behaviors according to attachment theory, such as parents’ abilities to accurately interpret children’s needs for comfort and exploration and to respond contingently, which may be especially challenging for children with LD, who manifest a variety of cognitive and socioemotional difficulties. Further studies attempting to develop such intervention programs should examine their effectiveness in buffering the socioemotional problems of these children. Considering the current findings on child–father close relationships, that the school-age children with LD reported more security with their mothers than with their fathers and that there was significantly lower attachment security to the father among the LD group compared with the typical group, interventions for these children with LD and their families would do well to focus on enhancing fathers’ level of involvement, availability, and support, to provide more optimal care for these children with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0731948712436398">Hastings, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0731948712436398">Hastings et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0731948712436398">Lamb &amp; Billings, 1997</xref>). The need for such interventions specifically targeting fathers appears crucial in light of the current finding that secure attachment only to the mother was insufficient to protect children from maladjustment.</p>

<title>Limitations and Directions for Future Study</title>
<p>Several limitations in the design and variable selections deserve mention. First, the current data were gathered at one point in time and did not indicate causality. Future research that examines similar variables over time in different developmental phases (i.e., preschool, adolescence) would provide important knowledge regarding the associations between children’s secure attachment classification and their adjustment in the social and emotional domains.</p>
<p>Second, conceptual matters also deserve a word of caution despite the interesting findings regarding children’s attachment classification with father and mother and their feelings of loneliness. The outcomes suggest that children who felt securely attached to both parents (Cluster A) felt less lonely than children who felt securely attached only to the mother, although no significant differences emerged between these children from Cluster A and children who felt securely attached only to the father. Like many studies on children’s loneliness, the current study used the well-known and well-validated scale of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0731948712436398">Asher et al. (1990)</xref>. This scale focuses on a unitary construct. Thus, the current results, along with other recent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0731948712436398">Verschueren &amp; Marcoen, 2005</xref>), indicated that security felt with mothers may be especially predictive of children’s functioning in more intimate small groups or dyadic interactions, whereas secure attachment to fathers may be more predictive of peer acceptance. These early speculations underscore the need for separate assessments of loneliness subtypes due to the emotional/social dimensions and the distinction between peer group and dyadic peer relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0731948712436398">Hoza, Bukowski, &amp; Beery, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0731948712436398">Qualter &amp; Munn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0731948712436398">Weiss, 1973</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, the relatively small sample sizes of Clusters B (<italic>n</italic> = 35), C (<italic>n</italic> = 34), and D (<italic>n</italic> = 15) also deserve a word of caution. To further understand the unique role of these profiles for explaining children’s well-adjusted functioning, future research should use larger samples, different socioeconomic classes, and other geographical areas to facilitate validation and generalization of the current findings.</p>
<p>Fourth, the current data did not examine the possible association between gender and pattern of attachment with father and mother. The current design was based on attachment theory assumptions, which indicated that attachment security does not vary as a function of gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731948712436398">Bowlby, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0731948712436398">1988</xref>), as well as on a recent study that showed nonsignificant effects for the gender variable among children in middle childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731948712436398">Booth-Laforce et al., 2006</xref>). However, to further understand the interrelationships among the current study measures, future research would do well to examine the possible unique contribution of children’s gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0731948712436398">Mayseless, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0731948712436398">Verschueren &amp; Marcoen, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Fifth, a word of caution is needed about the present sample’s heterogeneity in comorbidity characteristics as well as treatment options. As in previous studies, the current sample of children with LD manifested heterogeneous disabilities and comorbidity with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). As suggested by cross-sectional research, LD often co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders such as ADHD, depression, and anxiety or conduct disorders (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731948712436398">Capozzi et al., 2008</xref>, for a review). Future research might also explore the possible role of children’s individual comorbid disorders and treatments in explaining patterns of close relationships with significant others.</p>
<p>Sixth, the current data focused on children’s and parents’ perceptions, in line with prior studies emphasizing the higher reliability found for children’s self-reports compared with others’ reports when measuring perceptions of close relationships and emotional features, and the opposite outcomes for externalizing characteristics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0731948712436398">Ronen, 1997</xref>). However, one may speculate that inclusion of additional information sources, such as data on academic functioning or direct observations and teacher reports of behavioral problems (e.g., Teacher’s Report Form; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731948712436398">Achenbach &amp; Dumenci, 2001</xref>), may provide a more complete picture.</p>
<p>Finally, the present sample size did not permit examination of children’s individual characteristics (e.g., perceptual, attention, linguistic, visuomotor skill deficits) in explaining their well-adjusted functioning and patterns of close relationships with parents. Likewise, future studies on children with LD may also examine parental characteristics such as health and psychiatric history as possible contributors to children’s adjustment measures and patterns of close relationships.</p>
