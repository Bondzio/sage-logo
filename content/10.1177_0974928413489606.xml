<p>The last few months have seen several welcome additions to writings on international relations and Indian foreign policy by some retired members of the Indian Diplomatic Service, all of whom have distinguished themselves in important and responsible positions that they occupied while serving the country.</p>
<p><italic>Diplomatic Channels</italic> by Ambassador Krishnan Srinivasan occupies a significant position in this collection, not only because it deals with issues and subjects that are of continuing interest and concern to students, scholars and researchers as well as decision- and policy-makers, but also because they are also of equal relevance to common citizens of the country who take keen interest in the manner in which foreign policy is formulated and executed.</p>
<p>The most interesting and exciting part of the book which is divided into two main essays and contains several short pieces on contemporary issues is the first chapter titled ‘Retrospections’ which deals with the time and events when Kris Srinivasan was the Foreign Secretary for 14 months in 1994–1995. What makes this account particularly fascinating and refreshing is the extensive and detailed treatment of events that took place during this momentous period. This chapter would be especially stimulating for those who have studied or observed developments in those times from close quarters. No comparable accounts of events and developments in the formulation and execution of foreign policy with the vantage point of the Foreign Office in South Block are available since India’s independence in 1947. Srinivasan hence fulfils a much felt need of a detailed account of the ideas, personalities and pulls and pressures that go into the formulation of any policy, particularly in the realm of international relations and foreign affairs. This chapter stands out on account of the precise, sharp, accurate and insightful description of the main persona who were involved in determining and implementing India’s foreign policy in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Srinivasan describes President S.D. Sharma as having a ‘mumbling, indistinct manner of speech, causing his scarcely comprehending foreign visitors much bewilderment’. President Sharma also ‘liked to hear gossip about ministers’. His comments on P.V. Narasimha Rao who was the Prime Minister during Srinivasan’s tenure are telling. He describes Rao as ‘the opposite of charming. A poor conversationalist, he liked it best when playing the intellectual’. Of K.R. Narayanan, the author comments that ‘he was more urbane, more affable, sharper and had a better knowledge, especially of the East, than all other top leaders but, encouraged by his wife, he had an exaggerated notion of his importance and protocol status’. The book is laced with such perceptive remarks which bring alive the events and personalities of those times. Srinivasan does not mince words while describing even those leaders who are currently active in politics. For instance, he says of Salman Khurshid, the present External Affairs Minister that he ‘was more capable and intelligent, but did not take the pains to master any subject though he was certainly by far the best face and voice of the ministry at that time’.</p>
<p>All such descriptions and accounts are entirely devoid of any malice or personal ill-will of the author towards these individuals. These details are provided to enable the reader to get a better feel of the temper and atmosphere prevailing at that time. Srinivasan describes in some detail the incident that was widely reported in the media just before Narasimha Rao’s visit to USA in which Srinivasan is reported to have stormed out of a meeting convened by Prime Minister at 7 RCR. What is discernible and also commendable is that Srinivasan does not take personal credit, more than what is due, for several of the successes and achievements of his tenure. Srinivasan provides tantalisingly detailed accounts of discussions and relations with USA, Russia, Europe, China, Pakistan, North Korea issue, nuclear disarmament, foreign visits by Prime Minister Rao, etc. Interesting and evocative details have been provided by the author of the mystery thriller-like developments regarding Pakistan’s efforts to raise the Kashmir issue at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva and at the UN in New York. In both these attempts, Pakistan had to face a humiliating retreat on account of some nimble footed pre-emptive diplomacy and strategy adopted by Headquarters as well as our Missions.</p>
<p>The second detailed essay on ‘Non-Alignment Revisited’ is equally exhaustive and rewarding. The author delves deep into the philosophy as well as evolution and growth of the Non-Aligned Movement. He lists the three successes of the policy for India in its leadership role in the Korean crisis, the Suez Canal conflict and the Indo-China dispute. According to him, the pinnacle of achievement of this policy for us was attained even before the first Non-Aligned Summit was held in Belgrade in 1961. The policy was designed to promote peace, disarmament and co-existence and to provide a bridge between the two superpowers during the Cold War years. It failed to achieve any of these results. What was more disappointing and unhappy from our point of view was that it was not able to help us in any way to effectively deal in our wars with Pakistan and China. None of the non-aligned countries stood with us during these wars or during our nuclear tests in 1974.</p>
<p>The volume also contains penetrating short takes on contemporary events from as far afield as the USA in the West to Japan in the East. For the general reader, there are reflections on caste, charity and competitiveness. The volume closes with a short story about the reminiscences of a colourful retired diplomat.</p>
<p>During his years in service, the author had eminently successful stints as High Commissioner/Ambassador to Nigeria, Bangladesh and several other countries. He returned to Delhi to become the Foreign Secretary and led the Foreign Office with great élan and finesse in difficult and trying times. During his term, he was required to deal with the unfolding economic crisis of proportions that the country had not witnessed anytime before, the aftermath of the Babri Masjid demolition, the pangs of implementation of the Mandal Commission Report and the growing insurgency, for most part fuelled through support and promotion of terrorist activities by Pakistan in Kashmir. Post retirement, he was also deputy secretary general at the Commonwealth Secretariat in London for seven years.</p>
<p>In personal life, Srinivasan is a man of few words. He is more given to listening to others and does not suffer from any proclivity to launch forth and air his views on any given subject. He is hence able to assimilate and report more objectively and with greater precision than another commentator might be able to share with his readers and audience.</p>
<p>The other advantage is that the first chapter, which along with the chapter on Non-Alignment, truly forms the backbone of the book, was written within a year or so after Srinivasan relinquished charge of his position. All names, places, developments, sequence of events and details are hence accurate and authentic. Srinivasan is also known not to mince words and be direct and forthright in expressing his views and conclusions. These qualities find ample reflection in the book which makes it into an even more valuable and satisfying book to delve into.</p>
<p><italic>Diplomatic Channels</italic> is a must read for all students, practitioners and scholars of foreign policy and international relations. It will provide them with a ring-side view of the pulls and pressures under which most lofty decisions are taken and implemented. What sets this volume apart from several others of its genre is its candidness, forthright approach and sharp, insightful observations.</p>
