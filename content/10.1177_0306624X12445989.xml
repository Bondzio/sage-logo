<abstract>
<p>Regarded as beneficial and preferable to the clients, advice delivery has been an integral part of counseling; however, there are controversies over the suitability of giving advice in counseling services, including counseling conducted in the context of prisons. Based on conversation analysis, this article tries to explore when and how police counselors in two Chinese prisons give advice and how inmate clients respond to and seek advice in offender counseling. It is found that advice delivery, supposed to be for the inmate clients’ sake, only serves a phatic function in the context of prisons in which security is a priority, and transforming inmates into law-abiding citizen is the overall goal of prison rehabilitation and correction. Hence, offender counselors, intending to alleviate depression and anxiety in inmate clients, are caught in a dilemma.</p>

<p>As a new intervening tool to educate inmates, offender counseling was not initiated in China’s prisons until 1985 and has been considered as the fourth tool in addition to the three well-recognized traditional tools to transform inmates in China’s prisons—education, labor, and prison administration. The provision of offender counseling services has been thriving in about 90% of prisons in China for the past 25 years and is believed to not only improve the mental health of inmates but also to help maintain the order and security of the prison. However, there have been increasing suspicions about it in recent years, because what is actually going on in offender counseling is not well known, and how offender counseling could help inmate clients change is in question. In addition, provision of counseling by police counselors, both as facilitators and controllers, results in controversies over whether prison counseling works and should be further developed in China’s prisons. Based on conversation analysis (CA), this article tries to explore one integral part of offender counseling, that is, advice delivery, with an aim to shed light on how offender counseling is carried out in two Chinese prisons.</p>
<p>“The provision of advice is central to the work of many contemporary social service professionals, particularly those working in fields such as health care, education and counseling” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X12445989">Emmison, Butler, &amp; Danby, 2011</xref>, p. 4). Although there is no “institutional mandate” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X12445989">Emmison et al., 2011</xref>, p. 3) to give advice or not for most counseling services, advice delivery is an integral part of counseling and is regarded as a client-centered activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X12445989">Rita &amp; John, 1999</xref>). However, there exist controversies over whether advice should be given during counseling because the delivery of advice might impede further exploration into problem solving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0306624X12445989">Rita &amp; John, 1999</xref>). In addition, “mainstream counseling theory assumes that no human being, not even a trained counselor, can know for sure what is best for another person” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0306624X12445989">Masters, 2004</xref>, p. 13). Police counselors, whose clients are temporarily deprived of liberty and are now serving their sentences, assume the role of providing “professional” advice to inmates on how to deal with problems that arise during incarceration and how to avoid reoffending after release. However, because in China the majority of offender counseling is conducted by qualified counselors who are in police uniform, inmate clients tend to be resistant and defensive toward prison counselors as well as to their advice. Therefore, it has been suggested that advice delivery not be used in the process of counseling in that inmates seldom accept advice offered by counselors or do what counselors ask them to do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0306624X12445989">Egan, 1990</xref>). Nevertheless, counselors are always tempted to give advice because it is easy to give, and they are aware that many clients come for the counseling with the hope of getting it.</p>
<sec id="section1-0306624X12445989" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Originated from ethnography, CA was first developed in the late 1960s by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0306624X12445989">Harvey Sacks (1992)</xref> and later by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0306624X12445989">Schegloff (1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0306624X12445989">Jefferson (1984)</xref>. CA distinguishes itself from other approaches to discourse by its focus on talk-in-interaction, and “the primary objects of study are the structures and practices of human social interaction per se—not interaction as a carrier of other social phenomena” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0306624X12445989">Peräkylä, 2004</xref>, p. 3). Utterances in our daily life, in the opinion of CA analysts, are not so chaotic or random as they appear but are carefully designed. CA seeks to examine social structures and their functioning through analysis of detailed organization of ordinary phenomenon such as turn-taking procedures, adjacency pairs, and linguistic or nonlinguistic components interlocutors use such as repair, overlap, or silence that are regarded to have sequential consequences.</p>
<p>Counseling is a process of interaction between two parties. Only after detailed analysis of naturally occurring language used by counselors and clients can one understand the specific characteristics of counseling services and “obtain adequate understanding, leading to soundly based policy interventions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X12445989">Silverman, 1997</xref>, p. 35). Studies into advice delivery in different contexts using CA have yielded fruitful results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0306624X12445989">Heritage and Sefi (1992)</xref> explored how counselors use stepwise entry to advice through a question–answer format to avoid making new mothers feel deficient in knowledge or action during home visits. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0306624X12445989">Emmison et al. (2011)</xref> focus on how counselors use script proposals, a way of packaging their advice, to be consistent with values of self-direction and empowerment in a kid’s helpline. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0306624X12445989">Kinnell and Maynard (1996)</xref> investigated how counselors give advice to clients when they talk about safer sex in a clinic that provides anonymous HIV antibody testing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X12445989">Vehviläinen (2001)</xref> examined how stepwise entry to advice works in an education setting in which counselors and students discuss students’ plans. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0306624X12445989">Silverman (1997)</xref> analyzed forms of advice giving and advice reception, particularly forms of advice rejection in HIV counseling. These analyses of advice delivery shed light on our better understanding of the specific relationship between counselors and clients and the context in which advice delivery is given; however, there has been no discourse study into the delivery and reception of advice in counseling conducted in prisons in which security is the priority and transformation of the inmates into law-abiding citizens is the overall goal of prison rehabilitation and correction.</p>
<p>In the context of China’s prisons, there are different kinds of counseling, which could be grouped into three categories: counseling new inmates who have just entered the prison and are considered to have shown difficulties in adapting to prison life, counseling inmate clients who enter counseling voluntarily, and counseling mandatory inmate clients who are considered to be emotionally unstable or prone to violent behaviors. In this study, the focus is on the interaction between police counselors and inmate clients who come for counseling voluntarily. The data for this study were obtained from offender counseling services conducted in two prisons in southern China, one of which conducts face-to-face counseling and the other online video counseling. There are explicit rules and procedures for inmates to apply for counseling in both prisons, and promise of confidentiality is always provided at the beginning of each counseling session. The providers of counseling are all police officers who have obtained approved counseling qualifications required by the prison, and they wear police uniform during counseling.</p>
<p>The collection of advice delivery used in this study is drawn from four counseling sessions lasting from 45 min to 1.5 hr. The data were transcribed using Jeffersonian conventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0306624X12445989">Atkinson &amp; Heritage, 1984</xref>), and the version in Chinese pinyin is provided in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0306624X12445989">appendix</xref>. Chinese sentence-final particles, such as Ah, Ba, Le, and Ne, are not omitted in the Chinese pinyin. The age, education background, and prison terms vary among inmate clients; the crimes they committed include robbery, fraud, drug trafficking, and murder. For the purpose of anonymity, both parties in the counseling are designated by pseudonyms such as Chen for the police counselors, and Wang, Zhao, Sun, and Qian for the inmate clients. Detailed information that might reveal their identity also is omitted. Analysis of four counseling sessions can, by no means, tell the whole picture of offender counseling in China but might stimulate frontline police counselors’ reflection and point toward implications for the improvement of services of offender counseling and other treatment programs.</p>

<title>Analysis and Discussion</title>
<p>In accordance with Oxford Dictionaries online, advice refers to “guidance or recommendations offered with regard to prudent action.” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X12445989">Waring (2007)</xref> defines advising as “any activity that involves one party conveying to another what the former believes to be beneficial to the latter regarding some performance or behavior” (p. 367). In addition, “advice contains a normative dimension, a recommendation toward a course of action that the advice giver prefers, and it is given with the expectation that the recipient will treat it as relevant, helpful, or newsworthy and accept it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X12445989">Vehviläinen, 2001</xref>, p. 373). In other words, the recipients are supposed to consider advice given seriously, and any rejection or refusal of the advice might be regarded as inappropriate or even defiant. In the context of the prison, inmate clients who are clever enough will not explicitly doubt the feasibility of all the advice delivered by police counselors and will accept it willingly so that the dignity of police counselors is not threatened. However, it also is implicative that the party who is given advice has “insufficient competence in a certain area” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0306624X12445989">Waring, 2007</xref>, p. 368), which might lead to inmate clients’ implicit resistance.</p>
<p>One prominent feature of Extract 1 and other counseling sessions is the frequent use of the term <italic>gaizao</italic> (reform). The term <italic>gaizao</italic> means replacing the old with the new to adapt to the change. For the past years, gaizao in China has been criticized by the West because the object of gaizao is considered to be not only the body but the mind and therefore inhumane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0306624X12445989">Zhang, 2008</xref>, p. 16). With the introduction of Western penology into China, academics and practitioners in the fields of criminal justice have begun to replace gaizao with terms such as <italic>correction</italic> and <italic>rehabilitation</italic>, which so often are quoted that the position of the term <italic>gaizao</italic> as a core concept of prison education with Chinese characteristics has been endangered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0306624X12445989">M. Guo, 2005</xref>). However, the term <italic>gaizao</italic>, in current prisons, is still popularly used by prison officials and inmates and is molding their ideas and behaviors in an opposing direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0306624X12445989">Kong, 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>In this extract, the police counselor first asks about the client’s present conditions (Line 1) and her future plan for the rest of her prison terms (Line 3). The answers, after a silence of 0.5 s, provided by the client expressing her willingness to study hard and reform well (Line 4) satisfy the counselor. The adjective “good” (<italic>hao</italic>) prefaced by the degree modifier “very” (<italic>hen</italic>; Line 5) expresses the counselor’s positive evaluation of the client’s responses. In Line 5, the counselor has planned to say a sentence, which has a causal relationship “because you came here” (<italic>yinwei ni dao zheer lai</italic>), but cuts herself off and fixes it by asking whether the client knows the reason why she is staying in the prison. Whether the inmates acknowledge that they are serving a sentence for crimes committed and have guilty plea attitudes toward sentencing always involves the security and order of the prison; hence, the frequency of these kinds of questions in the prison and in counseling is very high. These questions raised in the context of counseling also indicate police counselor’s dual identities: being counselors, helping to alleviate any mental troubles that clients are undergoing, on one hand, and police officials eliciting information that might endanger prison administration, on the other. The client’s simple answer “(I) know” (<italic>zhidao</italic>) in Line 7 obviously is far from satisfactory because the counselor repeats this question requiring the client to elaborate on what she should do during incarceration (Line 8), and there is a silence lasting 0.6 s afterward. During this period, the counselor changes neither her topic nor ways of asking questions, implicating her insistence on this question. The counselor confirms the client’s answer given after a silence of 0.6 s using response token “Erm” (Line 10) and then starts to summarize by giving advice that the most important thing is to reform. Afterward, the counselor brings forward two more questions.</p>
<p>All the questions in this extract are systematically related: Why are you serving sentences in the prison now (it is because you committed a crime; Line 5), what should you do during incarceration (the most important is reform; Lines 6 and 8), whom is reform for (it is for you; Lines 12), and how to reform (get rid of old bad habits; Line 14). Questions in Lines 12 and 14 are raised without a gap or silence in between to allow the inmate to answer, and answers are soon followed by the counselor herself. These two self question–answer formats imply that the counselor might not be patient enough to wait for a correct answer from the client or might consider that the client lacks such knowledge, and therefore, provides these two answers advising a preferable attitude and activities to the client. Moreover, these two answers are both delivered in the form of tag question: right (<italic>duiba</italic>, Lines 12 and 14), implicating that the counselor is giving the client opportunities to disagree with or reject her advice and is willing to “find out ways to overcome these troubles and psychological crises through discussing with each other” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0306624X12445989">Luo, 2007</xref>, p. 416). However, because of the special context of the prison and power asymmetry between the police counselor and the inmate client, it is impossible for the client to question the advice. Thus, these tag questions, to some extent, are mere formalities. In Lines 11 and 13, the client is responding so actively to the counselor’s advice that her utterances are overlapped with the counselor’s turn (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0306624X12445989">appendix</xref> for Chinese version), displaying a strong degree of agreement, whereas these responses are just simple repetitions of what the counselor has said, and there are no more utterances, which are either complementary or approving. Considering the context of the prison, it is very likely that the client has been in the habit of showing agreement by shaping her turns “with minimal gap, often latched or in overlap” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0306624X12445989">Pomerantz, 1984</xref>) to show their compliance and it does not necessarily mean that the client has accepted the advice (p. 69).</p>

</list>
<p>In Extract 2, the counselor first asks about the client’s educational background. In the prison under study, all the inmates are required to learn to read and write, and the progress and quality of study are determined by their original educational level. After asking about the client’s ability to read (Line 3, Extract 2), the counselor provides the advice to “finish your study as soon as possible” (<italic>jinkuai de ba xuexi renwu wancheng</italic>; Line 7, Extract 2) because it is good for reform and is for the sake of everything and everyone, including the client. In Extract 3, the counselor asks the client whether she has confidence in her 15-year sentencing (Line 1), and there is a silence for 1.2 s afterward, indicating that the counselor has given up her turn. However, the client does not take the floor at this turn transition place. Undoubtedly, a 15-year prison term is a difficult time for any person, but it might be inappropriate to say so in this context. The client is in a dilemma and chooses to remain silent. After a 1.2-s silence, instead of requiring the client to offer an answer, the counselor breaks the silence and initiates two suggestions in Line 2. First, the client is advised to “reform well” (<italic>haohao gaizao</italic>) because she “still has opportunities” (<italic>haishi you jihui de</italic>). Second, the client is advised to “have confidence” (<italic>you xinxin</italic>) because she is “still young” (<italic>nianji hai qing</italic>). Whether these two suggestions, which are in causal relationships, make sense to the client is unknown, but the counselor might have been aware of the client’s unwillingness to respond. In Line 2, without eliciting feedback from the client, the counselor changes the topic and begins to ask about the client’s boyfriend.</p>
<p>The advice provided in Extracts 2 and 3 still focuses on the key word <italic>reform</italic> (<italic>gaizao</italic>). In the context of the prison, it is implied that inmate clients have deficiency in their old life values and habits and should change accordingly during incarceration so that they can be transformed into law-abiding citizen on release. On the whole, the advice that inmate clients should reform well in Extracts 1, 2, and 3 are provided by the counselors as preferable for the inmate clients and, therefore, should be accepted.</p>

In Line 3, the counselor breaks the silence, repeats what the client has said for confirmation, and then soon begins to provide advice: (a) put what you have learned to practice (Line 3); (b) be more outgoing (Line 5); (c) communicate more with fellow inmates (Line 5); (d) stay calm if anything happens (Line 5); (e) do not be impulsive (Line 7); (f) more asking (Line 9); (g) you should bear if you are wronged (Line 11); (h) suffering a loss is gaining an advantage and suffering a loss is a blessing (Line 13); (i) you could leave here earlier as long as you try hard to reform (Line 15); (j) have confidence (Line 15); and (k) try your best to solve problems by yourself, and ask police officers if you couldn’t solve them (Lines 19). These utterances not only implicate the problems and difficulties that might arise in prison life (e.g., to be wronged) but also provide some solutions to these situations (e.g., be patient, try to solve problems by herself). This advice is not delivered in an authoritarian or dictatorial manner, and some in the format of tag question (Lines 7, 9, 11, and 13) just like advice packaged in the tag questions in Extract 1. Therefore, their authoritativeness could be downgraded. The advice in Line 13 even resorts to the saying which often is heard and well remembered among the public in China (suffering is gaining an advantage), making it easier to be understood and hopefully more acceptable.</p>
<p>It is worth noticing that the counselor is very careful about her choice of words in advice delivery. In Line 11, the response token “Erm, Erm” in the middle of the sentence (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0306624X12445989">appendix</xref> for Chinese version) indicates the counselor’s hesitation in talking about the following problems and is trying to find a suitable word to describe some unusual situations. The Chinese pinyin <italic>zheli</italic> and <italic>zheer</italic> mean “here” in English and could be referred to as “the prison” in this context. The avoidance of referring to “prison” in Lines 5 and 15 in this extract and also in Lines 1, 5, 6, and 10 in Extract 1 expresses the counselors’ efforts to not humiliate the client and put the client on a more equal footing. However, seen from responses of the client in this extract, the client’s contribution of discourse is still very little. In Line 15, Extract 1, the response “yes” is more frequently used between two parties who are in a hierarchical relationship and does not necessarily mean a strong degree of agreement, nor does the response “yes” largely used in Lines 4, 6, 10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 22, and 24 in this extract.</p>

<title>Taking It Easy Is for Your Sake</title>
<p>Advice requested by the client is rare in the discourse data. During the process of the counseling, some clients might ask some open-ended questions appearing to seek answers from the counselor, but “meaning beyond words” are the client’s wishes that the counselor could help solve some practical problems. As for the questions raised by the clients, the counselors usually respond through advice.</p>

<list-item><p>16 Wang: Yes.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>During the process of this counseling, the client has repeatedly mentioned that her letters to her family members have not received any reply, and she is worried that her imprisonment would put her family into difficulties. Therefore, whenever the counselor gives her opportunities to raise either questions or difficulties, the client responds in the format of a declarative sentence that there are no other difficulties (e.g., Line 2). Her repetition that there are no other difficulties might be meant to emphasize that her worry about her family is her only concern. However, the counselor, intentionally or unintentionally, does not “understand” or intends to “ignore” her “meaning beyond words” and never gives advice or offers a solution in dealing with this problem. In this extract, the client asks about when she could call her home (Line 4) after the counselor’s intention to hand over the floor to her, either in direct (question in Line 1) or indirect form (repetition of the client’s utterances in Line 3). The appearance of this question is near the end of the counseling, and the reasons why the client brings forward this question at this time might be out of two considerations: First, the client is aware that the counseling is coming to a end, and she must make use of this opportunity; second, the client hesitates about whether she should ask this question because it is always the inmates who answer questions instead of raising questions. Therefore, the client might be worried about whether her questions might have some bad influence on her record or on the counselor’s evaluation of her attitude of cooperation despite repeated encouragement in different forms made by the counselor during the whole process of counseling, which could be shown by the form of the question raised by the client. The official address of the counselor (Line 4) before the enquiry implies that the counselor has been positioned more as a police official than a counselor and that the client is very cautious to avoid showing disrespect to the counselor. Deprivation of contact with persons outside of prison seems to be the most serious punishment in prison life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0306624X12445989">Blackburn, 2000</xref>). The purpose of this question raised by the client might be to have a call with her family members. However, the counselor’s advice is to “take it easy, don’t worry, worry is useless” (<italic>jiu manman lai, bie zhaoji, ji le ye meiyong</italic>, Line 15) after analyzing that the reasons for her loss of contact with her family members are that the client has missed her latest date and might miss her next date for family calls as arranged by the prison and that the countryside is not advanced in communication (the inmate’s hometown is in a countryside in a different province). When dealing with such problems, the simplest way for counselors in other institutions is to arrange for the client to make a call. However, because of restraints of the rules and regulations of the prison, the counselor could not provide feasible advice to the client nor promise that the client’s problems might be solved after reporting it to superiors. Therefore, what the counselor could do is to comfort the client, which might not be meaningful or helpful. The response token in Line 16 “yes” (<italic>shi</italic>) instead of “right” (<italic>dui</italic>) might be one of the signs of resistance shown by the weak, implicating that the counselor’s answer does not satisfy the need of the client.</p>

<p>During counseling, there also are some clients who would put forward what is troubling them and specifically ask for advice from counselors. In the following case, the client has a sleeping problem and always feels that he could not move at all when sleeping.

</list>
<p>In this extract, the client explicitly expresses his hope that “you could give me some advice” (<italic>huozhe ni gei wo tichu ge jianyi</italic>) in Line 1. However, the main purpose of the client might not be just to ask for advice but implicitly express his dissatisfaction with such utterances and behaviors of the custodial officials: (a) Custodial officials are not concerned seriously about their illness; (b) the medical facilities are limited in the prison, and thus, his illness could not be correctly diagnosed; (c) custodial officials think that he is afraid of death; and (d) there is nothing else he could do with his illness because of his incarceration. Through these narrations, the client hopes to win the counselor’s identification with his present helpless conditions and “support” (<italic>zhichi</italic>, at the end Line 1). Meanwhile, the client is fully aware of the explicit and implicit rules of the prison and will resort to expressions widely acknowledged by the prison by explaining that the reasons he had said so are that he is very worried whether he could serve prison terms easily and reform well in Line 3, which is surely a clever way to meet less criticism from the counselor.</p>
<p>Extreme case formulation in Line 3 “I would rather serve a longer sentence than have this illenss” (<italic>wo [shi] kending duo zuo jinian lao, wo ye bu qingyuan de zhege dongxi</italic>) is used to emphasize the client’s helplessness in having this kind of illness. Therefore, he should not be blamed for either his illness or his expression of dissatisfaction. From Lines 5 to 9, the interaction focuses on whether inmates can express emotion. The client resorts to direct report speech of the custodial officials’ utterances in Line 7 to express his doubts, because it is unreasonable not to allow inmates to express emotions, which are very natural and has won the counselor’s strong agreement (“expressing emotion is surely allowed,” <italic>qingxu kending yunxu de</italic>, Line 8). In Line 9, the comparison of his feeling better after talking with the counselor with his feeling dissatisfied with the utterances of custodial officials who do not allow him to vent his feelings also is a means to win the counselor’s support and identification.</p>
<p>During the process of the client’s narration, the counselor has been acting as an attentive listener and has allowed the client to speak out freely with little interruption. However, the counselor has never delivered advice about how the client should handle the present situation concerning his illness and the relationship with the custodial officials, but has continuously been encouraging the client by expressing his understanding (Lines 2, 4, and 6) and eliciting relevant information at the same time. After the client expresses that he feels comfortable after speaking out at the end of Line 9, there is a silence for 0.7 s, indicating that the client has given up his floor of speaking and waited for the feedback from the counselor. Realizing that the client has no more to say, the counselor breaks the silence and takes the floor but still does not explicitly express his comment on custodial officials but provides sidewise advice that the premise on which he let out his emotion is not to “influence other people” (<italic>yingxiang bieren</italic>, Line 10). Therefore, the topic of the content and object of emotion venting has been turned to the way of expressing emotion for the sake of the client, thereby avoiding evaluating the custodial officials.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The development of counseling in China’s prison is still very young, and to date, there have been no professional standards or supervision system based on China’s economic situation, cultural background, and the real situations of the prison. In this study, the counselors make use of advice delivery to summarize, break silence, and elicit information. Discourse resources such as repetition, tag questions, asking questions in a stepwise way, and change of topics are resorted to during interaction by police counselors with the aim of making advice more acceptable and persuasive. However, police counselors might not know or could not say directly what the best is for inmate clients, either because of lack of experience or constraints of the prison. Therefore, advice delivered by the police counselors is not only impersonal but could be applied to other inmates—hence, it is unlikely to be regarded as preferable and beneficial by inmate clients. Inmate clients, punished and incarcerated, are careful not to speak out without hesitancy during counseling. When given advice, they will resort to discourse resources such as response tokens connoting limited information, little contribution of the discourse to the interaction, and terms fully acknowledged by police counselors and the prison to avoid direct confrontation with the police counselors. On the whole, the advice given by the police counselors could be termed as <italic>soft orders</italic> and the responses made by the inmate clients to the advice could be termed as <italic>weak compliance</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0306624X12445989">J. Y. Guo, 2011</xref>). For example, the often-mentioned term <italic>gaizao</italic> (reform) has become a very secure choice of words for both parties in the counseling. As for the counselors, advising the client to reform accords with prison requirements and will meet less resistance from the clients who dare not challenge this authoritative term. As for inmate clients, resorting to the term <italic>reform</italic> in their responses to the advice given by counselors not only can circumvent their being criticized for being uncooperative but can also voice their implicit disagreement or disapproval. It is worth noticing that the object of reform is the inmates, and advising inmate clients to reform not only undermines the value of advice but also, to some extent, discourages initiatives of the clients.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0306624X12445989">Vehviläinen (2001)</xref> wrote, “Counseling entails an inherent contradiction” because “clients should be ‘empowered,’ their self-directedness increased, and their own experience treated as the relevant starting point,” but “counseling often has other aims that contradict these ideals and put the professional in the position of an authority,” and this contradiction is embodied more obviously in offender counseling (p. 373). In normal counseling, counselors and inmates would be on an equal footing. The police counselors and inmate clients are in fact in a controlling and controlled relationship. The inmate clients, out of either “respect” for or “fear” of the police counselors who are representing the power of the prison and the country, tend to show their compliance. The ideal goal of empowering the inmate client to speak out freely in counseling is quite contradictory to the main functions of the prison, which consist of “deprivation,” “punishment,” “reform,” and “restriction.” Therefore, the function of offender counseling at present might be minimized to being phatic, providing an alternative for inmates’ voices to be heard.</p>
