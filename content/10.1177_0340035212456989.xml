<p>By the time you read this, the World Library and Information Congress, 78th IFLA General Conference and Assembly, held in Helsinki, Finland in August, will be over and we will already be looking ahead to next year’s congress in Singapore. To provide a taste of the Helsinki conference, we will be publishing a selection of some of the best papers in the next issue. For the present, however, we present a varied selection of other papers which reflect in some small degree the wide range of interests of IFLA and its membership.</p>
<p>The first paper deals with a topic that we think has never been covered before in these pages. Carnival 2013 may be some months away still, but Lorraine M. Nero of the University of the West Indies in Trinidad and Tobago, brings carnival into the pages of <italic>IFLA Journal </italic>with her paper on ‘Cataloguing costume designs from the Trinidad and Tobago Carnival’. The author discusses the approaches to cataloguing carnival costume designs adopted by the National Library and Information System Authority (NALIS), the Carnival Institute of Trinidad and Tobago (CITT) and the Alma Jordan Library, University of the West Indies, in Trinidad and Tobago. Aiming to determine similarities and differences in the approaches as well as highlighting some of the issues encountered in cataloguing costume designs, the research shows that in addition to core elements found in metadata standards there are other data elements that the cataloguers have identified as being important for the documentation process including the relationship of the costume design to other pieces in the performance as well as the cultural context.</p>
<p>The second paper comes from a part of the world that has only rarely been represented in our pages in the past. In ‘Library and information science alumni of Kuwait University: Tracking positions and functions’, Taghreed Alqudsi-ghabra and Nujoud Al-Muomen of Kuwait University present the results of the first survey designed to investigate where alumni of Kuwait University’s Master of Library and Information Science program are working and what different functions they are performing. The paper draws inferences about the graduates’ skills, positions, functions, aspirations and behaviour and shows that the job market is fluid and evolving, with many graduates performing diverse and untypical functions. Questions related to the profession’s image and professional expectations are considered, and suggestions for future planning discussed in the light of the survey results.</p>
<p>We move to a different country and a different professional field with the next paper, ‘Changes and challenges: The new information environments in schools – a British perspective’, by independent consultant Andrew K. Shenton. The author notes that the nature of the learning resource areas found in Britain’s schools has changed dramatically in recent years, with traditional libraries becoming increasingly uncommon and being replaced in many institutions by computer-oriented ‘study centres’. These different environments pose a range of challenges to those who manage them. This paper explores in some detail questions related to such aspects as the physical environment, the virtual world to which the study centre offers access, the role of traditional materials, the functions of staff responsible for the facility and the purposes for which the area should be used.</p>
<p>Further changes of location and focus are reflected in the next paper, ‘Showing the green way: Advocating green values and image in a Finnish public library’, by Harri Sahavirta, Chief Librarian of the Vallila and Suomenlinna libraries in the Helsinki City Library system. Vallila Library created its own environmental strategies and policies and reviewed such activities as recirculation and recycling, but found that the greatest challenge was that nobody had spelled out the concept of ‘green library’: the library had to view the issue on a broader scale, showing others the road to becoming green(er). The library offers easy access to information on ecological issues and arranges events that focus on environmental issues. Commitment to green values may increase environmental sustainability and help libraries to take a new and visible role in changing society.</p>
<p>The final paper in this issue deals with another country that has rarely featured in these pages. ‘Developing libraries in Lesotho’, by former Peace Corps volunteer Joey N. Lehnhard. The paper describes efforts to create effective and sustainable school and community libraries in Lesotho through professional development both in literacy education and librarianship. A library effectiveness survey of 170 school and community libraries started since 2008 led to the formation of a team of Peace Corps volunteers and local educators and librarians to create and lead a series of workshops to guide local library leaders. Piloted in September 2010 and revised with feedback, this workshop series was intended to aid the creation of 32 new libraries in 2011 by focusing on topics most relevant to the developing culture of reading in Lesotho.</p>

<title>Arabic and Chinese abstracts</title>
<p>The first issue of <italic>IFLA Journal </italic>for 2012 included, for the first time, Arabic and Chinese translations of the abstracts of papers published in that issue. For technical reasons, it was not possible to include Arabic and Chinese abstracts in the second issue, but they have now been published online, and this issue is complete with the Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Russian and Spanish abstracts of the five papers described above.</p>
