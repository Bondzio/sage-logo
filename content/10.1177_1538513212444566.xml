<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The city is often revered precisely because it is the locus of difference and diversity, as the writings of Fischer (1975), Lefebvre (1991), Harvey (2000), and many others have attested.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1538513212444566">1</xref>
</sup> What counted for Jane Jacobs was the “everyday, ordinary performance in mixing people,” through which were formed “complex pools of use” that would be capable of producing something greater than the sum of their parts. In creative cities parlance, “visible diversity serves as a signal that a community embraces the open meritocratic values of the Creative Age.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1538513212444566">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The importance of diversity as a key component of successful urbanism has been well covered in the literature, and the diversity theme now pervades contemporary views about what cities are supposed to be, from ecological urbanism, to eco-feminism, to creative cities. Following Jane Jacobs' lead, the connection between diversity and urban vitality and economic growth is considered paramount. In the realm of urban planning and design, the notion of diversity—mixing people, uses, and activities—has become central to most conceptions of what the good city is supposed to be. The main idea is that “close-grained” diversity of uses provides “constant mutual support” and maximizes “exchange possibilities,” but diversity is also now the basis of urban sustainability—economic vitality, accessibility, and pedestrian-oriented provision of the diverse services and facilities a neighborhood requires.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1538513212444566">3</xref>
</sup> Related to this, socially diverse neighborhoods are seen as essential for broader community well-being and social equity goals.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1538513212444566">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It is somewhat ironic then that the rules of citymaking—in particular, zoning—came to be associated with the near antithesis of diversity. Instead of promoting the mixing of people and uses, zoning produced just the opposite—as James Howard Kunstler summarized it, “a formless, soulless, centerless, demoralizing mess.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1538513212444566">5</xref>
</sup> In recognition of this fundamental problem, the last decade of urban planning has been engaged in trying to overcome the entrenched rules of an earlier generation of planners. The basis of this reform—form-based codes (FBCs), smart codes, and sustainability codes—is largely about changing the rules on land use mix and diversity, instituting a new coding regime that would support diversity.</p>
<p>Zoning is implicated in this quest for diversity not only because it controls allowable use, but because it controls building form. Form, Jane Jacobs pointed out, is a key factor in sustaining diversity. Variation in housing type is particularly important, and zoning is capable of controlling tenure, the mix of different forms and sizes of units (single-family vs. multifamily), and even the mix of housing ages. Zoning can also prevent conditions that undermine an appropriate context for diversity, for example, by preventing people from subdividing their lots, adding units, or opening small businesses out of their homes. Zoning can play a role in degrading a public realm needed to provide an appropriate and supportive setting for mixing uses, for example, by requiring surface parking lots, wide setbacks that inhibit the ability to define space, or allowing big box stores out of scale with small scale diversity.</p>
<p>The fundamental ways in which zoning undermines diversity have received significant attention in planning scholarship. There have been analyses of the exclusionary motivations behind the Euclid decision, the separation of multifamily housing, and the racial basis of zoning, especially the exclusion of Blacks and Jews. Some claim that zoning was essentially an attempt to redistribute wealth away from low-income renters and toward existing property owners. Zoning rules are most often evaluated as boiling down to the same thing: keeping “lower class” people, and the uses they require, out. From the economist’s point of view, zoning is the embodiment of Madisonian “plans of oppression” in which principles of exclusion and protection of self-interest are allowed to drive the urban landscape.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1538513212444566">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While the history of zoning and its disastrous effects are widely known, the history of this association is more complex than is generally reported. In line with other recent reappraisals of the traditional narrative of zoning history, this article sheds light on the connection between zoning and diversity from a new, historically focused angle.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1538513212444566">7</xref>
</sup> I contend that the original thinking about zoning was more nuanced with regard to diversity and mix than most critics of zoning allow. Planners were not so unaware of the importance of urban diversity and so blind to the problems of social and land use separation. While planners were sometimes off the mark when it came to diversity—especially with regard to social diversity—in other ways, there was an understanding of the importance of diversity. Planners, especially those interested in reasserting the importance of diversity as a basis of economic vitality, should be aware of this history.</p>
<p>I first present the history of how early zoning proponents approached the idea of diversity: what did the original framers of zoning think about the mixing of people and land uses in cities, and what were their principle motivations? I lay out the ways in which thinking about diversity was initially more in line with what planners today value as a measure of good urbanism—a more finely grained, less restrictive level of urban mixing, especially in regard to commercial and residential mixing. For several reasons, this changed after World War II, and zoning evolved into a system that undermined urban diversity to a much greater degree than initially proposed. I conclude with an assessment of what zoning history tells us about the future of zoning reform in which diversity is promoted. Given the history of zoning and diversity, is it likely that development rules can be relied on to create a more diverse city? How does the historical record inform current efforts to reinstitute diversity and therefore a more supportive context for economic vitality?</p>

<title>Zoning and Separation</title>
<p>While there is some debate about the degree of good intentions—and openness to diversity—among the originators of zoning, it is generally assumed that the defining principle of American zoning was its intent to divide people and uses. Wolf’s detailed account of <italic>Euclid v. Ambler</italic> labeled zoning a “quintessentially Progressive concept,” but most accounts posit zoning as something that instead crushed diversity. The legacy of zoning—as a tool that undermines diversity—seems a settled question.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1538513212444566">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While there is no disagreement that this is how zoning evolved, it is possible to offer a revised interpretation of what early zoning proponents thought about diversity, what their motivations were, and how their approach differed from today’s zoning ordinances. My purpose is to revisit the historical record on zoning and diversity to reveal a more complex lineage. How did the original framers of zoning, whose imprint we are now working from, approach the subject of land use diversity?</p>
<p>Such a reevaluation requires recognition that not all zoning proponents acted the same with respect to social objectives, and that separation of use, intensity of development, and building form might have been motivated by very different objectives than social separation. Such an interpretation has been difficult, given that the history of zoning is overshadowed by its role in fostering social exclusion. This reevaluation is in no way meant to lessen the import of zoning’s racial bias. In some places, the use of rules for racial separation was central to the concept of zoning, and this remains one of the most important and disturbing lessons of urban planning experience in the United States.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1538513212444566">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It is important to recap this history. The racial undertones of zoning started in the 1880s with California’s laws against laundries, which were intended to exclude the Chinese (Modesto, California was the first to create a laundry free district, in 1885). Then shortly after 1900, many cities in the South passed racial zoning where each block was allocated to one or the other racial category, depending on the majority of occupants. Members of the other group were not allowed, by law, to move in. The US Supreme Court declared racial zoning unconstitutional in 1917 (Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U.S. 60, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/245/60/">http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/245/60/</ext-link>), but there were ways around it. For example, industrial uses could be purposefully zoned into black neighborhoods in an attempt to undermine the viability of those neighborhoods. In places like Atlanta and St. Louis, strict zoning requirements ensured that blacks would not be able to meet the standards for new construction. Glynn County, Georgia, did not allow alleys adjacent to lots greater than 120 feet in depth, because they did not want rear dwellings—populated with poor blacks—fronting them. In a more general way, as Babcock argued, zoning was popular because people were “concerned not with <italic>what</italic> but with <italic>whom.</italic>”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1538513212444566">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Sometimes early developers of planning regulations seemed naïve about how these rules could be used to manipulate social outcomes. Thomas Adams, writing in 1922, said “it would not be proper even if desirable to restrict the value of houses erected in a particular district,” but then went on to argue in favor of rules governing lot size, height, and use. Through their proselytizing of zoning, planners let loose a tool that provided a way for people to act on fear and maximize protection in unnecessary and socially damaging ways. Unfortunately, the more people learned, the more they demanded it. In 1917, 16 percent of zoning changes in New York were for tighter restrictions on who, or what, could occupy the land; just five years later, it was 77 percent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1538513212444566">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While social separation, especially racial exclusion, was a significant part of early zoning codes, there were other motivations impacting the relationship between zoning and diversity—and these are the focus of the remainder of this article. Apart from the attempt to socially separate, there were two motivating factors, both of which were significantly different from the exclusion impulse: the desire to limit the intensity of development (density), and the determination that zoning could be used to provide better housing opportunities for the middle-class and, for some housing advocates, poor people.</p>
<p>First, the separation of uses, particularly housing type, was an outcome of the desire to limit the intensity of development. New York City’s 1916 code, from which all others sprung, was defined at the time as a “reasonable plan for preventing over intensive development,” containing only, it was said, “a limited degree of segregation.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1538513212444566">12</xref>
</sup> Zoning proponents were aware, early on, that limits on development impacted the separation of uses.</p>
<p>In Germany, where zoning originated, limitations on density had a different purpose than in the United States—lower density via zoning was intended to keep land prices low for the working classes. Thus the reduction of densities was about housing <italic>reform</italic>, not exclusion. In the years leading up to New York City’s comprehensive zoning ordinance in 1916, a similar argument was being made.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1538513212444566">13</xref>
</sup> Cheap housing for industrial laborers would be impossible without such limits, and, it was thought, limits on speculation could only be stopped by limiting density through zoning. This meant that certain kinds of housing—multifamily apartments—were excluded.</p>
<p>Zoning for single-family housing came to be seen as something that would ensure that poor people, too, would get to live in a better form of housing, with its superior access to light, air, and nature. Jane Addams called the focus on single-family houses a “fetish,” but for most planners, it was not a matter of keeping poor people out, it was a matter of giving lower-income people a better place to live. Accessory units along rear alleys—what planners might now advocate as an affordable housing option—were not seen as healthy ways of promoting infill development, social diversity, or income-generating opportunities, they were viewed as filthy hovels, where families shared space with cesspools, stables, and holes filled with garbage. This reality was powerful when coupled with the common belief that bad housing was causing bad behavior: “dark rooms with a mean outlook create dark-minded citizens with a mean outlook.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1538513212444566">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Edward M. Bassett, a leading proponent of zoning in the early twentieth century, argued that the promotion of single-family housing was for the benefit of the poor and working classes, not the affluent. He wrote that “fine new apartments” were for “white-collar people,” and he took issue with the attempt to “belittle” the single family house. The threat that American cities would become like Manhattan, which in 1900 had 88 percent of its population living in tenement houses, was very much on the minds of reformers. In Philadelphia, the executive secretary of the Philadelphia Housing Association wrote that “it is the expensive apartment house that causes us worry,” not “detached houses.” When located adjacent to single-family houses, apartment buildings were viewed as parasitic, benefiting from the yards of their neighbors but offering none of their own amenity in return. “The apartment took, took, took. It never gave,” wrote New York City’s zoning committee secretary. Unfortunately, claims about the value of single-family homes for poor people were not backed up with actions or policies that would ensure equal access to quality housing. According to Power, Bassett’s advocacy for better housing for the poor in single-family neighborhoods “was all puff.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1538513212444566">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Keeping commercial and industrial uses apart from residential uses was another key motivation of zoning, backed by two strong reform movements: public health and housing. Zoning was what progressives turned to when their first choice, taxation reform, proved politically difficult. In the early 1900s, the focus of attention was the Lower East side of Manhattan, and extreme overcrowding there had been met with proposals for taxing land rather than buildings, which, it was believed, would encourage building in the outlying parts of the city and release land for development that was currently being held for speculation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1538513212444566">16</xref>
</sup> But the untaxing of buildings never occurred. Zoning, promoted by property owners along Fifth Avenue’s high class shopping district who wanted to stop the invasion of factories (and factory workers), proved much more tenable.</p>
<p>There was concern that a factory in a residential area would lead not only to conversion of single-family residences to multifamily housing, but that the resulting lowered rents and lowered maintenance would lead to slums.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1538513212444566">17</xref>
</sup> These concerns extended to less polluting uses, like stores. When residents and housing advocates pushed back against business integration—as they often did—they feared that commercial interests would become too dominant. Lawrence Veiller, founder of the National Housing Association, an organization devoted to improving housing conditions for the poor, was at first reluctant to embrace zoning, but later came to see it as essential for exactly this reason. He described the benefit of keeping stores out of residential areas as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>How are we to treat [the] case where a man has invested his money in an attractive dwelling with the idea of permanently living there for the rest of his days; then suddenly he finds his property values injured, the whole character of the street endangered, because someone has chosen to construct a small retail store in one of the houses? One store of this kind leads to another, and within a short time the residences are driven out.<sup>

<title>Zoning and Diversity</title>
<p>While the history of zoning’s role in use segregation is sometimes seen as a simple quest to sort cities by social category or urban function—or sometimes, as discussed above, via limits on density and a desire for “better” housing and less polluted neighborhoods—there are instances in zoning history that point to a more nuanced understanding of the implications and requirements of land use diversity. To begin with, progressives were aware early on that use separation promoted through zoning could be a problem. Lawrence Veiller worried that the separation of uses through zoning—“factories in one section, dwellings in another, commercial buildings in another and tenement houses in another”—was not only undemocratic, but that it fostered “class-consciousness.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1538513212444566">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A primary topic of debate was the degree to which stores and residences should be separated. The record reveals that it was not a simple metric of wanting to keep all stores out. Initially, controls were a matter of allowing some mix, but not enough to render a neighborhood dysfunctional and underserviced. For example, in a residential area, Bassett argued, butcher shops were bad, but dry goods retail was good. Commentary leading up to the adoption of New York’s 1916 ordinance included pleas to “separate the stores from the residence districts, and yet not to put them too far away, but always have them within reach.” Writing in 1920, Charles H. Cheney, a leading zoning advocate, wrote: “there are no single family dwelling districts without a small business or apartment house center located within a half mile or a few blocks at least, convenient for everybody.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1538513212444566">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>It was also believed that limiting businesses to certain locations was good for the economic health of those businesses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538513212444566">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538513212444566">2</xref> ). Specifically, constraining businesses to selected streets, where businesses would be “forced to stay on them” and residents would be “compelled” to shop on the nearest business street, would strengthen small businesses. If rogue businesses started to “short-circuit the trade” by infiltrating a residential corner, and if that business was successful and others followed, “this hurt the car-line street where the business ought to be.” On the other hand, if several stores came into a block fronting a main thoroughfare or street-car line, that street was likely showing its “normal destiny” and should be zoned for business entirely.<sup>

<p>Many planners saw single-family detached housing in geographical relation to apartments and local stores. This was possible because zoning initially had a much finer grain to it, a reflection of the kind of use pattern streetcar lines had established: apartments and businesses close to the streetcar lines, and single-family housing only a few blocks away. German cities, on which zoning was originally based, exhibited this pattern as well.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1538513212444566">22</xref>
</sup> The zoning proposed by German planners, such as that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1538513212444566">Figure 3</xref>, was meant to codify this spatial arrangement. Near public parks and playing fields—urban open space—a row of “small-sized residential buildings” lies adjacent, but these are immediately surrounded by higher intensity (medium-sized) residential buildings. These are next to, and protected from, a row of commercial buildings fronting shopping streets. The tightly grained pattern reflected in these rules would mean that virtually everyone in the town would have good access to amenities.</p>

<p>Bassett wanted zoning to establish a similar kind of pattern. Regarding the Flatbush area of Brooklyn he wrote that “probably nowhere in the United States can the effect of zoning be exemplified better than in Flatbush…an inter-dependent community of buildings and uses” consisting of “home districts where children can grow up,” “apartment houses for young married people” [and] “for old people after they have brought up their families” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1538513212444566">Figure 4</xref> ). Integrating houses and apartments meant that “the apartment dwellers are better off than in solid apartment house areas because the tenants have more light and air and can walk out on pleasant streets” and “the private home owners have the benefit of more stores, better local facilities and lower prices due to the presence of the apartment house customers.”<sup>

<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1538513212444566">Figure 5</xref> shows another example of the level of integration being discussed. The zoning map is an example from Los Angeles in 1928, where zoning advocates proposed a system of “Step Down Zoning.” Commercial uses would line street frontage, apartment houses would be adjacent to commercial zones, two-family housing adjacent to apartment houses, and finally zones for single-family houses. The arrangement created an ordered intensity of building types, “a gradual shading off from the commercial zone to the single-family residence zone.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1538513212444566">24</xref>
</sup> It is ironic, given the hundreds of zones now in place in most cities, that the authors feared at the time that the method would not take hold since most ordinances did not contain enough zoning categories. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1538513212444566">Figures 6</xref> show an example of the change in zoning that took place in Phoenix between 1930 and 2004—from a step down arrangement, similar to Los Angeles, to a map with no particular spatial organization.</p>

</fig>
<p>In addition to this finer spatial grain of zoning districts, zoning ordinances initially allowed a great variety of uses within each land use category, which is one reason why including more zones was unnecessary. George Kessler’s plan for Dallas in 1910 divided the city into zones, “each devoted to its own particular purpose,” but within each zone there was enough land use diversity to ensure that daily life needs could be locally accessed. John Nolen advocated something similar: “differentiated districts, each with the services needed for its greatest efficiency.” The most restricted residence district in Baltimore’s 1924 zoning ordinance allowed boarding houses, dormitories, apartments over garages, hotels, and lodging houses. Chicago’s 1923 “residential” district permitted “homes, apartments, hotels, clubs, churches, schools, libraries, museums, hospitals, nurseries, truck gardens, or railroad stations.” The rules allowed “doctors, dentists, artists, hairdressers, manicurists and dressmakers” to set up shop in residential zones.<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>Zoning ordinances in general were much simpler, often under eight pages, and this conciseness was the result of having fewer use designations. Typically, there were just three use zones—residential (single-family, mostly, unless an “apartment district” was also needed), commercial, and industrial. Chicago’s 1923 ordinance had four classes of use districts—residential, apartment, commercial, and manufacturing. So did Newark, New Jersey, although uses could be effectively limited by constraining the vertical and horizontal extension of buildings. Seattle’s 1923 zoning ordinance had just two residence, two commercial, and two industrial districts. New York City’s 1916 zoning ordinance, which essentially codified existing land uses, had three use districts: residential, business, and unrestricted. Within those categories, there was significant land use diversity allowed.</p>
<p>Zones were small and spatially arranged to allow local businesses to be adjacent to residential ones, and this contributed to urban diversity. Zones often consisted of a single block or part of one. The housing reformer Lawrence Veiller had been an advocate of small geographic boundaries for districts, in the range of a single side of a single block, because “anything larger than this is bound to cause trouble…with the units thus limited to one side of a block, it is possible to give to each part of a city the special treatment that it needs,—business in one case, residences in another.”<sup>

<title>The Loss of Nuance</title>
<p>This nuancing of land use diversity was something planners lost sight of at a fairly early stage. Already by the late 1920s, Clarence Perry was bemoaning the inconvenience being caused by “remoteness from markets” due to zoning out business. Modernist ideas about shopping center design were also starting to be a factor. A 1937 article in <italic>The Planner’s Journal</italic> claimed that “unbiased research in merchandizing methods” had shown that “the concentration of shops in a compact shopping area [is] desirable socially and economically,” and superior to “the nonconforming store in a residence district.” This kind of thinking put an end to the tighter connections between residential and commercial uses that had been in evidence in the earliest zoning ordinances. Planners, lacking faith in the ability of design to solve incompatibility issues, began arguing that residential areas needed to be protected with “physical buffers in the form of open space.” Magazine article titles like “Tower buildings and wider streets: A suggested relief for traffic congestion” signaled a new era in which traffic flow and efficiency became the main drivers of land use regulation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1538513212444566">27</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Zoning also started to exert more effect on separating housing and employment. This was indirect—zoning tended to increase land values toward the center, and this caused industry to migrate toward cheaper land, away from working-class neighborhoods. Many believed that this was a conscious effort to separate out “undesirable population classes” by removing the land uses they relied on—industrial sources of employment and retail establishments. Meanwhile, “zoning did nothing to relieve the ugly conditions in the urban slums,” claims to the contrary by Edward Bassett and other early twentieth-century planners notwithstanding.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1538513212444566">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>By mid-twentieth century, planners were well aware that the inability to mix uses was a significant problem. A half-century ago, planners warned that segregation of housing type “means that a family cannot find appropriate quarters in the same neighborhood as it passes through the usual stages of development.” Whyte wrote that zoning’s segregation of building types was resulting in “a social fabric of stifling monotony.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1538513212444566">29</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>There seemed to be a corresponding loss of connection between underlying purpose and zoning rule, where zoning seemed driven by bureaucracy rather than meaningful objective. Lewis Mumford had recognized this problem, arguing at mid-century that the mechanisms largely put into place with the help of planners—zoning, especially—had reduced the city’s capacity to foster its primary function of human exchange—“the maximum interplay of capacities and functions.” What zoning had become, as Michael Sorkin summed, was an “armature” of “conflict avoidance.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1538513212444566">30</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Why did planners lose the approach to land use and zoning that recognized the importance of diversity under certain spatial conditions? A number of explanations can be proposed. One is that the nuance was lost when zoning began to assert more control, a result of greater acceptance in the courts. A smaller scale, less dramatic approach—more permissive of land use diversity—was a necessary strategy in the initial stages, but this gradually gave way to a zoning approach that was, with greater leeway, larger-scaled and more constraining.</p>
<p>This was a gradual process. Kolnick showed that zoning developed incrementally out of a long-evolving desire to maintain public welfare and a sense of order, not necessarily a dramatic, pro-development change in line with the “city efficient” era, as some early zoning proponents (notably Bassett) had proposed. Over time, however, more acceptance of zoning allowed a coarser grain of regulation—that is, larger, and more single-use zones. By mid-twentieth century, zoning was in line with the large-scale, single-use community building favored by developers. Of influence too were new ideas about urban form itself: modernist urbanism, the movement launched by CIAM (Congrès internationaux d'architecture modern) in the 1920s advocated land use segregation, high-rise towers in parks, and a rejection of the smaller-scale pedestrian street that had been an urban form more conducive to diversity.<sup>

<title>Future Prospects: A Renewed Focus on Zoning for Diversity</title>
<p>Since the mid-twentieth century, zoning has been under constant siege. Critiques of zoning include John Reps' epic <italic>Requium for Zoning</italic> (1964), Babcock’s <italic>The Zoning Game</italic> (1966), Mandelker’s <italic>The Zoning Dilemma</italic> (1971), and Siegan’s <italic>Land Use Without Zoning</italic> (1972). Carl Feiss asked whether planners had been “lulled into a coma of mass acceptance” of an “incomprehensible” tool that was fostering “unlimited sprawl.” Siegan asked whether land was being regulated “merely for the sake of regulation,” apparently because people must be assuming that even if zoning was “unreasonable, inequitable, and irrational,” it was better than nothing.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1538513212444566">32</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Initial remedies focused on allowing greater flexibility. Kevin Lynch in <italic>The Image of the City</italic>, and Babcock and Weaver in <italic>City Zoning</italic> were among those calling for a loosening up of zoning rules.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1538513212444566">33</xref>
</sup> The first technique to be introduced was the “special use” or “conditional use” permit, just after World War II. In 1957, Chicago introduced “performance standards” for manufacturing districts, and in the 1960s performance standards and feedback loops were introduced in Petaluma, CA and Ramapo, NY. Other attempts to increase flexibility include the planned unit development (PUD) and related variants (PAD, PD, PCD, etc.), overlay zoning, floating zones, the floor area ratio, and, in the United Kingdom, Simplified Planning Zones. Complicated overlay zones, planned unit ordinances, and other installations of discretionary review—even as part of a legal code—meant that there was plenty of room for interpretation. Discretionary review became built-in. This seemed a natural response to the problem that many zoning rules had been instituted in a static way, with no contemplation of how an area might evolve.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1538513212444566">34</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Taking flexibility to its fullest extent, there have been recent musings about the value of getting rid of zoning entirely and letting the market guide development. One suggestion has been to adopt “open-ended” regulations, whereby rules are only adopted if they “do not limit the rights of other property owners or the community and impacts are mitigated.” Others have argued that our experience with no zoning—namely, Houston—is hardly a model to emulate. Land use patterns there have tended toward homogeneity and sprawl, not good urbanism. On the other hand, if it is true that the biggest effect of zoning’s removal would be that “apartment house developments” would penetrate “high-class residential districts,” as Toll argued it would, that might be the kind of free-market effect reformers have been looking for.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1538513212444566">35</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Concern about the unpredictability of a more flexible approach, however, has led current zoning reformers to look back toward the initial era of zoning—a period in which zones were more finely grained, there was a wider variation of uses allowed in any one zone, and there was a greater understanding of the locational requirements of zones, especially how one zone relates to another. Many city planning departments in the United States are implementing this approach through what are known as “form-based codes” (FBCs). Instead of concentrating on bulk and use, FBCs focus on the physical design of cities: the form, size and location of buildings, streets, and frontages. FBCs provide a mechanism for implementing a proscriptive vision about community form, rather than a set of rules designed to prohibit incompatibilities. This might be especially beneficial where diversity is an explicit goal: if the form is coherent and designed to be an asset, residents may be less likely to object to a wider mix of uses.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1538513212444566">36</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>FBCs seem to be adopting a logic similar to the earliest generation of codes, in which levels of diversity varied by location. The approach is found in the SmartCodes smart growth codes, sustainable codes, and most New Urbanist codes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1538513212444566">37</xref>
</sup> What is particularly interesting about these new conceptualizations of zoning is that they follow the approach to diversity that an earlier generation of planners had been following. As reviewed above, planners had initially based their approach to land use mix on a German system of variation, where different levels of diversity were considered appropriate based on where they were located in the city: more diversity in closer-in locations, less diversity at the periphery. The approach weakened over time, and the fine grain tuning of land uses in spatial proximity was lost sight of. New zoning approaches now seem intent on getting this spatially informed approach reconstituted.</p>
<p>The earlier approach was based on a well-developed spatial ideal, where workers, housing, and services were to be in proximity, but the specific requirements of each zone depended on spatial location. On busier commercial streets, living quarters were above shops, while on quieter streets, live/work units (the “shop/house”) was the norm. In the United States, planners had initially argued that “small-lot districts” should be “closer to the center of activity of the community,” and that “the logical places” for apartments was either in a buffer district between businesses and single family houses, along main thoroughfares, or near a railroad station. It might even be argued that the separation of housing types into single-family, two-family, and multifamily zones made sense, had the higher density housing been closer in and more accessible to urban amenities. Planners did discuss the need for “access to local shopping centers in each residence neighborhood,” and that “the ideal arrangement would permit a citizen to walk to his work,” but, unlike the German experience with zoning, such arrangements were difficult to hold on to as cities started to disperse with the advent of personalized transport. If spatial ideals had been more firmly established in US codes, it might have been apparent that there was a potential conflict being created with another commonly espoused goal: that “open spaces should increase proportionately” with population density.<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Despite calls for reform, most zoning codes in the United States prohibit diversity and negatively impact the ability of cities to foster creative, vibrant urban spaces. There is the occasional “mixed-use district” or overlay district, but for the most part, zoning lacks the finer spatial grain that would increase proximity between uses. In addition, residential areas are required, through zoning, to be kept strictly residential. The Phoenix zoning code provides a clear example. The code states that the purpose of its many “Residence Districts,” which cover most of the city, is “to preserve these areas from the distractions and adverse impacts which can result from immediate association with nonresidential uses.” Uses other than residences, therefore, are labeled “distractions,” rather than essentials that satisfy daily life needs. The only nonresidential uses explicitly mentioned as needing to be accessible are “light and air,” “open space,” and “a variety of outdoor areas.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1538513212444566">39</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Trying to develop a residential property to allow more diversity at a small scale is also prohibited by zoning. Accessory buildings in residence districts have the same yard requirements as the main building, meaning that only double lots under single ownership would be able to meet the requirement. The selling of products or services is also prohibited. Residents can sleep, eat, and park vehicles; engage in a “hobby, avocation, or pastime”; and operate a home occupation consisting of “architect, lawyer, off-site sales businesses, accountant, real estate agent, telemarketing sales, and psychologist.” Under no circumstances is it possible to operate a barbershop, beauty parlor, veterinary office, dog grooming, massage parlor, or restaurant. Employees are not allowed, unless they are immediate family members. There may not be any mechanical equipment “except that normally used for domestic, hobby, standard office, or household purposes,” no outdoor display, for example on the side of a building, and there can be no “exterior indication of the home occupation.” A business can only be small, as “not more than 25 percent of the total area under roof on the site shall be used for any home occupation.” An occupation in an accessory building requires a special use permit, which is not easy to obtain.</p>
<p>The historical experience with zoning in the United States suggests that zoning rules—apart from those that were explicitly race or class-based—started out being more conducive to land use diversity than most zoning codes now allow. As zoning became more chaotic, more spatially detached, and more complicated, it lost that ability. Is it realistic, then, to conclude that changing entrenched zoning rules is possible, or that such change will produce more diverse cities? Some observers have been doubtful. One study took the view that “mixed-use development”—one of the key strategies planners use to create diversity—could be characterized simultaneously as “ambiguous concept, simplistic analysis and wishful thinking.” One study of “mixed use in theory and practice” concluded that mixed use promises much but delivers little because it operates amidst “social and economic forces” that continue to promote land use separation. And there is still the fear that “mixed-use” in low-income communities will translate to “high levels of cancer, birth defects, asthma, respiratory disease, hearing loss, lack of sleep and stress.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1538513212444566">40</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>What can be said, however, is that there is emerging a greater conceptual clarity and consensus regarding what needs to change when it comes to the relationship between zoning and diversity—at least among planners. For those who support a diverse city, this reason is enough to be optimistic. Residents may want, above all, to protect the value of their property, but perhaps this value can now be derived not by homogeneity, but by some form of controlled, spatially informed, and integrated diversity similar to that advocated by an earlier generation of planners. Learning from past experience with zoning—how planners varied the size and grain of zoning categories, the spatial relationships they tried to employ, and the way in which diversity varied by location—may be important to the development of a renewed interest in zoning for diversity.</p>
