<abstract>
<p>United States ports must be prepared for the threat of a small-vessel attack using weapons of mass destruction (WMD). To reduce the risk of such an attack, modeling was conducted at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) in Aiken, South Carolina, to develop options for redeployment of existing maritime law enforcement resources, deployment of new resources, and optimal use of geographic terrain. Agent-based modeling (ABM) implemented by the Automated Vulnerability Evaluation for Risks of Terrorism (AVERT<sup>®</sup>) software was used to conduct computer-based simulation modeling. The port-specific models provided estimates for the probability of encountering an adversary based on allocated resources under varying environmental conditions and traffic flow rates. Defensive resources include patrol and response platforms, some of which may be more appropriate in particular environmental conditions. A diverse range of potential adversary and attack scenarios was assessed for a large area port and also for a port with a narrow inlet, thereby identifying vulnerable pathways. For chokepoint operations, the probability of encountering an adversary was estimated for various configurations and operational tempos. As traffic flow increased, the probability of encountering an adversary decreased because the adversary could assimilate into traffic, while security forces were preoccupied inspecting pleasure craft. However, there was a significant increase in the probability of encountering an adversary (<italic>P</italic>(Encounter)) when additional patrols were added. Noted was a decreasing marginal benefit of additional patrols at low traffic levels. In open water, use of helicopters on patrol substantially increased the <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) by directing on-water security to target vessels. This capability was due to the far-reaching vision and speed capabilities of helicopters. As a result of ABM, more effective countermeasures can be deployed with available resources to reduce the risk of a small-vessel attack using WMD. The models can be expanded to all ports in the United States using generic models similar to those presented herein that can be matched to any port based on its size and shape.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>In April 2008, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released the <italic>Small Vessel Security Strategy</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548512912439952">1</xref></sup> describing the ‘immense’ challenge of distinguishing between legitimate vessel operators and those engaged in illicit activities. A small vessel is defined by the industry as any craft that weighs less than 300 tons. There are an estimated 13 million registered recreational vessels, 82,000 fishing vessels, and 100,000 other commercial vessels contributing to the current United States small vessel population.</p>
<p>Redeployment of existing maritime law enforcement resources, deployment of new resources, and optimal use of geographic terrain are examined using agent-based modeling (ABM) for countering the threat of a small-vessel attack using weapons of mass destruction (WMD) within port areas. Current security tactics include a show of force through routine security patrols. However, more efficient interdiction relies on targeted areas for sensor-enabled security patrols to encounter, detect, and identify the illicit transport of materials used for WMD. Boat-mounted radiological and nuclear (Rad/Nuc) detection systems can detect gamma rays and neutrons with gamma spectroscopic identification. These weatherproof systems on harbor patrol watercraft are being used now by maritime law enforcement to provide actionable discovery and situational awareness.</p>
<p>In order to support maritime law enforcement, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) used ABM to evaluate various sensor-enabled, tactical, deterrent, and mitigation strategies to counter a terrorist Rad/Nuc attack within a maritime port, namely the inlet or harbor approach to strategic port facilities. The results would also be applicable to other sensor-enabled security patrols for interdiction of illicit materials. The Automated Vulnerability Evaluation for Risks of Terrorism (AVERT<sup>®</sup>) software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548512912439952">2</xref></sup> was used to implement the ABM for effective utilization of defensive security resources.</p>
<p>AVERT<sup>®</sup> is commercial simulation software from ARES Software Corporation that has been used by security specialists over the past 10 years to quantify risk and evaluate mitigation strategies for land-based, high-value facilities. The software is a United States DHS Safety Act approved tool used at commercial and government facilities, including Department of Energy (DOE) and Department of Defense nuclear weapons facilities.</p>
<p>The ABM methodology is used by security professionals to identify vulnerable pathways and preempt threats, thereby enhancing the protection of critical assets and facilities. The modeling serves as a primary tool for analyzing security systems in support of the implementation of optimal security postures. Previous models have focused on facilities in small, land-based geographic areas that contain military bases and security buildings rather than the much larger and more open port areas. Our application is unique because of its maritime basis and the much larger geographic areas involved in the simulations.</p>
<p>Maritime ports are ‘sprawling,’ intermingled with sophisticated transportation networks and, in most instances, in close proximity to densely populated areas that are easily accessible. Ports facilitate exceptional freedom in the transportation of goods, while allowing freight, vessels, and people to travel with relative anonymity. Owing to their accessibility, ports can be vulnerable to a vast array of attacks. Potential avenues for smuggling WMD or other harmful materials into the United States include (a) large vessels carrying containerized cargo, (b) large vessels carrying non-containerized cargo, (c) small vessels facilitating recreational traffic, and (d) small vessels facilitating commercial traffic. Moreover, ports contain numerous types of critical infrastructure and key resource facilities that could be targeted by terrorists, including administration buildings, military bases and vessels, cruise ships, pedestrian ferries, terminals, factories, power plants, and sports complexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548512912439952">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the operational challenges that terrorist groups face, maritime terror attacks against the United States have occurred in the past. Past terrorist attack scenarios include the use of rowed boats, inflatable craft, dinghies, and floating debris, as well as more sophisticated approaches, such as high-speed boats, deceptive fishing vessels, and commercial vessels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548512912439952">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Small vessels may be the most accessible type of watercraft with the highest potential of being used by a terrorist to attack a port. Some believe that small vessels pose a greater threat for nuclear smuggling than transporting material in shipping containers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548512912439952">5</xref></sup> This is because the small vessel size and high maneuverability lend to a greater probability of a successful terrorist attack.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548512912439952">6</xref></sup> According to the October 2007 General Accounting Report on the <italic>Small Vessel Security Summit</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548512912439952">7</xref></sup> many believe that it would not be difficult for terrorists to obtain a small vessel to execute an attack against the United States.</p>
<p>Historical data and past maritime terrorist attack scenarios may not be particularly useful in predicting future attack scenarios. The challenge is dealing with the fact that the risk of terrorism is dynamic. Understanding the threat of terrorism and the vulnerability of our ports is fundamental to being able to adequately prepare for an attack.</p>
<p>AVERT uses a stochastic ABM approach to vulnerability and risk assessment in which the model parameters, such as vessel speeds and detector capabilities, are represented using statistical distributions. These distributions convolve both statistical or aleatoric uncertainty (e.g. actual instantaneous speed or detector sensitivity) and systematic or epistemic uncertainty (e.g. agents alert versus drowsy). The stochastic state resulting from the interactions of these uncertainties is Monte Carlo sampled for each simulation. The <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) value reported in this paper for each model configuration is the mean of simulations of multiple Monte Carlo samples. The simulation means are presented in this paper as functions of other parameters that are varied systematically, such as the number of patrol craft and the volume of small vessel traffic. While other Monte Carlo-based simulation studies have been performed in which parameters of incoming vessels and defensive agents are perturbed and encounters are attempted,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548512912439952">8</xref></sup> the degree of scenario customization lacks the depth we are able to model.</p>
<p>Deciding the most effective way to set up a defensive strategy to stop an incoming adversary from reaching his or her destination has also been studied extensively in the realm of network interdiction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548512912439952">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548512912439952"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548512912439952"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548512912439952"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548512912439952">13</xref></sup> Typically, the situation is modeled as either a two-person Stackelberg game,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548512912439952">14</xref></sup> in which the defender chooses a defensive posture and the adversary chooses a path through the network accordingly, or a game in which both sides make decisions simultaneously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548512912439952">15</xref></sup> While stochasticity of several attributes of both the adversary and defender have been employed in some network interdiction models,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548512912439952">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548512912439952"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548512912439952">18</xref></sup> the network comprising the area under consideration is consistently modeled with only a discrete set of locations for the adversary and defensive agents, thus not capturing the type of continuous space scenarios that are crucial to the problem studied here.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1548512912439952" sec-type="methods">
<title>2. Methods</title>
<p>The focus in this paper is on risk reduction through vulnerability reduction. Risk is generally considered to have three main components: (1) threat (i.e., the probability that a particular target will be attacked), (2) vulnerability (i.e., the probability that an attack will cause damage), and (3) consequences (i.e., the magnitude of the damage).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548512912439952">19</xref></sup> Risk is expressed loosely as <italic>Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Consequences</italic>.</p>
<p>The models are designed to assess vulnerability reduction by evaluating the <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) for various operational tempo alternatives. The <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) provides a quantitative basis for evaluating the effectiveness of defensive postures for various threat scenarios and enables the comparisons of alternatives that could lead to decreased risk. Operational tempos can be selected that provide a high <italic>P</italic>(Encounter), thereby reducing the risk of a successful maritime attack.</p>
<p>Models were developed with enough fidelity so that realistic results were attained. The <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) is based on the traffic flow rate, the adversary’s capabilities and approach strategy, and the defense operational tempo that may range from baseline to surge operations. Baseline operations occur when the perceived risk of attack is low and there is no actionable intelligence indicating an increased threat. Surge strategies are executed at heightened security levels indicating a need for increased vigilance.</p>
<p>Defensive resources include response boats, patrol boats, and helicopters operated during conditions that include day, night, reduced visibility, and various sea states. A primary consideration in developing an ABM is the size of the patrol area because it relates to traffic density. Another issue is whether sensor-enabled detection is a primary or secondary mission with regard to patrol operations. If sensor-enabled detection is a secondary mission, then detection equipment may not be active during a large portion of patrol time. During this time, illicit materials may only be detected when a vessel is searched. Reasons to search a vessel would include suspected transport of illegal paraphernalia, other suspected illicit activity, fisheries inspection, safety inspection, search and rescue, or simply a need to reach a particular quota of inspected vessels. However, if the sensor-enabled detection is a primary mission, then this equipment would be used during all or nearly all of the patrol time periods. The determination of whether sensor-enabled detection is a primary mission or a secondary mission may depend on decisions based on the maritime security (MARSEC) level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548512912439952">20</xref></sup> The implications of sensor-enabled detection as a secondary mission were not fully explored because of the difficulties inherent in quantitatively assessing the impact of the strategy on deterrence.</p>
<p>There are four necessary constructs for an effective sensor-enabled, detection and deterrence program: (1) encounter, (2) detect and identify, (3) engage, and (4) defeat. An encounter occurs when a sensor-enabled, detector equipped law enforcement vessel comes within close enough proximity of an illicit material for a sufficient amount of time so as to make detection possible. The probability of detection is the product <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) ×<italic>P</italic>(Detection | Encounter). The <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) corresponds to the first construct and was evaluated using ABM. The probabilities corresponding to the remaining constructs could also be evaluated but are beyond the scope of the research presented.</p>
<p>The simulations were conducted making use of parallel search areas as well as chokepoint patrols that can be used generically for any port area. Parallel search areas are typically used by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) in search and rescue missions. In a parallel search, search vessels patrol back-and-forth along the major axis of a rectangular area, with the tracks separated by approximately twice the distance needed to detect the target. A chokepoint is any narrow passage that restricts traffic flow. It literally connotes a location where flow could be choked off. In particular, it refers to vessel paths that restrict freedom of movement by slowing and confining. Maritime law enforcement will typically use chokepoints as a resource-efficient way to manage the near-total maneuverability of small vessels in open water.</p>
<p>Once an adversary is encountered in AVERT<sup>®</sup>, combat would typically initiate with the patrol’s intention of quickly neutralizing the adversary. In reality, when an encounter is made with pleasure traffic, the vessel of interest will be held a certain amount of time, scanned for illicit materials, and then released if the vessel is cleared and determined to be safe. To customize the software for the maritime applications, a scripting code was developed by ARES and SRNL that runs within AVERT<sup>®</sup>. The scripting code modifies patrol and combat behavior to allow for a security-related encounter with the release of non-threatening, compliant pleasure traffic after a vessel size specific hold time for Rad/Nuc enabled search and detection logistics. In addition, the adversary’s strategy in ABM was specified as the path of least resistance even though a more direct combative strategy could be set within the software.</p>
<p>An ‘encounter’ in the simulation is defined as a radiation-detection-enabled patrol vessel coming sufficiently close to a potential adversary vessel to detect Rad/Nuc material. The effective detection distance in the model is a few hundred feet to account for the underlying discrete event simulation. Encounters with pleasure traffic are not counted in the simulations but serve as distractions for the defensive forces. The encounter time could take from 5 to 75 minutes depending on the type of encounter. The <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) is the probability that there will at least be a rendezvous (an encounter of the shortest time duration) with a potential adversary. Once within range, the encounter time, in reality, could turn out to be a relatively short duration ‘rendezvous’ (5–15 minutes), a longer duration ‘rendezvous and nest’ (15–30 minutes), or the longest duration ‘rendezvous, nest, and board’ (30–75 minutes).</p>
<p>A rendezvous occurs when a law enforcement boat comes alongside an operating vessel of interest with the proximity depending on sea state and weather conditions. The officer may address the vessel operator and will observe the operator’s behavior and assess the vessel’s on-board equipment. During this stage, the small vessel of interest is viewed for its compliance with laws (e.g. fishing licenses, proper equipment). If the law enforcement boat is equipped with a Rad/Nuc detector, scanning for Rad/Nuc material may take place. Nesting occurs when a state or local law enforcement officer requires additional information from a vessel operator. Nesting occurs while the vessel of interest and law enforcement boat are at a dead stop in the water and tied to each other. Boarding occurs when a law enforcement officer goes over the gunnels and is physically present on the small vessel of interest.</p>
<p>Parallel search areas with rectangular grids up to 10 nautical miles (nm) by 20 nm were considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1548512912439952">Figure 1</xref>) in the ABM. A work shift is 6 hours for response or patrol boats and 4 hours for Sikorsky H-60 (H-60) helicopters. Time was allowed in the simulation for the defenses to exit the grid within their normal shift hours. The patrol speed and vision followed random distributions for various environmental and sea state conditions. Nighttime average hold times were 20% greater than those used for daytime operations because of reduced visibility. Vision distances and vessel speeds were also reduced during nighttime operations.</p>

</fig>
<p>The encounter type (rendezvous; rendezvous and nest; rendezvous, nest and board) was treated as a stochastic event. Adversary speed distributions were varied. Various numbers of recreational vessels were released into the 10 nm × 20 nm grid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1548512912439952">Figure 1</xref>), with each vessel’s release time following a uniform distribution over a 6-hour shift. Each incoming recreational vessel was assigned a destination at the extreme opposite side of the grid for directing traffic flow. The traffic flow was along the major and minor axes of the grid with traffic uniformly distributed along the edges. In the simulation, the incoming vessels follow the shortest path to their target. In addition, the recreational vessels would not attempt to evade an encounter with a maritime patrol vessel. Combat, an option within the simulation for the adversary and patrols, was not considered because estimating <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) was the main objective.</p>
<p>The patrol type (federal, state, or local) and operational tempo were considered in the simulations to produce realistic results. The patrol boats can be on water several days a week in normal operations. The <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) is only applicable to the time that the patrol is active. A zero probability of encounter was taken into account during the hours when the patrols are not active when estimating the detection probability over time.</p>
<p>The number of patrols was a parameter that was varied in the scenarios to determine its impact on <italic>P</italic>(Encounter). The patrols could be from federal, state, or local agencies enforcing port security. Parameters that were varied according to probability distributions include the vision, vessel size, boat vessel speed, pursuit speed, evasive speed, and encounter time. The patrol path, patrol area size, and number of recreational vessels (traffic rate) were also varied. Vision/radar was assumed to have a 360° view.</p>
<p>In the simulation, a patrol will deviate from its patrol path if a potential adversary is seen. After completing an encounter, the patrol will return to its patrol path if no other vessels are seen. Vessels were not detained more than once in a single simulation.</p>
<p>In the simulation, the helicopter was equipped with a stand-off, sensor-enabled, radiation detector. If the stand-off detector alarmed, then the patrol boats were directed by the helicopter to intercept the suspect vessel. A helicopter with sensor-enabled, radiation detection capability could be used to screen vessels 30–60 ft in length during surge operations. Law enforcement maritime patrol vessels could attempt to encounter vessels of interest only when the helicopter radiation detector alarmed. As a result, the helicopter sensor-enabled patrols were able to provide greater coverage for large patrol areas.</p>
<p>Helicopters are not able to hover near small vessels less than 30 ft in length, especially during rough sea states. Small vessels less than 40 ft are not typically on the water during rough sea conditions. Rough sea conditions include 6 ft waves, 10 ft swells, or winds at 20 knots.</p>

<title>3. Results</title>
<p>The simulations allowed the direct comparison of the effectiveness of different strategies that vary operational tempo, traffic patterns, and other parameters related to maritime patrols. An effective mitigation strategy is to exploit the natural geography of the maritime domain. Placing patrols at chokepoints minimizes the adversary pathways and makes efficient use of existing law enforcement patrol resources. We divide our analysis into two subsections based on the landscape of the patrolled area: chokepoint ABM and open-water ABM.</p>
<sec id="section4-1548512912439952">
<title>3.1. Chokepoint ABM</title>
<p>For chokepoint operations, the <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) was estimated throughout the simulation for increasing choke-point patrols. Chokepoint lengths ranged from 0.25 nm to 6 nm. As normal traffic flow increases, the <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) decreases because the adversary can assimilate into normal traffic. There was a significant increase in <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) when additional patrols were added.</p>
<p>The 0.25 nm fence line (an imaginary boundary line separating one area from another) could be deployed at narrow chokepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1548512912439952">Figure 2(a)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1548512912439952">(b)</xref>), while the 3 nm fence line could be deployed at an inlet to a maritime port. Encounter time was randomly distributed from 10 to 15 minutes that could allow for the rendezvous and then escorting the incoming vessel past a sensor-enabled, screening station. In addition, a 6 nm fence line was used to determine the number of patrols necessary when deploying this particular strategy in open water for directing traffic past a sensor-enabled, screening station.</p>

</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1548512912439952-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In the simulation, the normal traffic and adversary were placed in a holding area below the chokepoint and randomly released for traversing the chokepoint, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1548512912439952">Figure 2(a)</xref>. The adversary’s strategy was to follow an evasive path to avoid detection. The simulations revealed that this path was typically along the outer edge boundaries of each patrol area. A patrol that is constantly moving was preferred over a stationary, in-waiting patrol. When multiple patrols are allocated to the same chokepoint, one zone of coverage leads to a higher <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) than separate zones of coverage.</p>
<p>Allocating fence patrols at a chokepoint is most effective in conducting encounters. However, the chokepoint may be uncomfortably close to a population center or high-value targets. An option is evaluating <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) for a patrol region farther away from the chokepoint for directing traffic past a sensor-enabled, screening station before the port’s entrance.</p>
<p>There was a decreasing benefit of additional fence patrols at a chokepoint, especially with low traffic levels. Specifically, for low traffic flows, doubling the resources did not lead to doubling the <italic>P</italic>(Encounter). The marginal impact on the <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) became less as additional law enforcement boats were added. This same effect was not observed for high traffic levels. Therefore, additional patrols were included in the simulations to determine the point at which there was a diminishing return on the number of encounters per patrol.</p>

<title>3.2. Open-water ABM</title>
<p>Normal patrol operations were modeled on a 10 nm × 20 nm grid with a parallel path patrol area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1548512912439952">Figure 3</xref>). The grid contained a mix of various-sized small vessels with variable speed conditions. The patrol pattern outlined in the grid in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1548512912439952">Figure 3</xref>, emulating a sweep operation, was performed during daylight with calm sea conditions. The boundaries of the patrol area as well as all nodes within the patrol area are viewed along the patrol path. The patrol speed for the response boat was significantly greater than for the patrol boat. In addition, the pursuit speed for the response boat was substantially greater than that for patrol boats.</p>

The <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) for a response boat was greater than that for a patrol boat and even more so for low traffic flows. These results show that a H-60 helicopter on patrol substantially increases the <italic>P</italic>(Encounter). This was due to the helicopter’s far-reaching sight and its maximum speed (e.g. vision 10 nm, speed 120 knots during daylight and good weather conditions). The <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) is 0.70 for one helicopter at 40 vessels/shift compared with approximately 0.13 when only two patrol boats are in the water during calm sea conditions. In addition, the <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) for a helicopter on patrol during rough sea conditions, when no small vessels are in the water, is essentially the same as during calm sea conditions assuming that wind conditions for flight are within acceptable ranges. Furthermore, the <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) increases to 0.93 for two helicopters on patrol at 40 vessels/shift. Adding an additional response boat also increased the <italic>P</italic>(Encounter).</p>

<p>A random mix of various-sized small vessels (small, i.e., less than 40 ft, medium, i.e., 40–60 ft, and large, i.e., 60–100 ft) was active in the simulation. During reduced visibility conditions, the ability of resources to perform operations is greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Vessel size distribution on the water is dependent on the sea state. Under good weather conditions, large vessels accounted for 5% of the traffic. Vision and speed was assigned according to environmental conditions. The rendezvous occurred 30% of the time, rendezvous and nest occurred 56% of the time, and a full boarding occurred 14% of the time. Federal patrol or response boats do not nest; rather, they can ‘rendezvous only’ 70% of the time or ‘rendezvous and then board’ 30% of the time. The distribution of encounter times (rendezvous, nest, board) was built into the simulation according to the size of the vessel encountered and the type of encounter.</p>

<title>4. Conclusions and recommendations</title>
<p>Every United States port has unique geographic attributes and preferred vessel entry and exit routes. The results for patrol areas of various dimensions developed in this study and through further research could provide the building blocks to evaluate the encounter effectiveness of sensor-enabled, detection patrols within any maritime security area of interest.</p>
<p>The simulation provided a quantitative basis for recommending various patrol patterns and defensive postures that could lead to decreased risk and enhanced deterrence strategies. An understanding of patrol effectiveness was gained through the modeling. In addition, the simulation results provide an indication of the tactical resources needed to achieve enhanced <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) at chokepoints during surge operations. ABM allowed fidelity to be built into the models by implementing specific strategies and capabilities for the adversary as well as for the defensive forces. The simulation results include the prioritized identification of vulnerable approach pathways into the port areas.</p>
<p>Normal baseline and surge operations were considered to estimate the <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) for an adversary possessing measurable illicit materials or devices. Patrol encounter, detection, and defeat effectiveness for various platforms and traffic flow rates was evaluated under a range of environmental conditions, such as day, night, rough seas, and reduced visibility. The results provide a basis for the tactical resource allocation that could lead to an increase in the <italic>P</italic>(Encounter) for the targeted port areas. The results also can be used to compare and recommend detector sensitivity and effectiveness required for baseline and surge operations in the maritime environment.</p>
<p>ABM has two significant advantages for this type of study. First, it is possible to represent parameters and behaviors that are not easily expressed in closed mathematical form, as may be required for numerical methods. Second, it is possible to examine the behaviors of and outcomes for specific individuals. This is especially important for models with small numbers of agents, such as the patrol craft in this study.</p>
<p>Operations research (OR) tends to rely on numerical methods, although it may incorporate non-numerical methods, such as genetic algorithms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548512912439952">21</xref></sup> In contrast with OR, it is noted that ABM represents actual or plausible individual behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548512912439952">22</xref></sup> OR in maritime search focuses on minimizing the time to locate the search target.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548512912439952">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548512912439952"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548512912439952">25</xref></sup> However, the ‘No Free Lunch’ theorem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548512912439952">26</xref></sup> in OR posits that, over the space of all possible searches, all search algorithms are equivalent. Similarly, Champagne et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548512912439952">27</xref></sup> present an ABM model that incorporates evasive behavior by the target of the search. They find that differences in effectiveness between search patterns are not significant.</p>
<p>The simulation results provide a quantitative basis for evaluating various defensive postures and enable the comparisons of alternatives that can lead to decreased risk. Further simulations could be done to provide an understanding of enhanced mitigation strategies during surge operations.</p>
<p>The results for grids of various sizes can be applied to any maritime security area of interest. In addition, multiple grids can be combined to estimate spatial vulnerabilities over large areas or maritime security zones. In doing so, the vulnerabilities and resources required for baseline normal and surge operations can be evaluated for any United States port. ABM could also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of intercepting in open water by directing or escorting traffic past a sensor-enabled detection station before entering a port.</p>
<p>It is recommended that a library be constructed containing modeling results for grids of various sizes for multiple maritime security areas of interest as well as various adversary scenarios so that any port area in the United States can be modeled. The purpose of the maritime security area modeling would be to determine vulnerable maritime pathways and optimal defensive strategies and resource allocation for enhanced situational awareness in our port areas and especially near critical infrastructure and key resource facilities.</p>
<p>Terrorists can strike at any given place at a port at any given time. As evidenced earlier, the chance of maritime and port terrorism is both prevalent and complex. While it is important to keep the challenges inherent in preventing a port terrorist attack in mind, it is also vital to understand that if proper security measures are in place, maritime pathway vulnerabilities can be recognized, and risks of terrorism can be reduced.</p>
