<abstract>
<p>Existing research suggests that men and women have similar reasons for attending North American seminaries and are influenced strongly by faculty while in school. To increase understanding of the experiences of women and men in seminary, this study used interactive qualitative analysis to discover and compare the main themes of seminary experience for men and women at one Protestant seminary. Study results show men and women differed in their perception of how seminary influenced their sense of calling. One third of women interviewed reported experiences of resistance to their pursuit of ministry as a vocation. Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms that continue to reproduce sexism. The author argues that seminaries need to increase the proportion of women faculty members to promote the flourishing of all students.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Theological schools create distinctive microcultures for students, despite their use of similar teaching methods and adherence to common standards. Residential theological schools frequently stress the value of a specific kind of community (precisely the <italic>sui generis</italic> community that a given school uniquely produces) in order to train students to become the sort of church leaders that the school aims for. Ethnographies of student experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0966735011425304">Kleinman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0966735011425304">Carroll et al., 1997</xref>) and other qualitative studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425304">Foster et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0966735011425304">Lincoln, 2009</xref>) demonstrate that formal and informal aspects of the curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0966735011425304">Eisner, 2002</xref>) work together to shape student experience. Without erasing the life experiences that students bring with them to school, all aspects of student experience contribute to the transformation of seminary students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0966735011425304">Lincoln, 2010</xref>). In North American seminaries, both women and men pursue theological education. In the fall of 2009, women comprised 30 percent of students studying for the Master of Divinity degree in the United States and 37 percent of students in Canada (Association of Theological Schools 2009-2010 data table 2.14-B).</p>
<p>This study explores student experience in seminary by focusing on differences and similarities in the experiences of women and men at one Protestant seminary. The study reported here will benefit those directly involved in theological education and the churches. To anticipate study findings: there were both similarities and differences between men and women at the research site. Thus, a study employing the lens of gender is helpful. Seminary professors and pastors to students will benefit from a better understanding of the range of experiences of the men and women whom they teach and counsel. Denominational committees that oversee candidates during their ordination processes will benefit. Finally, church bodies at large will benefit from increased understanding of the seminary experiences that shaped students into pastors and other church leaders. Consideration of student experience in seminary is especially timely given the current stresses shaping mainline Protestant church bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0966735011425304">Bottum, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0966735011425304">Wind, 2008</xref>) and virtually all North American theological schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0966735011425304">Anon., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0966735011425304">Hansen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0966735011425304">Vissers, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Excursus: Gender, Sexism, and Researcher Positionality</title>
<p>Before describing the problem addressed by this research, a few words are in order to address the idea of gender, sexism, and the researcher’s commitments with reference to this study. First, some gender theorists have argued that the traditional categories of men and women are theoretically vapid and do not help us explain how people behave or are perceived in society. Simple notions about men and women are banal because each of us is an extremely complex, motile self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0966735011425304">Butler, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0966735011425304">Butler, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0966735011425304">Sedgwick, 2008</xref>). An individual may be a <italic>man</italic> or a <italic>woman</italic> but such labels say almost nothing important. Thus Anzaldúa commented that, ‘This morning when I got up I looked in the mirror to see who I was (my identity keeps changing)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0966735011425304">Anzaldúa, 1990</xref>: 216). The premise of this article, siding with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0966735011425304">Bourdieu (2001)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0966735011425304">Kruks (2001</xref>), and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0966735011425304">Sölle, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0966735011425304">Schüssler Fiorenza, 1996</xref>) is that the categories of men and women have theoretical and practical relevance in understanding the experiences of persons in twenty-first century North American cultures. For discussion of ideas of gender in feminist theory, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0966735011425304">Beasley (1999)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0966735011425304">Kroløkke and Sørensen (2006)</xref>. It is beyond the scope of this paper to do more than note the experience of people who are transsexual or transgendered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0966735011425304">Looy and Bouma, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0966735011425304">Shotwell and Sangrey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0966735011425304">Stryker and Whittle, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, this paper uses the term <italic>sexism</italic> to describe the disadvantaging of women over against men in terms of opportunities for education, vocation, or career. Some Christian traditions consider the differences between women and men to be part of God’s good intention for creation and the church and therefore do not ordain women to positions of leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0966735011425304">Jones, Thorpe, and Wootton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0966735011425304">Ratzinger, 1998</xref>). These Christians might well object to using sexism to describe differing options and treatment for women seeking ordination and church work. However, sexism is widely used both inside and outside of Christian circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0966735011425304">Douglas, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0966735011425304">McDougal, 2007</xref>) and seems an appropriate label to describe the experiences voiced by some study participants.</p>
<p>Finally, this study involved one situated self (the researcher) attempting to understand the life worlds of seminary students. The method used, interactive qualitative analysis, is rooted in phenomenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0966735011425304">Northcutt and McCoy, 2004</xref>: 4) and takes pains to bracket the researcher’s predilections during data collection. At the same time, the interpretation of data is shaped by the researcher’s background and values. This article shares feminist commitments in the sense that the researcher values ‘women’s flourishing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0966735011425304">Johnson, 1998</xref>: 35) as equals to men in the church. More specifically, the researcher is a modernist sort of Lutheran who respectfully disagrees with Martin Luther’s conclusion that ‘the Holy Spirit has excepted women, children, and incompetent people’ from serving in the church’s ministerial offices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0966735011425304">Luther, 1966</xref> [1539]: 154).</p>

<sec id="section3-0966735011425304">
<title>Problem Statement and Research Questions</title>
<p>Those who enroll in theological schools do so for a range of reasons, according to data collected by The Association of Theological schools (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0966735011425304">Table 1</xref>). For both men and women, important reasons typically include experiencing a call from God, the opportunity for study/growth, the desire to serve others, intellectual interest, the desire to make a difference, and the desire to discern God’s will. Students rate such sources of influence as experience in church life, the desire to contribute to the cause of social justice, and the search for meaning as only somewhat important. When students reported their top five reasons for choosing a particular seminary in the <italic>Entering Student Questionnaire</italic>, the two most common reasons given by women and men were academic reputation and theological perspective. The third most common reason given by men was faculty; for women it was spiritual atmosphere. Both men and women reported denominational affiliation as the fourth most frequent reason. According to these data, then, there are many similarities and a few differences between men and women in terms of factors leading to the decision to go to seminary and to attend one school in particular.</p>

<p>Women and men who graduate with the Master of Divinity degree identify many of the same influences on their educational experience as being ‘most important,’ but, once again, there are some differences. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0966735011425304">Table 2</xref> shows that both women and men chose faculty most frequently as an important influence. But for women, the second and third most frequently chosen influences were field education/internship and interaction with fellow students.

<p>Responses to widely-used questionnaires, then, suggest similarities and differences in the educational experiences of women and men, but do not shed much light on the texture of student experience. For instance, faculty might be influential in a variety of ways, which might be the same for women and men; but perhaps not. This study probes student experience using qualitative methods. Specifically, the data reported here address three research questions: What themes do women and men use to describe their experience as students? How do women and men arrange these themes into a system of thought or mind-map? How do the mind-maps of men and women compare?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0966735011425304">
<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>What does the published literature report about the experiences of students in seminaries? Few published studies attend to student experience in detail, although many papers acknowledge the complexity of life for twenty-first century seminarians (notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0966735011425304">Ricciuti, 2003</xref>). Because the focus of this article is a comparison of the experience of men and women in seminary, this summary especially attends to gender. This section has three parts. First, it briefly reviews ethnographic literature focusing on students in theological schools. Second, it summarizes the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425304">Foster et al., (2006)</xref> about teaching practices in seminaries. Finally, it summarizes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0966735011425304">Finlay’s (2003)</xref> study that explicitly attended to issues of gender and career choice at one Protestant seminary.</p>
<sec id="section5-0966735011425304">
<title>Ethnographies</title>
<p>Two published studies examined the experience of students in seminaries in the United States. Using ethnographic methods rooted in grounded theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0966735011425304">Glaser and Strauss, 1967</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0966735011425304">Kleinman (1984)</xref> found that theological students at Midwest Seminary were socialized to conform to an ideal type of minister, a nonjudgmental humanistic professional. At the time of Kleinman’s research, Midwest Seminary specifically articulated concern for the ‘role of women in Christian ministry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0966735011425304">Kleinman, 1984</xref>: 20). There was an active woman’s caucus at the school. Kleinman discovered that women faced some sexist treatment within the school (especially about the appropriateness of women answering a call to ordained ministry), despite the fact that the dominant discourse of Midwest Seminary endorsed a feminized vision for Christian ministry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0966735011425304">Kleinman, 1984</xref>: 86). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0966735011425304">Carroll et al., (1997)</xref> studied the cultures of two seminaries with different theological emphases, Evangelical Theological Seminary (ETS) and Mainline Theological Seminary (MTS), over a three-year period. At ETS, the researchers witnessed ongoing passionate discussion between students who favored the ordination of women and those who opposed it. At MTS, women students were active in groups promoting social justice and other aspects of diversity, one of the school’s key cultural values. Students also openly debated the extent to which feminist theology should critique Christian tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0966735011425304">Carroll et al., 1997</xref>: 154-55). Researchers concluded that many MTS students were gradually shaped by the school’s dominant message of justice to confess sexism, racism, and class privilege as sins. ETS students were shaped by the dominant message that the Bible details God’s reasonable, coherent intentions for human life.</p>

<sec id="section6-0966735011425304">
<title>Educating for Pastoral Imagination</title>
<p>The recent multi-site study of theological education funded by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425304">Foster et al., 2006</xref>) explored the relationship between teaching practices in theological schools and the creation of pastoral imagination (Dykstra, 2008) in future religious leaders. Rooted in appreciative inquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0966735011425304">Cooperrider and Whitney, 1999</xref>), the researchers first surveyed a sample of divinity schools and seminaries, then conducted three-day site visits on eight campuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425304">Foster et al., 2006</xref>: 386-87). Visits included group interviews of students and faculty, classroom observation, and individual interviews with key personnel. These researchers noted that the schools they visited contained many different kinds of students with profoundly different academic and spiritual backgrounds. Yet, ‘despite shared rhetoric about institutional inclusivity, no school we visited pedagogically embraced the full range of differences faculty encountered among its students’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425304">Foster et al., 2006</xref>: 58). Instead, faculty honored some aspects of difference (while ignoring others) based on the values, training, and piety of the professors. Foster et al., found ‘the influence of the presence of women in the schools we visited in the attention given by faculty … to such themes in feminist pedagogy as building learning communities, honoring different styles of learning in assignment, and engaging students in narrative modes of learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425304">Foster et al., 2006</xref>: 255-56). This study concluded that in schools with many commuter students, a high student-to-faculty ratio, and large schools, faculty members assume that responsibility for learning lies with the individual student.</p>

<sec id="section7-0966735011425304">
<title>Facing the Stained Glass Ceiling</title>
<p>Finally, to gain insight about ‘why men and women have different career paths in ministry,’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0966735011425304">Finlay (2003</xref>: 11) conducted a mixed methods study during her four years (1993-1996) as a student at Kairos Theological Seminary (KTS), a mainline Protestant school. Using surveys and observation, she pursued several research questions, including the levels of support received by women and men from their families and home churches and whether ‘men and women have different experiences of acceptance or resistance’ with church officials while they attend seminary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0966735011425304">Finlay, 2003</xref>: 12). She found that men received more financial support from their home congregations than women. She discovered that women had higher expectations than men for religious/spiritual goals while in school and that ‘women practiced a greater variety of spiritual disciplines than men, and practiced them more frequently than men’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0966735011425304">Finlay, 2003</xref>: 88). Finlay also reported that half of the women in her study had experienced ‘insults, hostility, or coolness towards their participation in worship leadership or towards their plans to attend seminary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0966735011425304">Finlay, 2003</xref>: 102).</p>

<sec id="section8-0966735011425304">
<title>Summary of Literature on Student Experience</title>
<p>Studies touching on student experience in seminary used a variety of research methods. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0966735011425304">Kleinman (1984)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0966735011425304">Carroll et al., (1997)</xref> were especially interested in surfacing student experience. At all three schools, researchers discovered that students wrestled with the theological and practical meaning of being called to ordained ministry. Women faced challenges not encountered by men when discerning their call, in large measure because of the widespread presumption that ministry was a calling for men but not women. Finlay reported that women at her research site had also frequently encountered gender-related resistance to their vocational choice. Women at KTS had higher levels of interest in spiritual goals for their education, and had higher rates of participation in spiritual practices at school than men. The study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425304">Foster et al., (2006)</xref> focused on the pedagogy of theological schools. Variety ruled. However, they reported only modestly on student experience and described virtually nothing about the experiences of women. By contrast, the study reported here intentionally focuses on student experiences and aggregates data by gender.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>To explore the experience of seminarians through the lens of gender, the researcher recoded data collected for a study of the life worlds of seminarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0966735011425304">Lincoln, 2009</xref>). The 2009 study compared experiences of first- and second-career students. During data recoding, the researcher analyzed interview transcripts of nine women and eight men who were M.Div. students at pseudonymous New Creation Theological Seminary (NCTS), a free-standing Presbyterian seminary in the United States of America. Of the nine women interviewed for this study, six were members of the Presbyterian Church (USA), one was a member of the United Methodist Church, one was a member of the Missionary Baptist Church, and one was a member of the Presbyterian Church in Korea. Seven women were Americans citizens who identified themselves as white, one as multi-ethnic. One woman participant was a citizen of South Korea. Of the eight men interviewed, three were members of the Presbyterian Church (USA), two were members of the United Methodist Church, one was a member of the Assemblies of God, and one had no denominational affiliation. All eight men were US citizens. Seven were white and one was Korean American. The denominational affiliation and racial-ethnic identities of students roughly paralleled that of the NCTS student body.</p>
<p>This study used a form of qualitative research, interactive qualitative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0966735011425304">Northcutt and McCoy, 2004</xref>). IQA combines elements of traditional qualitative research (notably, interviews), with a concern to find underlying patterns in group experience. The researcher discovered 12 themes of student experience through two focus groups, then devised an interview protocol of open-ended questions about these themes. During interviews, participants spoke about their experience of each theme with minimal researcher intervention. In addition, the researcher asked participants about the relationships between themes. The researcher used these associations, called <italic>theoretical codes</italic>, to produce a mind-map depicting the typical flow of relationships for the two groups of interest, men and women. In IQA parlance, each of these groups is a <italic>constituency</italic>. IQA researchers use rule-driven procedures to aggregate theoretical codes and create group mind-maps for constituencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0966735011425304">Northcutt and McCoy, 2004</xref>: 237-96). The mind-map depicts themes as a closed system of relationships. The themes or elements that influence many other themes in the system are called <italic>drivers</italic>. The themes which receive far more influence than they exert are called <italic>outcomes</italic>. In the IQA approach, outcomes are not less important to study participants than drivers. Rather, participants report that outcomes exert relatively less influence on other themes than do drivers. Finally, the researcher analyzed the timbre of each participant’s interview transcript. In IQA terms, timbre is a way of characterizing discourse. Judgments about timbre parallel a wine connoisseur’s observations about a sample of wine (dry versus sweet, flavor notes, etc.). ‘Elements that have the same meaning may have a different . . . “feel” between constituencies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0966735011425304">Northcutt and McCoy, 2004</xref>: 345). Based on interview transcripts, the researcher judged the timbre for each participant (by theme) as positive, neutral, negative, or volatile and aggregated the results by constituency.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>This section has three parts corresponding to the three research questions of the study. First, the section presents the main themes of student experience and discusses the timbre of student discourse (research question 1). Second, the section presents and interprets mind-maps for each constituency (research question 2). Finally, the two mind-maps are compared (research question 3).</p>
<sec id="section11-0966735011425304">
<title>Themes of Student Experience</title>
<p>Both women and men described their seminary experience under 12 themes. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0966735011425304">Table 3</xref> gives the name and definition for each theme. The researcher transcribed all student interviews and examined the texts for sub-themes. To qualify as a sub-theme, an idea needed to be discussed by at least three different study participants. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0966735011425304">Table 4</xref> shows the 62 sub-themes that met this criterion. For instance, under the theme Facilities students spoke about the seminary’s setting, classrooms, the library, and student housing. Further analysis of transcripts revealed that for 26 of the 62 sub-themes, members of one constituency spoke about the sub-theme twice as frequently or more. For instance, under the theme ‘Life Management’, men spoke more often about the value of self-care; under the same theme, women spoke more frequently about seminary devouring time. Each sub-theme for which one or the other constituency spoke twice as frequently, or more, is noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0966735011425304">Table 4</xref> (W refers to women; M refers to men).</p>

<p>This report provides examples of student discourse for three themes, ‘School Bureaucracy,’ ‘Community,’ and ‘Emotions.’ These themes and sub-themes were chosen to document participant ideas from a driver, an outcome, a theme in the middle of each mind-map, and to show examples in which men and women shared common perceptions as well as cases where their perceptions differed. In addition, text regarding barriers to women pursuing a call to ministry (sexism) under the theme ‘Church Requirements’ is reported. Following IQA practice, student discourse is reported as synthetic quotations that combine the words of more than one participant. The reason for reporting participant discourse this way is that the researcher is interested in showing the range of experience discovered, rather than focusing on a typical individual.</p>
<p>The theme ‘School Bureaucracy’ (a driver) had six subthemes. Both men and women agreed that the administration at NCTS was efficient. Men said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s been clockwork, like lights and sound in a theater. You only notice if something’s going bad. Going to the registry of motor vehicles is tortuous; processes at NCTS are delightful. I’ve been able to find out things I’ve needed in a very timely manner. Paying fees is just a matter of going to business office and doing it. The seminary is extremely well run.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, women said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There’s less bureaucracy here than any other place I’ve been. I’m an older student. I’ve experienced a lot of bureaucracy in my life. It’s been really smooth here. The application process was really smooth. The staff is supportive if you need something. Mostly, it’s invisible. The bureaucracy is not a big deal.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Women, more frequently then men, mentioned problems in communication. They said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Before I started school, I found it difficult to get information about how to register for classes. It took three or four tries. It seemed to be a big mystery. Housing is the most frustrating part of seminary. We held community meetings in our apartment with staff to express concerns. Sometimes they’re acted on; sometimes we’re ignored. Being on student senate I see more of administration than others. I think there could be more transparency to explain policies and procedures to the students, such as last year when the issue of same sex housing came up. The student group pushing the idea didn’t understand that the seminary board only met a couple of times a year, so there couldn’t be a decision until they had considered and voted on it. In general, I wish the board and administrators were more interactive with us.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The theme ‘Community’ had eight subthemes, including ‘community as a core value’ and ‘engagement in community life.’ Regarding community as a core value, women said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When I visited here, I kept hearing the word “community,” I wanted to roll my eyes and say, “Enough of the community thing.” But I’ve found it to be true. I’ve observed faculty and staff advocating community. Community is a core value here.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Men said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I know that we preach “community, community, community.” A lot of students reach out to involve everybody. We’re part of something that’s alive, an extended family. One of the things it says on the banners around the campus is “Be an Exemplary Community.” But at times there’s been questionable behavior. It makes me upset.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both men and women talked about limits to their engagement in relationships with other students. Women said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We have an awesome community because people are so willing to show up and take pride in being a NCTS student. How involved you are here depends on how much effort you put into it. I’ve seen students who don’t get involved quickly in their junior year. They fall away and you don’t see them. When people take initiative and get into a small group, they do a lot better here.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In contrast, one woman said: ‘For me, community has been in class and being in the dining hall for lunch. A lot of the other student activities are on Thursday nights or the weekend. I’m not here for those because of my commuting schedule.’</p>
<p>Men spoke more frequently than women about engaging in community. They said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Community is an important part of the seminary life. A lot of students reach out and involve everybody, or get a group going that interests some people. You can be a part of NCTS very quickly. The school is intentional about getting to know you. You feel welcomed. It’s safe to be part of as much as you are able or desire to. For a student who does not live on campus, there is as much opportunity to be part of the community as you choose to.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some men spoke of why they had few relationships with other students:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I’ve had very little to do with students here at seminary. The bulk of my time, energy, and relationships goes to Young Life and Faith Church. I try hard to make family first. Studies and classes come second. People ask you to go out after class and I can’t do that. I don’t go to student forums anymore because I need to get home and help my wife with the twins. I have friends here and I value those relationships, but if a student has responsibilities off campus, how can you form community here? My community is in East Hamlet, the engineering firm I work for, and my family.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Study participants spoke about the theme ‘Emotions’, which had three sub-themes. Both men and women talked about positive emotions. Women said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is intellectually stimulating to learn new things. It’s been a rewarding experience to come here and carve out some time solely for study. That goes away when you get in the real world. Looking back, there have definitely been ups and downs. I’d say more ups than downs. Even the downs are good downs, knowing that hard work is being done. I don’t know if meaningful is an emotion, but a lot of the experiences I’ve had were meaningful. It’s been good.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Men said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My greatest emotion is blessing. There have been times of great excitement and joy. I love getting together with friends. It’s fun hanging out with people, playing football and having a good time. Most often, my emotions are happy, joyful. I have complete peace in regard to grades and assignments. I have learned that if you truly seek Jesus Christ and the kingdom first, everything else is taken care of. I’ve never been in a minority position before. That caused me anxiety, but I was given acceptance here.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Men and woman also talked about frustration and stress. Men said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Making the transition from a Pentecostal to a Presbyterian school was hard. I was frustrated a lot because of the differences in beliefs and coming from the east coast. I was frustrated because I got a C on an exam. I explained to the professor that was because of a timeline. I had gotten the first one and the last one mixed up, so it threw off the whole list. The professor said, “Good point, but I’m still not changing the grade.” You hear all the time that this school is so grace-filled. I hadn’t experienced too much grace. Making sure that my wife is happy, and doing things for her while still trying to maintain the grades that can be hectic and overwhelming.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One man dropped out and eventually returned to NCTS:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I didn’t think I was capable of handling the academic work. That was chewing on me pretty good. At the start of my second year, I had four or five things due on the same day. About that time our youngest son, who was in the service, got sent to Afghanistan and went through a divorce while he was there. I couldn’t stand it. I had to drop my classes and leave. I had no intention of ever coming back. Everything worked out very well for my son. He got through combat without a scratch. I was asked to preach when I got home. When I came out of the pulpit one Sunday, I knew that I was going to come back to school. I’ve been a lot more solid since I’ve been back. I’ve done fine.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Women also spoke about frustration. They said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>People cry. I tell the juniors, “Everyone cries. It’s okay.” The first thing was being overwhelmed. I was 2,000 miles away from home. I didn’t even know how to get to a grocery store. Then I started classes and was overwhelmed by that. There was a lot of frustration and anger. Is tired an emotion? The first year, I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow. I was physically, emotionally, intellectually drained. There’s always frustration, because you’re dealing with a bureaucracy on the school side. There’s stress because your academic work is due all at once. During finals, I don’t come on campus much because people are all stressed out. At times, I’ve been frustrated with all the church requirements added on to all of the school requirements.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Three women interviewed described experiences of sexism related to their pursuit of leadership positions in churches. One woman, a Korean student, noted: ‘I had a hard time as a woman in the church in my home country. We can be ordained as a pastor, but there still are huge obstacles. Most of the time they don’t give us a chance.’ Two other women, US citizens, said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The moderator for this Baptist district does not believe that women should be pastors, only ministers and evangelists. He thinks that a woman pastoring a congregation goes against what Bible says about the family. I haven’t even gotten into that argument. I’ve prayed about it, and received from God that it’s not about gender. The message of the gospel doesn’t change, no matter who delivers it. I am dismayed about how women in ministry are treated. I’m Methodist and we’re placed. I was told not to be concerned that I have family members with chronic illness. The bishop would take that into account in placing me. Then the local district committee told me that I will be transferred wherever the bishop wants and that family doesn’t matter. A man who went to the same committee was told not to worry. His wife is a doctor. They’d place him so that her job wouldn’t be uprooted. He’s not the only male that I’ve heard about who’s had that offer. I’m struggling with that. It seems like sexism but nothing I can prove. There’s a good old boys network. The policies that the church has to ensure women are in ministry have pushed that network underground, so it’s harder to fight. When it’s above ground and you know what you are fighting. But now it’s done behind closed doors.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Both of the married women who spoke about sexism reported that their spouses were highly supportive of their call to ministry and decisions to attend seminary. Another woman reported that she and her husband, who lived a few miles from the campus, sold their house and moved into student housing with their children so that they could become more fully immersed in the life of the seminary.</p>
<p>To summarize the texts presented above, student discourse for both constituencies frequently contained similar observations about the administrative procedures of the school, relationships with students, and the feeling that students had while in school. The researcher found this pattern repeated throughout all 12 themes. However, approximately 40 percent of the time, members of one constituency or the other had more to say about a specific sub-theme.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0966735011425304">
<title>Timbre</title>
<p>The researcher also analyzed each transcript for timbre. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0966735011425304">Table 5</xref> displays the dominant timbre for the themes. In five of the 12 themes, the dominant timbre varied between women and men. In the case of ‘Church Requirements,’ for instance, women spoke more negatively about their denominational ordination process than did men. They characterized these processes as needlessly cumbersome and redundant. On the other hand, women were more positive than men in their comments about the theme ‘Academic Program.’ Some men faulted the curriculum for being too academic and not practical enough. In several cases, there was no discernable dominant timbre. For instance, participant discourse about ‘Life Management’ and ‘Emotions’ was widely varying in tone for both women and men. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0966735011425304">Table 5</xref> documents that the dominant timbre was positive for men for half of the themes; the dominant timbre was positive for women in seven of the 12 themes. The only instance of the dominant timbre being negative was Church Requirements (for women). Based on timbre analysis, attending NCTS was generally a positive experience for members of both constituencies, although student feelings about school ran the gambit from joy to frustration.</p>

<title>Group Mind-maps</title>
<p>Following IQA procedures, the researcher used theoretical codes to create mind-maps for each constituency. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0966735011425304">Figure 1</xref> displays the mind-maps for women; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0966735011425304">Figure 2</xref> for men. IQA procedures create a topologically simple mind-map. The direction of the pattern of influence is indicated by arrows linking themes. For both women and men, a driver is ‘School Bureaucracy.’ To aid interpretation, the drivers are shown in bold font. Drivers exert influence on many other themes in the system. In each system, the outcomes include ‘Emotions’ and ‘Transformation.’ Outcomes are shown in bold italic font. Both mind-maps show an abundance of recursion, or flows of influence ‘backwards’ in the system from relative outcomes to drivers. For instance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0966735011425304">Figure 1</xref>, there is a complex set of links from the themes of spirituality and emotions. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0966735011425304">Figure 2</xref>, the outcomes for men end in a three-element loop comprised of ‘Transformation,’ ‘Ministry,’ and ‘Emotions.’ There is also recursion from ‘Spirituality’ to ‘Church Requirements.’ The mind-maps incorporate the results of the timbre analysis. If a theme has a dominant timbre for a given constituency, it is shown in parenthesis.</p>

<title>Mind-maps Compared</title>
<p>The general shape of the two mind-maps is similar. In each case, the theme ‘School Bureaucracy’ is a driver. In both systems, ‘Transformation’ is an outcome. In IQA terms, this means that ‘Transformation’ is more a result of the effects of other themes in the system than it is a source of influence on other themes. This is consistent with student discourse about the changes that they experienced during seminary. Students reported that they gained new knowledge and professional skills in seminary as a result of engaging in the school’s academic program and ministry experiences. In both mind-maps, the theme ‘Spirituality’ forms a kind of hub with lines of influence backwards and forwards to other system elements.</p>
<p>This suggests that, for participants, spirituality mediated the way that they conceptualized many themes of student experience, even though the theme ‘Spirituality’ was not a driver. As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0966735011425304">Table 5</xref>, the dominant timbre for ‘Spirituality’ also differed between the two constituencies. It was positive for men, but there was no dominant timbre for women. Women spoke often about the difficulty of creating time to practice spiritual disciplines. The timbre differences in almost half of the themes thus point to subtle but real differences in the experiences of men and women in this study.</p>
<p>The two mind-maps show one striking difference between women and men. For men, the theme ‘Call to Ministry’ was a driver. For women, this theme is located closer to the outcome side of the system. The dominant timbre for this theme was positive for both constituencies. The differing location in each mind-map suggests that, comparatively speaking, women perceive that their understanding of vocation was impacted by other aspects of their theological education more strongly than do men. This systemic difference is consistent with analysis of interviews. As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0966735011425304">Table 4</xref>, women spoke more frequently than men about how their sense of call changed during seminary (the sub-theme ‘change in understanding’). Similarly, when discussing the theme ‘Transformation,’ women also spoke more frequently than did men about how their sense of call changed during school (the sub-theme ‘call’).</p>

<title>Summary of Findings</title>
<p>This subsection summarizes study findings. Students at NCTS spoke about their experiences in school under the same 12 themes. In general, participants were positive about their experience. The mind-maps for each constituency showed the same general flow of influence between themes, although men reported that ‘Call to Ministry’ exerted more influence on other themes than did women. For both women and men, outcomes were ‘Transformation’ and ‘Emotions.’ Analysis of student discourse also showed that members of one constituency spoke about specific sub-themes more frequently in 26 out of 62 cases. Only women spoke about resistance to their pursuit of ministry as a calling.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This section compares the experience of NCTS students with previous research and reflects on the continued existence of barriers to women’s participation in ministry.</p>
<sec id="section17-0966735011425304">
<title>Finding Clarity, Community, and God</title>
<p>The findings of this study are consistent with earlier studies of seminary students regarding how theological education increases clarity in one’s sense of vocation, the importance of community in forming students, and differing expectations that women and men bring with them to seminary regarding spirituality. They also resonate with the challenges faced by women who engage in higher education. First, previous research found that students enter seminary because they experience a call from God (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0966735011425304">Table 1</xref>). All participants in this study affirmed that they had a sense of call prior to enrolling in seminary. They also reported that one of the effects of attending NCTS was a changed sense of call. Women reported a change in their understanding of call more frequently then men did. Women at NCTS reported, more frequently than men, that ministry experiences led to new discoveries about the work of pastors and that such experiences provided hands on learning. As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0966735011425304">Table 2</xref>, MDiv graduates consistently report that field education and experiences in ministry are important influences on their educational experience. The results of this study suggest why graduates find these experiences helpful: ministry experiences with the right supervisor expose students directly to ministerial activities such as visiting the sick. Students make discoveries and refine their understanding of what it means to be called. Pastoral work for mainline clergy involves ‘core tasks’ of preaching, worship, administration, and pastoral care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0966735011425304">Carroll and McMillan, 2006</xref>: 106). Students value aspects of MDiv education that anticipate the specific tasks that pastors do.</p>
<p>Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0966735011425304">Kleinman’s (1984)</xref> ethnography highlighted how students at Midwest Seminary were socialized to value ‘community’ as a key value. In this study, women and men also spoke about the importance of community – defined as relationships that NCTS students have with other NCTS students – for their seminary experience. While Community was not a driver in the mind-map of either constituency, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0966735011425304">Table 6</xref> shows that NCTS graduates for the past five years rated interaction with fellow students as in important influence during their seminary training. In contrast to the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0966735011425304">Table 2</xref>, men at NCTS chose interaction with students at a higher rate than male MDiv graduates from all ATS schools (14.82 percent versus 9.51 percent). While study participants, both men and women, agreed that community was a core value of the school, NCTS graduates have only modestly pointed to the ‘community life of school’ as an important influence on their educational experience (3.12 percent for men; 4.46 percent for women). This finding is consistent with ATS data as reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0966735011425304">Table 2</xref> (2.28 percent for men; 2.89 percent for women). In both cases, it appears that students are making a distinction between interaction between fellow students and ‘community life.’ The nature of this distinction, however, is opaque. The sub-themes discovered in this study for the theme ‘Community’ suggest that NCTS students valued interaction with fellow students in emotionally supportive informal groups (‘a core little group of friends,’ one man said) and because they learned from other students (‘a lot of learning happens outside of the classroom. We digest what’s gone in chapel or classroom,’ one woman said). It may be that students distinguish sharply between activities designed and delivered to students by the school staff (lecture series, retreat days, etc.) and those initiated by students themselves.</p>
<p>Third, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0966735011425304">Finlay (2003)</xref> discovered that women at KTS had higher expectations than men for religious/spiritual goals while in school, and practiced a greater variety of spiritual disciplines with more frequency than men did (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0966735011425304">Finlay, 2003</xref>: 88). Women at NCTS spoke with greater frequency than did men about chapel worship, group practices, and individual spiritual practices (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0966735011425304">Table 4</xref>). Women at NCTS also spoke more frequently than men about time limiting their ability to engage in spiritual exercises. Time constraints were a source of frustration. One woman said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s hard to spend time on spiritual practices at seminary, especially if you have kids. You have all the assignments, tests. You don’t want to add one more thing, but it needs to be done. You don’t have a lot of free time.</p>

<p>While there was no dominant timbre for the theme ‘Spirituality’ for women, for men the dominant timbre was positive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0966735011425304">Table 5</xref>). Thus, the findings in this study are consistent with Finlay’s conclusion that women brought high religious/spiritual expectations with them to seminary. As documented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0966735011425304">Table 6</xref>, neither men nor women at NCTS reported that the school’s program of spiritual formation or worship was a relatively important influence on their educational experience. During the time of the study, participation in chapel and group spiritual formation groups was encouraged at NCTS but was not required. This finding is consistent with the conclusion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425304">Foster et al., (2006</xref>: 272-84) that worship and intentional formation programs are commonly less integrated into the curricula at seminaries which have denominationally diverse student bodies and therefore appear to have less impact on students.</p>
<p>Finally, study results point to challenges that women experience in balancing school and life responsibilities. As reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0966735011425304">Table 5</xref>, there was no dominant timbre for either constituency for the theme ‘Life Management.’ Nevertheless, in all five of the sub-themes, one constituency had a lot more to say than the other. Men spoke about steps that they took to balance going to school and life beyond school far more frequently than did women. By contrast, women reported that seminary used up all of their time. One woman said that she ‘got the short end of the stick’ in her family when it came to seeing the doctor or getting a haircut. NCTS women reported the stress caused by going to school while continuing to look after children. As one woman put it, ‘we are all [my whole family] in seminary together.’ This finding resonates with research about multiple-role women students in social work and nursing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0966735011425304">Gigliotti, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0966735011425304">Home, 1997</xref>).</p>

<title>Sexism: Alive and Well?</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0966735011425304">Finlay (2003</xref>: 100) reported that half of the women in her study had experienced antagonism or coolness towards their service as worship leaders or their plans to pursue theological education, including ‘very discouraging conversations with pastors or Presbytery committees.’ She concluded that male clergy still frequently direct women away from pursuing ministry, ‘evidence that women still face obstacles in their efforts to become ministers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0966735011425304">Finlay, 2003</xref>: 102). As detailed in the section on results, a third of NCTS women interviewed also reported opposition to their pursuit of ministry as a vocation. This opposition came from church leaders, not from other NCTS students, faculty, or staff. Both men and women talked about the support that they had received from committees overseeing their frequently exhausting ordination processes. In contrast to the seminaries studied by Kleinman, and Carrol et al., no male student interviewed at NCTS commented on presence of women in the student body or their pursuit of ordination. Women at NCTS appeared to feel accepted by fellow students, faculty, and administrators, but were aware that simply being a woman could cause them difficulties as they sought positions in the church ─ the stained glass ceiling phenomenon that results in clergywomen not achieving the same marks of success in congregational ministry as clergymen belonging to the same church body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0966735011425304">Schneider and Schneider, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0966735011425304">Sullins, 2000</xref>). In this study, the three women who reported sexist treatment were a multi-ethnic American, a white American, and a South Korean. Each reported that they faced barriers because they were <italic>women</italic> aspiring to ministry. Their experience suggests that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0966735011425304">Kruks (2001</xref>: 132) is correct in arguing for the ongoing importance of the disputed category of women in the face of some forms of postmodern feminism so that ‘narratives of women’s oppression and demands for recognition’ may emerge.</p>

<sec id="section19-0966735011425304">
<title>Limits and Further Research</title>
<p>This study used IQA methods to discover the texture of student experience at one research site. IQA approaches enable participants to speak their minds with minimal promptings or follow-up questions. Because the study focused on a single research site, it would be rash to suggest that student experience at NCTS is a proxy for other mainline Protestant seminaries. Nevertheless, the study points to genuine differences in experience between men and women in seminary, while at the same time affirming that they share a common world, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0966735011425304">Goodman’s (1978)</xref> terms, shaped powerfully by the culture of the school and the external pressure of denominational expectations. A seminary may be a distinct micro-culture, but that micro-culture is part of a larger cultural system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0966735011425304">Berger and Luckmann, 1967</xref>). Going to seminary is no holiday from sexism.</p>
<p>Researchers seeking to pursue the traces of difference between the experiences of women and men discovered at NCTS might pursue three lines of research. First, researchers interested in gender discrimination might survey other seminarians about their experiences of affirmation or discouragement based on gender. While there is a large body of literature about sexism and clergy women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0966735011425304">Zikmund, Lummis, and Chang, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0966735011425304">Cody-Rydzewski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0966735011425304">Lawless, 1993</xref>), Finlay’s study of a single seminary is the sole work focusing directly on gender and seminary students. But Finlay’s data is now more than a decade old. Scholars with commitments to the full inclusion of women as leaders in churches should continue to do research monitoring the extent to which theological education nourishes or thwarts this goal. Second, researchers interested in studying what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0966735011425304">Ricciuti (2003</xref>: 147) calls ‘the multiple life-and-ministry responsibilities’ faced by many students can pursue clues about the challenges of school and life balance that surfaced in the theme ‘Life Management.’ Further research might focus on school-life balance for seminary students, especially given traditional role expectations that place a greater burden on women for taking care of children. Finally, men and women in this study perceived the influence of their individual call to a Christian service in distinctive ways. It appears that seminary refines vocational clarity for women in ways that it does not for men. Researchers might test whether this finding is true for women in other seminary settings and, if so, attempt to explain underlying mechanisms. Is it the case that, even in mainline Protestant churches, ministry continues to be construed as ‘sacredly male’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0966735011425304">Carroll and McMillan, 2006</xref>: 66) so that women must work during seminary to imagine themselves as ministers? Or do people continue to think and act as if being a man is the normal sort of human being, unmarked and unremarkable, while being a woman is Other and in need of explanation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0966735011425304">Bourdieu, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0966735011425304">de Beauvoir, 2010</xref>)?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0966735011425304">
<title>All Flourishing? Implications for Leaders</title>
<p>This report concludes with three implications for leaders of theological schools. Each derives from study findings. First, both men and women at NCTS perceived that the requirements of their church bodies were influential in their seminary experience. In IQA terms, ‘Church Requirements’ was a driver. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0966735011425304">Aleshire (2008</xref>: xix) notes that theological schools are fundamentally ‘hybrid institutions’ permanently bound to both ‘the work of the church and the patterns and practices of higher education.’ Leaders of theological schools – even those serving free-standing Protestant seminaries – need to attend to the problems of the church as well as the challenges of conforming to best educational practices. If sexism continues to be a problem in the churches, it is a problem also for school leaders.</p>
<p>Second, NCTS students reported that faculty members were highly influential in their educational experience, primarily as instructors and advisors. This finding is consistent with ESQ reports that faculty are very influential in the educational experience of MDiv graduates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0966735011425304">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0966735011425304">Carroll et al., (1997</xref>: 271) argued that ‘<italic>faculty dominate the students’ experience of their school</italic>’ because of the level of contact that they have with students. The faculty ‘are the primary purveyors to students of institutional culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0966735011425304">Carroll et al., 1997</xref>: 272). Faculty may consider their influence on students as unfailingly benign. Faculty in theological schools view themselves as experts, sages, fellow pilgrims, and mentors. The overall tone of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0966735011425304">Foster et al., (2006</xref>: 352-54) study seemed to put in doubt the existence of poor teachers in any seminary. These same faculty are the instructors who assign students papers but may not provide timely feedback, prefer not to teach evening courses, and who may or may not keep regular office hours. While theological education appears to be free of the distain with which professors in research universities talk about teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0966735011425304">Tuchman, 2009</xref>), it is not a foregone conclusion that faculty unfailingly live up to the standards that they set for themselves, nor that faculty influence on students’ experience is uniformly benevolent. Because faculty hold so much power over students, it is necessary for faculty to engage in self-criticism to discover how they might more fully support the learning and ministerial preparation of their students.</p>
<p>A third implication flowing from this study has to do with the composition of professoriate teaching in seminaries. The most recent data on completions of doctoral degrees in the United States noted that in 2009, for the first time, the majority of newly minted PhD recipients were women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0966735011425304">Bell, 2010</xref>). However, in religious studies and theology, the professoriate continues to be numerically dominated by men. Approximately one-third of students enrolled in PhD programs supplying seminary faculty to Canadian and American schools were women in 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0966735011425304">Wheeler, Miller, and Schuth, 2005</xref>). In ATS schools, the proportion of women who were full-time faculty in 1999 was 20.4 percent in 2009 it was 23.4 percent (Association of Theological Schools Table 3.1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0966735011425304">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0966735011425304">2009a</xref>). It is an open question whether male-dominated faculties will be able to influence the experiences of students, both men and women, in ways that are consonant with their stated commitments to the flourishing of women. Leaders of theological schools committed to shaping women and men for ministry should ponder not only the stained glass ceiling, but the ceilings that now seem to top ivory towers.</p>
