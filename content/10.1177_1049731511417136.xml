<abstract>
<p>Empathy is a core principle essential to social work. Despite this emphasis, minimal empirical research of empathy has been undertaken by social work researchers. The purpose of this study was to develop and initially validate the Empathy Scale for Social Workers (ESSW). The ESSW is a 41-item self-report inventory designed to assess empathy in social work practitioners. The sample (<italic>N</italic> = 271) consisted of social workers who had attained the Master of Social Work (MSW) degree. Findings revealed promising psychometric properties for the ESSW, and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) demonstrated content, construct, and factorial validity. Results were encouraging and they lay the ground work for the continued development of the ESSW. This scale addresses a gap in social work knowledge regarding the empirical evaluation of empathy. Results have implications for social work as the scale may be used to assess student training needs and/or as a screening tool for social work supervisors and practitioners.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Direct social work practice by its nature is an interactive, mutual, and dynamic process. Lacking probative technologies and a unifying theoretical authority, social workers rely on a tool kit of diffuse interpersonal skills and techniques to understand unique client needs, and choose appropriate and effective therapeutic interventions. A collaborative helping relationship that enlists inherent client strengths and environmental resources requires practitioners who can readily and accurately detect the nuanced perspectives and emotions of their clients. These core practice skills include reflective listening techniques and empathic inquiry. Despite its acceptance as an important underlying aspect of human personality, interpersonal relationships, and the helping process, empathy’s definition remains undifferentiated. Notably, the understanding and practice of empathy as an important theoretical construct and personal attribute in social work practice has been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731511417136">Freedberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049731511417136">Hepworth &amp; Larsen, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731511417136">Hollis &amp; Woods, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731511417136">Lantz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049731511417136">Rothery &amp; Tutty, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049731511417136">Saulnier, 1996</xref>). Ironically, the empirical assessment and measurement of empathy has not been vigorously pursued by social work researchers despite the profession’s anchoring of the construct in education and practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731511417136">Gerdes and Segal (2009)</xref> provided a recent and notable exception in their theoretical contributions to the exploration of the important role of empathy in social work practice.</p>
<p>Most human behavior and development theories that inform social work place emphasize on the role of empathy in developing a productive relationship between worker and client. Psychodynamic theories such as self-psychology and object relations require an empathic therapist for their delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731511417136">Martin, 2001</xref>). Cognitive-behavioral approaches and crisis-intervention models describe an explicit need for empathy skills on the part of the practitioner. Humanistic models such as client-centered therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731511417136">Rogers, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049731511417136">Rothery &amp; Tutty, 2001</xref>) and existential social work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731511417136">Lantz, 2001</xref>) also predicate the applications of their theoretical frameworks with empathy and its adjacent interpersonal attributes and abilities.</p>
<p>Social work practice texts are replete with references regarding the importance of empathy in the successful implementation of face-to-face practice with individuals, groups, families, and communities. Students often receive specific training in the use of empathy skills and rehearse these in the classroom and field placements prior to beginning their professional careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1049731511417136">Woods &amp; Hollis, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The utility of the helping relationship in social work has been repeatedly demonstrated. Indeed, the process skills of the worker provide the potential for change, and have been identified by social work clients as the single most important factor in treatment success. Empathy and other similar constructs repeatedly appear in the literature examining the therapeutic relationship (TR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731511417136">Coady &amp; Marziali, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731511417136">Lejuez, Hopko, Levine, Gholkar, &amp; Collins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049731511417136">Olio &amp; Cornell, 1993</xref>). The field emphasizes empathy, tolerance, and genuine concern for the welfare of vulnerable populations in society and social work outcome research continues to support the empathic and intuitive nature of successful social work practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049731511417136">Smith, Thomas, &amp; Jackson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1049731511417136">Tevithick, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous reviews of available empathy measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731511417136">Chlopan, McCain, Carbonell, &amp; Hagen, 1985</xref>) revealed no instrument designed to measure empathy for social workers. Other available empathy instruments have limited utility for the measurement of empathy in social workers. The empathy quotient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731511417136">Baron-Cohen &amp; Wheelwright, 2004</xref>), while reliable (α = .92), the scale is specifically designed for clinical populations. The interpersonal reactivity index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731511417136">Davis, 1983</xref>) has been repeatedly subjected to empirical testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049731511417136">Pulos, Elison, &amp; Lennon, 2004</xref>), but it was not designed to assess empathy in a helping relationship. The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731511417136">Hojat, 2007</xref>) evaluates empathy for physicians and is based on concepts and terminology specific to the practice of medicine. These scales have informed the development of the current scale but were not considered adequate to evaluate empathy for social workers. Notably, the lack of an objective measure of empathy for social workers represents a knowledge gap in the social work practice and research literature given its role as a core and guiding principle in social work.</p>
<sec id="section2-1049731511417136">
<title>Statement of Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this research was to develop and initially validate a measure, the Empathy Scale for Social Workers (ESSW) to assess empathy among social work practitioners (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1049731511417136">Appendix A</xref>). It is intended to extend social work research further into the empirical study of one of the essential process skills used by social workers.</p>
<p>The scale was designed to assess the complex structural nature of empathy among social work practitioners. Empathy was considered as a concept with cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731511417136">Davis, 1983</xref>). This study presents the latent structure of empathy’s three dimensions as supported by six interlocking constructs. Based on an extensive review of current literature, these constructs are: (a) perspective taking (PT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731511417136">Baron-Cohen &amp; Wheelwright, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731511417136">Cliffordson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731511417136">Davis, 1980</xref>), (b) altruism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731511417136">Batson, Eklund, Chermok, Hoyt, &amp; Ortiz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049731511417136">Jolliffe &amp; Farrington, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049731511417136">Koss-Chioino, 2006</xref>), (c) caring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731511417136">Danby, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731511417136">Engster, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049731511417136">Skovholt, 2005</xref>), (d) congruence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731511417136">Freedberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731511417136">Rogers, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049731511417136">Rothery &amp; Tutty, 2001</xref>), (e) interpersonal sensitivity (IS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731511417136">Carney &amp; Harrigan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731511417136">Hall &amp; Mast, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049731511417136">Snodgrass &amp; Rosenthal, 1985</xref>), and (f) the TR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731511417136">Rogers, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049731511417136">Rothery &amp; Tutty, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049731511417136">Wickman &amp; Campbell, 2003</xref>). They are proposed as expressions and theoretical evidence of empathy in social workers.</p>

<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>Interest in empathy led researchers to study its underlying properties and attempt to quantify its dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731511417136">Davis, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731511417136">Dymond, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731511417136">Hogan, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731511417136">Hojat, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049731511417136">Mehrabian &amp; Epstein, 1972</xref>). Empathy is normally defined as having two primary dimensions, affective and cognitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731511417136">Cliffordson, 2002</xref>). The framework described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049731511417136">Figure 1</xref>
 illustrates a model of empathy extending the primary cognitive and affective dimensions by incorporating its behavioral manifestations. Recently, theoretical inquiry into the nature of empathy in social work practice has considered the essential role of clinical expressions of the central concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731511417136">Gerdes &amp; Segal, 2009</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049731511417136">Figure 1</xref>, these three dimensions are operationalized into six underlying constructs that provide a proposed definition of empathy in this study. This process required an initial comprehensive theoretical scaffolding to begin to document evidence for the construct validity of this measure. This requisite step in objective scale development has been outlined by researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731511417136">Cronbach &amp; Meehl, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049731511417136">Nunnally, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049731511417136">Rubin &amp; Babbie, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1049731511417136">Spector, 1992</xref>). The creation of a comprehensive theoretical framework permits test items to be drawn from a universe of concepts related to the latent structure under scrutiny. An exhaustive approach to scale item creation and selection enhanced the likelihood that as many aspects of empathy as possible would be incorporated into the design of the ESSW.</p>

</fig>
<p>The six constructs depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049731511417136">Figure 1</xref> are (a) caring, (b) congruence, (c) IS, (d) PT, (e) altruism, and (f) the TR. They were taken from the literature in social work and related disciplines and provide both theoretical and empirical evidence of the existence and importance of empathy in social work practice. Just as the affective, cognitive, and behavioral dimensions of empathy share components in their manifestations, so do these six specific nonmutually exclusive constructs.</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine affective, cognitive, and behavioral components of empathy ever being “stand alone” concepts. Empathy, by its interpersonal and dynamic nature, is something we think, feel, and do. In clinical practice, the use of empathy is indeed a highly complex and dynamic process and its use in social work often requires the practitioner to have all three dimensions “turned on” at once.</p>
<p>Each of the constructs outlined in this theoretical framework has affective, cognitive, and behavioral components and manifestations. They have been determined, for the purposes of this study, to be <italic>primarily</italic> affective, cognitive, or behavioral. For example, in this study, IS is grouped within the cognitive dimension. The thoughtful attunement to nonverbal communications from clients (a part of IS) will often identify illicit intense emotional material within the clinical practice relationship, and reflection or inquiry into this material by the therapist then by definition becomes a behavioral extension of IS. As such, the use of IS is <italic>primarily</italic> cognitive in that the nonverbal cues of the client are compared to an internal and established clinical knowledge base. Limited eye contact may communicate deference, anger, or psychosis depending on the social context and interpersonal and intrapsychic dynamics of the interaction. The IS in a helping relationship depends on the perceptiveness and content knowledge base of the clinician. Likewise, altruism is behavior rooted in emotional as well as cognitive motivations, and while these affective and intellectual components are crucial to our understanding of altruism, it remains <italic>primarily</italic> a behavior.</p>
<p>The six constructs underlying a definition of empathy proposed here have varied meanings and connotations to wide and disparate audiences. Terms like congruence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731511417136">Rogers, 1951</xref>) and IS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049731511417136">Snodgrass, Hecht, &amp; Ploutz-Snyder, 1998</xref>) have been redefined by theorists and researchers, with unique meanings for a specific field or discipline. This process further complicates the definitive categorization of these concepts. The exploratory aspects of this study aim to shed light on the degrees of difference and similarity between these terms and constructs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049731511417136">
<title>The Affective Dimension</title>
<p>The affective dimension of empathy is an interactive process of emotional connection and concern for others. It involves emotions defined by how a person feels in the context of an interpersonal experience. Perception of the emotional world of another and an emotionally empathic approach to helping are manifested by two supporting constructs, caring and congruence.</p>
<sec id="section5-1049731511417136">
<title>Caring</title>
<p>Caring as a theoretical construct has been developed and refined in part, within the disciples of nursing, philosophy, and counseling. It has been defined as behavior directed at meeting the immediate needs of another by the use of a discipline-specific skill set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049731511417136">Lee-Hsieh, Kuo, Tseng, &amp; Tuton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049731511417136">Skovholt, 2005</xref>). Alternative theories of this notion stress the importance of caring as a social construct with implications in moral and ethical decision-making processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731511417136">Danby, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Caring as both a goal-oriented interactional behavior and theoretical construct is notably absent in the empathy scale development literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731511417136">Davis, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731511417136">De Kemp, Overbeek, de Wied, Engels, &amp; Scholte, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731511417136">Hashimoto &amp; Shiomi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731511417136">Hojat, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049731511417136">Mehrabian &amp; Epstein, 1972</xref>). By contrast, other related constructs such as empathic concern, PT, and compassion repeatedly appear in the literature on caring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731511417136">Danby, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731511417136">Engster, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1049731511417136">Skovholt, 2005</xref>). Clearly, caring is an emotional and interactive process that taps the affective components of helping relationships and a relational connection to the feelings of another lays the groundwork for the experience and expression of caring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731511417136">Brenner &amp; Wrubel, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731511417136">Engster, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049731511417136">
<title>Congruence</title>
<p>Congruence is defined as an ability to be open, nonjudgmental, and honest within helping relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049731511417136">Tudor &amp; Worrall, 1994</xref>). Congruence was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731511417136">Rogers (1951)</xref> to be a “core condition” of an empathic and productive therapist–client relationship. Congruence is a therapeutic and emotional connection associated with positive outcomes in psychotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731511417136">Marziali &amp; Alexander, 1991</xref>). It requires a therapist to communicate verbally as well as nonverbally that he or she is a learner anticipating understanding the client’s unique situation and perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049731511417136">Wickman &amp; Campbell, 2003</xref>). Social work theorists and practitioners have continued to embrace congruence and empathy as essential change facilitating skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731511417136">Freedberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049731511417136">Rothery &amp; Tutty, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Research regarding the measurement of empathy has captured elements of congruence without explicating it as a unique construct in its own right (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731511417136">Davis, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731511417136">Hogan, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731511417136">Hojat, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049731511417136">Mehrabian &amp; Epstein, 1972</xref>). Congruence and empathy are cooccurring conditions with behavioral similarities and have been described as overlapping conditions of an effective TR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731511417136">Allen-Meares &amp; Burman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049731511417136">Houston, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049731511417136">Lambert &amp; Barley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731511417136">Rogers, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1049731511417136">Tudor &amp; Worrall, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1049731511417136">Wickman &amp; Campbell, 2003</xref>). Congruence is both an interactive and emotional process, it is a helper’s resonance with the feelings of another, and it supports a relationship from which healing can emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731511417136">Freedberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731511417136">Rogers, 1951</xref>).</p>

<title>The Cognitive Dimension</title>
<p>Cognitive dimensions of empathy involve interpersonal perception, intellectual flexibility, and openness to understanding the experiences of another in the service of helping.

<p>The IS is a communicative process between individuals based on their understanding of one another’s body language and facial expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049731511417136">Snodgrass &amp; Rosenthal, 1985</xref>). This skill varies considerably between individuals and is influenced by both social context and gender role expectations. The IS contributes to intimate relationship success and effective helping relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1049731511417136">Snodgrass et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The IS is considered a necessary but insufficient condition for empathy. One cannot be empathic without being interpersonally sensitive, but sensitivity does not guarantee empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731511417136">Carney &amp; Harrigan, 2003</xref>). The IS can aid in the assessment of a client’s nonverbal behaviors, and it creates an opportunity for exploration of issues not initially presented by the client (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1049731511417136">Snodgrass &amp; Rosenthal, 1985</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731511417136">Hall and Mast (2007)</xref> identified nonverbal communication and IS as confirmatory and complementary processes in one’s development of accurate empathy.</p>
<p>The IS is a cognitive exploration that injects the helping process with a level of objectivity in understanding the contextual but often unspoken nature of a client’s concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731511417136">Carney &amp; Harrigan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1049731511417136">Underwood &amp; Moore, 1982</xref>).</p>

<italic>Perspective taking.</italic> PT is defined as the ability to accurately perceive another’s point of view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731511417136">Davis, 1980</xref>). It involves the internal and cognitive interpretation and understanding of another’s mental, emotional, and situational status. It becomes necessary to suspend one’s own perspective or worldview and seek to understand the environmental issues and factors contributing to the thoughts and feelings of someone else (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731511417136">Baron-Cohen &amp; Wheelwright, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731511417136">Cliffordson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731511417136">Davis, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731511417136">Hojat, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731511417136">Johnson, Cheek, &amp; Smither, 1983</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731511417136">Dymond (1949)</xref> defined empathy as “the imaginative transposing of oneself into the thinking, feeling, and acting of another, and so structuring the world as he does” (p. 127).</p>
<p>PT has been described as an essential part of the development and expression of empathy. Research has demonstrated the complex processes and relationship between PT and empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049731511417136">Oswald, 1996</xref>). Factor analytic studies of empathy measures suggest PT to be an underlying function of empathy as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731511417136">Cliffordson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731511417136">Davis, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731511417136">Hojat, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731511417136">Johnson et al., 1983</xref>). Theoretical and empirical study has consistently identified PT as an important facet of empathy in professional helping relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731511417136">Hojat, 2007</xref>). Flexible and objective attunement to the details of a client’s perspective is required to be of help. By taking a client’s perspective, a clinician enhances the chances of employing successful assessment and intervention strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731511417136">Davis, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049731511417136">Saulnier, 1996</xref>).</p>

<title>The Behavioral Dimension</title>
<p>Intuitively one recognizes that behavioral manifestations of empathy involve interpersonal actions and motivations. These are other-directed and outwardly observable expressions of empathy and demonstrate functional aspects of the concept and its concrete applications within helping relationships. The two constructs (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049731511417136">Figure 1</xref>) related to this dimension are altruism and the TR.</p>
<sec id="section12-1049731511417136">
<title>Altruism</title>
<p>Altruism has been described as a prosocial behavior intended to help or assist another individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731511417136">Bierhoff &amp; Rohmann, 2004</xref>). Altruism can take the form of efforts to relieve distress, such as helping someone to stand after a fall, or goal-directed behavior such as opening a door for another. Altruistic behavior is distinct from collaboration in that all expect to benefit from a collaborative effort. Altruism has been identified as a behavioral indicator of empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731511417136">Batson et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1049731511417136">Underwood &amp; Moore, 1982</xref>). The role of motivation in altruistic behavior is essential to understanding the concept and the empathy–altruism hypothesis posits that altruistic behavior is motivated by an individual’s concern for the welfare of another as an outgrowth of empathic expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731511417136">Batson et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731511417136">2007</xref>). Additionally, this hypothesis suggests that altruistic behavior is not driven by alternative motivations such as guilt within the helper or the anticipation of the rewarding experience of seeing change in the recipient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731511417136">Batson et al., 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>While altruism serves as a behavioral indicator of empathy, most empathy measurement research does not attend to the relationship between altruism and empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049731511417136">Davis, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731511417136">Dymond, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731511417136">Hogan, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731511417136">Hojat, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049731511417136">Mehrabian &amp; Epstein, 1972</xref>). Empirical research studies on empathy have repeatedly found an inverse relationship between antisocial behavior and empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731511417136">De Kemp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049731511417136">Jolliffe &amp; Farrington, 2005</xref>). As the relationship between antisocial behavior and empathy helps define what empathy is not, the prosocial behavior of altruism should be a part of the theoretical network defining what empathy is. The empirical evidence of a relationship between the concepts helps to explain the complex theoretical overlap between them. Given the centrality of altruism to the character of social work, its role in the assessment of empathy in practitioners is warranted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731511417136">Bulke, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731511417136">Holosko, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049731511417136">Pins, 1963</xref>).</p>

<title>The therapeutic relationship</title>
<p>The TR has been identified as a significant agent of change and growth in a variety of helping relationships and clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731511417136">Allen-Meares &amp; Burman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049731511417136">Lambert &amp; Barley, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049731511417136">Olio &amp; Cornell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1049731511417136">Stewart, 1984</xref>). This consists in part, of a sense of trust and a bond between the therapist and client (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731511417136">Dykeman, Nelson, &amp; Appleton, 1995</xref>). A TR is one in which a worker is accepting, nonjudgmental, supportive, and empathic. Other identified defining characteristics of TR are effective affirmation skills, caring, and respect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731511417136">Allen-Meares &amp; Burman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049731511417136">Lambert &amp; Barley, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The importance of TR is a central construct in most theories of human behavior and therapeutic change. Psychodynamic theorists and researchers describe this alliance as a foundation for explaining therapeutic benefits of clinical intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049731511417136">Kradin, 2005</xref>). Theorists from existential, feminist, behavioral, and family systems schools of thought often center their models around an empathic TR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731511417136">Lantz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731511417136">Lejuez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049731511417136">Minuchin &amp; Fishman, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049731511417136">Saulnier, 2001</xref>). Empathy is a distinct process component of the worker–client relationship that is embraced by most theoretical therapeutic models of change. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731511417136">Freedberg (2007)</xref> stated, “I am suggesting that an enhanced feeling of power grows out of a healthy interaction with empathically attuned others, contributing to the capacity to act in the environment with a sense of self-efficacy and purposefulness” (p. 256).</p>
<p>Empathy and its ultimate behavioral and theoretical expressions appear in studies of TR. Accordingly, measures of the helping relationship have been successfully used in the evaluation of therapeutic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731511417136">Coady &amp; Marziali, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731511417136">Marziali &amp; Alexander, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1049731511417136">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). While a reflective and thoughtful process, TR is an outwardly focused behavior initiated by the helper and it requires motivation and direct action by the clinician to provide a relational and behavioral vehicle for change.</p>
<p>In sum here, six constructs as noted above are associated with the concept of empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049731511417136">King, 2009</xref>). All have empirical and theoretical justification in the literature and all were included in the development and initial validation of the ESSW to assess empathy among social worker practitioners who use this skill in their day-to-day practice.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section16-1049731511417136">
<title>Scale Construction</title>
<p>The initial items on the ESSW were developed using scale construction methods through three steps. First, a review of the literature from prior research on empathy and its related constructs was conducted. This provided descriptions of empathy that formed a large pool of terms and phrases from which scale item stems were developed. Second, items from existing general empathy scales were reviewed, and phraseology related to the concept of empathy was incorporated into the construction of complete social work practice-related scale items. Each of the six latent constructs of empathy (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049731511417136">Figure 1</xref>) was allotted 6–7 items each, resulting in a 41-item scale for initial testing. Third, to establish a level of content validity for the ESSW, expert reviewers were recruited to review the scale. All reviewers were social work practitioners with advanced clinical licensure (licensed clinical social worker [LCSW]) in the state of Georgia (<italic>N</italic> = 20). These initial pilot data were used to refine the scale items but were not included in the final data analysis.</p>
<p>The reviewers evaluated the ESSW using the following three criteria-based questions, how accurate is this scale in describing empathy in social work practice? Are the scale items worded coherently? Does the scale appear to be useful for social workers? Reviewers were asked to rate the scale according to these criteria using a 10-point scale, “1 = <italic>not at all</italic>” to “10 = <italic>very much</italic>.” Participants were also asked to identify items on the scale that they thought were worded poorly or confusing. Amendments were then made to the pretested scale.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1049731511417136">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The study used a nonprobability, purposive sampling technique, an approach common in the development of measurement instruments that seek to assess a specific group’s attitudes and underlying beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049731511417136">Rubin &amp; Babbie, 2005</xref>). The sample consisted of social work practitioners with at least 2 years of direct social work practice experience, and a Master of Social Work (MSW) degree. This inclusion criterion sought to capture a sample of social workers who had enough clinical experience to have had sufficient opportunities for exposure to the use of empathy in practice. Study participants were sought from a list of MSW graduates from the University of Georgia (UGA), School of Social Work between the years 1975 and 2005. Study participants were also recruited from the Georgia Society for Clinical Social Work. All participants’ response data were pooled for the final data analysis. The final sample size of the study was 271 (<italic>N</italic> = 271). As the purpose of the study was to evaluate empathy among social workers; the sample was discipline specific and relatively homogeneous.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1049731511417136">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This study is a quantitative-descriptive research design. This design is appropriate, when the research goal is the development of an objective rating scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731511417136">Holosko, 2006</xref>). Specific objectives designed to further the purpose of the study were to describe and quantify the relationships between various study variables. In this case, a single, relatively homogenous, group of participants was sought for this study. The scale was electronically formatted by the Survey Research Center (SRC) at the UGA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1049731511417136">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>After study approval by the Institutional Review Board at UGA, the ESSW was made available electronically to potential participants, via a web link through the SRC at UGA. No specific incentives were offered to study respondents. Participants then accessed the link and were presented with an introductory cover letter informing them of their rights as research subjects including the lack of assured anonymity, when participating in an online survey. To ensure the confidentiality of participants no personal identifying information was requested by the researcher, and all participants were asked to provide general demographic information only in order to better describe the overall sample. Demographic data were gender, age, ethnicity, years of practice experience, and current practice setting. Participants then moved on to completing the ESSW and the additional validation scales. Once the survey became available via the Internet and participants were solicited, data collection began and continued for a period of 8 weeks from April 1, 2009, until June 1, 2009.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1049731511417136">
<title>Instruments of Study</title>
<p>The ESSW contains 41 items describing thoughts, feelings, and actions involved in the use of empathy in social work practice. Participants are asked to respond to the items on a Likert-type frequency scale. Theoretically, higher scores reflect higher levels of empathy. The response format for the ESSW is 1 = <italic>never</italic>, 2 = <italic>rarely</italic>, 3 = <italic>sometimes</italic>, 4 = <italic>often</italic>, and 5 = <italic>always</italic>. The scale contains four reverse scored items. These are Items 25, 27, 29, 32, and 40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049731511417136">King, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Participants also completed The Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE; clinical social work version). This scale was adapted (with the author’s permission) by the research team from The Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy (JSPE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731511417136">Hojat, 2007</xref>). The JSPE is a 20-item self-report questionnaire designed to assess empathy among medical doctors and has strong psychometric properties, α = .92 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731511417136">Hojat, 2007</xref>). The scale was adapted, with feedback from the original author, using language more consistent with the direct practice of social work. The JSE (clinical social work version) uses a response set ranging from 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 7 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. This scale was used as a convergent validity check on the ESSW.</p>
<p>The Self-Report Altruism scale (SRA) is designed to assess altruistic behavior in adults. The SRA is a 20-item questionnaire with high reliability, α = .80, and acceptable validity correlations with related measures and was used as an additional construct validity measure for the ESSW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049731511417136">Rushton, Chrisjohn, &amp; Fekken, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally here, study participants completed the Verbal Aggression Scale (VAS). This scale measured the degree to which someone uses verbal attacks and manipulation to influence others. High scores on the VAS reflect an interactive style in significant contrast to the constructs and concepts used in this study to define empathy. The VAS is a 20-item questionnaire with strong reliability, α = .80, and moderate validity correlations with related measures. It was used as a discriminant validity check on the ESSW. The response sets for this scale are 1 = <italic>almost never</italic>, 2 = <italic>rarely</italic>, 3 = <italic>sometimes</italic>, 4 = <italic>often</italic>, 5 = <italic>almost always</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731511417136">Infante &amp; Wigley, 1986</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1049731511417136">
<title>Data Analysis Procedures</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using the Statistical Program for the Social Sciences, 16.0 (SPSS). The data were examined for missing data entries for each respondent. Data from respondents who did not complete all sections of the survey were not included in the final analysis. This resulted in a final sample size of 271. Frequency and descriptive statistics for the demographic data were computed and the internal consistency of the ESSW was determined using Cronbach’s coefficient alpha (α). An item analysis was conducted to examine the distribution of specifically problematic items. The correlation matrix was analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) techniques. Variable coefficients (factor loadings) were computed and revealed the extent to which specific items grouped together to form factors. Due to the latent and undifferentiated nature of the construct being evaluated, and the theoretical overlap between items, an oblique rotation of factors was used to clarify the factor structure of the ESSW as is preferred when evaluating the factors of latent human capacities that are expected to correlate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731511417136">Gorsuch, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731511417136">Kline, 1994</xref>).</p>

<title>Item Analysis</title>
<p>An item analysis was conducted to evaluate specific scale items for future retention or deletion from the ESSW. Item frequency and distribution values were computed and evaluated to empirically inform this decision-making process. The skewness and kurtosis values of items are indicators of the normality of its distribution. Skewness and kurtosis values outside of the 2.0 to −2.0 range are generally considered problematic and suggest a closer examination of an item for evidence of its appropriateness for retention. This process revealed three items meeting these criteria.</p>
<p>Each of these items (20, 25, 26, and 41) were subjected to further analysis to determine how they were affecting the overall coefficient α of the ESSW. Examination of item 20, “I can put aside my feelings and listen attentively to a client” revealed kurtosis = 3.38 with 67.3% of participants responding “always” and 24.6% endorsing “often.” When this item was deleted the Cronbach’s α improved to .839 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049731511417136">King, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Item 25, “I am careless when working with clients,” had a kurtosis value of 2.77 and 60.3% of participants responded “rarely” and 32.7% responded “never.” When this item was deleted from the scale, the coefficient α improved to .835 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049731511417136">King, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Item 41, “Having an intimate relationship with a client is appropriate,” had a kurtosis value of 6.10 and 93% of respondents endorsed “never.” Eliminating this item improved the overall α of the scale to .840 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049731511417136">King, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the distribution concerns for Items 25 and 41, they are intuitively problematic. The wording of these items makes them subject to potential social desirability bias as it is unlikely practicing social workers would favorably endorse either item due to the phraseology of behavior detrimental to client welfare and a productive helping relationship. These findings certainly warrant the removal of these two items from the scale.</p>

<title>Correlations With Additional Measures</title>
<p>The following additional measures were utilized to assess the significance and direction of the scales’ relationships with each other. This procedure was meant to evaluate the construct and discriminant validity of the ESSW. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed for these scales’ relationships with one another and the level of significance in each.</p>
<p>It was hypothesized that the ESSW would correlate with both the JSE and the SRA in a positively direction and significantly. The construct validity of the ESSW is strengthened by its significant relationship with the JSE. This provides evidence that the ESSW was measuring a closely related but different theoretical construct. The comparison of the ESSW against the VAS was hypothesized to correlate in a negative direction with the ESSW to a significant degree as well. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049731511417136">Table 2</xref>

<title>Factor Analyses</title>
<p>The initial EFA and subsequent examination of factor eigenvalues and the Scree plot suggested that a three-factor solution could be the best fit for the data. A second EFA was conducted including an Oblimin rotation to achieve a factor pattern matrix (<italic>N</italic> = 271). The item criteria for retention on a factor included interpretation based on theory, interpretability of the factor, a minimum of three items loading (&gt;.35) on each factor, and the examination of the Scree plot. As items grouped into factors, three distinct clusters of items were identified. These factors reflected the underlying elements of the six constructs posited to comprise empathy in social work practice.</p>
<p>The first factor was named “a compassionate contextual assessment” (CCA), and it describes a framework for understanding the experience of receiving and delivering social work services. The second factor identified in the analyses was “an accepting and attentive collaborative inquiry” (ACI), and it described the relationship style and quality inherent in direct social work practice. The final factor was named “intrinsic helping and emotional support” (IHS), and reflected behavioral expressions of caring and altruism in an empathic helping experience (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1049731511417136">Table 3</xref>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Empathy appears to be a complex, interactive, and dynamic grouping of affective, cognitive, and behavioral components that manifest themselves in social work practice. The ESSW is an important first step in the objective evaluation of empathy among social workers. Direct social work practitioners identified the concepts introduced here as relevant and influential in their use of empathy in practice.</p>
<p>The psychometric properties of the ESSW lend empirical support to the study’s theoretical claim that empathy consists of a variety of discreet but overlapping constructs and expressions similar to other latent human abilities and attributes. The internal consistency of the instrument was strong, indicating the measure is indeed tapping a commonly understood concept by study participants labeled as empathy in this study.</p>
<p>Factor analyses reinforced the idea that empathy in social work practice consisted of various expressions, rather than a singular all-inclusive concept. As social work is an applied profession, and this study involved the evaluation of social work practitioners and the factors were named in a way to reflect empathy as an active and dynamic process rather than a static and isolated concept. As is the case in this study, during the initial validation stages of scale development, naming factors is an inexact process requiring replication studies to define factors with increasing specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731511417136">Gorsuch, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731511417136">Kline, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The first factor was named “a CCA,” and it described a framework for understanding the experience of receiving and delivering social work services. It contained items drawn from the theoretical construct PT. For example, Item 8 “I can disagree with a client and still appreciate their position,” and Item 31 “I try to understand a client’s point of view before making suggestions,” represent the contextual assessment aspects of this factor. Item 28, “I lose track of what a client is telling me,” (reverse scored) is an example of items representing the concept of congruence and Item 25, “I am careless when working with clients,” (reverse scored) is an example drawn from the construct of caring. These items influenced including the term compassionate, when naming the factor. The terms assessment and compassionate “bookend” the term contextual in Factor 1. Assessment describes what action a practitioner is taking, and compassionate connotes the interpersonal approach of how services are rendered in the practice of social work. The term contextual represents the perspective or position from which the practitioner considers the client’s individual circumstances. Social work theory emphasizes human behavior in the context of the social environment and makes this identification of this first factor appropriate and understandable.</p>
<p>The second factor identified was “accepting and attentive collaborative inquiry.” This also described a method of social work intervention, marked by the emphasis on the concept of a TR with clients. Item 13, “My relationship with a client can help them overcome their problems,” and Item 19,” The personal dynamics of my relationship with a client are beneficial to the treatment process,” are both examples of the TR construct and reflect a “collaborative inquiry.” The terms “accepting and attentive” are representative of the construct of caring in part by Item 14, “It is important for my clients to be able to trust me,” and Item 17, “It is important for my clients to know that I care about them.” Item 2, “Unconditional acceptance helps clients,” represents the concept of congruence.</p>
<p>The third factor was “intrinsic helping and emotional support.” It consisted of items representing caring and altruism constructs. For example, Item 4, “I enjoy helping people,” and Item 11, “Helping clients is rewarding in and of itself,” theoretically represent the concept of altruism. The role that altruism plays as a consistent personality marker and behavioral expression of the social work profession has been explored and empirically documented.</p>

<title>Study Limitations</title>
<p>The diffuse nature of empathy in social work practice makes it difficult to measure with specificity and is an inherent limitation of this research. The six constructs identified to underlie empathy are not unique to social work and take on differential meanings in the general population and other helping professions.</p>
<p>The choice of an electronic survey as a tool for data collection can be problematic as well. Survey research is susceptible to a level of bias as findings may be influenced by the responses of most motivated participants. The study survey was lengthy with four different scales with approximately 100 items. This could result in an exhaustion or capitulation effect among respondents. As noted before the sample was a highly homogenous group and would be inclined to answer items regarding empathy and social work practice in similar ways. Given the theoretical and educational emphases on empathy in clinical practice, a level of social desirability bias could have influenced these study findings.</p>
<sec id="section30-1049731511417136">
<title>Implications for Social Work</title>
<p>As practitioners determine which area of practice is the “best fit” for them as people and professionals, the ESSW may provide objective information in this decision-making process. This opportunity for self-evaluation may assist practitioners as a tool for practice and career choice decisions, as well as continuing education and supervision needs in the field. Frequently, social workers find themselves in supervisory positions of social service agencies and direct care staff. Many social work practitioners are well suited for these positions, due in part to the inclusive communication and contextual orientation and skills that they bring to clinical practice settings. Often, the skills of practitioners (such as empathy) can enhance the effectiveness and overall success of an agency supervisor, and the agency overall. The ESSW has utility as a screening and self-evaluation tool for potential social work supervisors, and their ability to balance and differentiate the types of empathy needed while supervising clinicians and staff.</p>
<p>As noted previously, empathy has been defined as essential for effective social work practice by its virtually universal emphasis in social work education. The ESSW can function as one of a group of self-evaluation and objective screening devices for social work students and practitioners. If empathy is central to social work practice, then social work students and practitioners lacking the capacity for empathy in general, or regarding specific client groups may be identified and the information gained by the use of the ESSW can inform schools of social work admission procedures, as well as student field placement assignments. Social work practice supervisors would be able to make more empirically informed decisions about clinical assignments and practitioner staffing patterns in agency settings with the use of the ESSW.</p>
<p>The ESSW may provide social work academics and researchers with information that brings the nature of social work into greater focus. It provides empirical research data regarding the constructs that underlie empathy. Understanding the processes by which empathy functions in social work practice brings the concept to the forefront, in explaining how and why practitioners deliver effective services. Through repeated testing of the instrument, the ESSW can become a mechanism for the generation of an informed and improved social work theory and its application in direct practice settings.</p>
<p>Social researchers from a variety of disciplines would benefit from the data generated by future administrations of the ESSW. The ESSW could function as an effective construct and divergent validity tool in the development of scales designed to measure similar or differentiated concepts. Researchers interested in the complexities and dynamics of human cognition, communication, and relationships could benefit from the continuing refinement and development of the ESSW for use in other helping professions. Adaptations of the ESSW would provide insight into the similarities and differences in the constructs underlying empathy in clinical populations as varied as the developmentally disabled, juvenile offenders, substance abusers, sex offenders, and child abuse victims.</p>
<p>The implications for social work practice outlined above represent the potential the ESSW has to impact the profession of social work and influence future research efforts. The use of varied research methodologies could be helpful in contributing to a deeper understanding of the nature of empathy in social work. Empirical outcome studies in the teaching of empathy skills to different groups of students and practitioners could extend further the clinical and research utility and capacities of the ESSW. Research inquiries that facilitate the development of an even more detailed and comprehensive picture of the components of empathy could provide important data for inclusion in the ongoing development of the ESSW. Finally, this process would further an understanding of how and why empathy figures as prominently as it does, not only in social work practice but also as a unique and varied human ability and attribute.</p>
