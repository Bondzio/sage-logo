<p>Ravi Vasudevan, although he has not been prolific, is one of the more respected film scholars and academics in India. His work has been devoted to mainstream Hindi cinema and his most important effort has been an anthology—perhaps the best known of academic writing on Indian cinema—entitled <italic>Making Meaning in Indian Cinema</italic> (Oxford, 2000). Vasudevan’s interest in mainstream cinema is largely in its narrative form and most specifically in its melodrama. Since the essay he contributed to the anthology he edited, the one entitled ‘Shifting Codes, Dissolving Identities: The Hindi Social Film of the 1950s as Popular Culture’ is regarded as seminal by film scholars, one found oneself waiting for his treatise on melodrama, which is intriguingly titled <italic>The Melodramatic Public</italic>. Mainstream cinema has come a long way since 2000 and one wondered how a new volume of academic writing on Indian film would deal with its transformation.</p>
<p>Since ‘melodrama’ is the key notion dealt with in the book, a few words should perhaps be said about melodrama’s historical significance. Broadly speaking, melodrama is seen to indulge in strong emotionalism, moral polarisation and schematisation; it portrays extreme situations and actions, overt villainy, the persecution of the good and the final reward of virtue, inflated or extravagant expression, abrupt changes in fortune and dark plotting and suspense. Academic studies of melodrama in cinema have—usually indirectly—proceeded from the work of Peter Brooks (<italic>The Melodramatic Imagination: Balzac, Henry James and the Mode of Excess</italic>, 1976). The origins of Western melodrama were located by Brooks within the context of the French Revolution and its aftermath when the traditional sacred and its representative institutions (Church and Monarch) were liquidated. The Revolution attempted to install the Republic as the institution of morality and melodrama after the Revolution made operative a moral universe in a post-sacred era. Melodrama, as an aesthetic form is therefore considered a corollary to the democratisation of society and this gives it special value. The difficulty with using this as a basis for Hindi cinema is that it admits that melodrama as a dramatic form in India is entirely post-colonial and this needs questioning. One cannot, for instance, assert that Kalidasa’s <italic>Shakuntala</italic>, the story of Harishchandra and that much of the epics are not broadly ‘melodramatic’. In fact, there is little reason to believe that the ‘traditional sacred’ has even been liquidated in Indian cinema. If the gods themselves rewarded Harishchandra at the conclusion, rather than a nebulous ‘moral occult’ (In Brooks’ terms), divine intervention in Hindi cinema continues even in <italic>Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!</italic> (1994) in which application is made to the divine and the family dog becomes divinity’s agent to effect the happy resolution. While Asian cinema outside India—like that from South Korea—may benefit from the use of Western theories of melodrama, one doubts that Hindi cinema has benefited as much, which is perhaps why Vasudevan’s approach leaves us wondering.</p>
<p>The author admits at the outset that the present book actually incorporates essays written over several years and is not an independent enquiry pertinent to 2010, when the book was published. Much of the book includes writing not even devoted to melodrama—short pieces on documentaries like those of Madhushree Dutta and Anand Patwardhan, on the earlier part of Aamir Khan’s career and on Ramgopal Verma’s <italic>Satya</italic> (1998). It therefore contains parts which seem overly familiar, the chief of which are the sections devoted to Satyajit Ray and how his kind of classical realist cinema went to define an official position on film/cultural aesthetics in the Nehruvian era. One particularly interesting segment is, however, his sharp analysis of Ray’s <italic>Janaranya</italic> (1976). Vasudevan’s argument proceeds from the recognition that the classical realist art cinema posits a modern spectator with an individualised perception central to a civil society constituted by freely associating individuals and distanced from the traditional/feudal structures actually prevalent. To paraphrase him, where Ray’s classical realist storytelling structures narrativise through causal linkages and a consistent logic, <italic>Janaranya</italic> is cast as a series of independent ‘attractions’ in which documentary and dark jokes predominate. Vasudevan sees this as an admission that the classical form Ray used in <italic>Pather Panchali</italic> is not tenable any longer and since an association is made between Ray’s early narratives and the creation of the modern spectator-citizen, it is an admission of the failure of the ‘bid to conquer the real ideologically’.</p>
<p>This is the author at his sharpest but the rest of the book does not quite measure up to it. The most important drawback of <italic>The Melodramatic Public</italic> is that Ravi Vasudevan focuses too much of his attention on the Nehruvian era and its ideological preoccupations—which have also been dealt with extensively by M. Madhava Prasad and Ashish Rajadhyaksha in similar terms. When he deals with later films like those from the 1990s, the terms he employs are very different and he is unable to convince us of their implications. For instance, the association between the heroine’s father making a ‘thumbs up’ sign to the hero in <italic>DDLJ</italic> (1995) and Coca Cola taking over Thums-Up in 1995 is politically insignificant if not ludicrous. For a major enquiry published as late as 2010 to have such a slight view of cinema after 2000 is even inexcusable, especially because politics has been vastly transformed in the last decade, as has cinema. In fact, it is doubtful if melodrama—once the only form—thrives today, with films like <italic>Three Idiots</italic>, <italic>Peepli Live</italic> and <italic>Dabangg</italic> being huge successes and none of them being melodramas as we understand the term.</p>
<p>It is not that scholars writing on popular cinema are not ‘political’ because ideology is virtually the only prism through which they view culture. Their difficulty is perhaps that they are post-Marxist in their approach and the theories they invoke have little of value to add about the problems in culture today, specifically in India. Nehru’s India is perhaps safe territory because ‘interpretive communities’ like those around post-colonialism naturally flourish in it. But one wonders if film/cultural theory, being unable to deal with the truly contemporary, is not politically and ideologically ineffectual—regardless of the radical rhetoric that it is prone to employing.</p>
