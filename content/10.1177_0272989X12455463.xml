<abstract>
<p>State-transition modeling (STM) is an intuitive, flexible, and transparent approach of computer-based decision-analytic modeling, including both Markov model cohort simulation as well as individual-based (first-order Monte Carlo) microsimulation. Conceptualizing a decision problem in terms of a set of (health) states and transitions among these states, STM is one of the most widespread modeling techniques in clinical decision analysis, health technology assessment, and health-economic evaluation. STMs have been used in many different populations and diseases, and their applications range from personalized health care strategies to public health programs. Most frequently, state-transition models are used in the evaluation of risk factor interventions, screening, diagnostic procedures, treatment strategies, and disease management programs.</p>

<p>A new Good Research Practices in Modeling Task Force was constituted by the ISPOR Board of Directors in 2010, and the Society for Medical Decision Making was invited to join the effort. This paper, along with six others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X12455463">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X12455463"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X12455463"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X12455463"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X12455463"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X12455463">6</xref></sup> is part of a series commissioned by the Task Force.</p>
<p>The goal of this article is to provide consensus-based guidelines for the application of state-transition modeling (STM) in the context of health care. We structured the best practice recommendations in the following sections: choice of model type (cohort v. individual-level model), model structure, model parameters, analysis, reporting, and communication. In each of these sections, we give a brief description, address the issues that are of particular relevance to the application of STMs, give specific examples from the literature, and provide best practice recommendations for STM. These recommendations are directed both to modelers and to users of modeling results such as clinicians, clinical guideline developers, manufacturers, or policy makers.</p>
<sec id="section1-0272989X12455463">
<title>Use of State-Transition Models</title>
<p>Many clinical situations can be described in terms of the conditions that individuals can be in (“states”), how they can move among such states (“transitions”), and how likely such moves are (“transition probabilities”). In these situations, STMs are often well suited to the decision problem, as they conceptualize it in terms of a set of states and transitions among these states. Several dimensions fall within this broad category. For example, some STMs allow for interactions among groups (i.e., the transition probabilities depend on the states of other individuals), whereas others assume no interactions. Some allow transitions to occur only at specified time intervals, whereas others use a continuous state-space process. STMs can be used to simulate a closed cohort over time or a dynamic population (e.g., the US adult population). They may simulate all individuals simultaneously or one at a time.</p>
<p>We focus on two common frameworks in health care: cohort, or “Markov,” models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X12455463">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X12455463">8</xref></sup> and individual-based models, commonly known as “first-order Monte Carlo” or “microsimulation” models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0272989X12455463">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X12455463"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X12455463">11</xref></sup> These frameworks do not capture interactions, model a single (closed) cohort, and allow transitions to occur only at specified time intervals.</p>
<p>An STM should be used, rather than a simpler model with limited ability to reflect time (e.g., decision tree), if it requires time-dependent parameters (e.g., recurrence probability after cancer treatment), time to an event (e.g., disease-free survival), or repeated events (e.g., second myocardial infarction).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X12455463">12</xref></sup> Other modeling techniques are also suitable for these situations (e.g., discrete event simulation).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0272989X12455463">
<title>Key Concepts and Definitions</title>
<p>The formal elements of an STM are states, transitions, initial state vector, transition probabilities, cycle length, state values (“rewards”), logical tests performed at the beginning of each cycle to determine the transitions, and termination criteria.</p>
<sec id="section3-0272989X12455463">
<title>Model Structure</title>
<p>STMs are structured around a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive health states. A modeled individual must be in only one state in any cycle. Events that occur within a cycle can be modeled with a Markov cycle tree—a series of chance nodes representing the events. The average number of cycles that individuals reside in each state can be used in conjunction with state values (e.g., life years, health-related quality of life, cost) to estimate life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and expected costs.</p>
<p>An STM can capture many features present in the course of a disease or clinical process (e.g., disease risk over time, changing states, episodic events), although this is not the only approach that can capture these features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X12455463">13</xref></sup> The principal advantage of cohort STMs is that they are relatively simple to develop, debug, communicate, and analyze using user-friendly software, if the number of states is not too large. The primary disadvantage is the underlying assumption that transition probabilities do not depend on history— neither on past states nor time spent in the current state. This assumption (the “Markovian” property) can be very limiting for clinical applications where these aspects tend to be strong determinants of what happens next. A Markov model can handle memory by creating states that include history, but this can greatly increase the number of states, resulting in very large models that are difficult to manage (i.e., “state explosion”).</p>
<p>Individual-level STMs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X12455463">Table 1</xref>) are not limited by the Markovian property as they simulate one individual at a time. These microsimulations are evaluated using first-order Monte Carlo simulation: Whether an individual facing a certain transition probability makes this transition depends on a random number.</p>

<p>Whereas cohort models are analyzed as single cohorts progressing through the states simultaneously (which does not allow distinguishing one individual from another except by state descriptions), individual-level STMs keep track of each individual’s history (“tracker variables”). This can greatly reduce the number of states. The main disadvantages are that they are computationally intensive, often requiring simulation of millions of individuals to obtain stable values for the outcomes of interest, and they are more difficult to debug. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272989X12455463">Figure 1</xref> displays the Markov trace of a cohort simulation and the possible paths of a microsimulation.</p>

<caption><p>In a cohort simulation (a), the entire cohort is (re)distributed across states after each cycle. In an individual-level microsimulation (b), a finite number of individuals are simulated using first-order Monte Carlo microsimulation. In this simple example, all individuals start in the state “Well” and the disease is chronic (i.e., there is no regression from “Disease” to “Well”). In principle, individuals can start in different states and they can regress to states they have already been in.</p></caption>

<p>An STM must start with a decision node from which the intervention branches originate. Each branch either leads directly to one Markov node (followed by an STM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0272989X12455463">Figure 2a</xref>), or there is a decision tree leading to multiple Markov nodes per intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0272989X12455463">Figure 2b</xref>). An STM following one branch can have a different structure than one following another branch.</p>

<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Best practices</italic></p>
<p>III-1 If the decision problem can be represented with a manageable number of health states that incorporate all characteristics relevant to the decision problem, including the relevant history, a cohort simulation should be chosen because of its transparency, efficiency, ease of debugging, and ability to conduct specific value-of-information analyses. If, however, a valid representation of any aspect of the decision problem would lead to an unmanageable number of states, then an individual-level state-transition model is recommended. Validity should not be sacrificed for simplicity.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Before choosing between cohort or individual-level simulation, the characteristics of the population that must be carried through the model (i.e., state descriptors or tracker variables) must be specified. These must include all relevant states pertaining to the disease or clinical process and intervention(s), all relevant history (e.g., past states, risk factors, time in state, time since last event) that are determinants of transition probabilities (e.g., determinants of disease incidence, progression, mortality), or state values (e.g., determinants of utilities and costs). An advantage of using an individual-level STM is the ability to model individual characteristics as continuous variables and to evaluate dynamic intervention strategies—ones in which future decisions depend on current and past patient characteristics. In cohort STMs, continuous variables (e.g., blood pressure) have to be categorized; some guidance exists for determining how many states to create.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0272989X12455463">35</xref></sup> Individual-level STMs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0272989X12455463">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0272989X12455463">37</xref></sup> however, require more computation time, which may be important if probabilistic sensitivity analyses or value-of-information analyses are performed.</p>

<p><italic>Best practices</italic></p>
<p>III-2 The strategies being evaluated should be clearly defined. In particular, sequential decisions should not be modeled within the Markov cycle tree but rather be part of the specification of the alternative intervention strategies that precede the Markov tree.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interventions may be single-time (e.g., one-time vaccination or surgery), static over time (i.e., not depending on intervention outcomes or other events), or dynamic (consisting of decision rules for how to start, stop, or change interventions over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272989X12455463">38</xref></sup>). Examples of dynamic strategies are 1) the start of a preventive behavioral intervention if body mass index (BMI) increases, 2) increase of the screening interval for cervical cancer if a woman has repeatedly tested negative, 3) repetition of a diagnostic test after an equivocal result, or 4) change to another drug after first-line treatment failure.</p>
<p>This recommendation refers to standard STMs. Other methods such as Markov decision processes generalize STMs by allowing embedding of sequential decisions, and thus, multiple decisions can be made in multiple time periods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0272989X12455463">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0272989X12455463">40</xref></sup></p>

<p>The model outputs for a single cohort allow for the comparison of alternative strategies for that cohort.

If outputs are desired for a population-based starting cohort, then the model must be run multiple times, one for each stratum, and then aggregated across strata (e.g., Dewilde and Anderson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0272989X12455463">41</xref></sup>).</p>

<title>Defining States</title>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Best practices</italic></p>
<p>III-4 Specification of states and transitions should generally reflect the biological/theoretical understanding of the disease or condition being modeled.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Conceptualization of an STM should begin by identifying states that reflect the disease/health process, with transitions among the states that would be expected in the absence of intervention, as well as the interventions’ effects on these. The states should be specified as mutually exclusive (any individual can be in only one state during each cycle) and collectively exhaustive (every individual in the initial cohort must be in a state during each cycle), and they should adequately capture the benefits or harms of any interventions. These effects can characterize the state values (e.g., differences in symptoms and quality of life) or reflect changes in transition probabilities.</p>
<p>At the start of a cohort simulation, the modeled population is allocated among the states. Each state is homogeneous—every individual in that state has the same transition probabilities—implying that any characteristics that determine those probabilities must not differ within the state. If history (prior states or time spent in a current state) is important in determining transition probabilities, then the relevant states should carry that history in their definition (e.g., if risk of myocardial infarction depends on prior myocardial infarction [MI], then the states would need to include this historical element by using states such as “disease-free, no prior MI” and “disease-free, prior MI”). In an individual-level STM, these characteristics and other parameters can be heterogeneous within a state but must be tracked throughout, and transition probabilities must be defined as a function of these characteristics.</p>
<p>When there are alternatives for modeling natural history (e.g., defining states with biological but often unobservable disease measures such as spirometry in asthma or with symptomatic descriptions such as “on treatment” stages for Parkinson disease), the analyst should justify the approach used or compare alternatives in sensitivity analysis. Although it may be possible to describe natural history solely on the basis of health care utilization, this does not provide direct insight into health outcomes at the biological level, and its value is limited for most decision problems. If cause of death is an important outcome or different causes have different costs, then competing causes should be modeled in an unbiased way (e.g., probability of death modeled first, followed by a conditional distribution of cause-specific deaths).</p>
<p>Another important consideration in structuring an STM is initial immediate or short-term events. An efficient and transparent way to model such events is as a decision tree preceding the STM, unless there are justified reasons for representing them within the states. When events are modeled preceding an STM, the time spent before entering the STM should be captured appropriately by giving credit to the starting cohorts for the time elapsed (e.g., an upfront decision tree could be used to represent results and subsequent outcomes from diagnostic test strategies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0272989X12455463">29</xref></sup> or treatments with limited duration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0272989X12455463">33</xref></sup> or initial coronary interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0272989X12455463">31</xref></sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0272989X12455463">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Intervention Effects</title>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Best practices</italic></p>
<p>III-5 States should adequately capture the type of intervention (i.e., prevention, screening, diagnostics, treatment) as well as the intervention’s benefits and harms.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For models evaluating primary prevention, possible risk factor levels in the target population should be represented as predisease states or tracker variables. As current risk factors are often predictors of future ones, the state descriptions or tracker variables should capture their course and changes in sufficient detail. These models may not require as much detail postdisease as would those evaluating interventions for the disease, but they should sufficiently capture the relevant disease elements. One useful approach is to collaborate with investigators with well-developed disease-specific treatment models to derive relevant eventual outcomes (e.g., lifetime costs or survival) that can be used in the prevention model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0272989X12455463">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0272989X12455463">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>Models evaluating screening should define states reflecting the underlying disease process, especially for interval screening programs. It is not appropriate to take an empirical estimate of the probability of a positive screen from a study because this does not explicitly incorporate the underlying disease probability. For cancer screening, states should distinguish between cases detected by screening and incidental findings (e.g., through other diagnostic tests) or cases detected by symptoms. Modelers should describe how they have controlled for lead-time and length bias.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0272989X12455463">44</xref></sup> Dynamic interval screening strategies (“individualized screening”) may depend on prior screening history (e.g., some algorithms for cervical cancer screening recommend extension of the interval after repeated negative tests). As capturing screening history in the Markov states can lead to state explosion, it may be necessary to use an individual-level STM, with screening history included as tracker variables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0272989X12455463">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>In models evaluating diagnostic strategies, it is typical to represent the testing pathways and their outcomes (e.g., true positive, false positive) in a pre-STM decision tree. If multiple tests are performed in combination or sequence, and some results are prognostic factors that can change over time, their history must be incorporated in the states or implemented as tracker variables.</p>
<p>In models evaluating therapeutic strategies, the mechanism by which the treatment alters the disease course should be explicit (e.g., reduction in event risk or mortality, slowing disease progression). In addition, how harms of the intervention(s) affect prognosis should be specified. STMs should incorporate realistic assumptions about adherence over time. Long-term treatment effectiveness and costs often depend on time-varying heterogeneous patient characteristics, and many treatments are “personalized” and follow dynamic rules (e.g., dose and second-line treatments, as well as compliance and treatment success, depend on current treatment response and side effects). These dynamic characteristics should be considered in the states or tracker variables.</p>

<title>Heterogeneity</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Best practices</italic></p>
<p>III-6 States need to be homogeneous with respect to both observed and unobserved (i.e., not known by the decision maker) characteristics that affect transition probabilities.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In a cohort STM, all individuals in a given state are indistinguishable in terms of their transition probabilities. Many characteristics that affect transition probabilities (e.g., age, sex, comorbidities, disease stage) are known at the time of the decision and can be used to define the starting cohorts. These characteristics do not need to be incorporated into state definitions or tracker variables unless they are expected to change over time in a meaningful way. For example, a cohort starting with few comorbidities may develop more over time, and to capture this requires incorporating this attribute in the states. Variables that affect transition probabilities but are not known at decision time (e.g., genetic mutation, undiagnosed infection) can create “heterogeneity bias,”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0272989X12455463">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0272989X12455463">46</xref></sup> and inclusion of such variables should be considered.</p>

<title>Time Horizon</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Best practices</italic></p>
<p>III-7 The time horizon for the model should be sufficiently large to capture all health effects and costs relevant to the decision problem.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The time horizon relates to the number of cycles or duration for which the cohort is tracked. Common approaches include modeling to an age of 120 years or tracking the cohort until more than 99.9% of individuals are dead. If the intervention affects mortality, the time horizon should be lifetime to capture (quality-adjusted) life years gained from delayed deaths.</p>

<sec id="section18-0272989X12455463">
<title>Cycle Length</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Best practices</italic></p>
<p>III-8 Cycle length should be short enough to represent the frequency of clinical events and interventions.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Choice of cycle length should be based on the clinical problem, remaining life expectancy, and computational efficiency. It should allow transitions to occur consistent with the clinical problem and intervention effects (e.g., a model assessing monthly screening requires cycles no longer than 1 month). Cycle length should be short enough that an event occurs at most once per cycle. Shorter cycle lengths provide better approximations of life expectancy. If life expectancy is relatively short (e.g., with an acute disease or at older ages), then a shorter cycle length should be considered, even if the clinical problem does not warrant it. Although shorter cycles will always yield more precise estimates, the error gets very small when the number of cycles required increases.</p>

<p><italic>Best practices</italic></p>
<p>III-9 Components of state-transition models that reflect similar clinical courses should not be re-created but rather should be incorporated once and linked to that structure throughout the model.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Symmetric models ensure that the disease process is represented consistently across strategies. For example, STMs used to compare cardiac catheterization and subsequent treatment dictated by its results v. initial medical therapy should specify true underlying disease status even though it is not observed in the medical therapy strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0272989X12455463">47</xref></sup> Otherwise, errors result when conducting sensitivity analysis on the underlying probability of any particular anatomy (e.g., left main disease).</p>

<p>III-10 Transition probabilities and intervention effects should be derived from the most representative data sources for the decision problem.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ideally, transition probabilities pertaining to natural history are derived from population-based epidemiological studies, as these are most likely to be representative. Transition probabilities may be derived from the control arms of trials, recognizing that these may be less generalizable due to selection criteria for participants. If multiple sources are available, summarized data from a systematic review or meta-analysis are best for informing transition probabilities or state values. Methods assessing the quality of a body of evidence rather than quality of individual studies are available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0272989X12455463">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0272989X12455463"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0272989X12455463">50</xref></sup> In the absence of good systematic reviews, a detailed evidence table should be provided in an appendix with a description and justification of how key parameters—including the ranges used for sensitivity analyses—were derived.</p>

To avoid confusion, probabilities should never be called rates.</p>
<p>The assumed functional relationship between disease-specific and background mortality should be stated. Because an assumption of additive rates can give very different results than a multiplicative one,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0272989X12455463">52</xref></sup> the impact of this assumption should be assessed.</p>

<title>Intervention Effects</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>Best practices</italic></p>
<p>III-12 All parameters relating to the effectiveness of interventions derived from observational studies should be correctly controlled for confounding. Time-varying confounding is of particular concern in estimating intervention effects.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Efficacy derived from randomized clinical trials may have to be adjusted for compliance to reflect real-world effectiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0272989X12455463">53</xref></sup> Effectiveness derived from observational studies must be adjusted for confounding (e.g., using multivariate regression techniques or propensity scoring). Adjustment for time-varying confounding (i.e., confounders that simultaneously act as intermediate steps in the pathway between intervention and outcome) require special methods such as marginal structural analysis or g-estimation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0272989X12455463">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0272989X12455463">54</xref></sup> When results from observational studies are used in the model, causal graphs can be used to explicitly state causal assumptions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0272989X12455463">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>When extrapolating beyond a trial’s duration, reductions in all-cause mortality should not be applied directly since background mortality (from other causes) increases with age. If disease-specific mortality is not available, a relative reduction can be applied to disease-specific mortality, providing a conservative estimate of treatment benefit. Alternatively, life-table mortality could be subtracted from total mortality to estimate reduction in disease-specific mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0272989X12455463">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>For preventive and therapeutic interventions, if evidence is available for reduction in disease incidence, events or progression, and also for mortality, using both may double count. If this is a concern, the consistency of the model-generated reductions should be validated with estimates from clinical studies.</p>

To account for this, a half-cycle correction is made by assigning half of the reward in each state.

<p>III-17 The report should use nontechnical language and clear figures and tables that enhance understanding of the STM to communicate its key structural elements, assumptions, and parameters.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>STMs are often represented by two types of diagrams: a state-transition diagram, also known as a “bubble diagram,” and a Markov cycle tree (a set of probability nodes that describes the progression from one state to the next). State-transition diagrams represent states as discrete compartments (“bubbles”) and transitions as arrows between them. Although a relatively simple model with few states may be fully represented in a single diagram, complicated models consisting of multiple states cannot feasibly be represented by displaying all states and transitions. Such models are invariably cluttered, and the resultant tangle of arrows and states often impairs communication, rather than enhancing it. In such circumstances, simplified or partial diagrams are desirable. Markov cycle trees, often stylized, can display the transitions between states, as well as probabilities and transitions that are conditional upon other events or parameters.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>Presenting intermediate results can be helpful for demonstrating face validity for clinical experts, epidemiologists, and decision makers. Useful measures include incidences related to a fixed time horizon (e.g., 10-year risks), average number of events per lifetime, percent of initial cohort that experienced two or more events in their lifetime, or mean age at which the first event occurred. In addition, it can be useful to generate summary data from STMs to indicate how much time is spent in certain states (e.g., a model of stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation could report the average amount of time spent without a stroke and the average time from first stroke to death). Such measures can also be used for debugging the model or for validating model results with empirical data or for internal debugging. As STMs allow deriving the time at which particular transitions occur, the results can be represented as (modeled) probability or survival curves and directly compared with survival curves from empirical studies.</p>
