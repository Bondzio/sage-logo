<abstract>
<p>A supersonic piezohydraulic microjet flow control actuator has been developed using a 400-µm-diameter micronozzle capable of producing pulsed microjet flow over a broad frequency range from quasi-static to 1.6 kHz. Such flow control actuators are useful in providing ideal control inputs for controlling flow properties to improve aerodynamic performance, for example, reduce or eliminate flow separation and mitigate noise from propulsion systems and other aircraft components. The design of the piezohydraulic microjet is presented in combination with experimental results to quantify the internal system dynamic characteristics in comparison with the microjet flow. The microjet actuator couples a piezoelectric stack actuator and a hydraulic circuit to amplify the 20-µm stack actuator displacement to an amplitude that is necessary to throttle flow through the 400-µm-diameter micronozzle. Unsteady pressure measurements at the microjet exit are correlated with the piezoelectric stack actuator displacement and voltage input to provide comparisons between the internal electromechanical actuation and external pulsed flow behavior. Phase-conditioned micro-Schlieren imagery is also utilized to quantify the flow field. The results illustrate broadband supersonic pulsed microjet actuation frequencies that approach 1 kHz: frequencies that are much higher than currently achieved with broadband actuators with this control authority.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The ability to actively control high-speed aerodynamic flow provides many challenges and opportunities to rectify adverse flow behavior, such as separation that occurs on the lifting and other surfaces of high-performance aircraft. Recent research in this area has focused on various active and passive control methods to manipulate flow fields and suppress noise to increase aircraft performance and maneuverability. Nonpassive alterations to the boundary layer flow of structures such as airfoils, compressor blades, or cavity flows have created unique opportunities to improve aerodynamic performance dependent upon the surrounding environmental conditions or the oscillatory nature of mechanical devices like rotor blades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1045389X12457833">Greenblatt and Wygnanski, 2000</xref>). To enhance the effects of boundary layer control, the need for broadband actuation is critical to achieve robustness and enhanced agility over a broader operating regime. The combination of smart materials exhibiting high-frequency response characteristics and modern microjet applications provides a viable alternative to address this active flow control challenge.</p>
<p>During the past couple of decades, research on boundary layer flow control has increased significantly in the area of active flow control relative to passive methods. Active control of boundary layer flow has predominantly focused on steady and unsteady methods that mitigate undesirable flow conditions. Active methods that use an external energy source to alter the flow can be categorized into steady mass flow, pulsed mass flow, or zero net mass flow systems. Steady mass flow and pulsed mass flow systems are associated with a nonzero mass addition to the boundary layer (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045389X12457833">Cattafesta et al., 2003</xref>). These systems are characteristic of requiring a reservoir pressure source to supply the energy input into the flow for manipulation of the inherent behavior of shear or boundary layer flow. Steady flow systems, such as supersonic steady flow microjets, have been experimentally shown to reduce noise and interrupt flow structures that result in adverse affects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X12457833">Alvi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1045389X12457833">Henderson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045389X12457833">Kumar et al., 2009</xref>). Zero net mass flow systems, such as synthetic jets and “SparkJet” systems, produce no net mass flow while maintaining a net momentum flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1045389X12457833">Glezer and Amitay, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1045389X12457833">Grossman et al., 2004</xref>). Pulsed flow systems have received an increase in attention in recent years due to the potential opportunities for substantial gains in performance by adding time-varying momentum to the flow while simultaneously reducing the net mass flux.</p>
<p>Despite the argument that active flow control is superior to passive methods such as vortex generators or riblets, active flow control designs vary greatly in their performance attributes. The question often arises, which means of active flow control is preferred: steady or unsteady pulsed flow? When the attributes of power consumption and, in some situations, system complexity are investigated, unsteady flow is often concluded to be superior to constant mass-injection flow schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1045389X12457833">Williams and MacMynowski, 2009</xref>). Active systems can further be grouped with either open- or closed-loop control. An open-loop control scheme inherently requires no feedback signal compared to closed-loop control, which typically depends on sensor processing and advanced aeroacoustic or fluid-structure control algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045389X12457833">Cattafesta et al., 2003</xref>). The combination of closed-loop control and active pulsed flow presents opportunities to vary the net mass and momentum added to the overall system along with reducing the power required for system operation. Known issues of pulsed flow actuators have included limited actuation forces resulting in reduced control authority and bandwidth due to power limitations and a lack of knowledge of multiscale flow instabilities. The characteristics of pulsed flow, despite complexity, are promising for increasing system efficiency by reducing mass flux while simultaneously enhancing their control efficacy, for example, by reducing undesirable boundary layer separation.</p>
<p>The success of pulsed flow actuators depends mainly on their pulsing frequency range, momentum addition into the environment, and overall system size and efficiency versus complexity. Broad bandwidth potentially allows for a reduction in power and a greater level of adaptability to various applications and flows. It has been shown that high momentum input with supersonic microjets proves to be more effective than low momentum addition, especially when ambient flow velocities are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X12457833">Alvi et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1045389X12457833">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045389X12457833">Kumar et al., 2009</xref>). Microjets are adept at high momentum addition due to their small diameter when coupled with large momentum flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1045389X12457833">Solomon et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The robustness of microactuator designs relies on advances in the actuator dynamics over a broad range of ambient conditions accompanied with a high cyclic lifespan. Piezoelectric materials are a suitable candidate to aid in achieving such performance attributes. When an electric field is applied to a piezoelectric material, mechanical strain is generated, and conversely, stress induces a charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1045389X12457833">Jaffe et al., 1971</xref>). The advantageous attributes of piezoceramics include high forces and large bandwidth in a compact actuator. However, the field-induced strain of these ceramic stacks is on the order of about 0.1%. Addressing the issue of increasing actuator displacement while maintaining a small size and high displacement is important for active flow control of aerospace structures.</p>
<sec id="section2-1045389X12457833">
<title>Smart material integration</title>
<p>The concept of utilizing smart materials such as piezoelectric actuators for flow control has been considered in a number of adaptive structure designs. Piezoelectric-based diaphragms, flaps, cantilevered beams, and so on have been used for low momentum control of cavity flows and boundary layer shear flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1045389X12457833">Cattafesta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1045389X12457833">Seifert et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1045389X12457833">Wiltse and Glezer, 1993</xref>). However, combining the closed-loop tunability of a piezohydraulic stack actuator with the concepts of steady mass flow microjets provides larger bandwidth and higher force capabilities. The actuator design presented here integrates these two systems together to produce a broadband pulsed microjet flow control actuator. The design integrates a 400-µm-diameter microjet with a piezoceramic stack coupled with a hydraulic circuit to create a high-frequency control valve. The stack actuator’s 20-µm maximum displacement is amplified using a hydraulic circuit to deform a dual-rubber diaphragm assembly. The diaphragm adjacent to the microjet throttles the flow through the 400-µm sonic nozzle. The design characteristics, experimental setup, and experimental results including micro-Schlieren flow imagery and exiting flow dynamic pressure measurements of the actuator are presented. This extends prior work summarized in a previous design study of the quasi-static piezohydraulic actuation performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045389X12457833">Oates and Liu, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The hydraulic amplification of a piezoelectric stack is important to the successful performance of the relatively compact piezohydraulic actuator. Previous research with smart material hydraulic actuators has focused on the concept of cyclic or pulsing devices to reduce space and power. Similar piezoelectric hydraulic actuators have provided robust performance, either targeting high-frequency pumping or high-displacement amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045389X12457833">Sirohi and Chopra, 2003</xref>). Maximum actuation frequencies of these devices have ranged from quasi-static up to 1 kHz, depending on design targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1045389X12457833">Chaudhuri and Wereley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1045389X12457833">Mauck and Lynch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1045389X12457833">Sirohi and Chopra, 2003</xref>). High pumping frequencies (&gt;1 kHz) have been difficult to achieve due to inertial effects and viscous losses in the hydraulic fluid, which lead to unsteady fluid dynamic behavior and limit bandwidth. These active material hydraulic actuators have primarily focused on addressing the need to produce a large stroke with high force while maintaining a compact system design that converts the motion of the actuator into unidirectional motion of the hydraulic fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1045389X12457833">Chaudhuri et al., 2009</xref>). In comparison to the current study, these hydraulic actuators have not been directly coupled with an aerodynamic flow control device to explore broadband actuator concepts that can be used for flow separation control or noise reduction.</p>
<p>The research discussed here is an expansion of the development of a piezohydraulic actuator design summarized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045389X12457833">Oates and Liu (2009)</xref>. This study concentrated on quasi-static performance characterization and a system dynamic model to validate electrofluidmechanical dynamic performance. At the maximum input voltage of 1000 V, amplification of approximately 60 times was measured. The displacement of the rubber diaphragm, in excess of 1 mm, was then utilized to throttle the microjet flow. Preliminary model predictions suggested that pulsed microjet frequencies could occur up to 800 Hz with little attenuation, but experimental validation was not conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045389X12457833">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). These broadband model predictions are quantified experimentally in this analysis.</p>
<p>The design of the piezohydraulic actuator is presented in section “Actuator design” and followed by the experimental setup and results in sections “Experimental setup” and “Experimental results,” respectively. This extends prior quasi-static displacement characterizations to broadband internal dynamic characterization and simultaneous correlations with external microjet flow. A set of diagnostic tools are implemented to quantify both unsteady pressure and supersonic pulsed flow as a function of the input electric field to the stack actuator. The experimental results are then discussed in section “Concluding remarks.”</p>

<title>Piezohydraulic actuator</title>
<p>The piezohydraulic actuator design consists of six main components: a piezoceramic stack actuator, piston, two rubber diaphragms enclosing hydraulic fluid, a cylindrical aluminum housing, and a microjet. The piezoceramic stack actuator (Kinetic Ceramics) that is positioned inside the aluminum housing is cylindrical in shape with a length of 22 mm and a diameter of 19 mm. A nominal free stack actuator displacement of ~20 µm is achieved at 1 kV. Under fixed displacement boundary conditions, the stack is expected to generate 10 kN based on published data (Kinetic Ceramics). A dual-diaphragm design, using a large rubber gasket next to the piston and a small rubber gasket at the top of the converging nozzle, encloses silicone hydraulic fluid (Dow Corning 200), which has a viscosity of 6.5 × 10<sup>–7</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s. In all subsequent discussion, we denote the smaller diaphragm at the top of the converging nozzle as the “top diaphragm” and the larger diaphragm in contact with the piston as the “bottom diaphragm.” The design of this actuator is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12457833">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Hydraulic amplification is utilized to increase the displacement of the diaphragm that throttles the microjet. The amplification is achieved using a converging nozzle design, shown in the top portion of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12457833">Figure 1</xref> and the detailed view in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12457833">Figure 2</xref>. By applying an electric field to the stack actuator, the piston connected to the stack forces the hydraulic fluid into the cylindrical head to deform the top rubber diaphragm. Fluid is forced through the chamber above the piston into the smaller cylindrical channel. The amount of deformation in the stack actuator and the top rubber diaphragm is dependent upon the bias pressure applied to the hydraulic fluid, the voltage supplied to the piezoelectric stack actuator, and the initial piston location relative to the initial location of the smaller rubber diaphragm. The initial position of the piston influences the effective capacitance of the fluid in the cylinder head and, subsequently, fluid compressibility and bandwidth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1045389X12457833">Oates and Lynch, 2001</xref>). Reducing the fluid volume by raising the piston location not only increases the effective stiffness but also increase squeeze film damping.</p>

<p>Hydraulic amplification of 67 times has been achieved between the stack actuator and the top rubber diaphragm located at the top of the actuator housing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045389X12457833">Oates and Liu, 2009</xref>). This top rubber diaphragm has a thickness of 0.5 mm. The amplification was based on a measured 18-µm stack actuator displacement versus a 1.2-mm displacement from the top rubber diaphragm for a voltage input of 800 V. The exact displacement necessary to open and close the microjet orifice is difficult to measure. Based on the geometry shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12457833">Figure 2</xref>, the top diaphragm must move a minimal distance of 0.4 mm within the triangular region of the microjet orifice shown in the “Microjet Exit View” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1045389X12457833">Figure 2</xref>. This microjet diameter was chosen to provide a factor of safety of 3 based on prior measurements of the top diaphragm displacement given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045389X12457833">Oates and Liu (2009)</xref>.</p>

<title>Microjet interface</title>
<p>By coupling a 400-µm-diameter microjet with the deforming rubber diaphragms, an active broadband pulsed microjet is created. The diameter of the microjet was chosen to be comparable with other microjet experiments (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1045389X12457833">Alvi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1045389X12457833">Kumar et al., 2009</xref>). The top rubber diaphragm, used to seal the hydraulic fluid at the interface of the converging channel, is fixed between the actuator housing and a microjet made of acrylic. The rubber diaphragm deforms into the flow path whenever voltage is applied to the piezoelectric stack actuator causing an obstruction to the flow. Whenever a sinusoidal input voltage is supplied, the microjet flow varies as a sinusoidal pressure or flow. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1045389X12457833">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the microjet interface including the junction between the hydraulic actuator housing and the acrylic microjet as well as the interaction between the rubber diaphragm and microjet airflow.</p>

The microjet dynamic performance has only been studied in preliminary tests by measuring the exiting pressure response of the microjet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045389X12457833">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). The actuator in this study experimentally showed pulse flow up to approximately 600 Hz before attenuation begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045389X12457833">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). Here, the pressure response of the exiting flow is rigorously quantified and compared with micro-Schlieren photography and in situ piezoelectric strain data to illustrate the various phases of the pulsed flow at frequencies ranging between 1 Hz and 1.6 kHz.</p>

<title>Hardware and setup</title>
<p>The assembly of the hydraulic actuator system consists of a hydraulic circuit and the hydraulic actuator illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1045389X12457833">Figure 1</xref>. The hydraulic circuit acts as a means to charge the hydraulic actuator with silicone fluid, purge air from the system, and control the bias pressure and the preload that is simultaneously applied to the rubber diaphragm and piezoelectric stack actuator. A schematic of the hydraulic system is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1045389X12457833">Figure 4</xref>. A nitrogen tank is used as the bias pressure source of the hydraulic circuit. An accumulator is used to apply a constant compressive preload to the piezohydraulic actuator during testing. A digital pressure gauge was placed in-line after the accumulator to monitor bias pressure during testing. A check valve is used to prevent hydraulic fluid from flowing back into the accumulator. A shutoff valve is connected after the check valve to allow for pressure to be bled off from the hydraulic actuator without affecting the pressure maintained in the accumulator. Air is bled from the system via a bleed valve within the cylinder head. To bleed air from the system, the accumulator is charged with pressure while the shutoff valve is open and the bleed valve is slowly unscrewed. This relieves pressure from the system and allows air to be evacuated. Any entrained air inside the hydraulic circuit between the check valve and the hydraulic actuator can significantly reduce the amount of hydraulic amplification.</p>

<p>The overall configuration of the test equipment used for the input source and signal routing is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12457833">Figure 5</xref>. The piezoelectric stack actuator is powered by a PiezoMechanik 1000 V/7 A switching power supply to amplify the input voltage signal. The input signal was generated using a dSpace data acquisition system (DS1005 DSP board), controlled by MATLAB and Simulink. The input signal to the PiezoMechanik amplifier ranged from 0 to 5 V. The amplifier increased the voltage by a gain of 200 to achieve a signal ranging from 0 to 1000 V. The amplified signal was monitored with a voltage divider to quantify output voltage applied directly to the stack actuator. During operation, dSpace was used to collect strain of the stack actuator via an Omega strain gauge (SGD-10/350-LY11) and the unsteady pressure measurements of the exiting flow from the microjet interface using a Kulite pressure transducer. The dynamic response of the strain gauge was compared to a Lion Precision C1-A capacitor probe to measure displacement over the test range of input frequencies under zero hydraulic pressure loading. In these experiments, the stack actuator was removed from the piezohydraulic system shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1045389X12457833">Figure 5</xref>. The stack actuator was preloaded between two aluminum plates using nylon bolts to mitigate large spring constant loads on the stack. Four nylon bolts were positioned on the corners of the aluminum plate and then bolted together such that the piezoelectric stack actuator was preloaded in between the two aluminum plates. The actuator displacement was then measured by externally clamping the bottom aluminum plate and positioning the capacitor probe on the top aluminum plate to measure its displacement. This allowed direct comparisons between the strain gauge and capacitor probe measurement. A Vishay 2310B signal conditioning amplifier was used for filtering and amplifying the signal from the Omega strain gauge. The dSpace system was also used to monitor the reservoir pressure using an Omega PX215-100AI pressure transducer. This pressure source supplied flow to the microjet. A 0- to 100-psig range Kulite pressure transducer (model number: XCQ-062-100G) with a sensitivity of 1.002 mV/psig was used to measure dynamic microjet pressure. Signal amplification of the probe was done using a Hendrick and Assoc. Mx9000 differential amplifier and filter.</p>

<p>Ultraminiature high-frequency pressure transducers used for monitoring unsteady pressure typically have a 1.6 mm diameter, and the use of such a sensor to measure unsteady pressures at the exit of 400-µm microjet will result in a large measurement uncertainty. To counter this problem, an ultraminiature pressure probe was designed by modifying a 100-psig Kulite pressure transducer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1045389X12457833">Figure 6(b)</xref>). A brass nozzle with an internal diameter of 400 µm was fitted at the face of the transducer, which results in a well-known tube and cavity arrangement. The flat dynamic response of the base Kulite sensor is about 70 kHz, but the dead air volume results in significant reduction in the dynamic response of the system. The frequency response of such a system can be estimated as</p>

<p>The unsteady pressure measurements using the Kulite probe were obtained along the microjet centerline, 0.25 mm downstream of the micronozzle exit. An illustration of this experimental setup is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1045389X12457833">Figure 7</xref>, where the Kulite probe was positioned parallel to the flow to measure total pressure. This location was selected based on the centerline survey conducted using a standard pitot probe, which measures the steady/time-averaged pitot pressure. The results of the jet centerline surveys using the steady pitot probe, which has an outer diameter of 200 µm, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1045389X12457833">Figure 8</xref>. Here, the microjet is operating at a reservoir pressure of 30 psig. As seen here, the 0.25 mm location is near the end of the linear (almost flat) region of the pressure profile, beyond which it decays rapidly due to the shock structure present in the underexpanded microjet corresponding to this flow condition. Hence, placing the Kulite probe at this location minimized any interaction with the shock structure (with respect to the mean microjet flow field) while being sufficiently far away so as not to cause any obstruction at the micronozzle exit. All unsteady, Kulite probe measurements were obtained with the reservoir pressure of 30 psig.</p>

<p>The unsteady pressure measurements were compared to micro-Schlieren flow visualizations at the exit of the microjet as given in section “Actuator design.” These experiments were conducted to provide information on the harmonic behavior of the jet flow structure in the absence of the pressure probes. This type of optical system was used to quantify the flow structures associated with the exiting supersonic flow field. With a microjet diameter of 400 µm, a spatial resolution on the order of tens of micrometer is required. To achieve this resolution, the micro-Schlieren setup included a high-magnification in-line achromatic lens-based optics coupled with a knife edge and a Kodak Megaplus™ 1.4 camera with a resolution of 1008 × 1018 pixels. A knife edge was selected for the setup compared to a gradient filter for better sensitivity. An IDT light-emitting diode (LED) connected in-line with a Stanford model DG535 delay/pulse generator provided a strobing light source. The final magnification of the optical setup was in the range of 4–5×. The micro-Schlieren optical setup including the hydraulic actuator is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1045389X12457833">Figure 10</xref>. Note that the pressure probe in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1045389X12457833">Figure 7</xref> was removed during these visualizations to avoid impinging flow fields during pulsed flow actuation.</p>

<title>Experimental methods</title>
<p>All experiments were conducted at the Advanced Aero-Propulsion Laboratory (AAPL) at Florida State University. Bench-top tests were arranged on an optical table to facilitate micropositioning and to reduce the effect of external vibrations. Flow characterization measurements were taken at 1 Hz as a baseline input voltage frequency to the piezoelectric stack actuator and at 100-Hz increments up to 1.6 kHz. Parameters such as the reservoir pressure supplied to the microjet and the output signal high-pass filtering were kept constant throughout the test series. The bias pressure supplied to the accumulator ranged from 45 to 55 psig. This range was selected to optimize the microjet performance. For example, larger bias pressure was required to sufficiently throttle the flow as the microjet air pressure increased. Furthermore, the accumulator pressure was varied in part due to the biased voltage applied to the piezoelectric stack, which affected the nominal position of the top diaphragm.</p>
<p>Data collected with dSpace included the exit flow dynamic unsteady pressure, input reservoir pressure for the microjet, and the piezoelectric stack actuator strain. These data were collected simultaneously with the input voltage and amplified voltage signal via a voltage divider. When collecting micro-Schlieren images, dSpace was also used to provide a control step input for the camera frequency and LED light source. IDT’s proVision™ software was used on a separate computer to collect images from the Kodak Megaplus camera. A schematic of the drive electronics and signal routing is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1045389X12457833">Figure 11</xref> for the pulsed flow pressure response characterization and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1045389X12457833">Figure 12</xref> for micro-Schlieren flow imagery.</p>

<p>The piezoelectric stack actuator was driven using a switching power amplifier that requires adjusting the input voltage range to avoid nonlinearities due to saturation in the output signal for amplified voltages below 60 V. Before tests with the piezoelectric stack were conducted, the strain gauge amplifier was balanced without any electrical load to the stack. This was defined as the zero reference strain for comparison to the small bias voltage in the switching power amplifier. The sinusoidal input signal to the stack was biased to approximately 80 V to reduce the possibility of saturation at the lower peak of the sine wave to avoid actuator fatigue. The voltage applied from the power amplifier to the piezoelectric stack actuator was also monitored using a voltage divider that reduces the voltage signal by 200 times.</p>
<p>Performance of the piezohydraulic actuator was conducted using two procedures. For exit flow imagery, the micro-Schlieren system was used for tuning the actuator for performance during image capture while adjusting the bias pressure to the accumulator to optimize the throttling effect of the rubber diaphragm and microjet interface. The shock shell sizes coupled with the input pressure and microjet geometry were used to calculate and check the exit flow speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1045389X12457833">Phalnikar et al., 2008</xref>). In comparison to tests utilizing the dynamic pressure probe, the micro-Schlieren testing required this method of tuning to maintain and maximize performance. No pressure data were collected during image capture. During microjet flow characterization, the dynamic probe was used along with the micropositioning stages to constrain the probe’s position at a fixed distance away from the jet exit; due to blockage of the optical path by the pressure probe, no visualizations were recorded during the probe surveys.</p>
<p>Phase-conditioned images were acquired at 25 different phases of one pulsed jet period/cycle. The driving frequency was divided to yield a frequency close to the camera frame rate of 25 Hz, which was then used to conditionally trigger the camera. The first or initial phase was taken at an arbitrary point in the cycle; for subsequent phases, a delay was added equal to 1/24 of the period, that is, a phase delay of approximately 15°. This yields 25 phase-conditioned images for each cycle of the pulsed microjet. Images at each phase were averaged to provide time-resolved (phase-conditioned) phase-averaged pulsed flow visualization.</p>
<p>Schlieren images were averaged using a standard matrix averaging technique, in which we load all the images on a MATLAB worksheet, generate a matrix, and then average each pixel by the number of images loaded. In this study, we did not use any filtering or image enhancement technique to avoid any loss in data.</p>

<title>Experimental results</title>
<p>The hydraulic actuator was tested at frequencies ranging from quasi-static to 1.6 kHz to quantify changes in pulsed flow characteristics. These frequencies were chosen based on the previous studies that demonstrated attenuation in performance near 800 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1045389X12457833">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). An input pressure of 30 psig was used for all dynamic pressure measurements. For micro-Schlieren visualizations, the images were collected at 1, 100, 400, and 800 Hz. These frequencies were selected since they permit the use of a constant phase collection of images at a sample frequency of 25 Hz for micro-Schlieren testing. Two reservoir pressures of 30 and 40 psig were selected for image capture. Only images collected for the 40-psig tests are presented as they were of a superior quality. At steady flow operation of the microjet (i.e. no pulsing), the output flow was found to be supersonic at both reservoir pressures, as indicated by the formation of shock shells.</p>

<title>Microjet pressure response</title>
<p>In situ characterization of the piezoelectric stack was performed by measuring strain during pulsed flow tests. During these experiments, the dynamic pressure is measured at the nozzle exit simultaneously with the strain of the piezoelectric stack actuator using the strain gauge. In addition, the voltage input to the power supply and the voltage applied to the stack actuator were measured to quantify differences in phase and gain for critical components in the piezohydraulic system. The stack displacement, based on strain data for 1, 100, and 400 Hz, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1045389X12457833">Figure 13</xref>. The maximum amplitude of the displacement at each frequency (up to 1.6 kHz) is listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1045389X12457833">Table 1</xref>. An increase in maximum amplitude recorded from the strain gauge is noticed up to 1.4 kHz during pulsed flow testing. This trend was also noticed during testing of the piezoelectric stack prior to inserting the stack actuator inside the hydraulic actuator. In comparison to in situ strain gauge measurements, the strain gauge measurements were compared to a noncontact capacitor probe for frequencies up to 1.6 kHz (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1045389X12457833">Table 1</xref>). As the input sinusoidal frequency for the piezoelectric stack increases, the uncertainty associated with the strain gauge increases. The results suggest that viscoelastic effects may influence the strain gauge measurements since this gauge is mounted outside of the piezoelectric stack’s epoxy layer. The capacitor probe data are expected to be more accurate, although these measurements could not be taken during hydraulic actuation. The Lion Precision capacitor probe (model CPL 290, probe range of 50–1250 µm) used in the experiments has a sensitivity of 10 V/mm and a resolution of 0.003%. As previously noted, the actuator was mounted between aluminum plates constrained by four nylon bolts to provide a sufficient preload.</p>

<p>Unsteady pressure was measured with the Kulite dynamic probe at a reservoir pressure of 30 psig to the microjet. The probe was positioned 0.25 mm away from the microjet exit. As discussed earlier, at this distance, the open-jet pressure was recorded with a standard 200-µm pitot probe to be ~25 psig. This was to verify that the data collected with the dynamic probe at the same position also gave the correct steady pressure (25 psig). For each set of data, pulsed flow was first measured at 1 Hz as the baseline frequency. Data were then collected for the different input frequencies, maintaining the same bias hydraulic pressure for most frequencies. For mid-range frequencies between 400 and 700 Hz, the bias pressure was increased from 45 to 51 psig to mitigate reductions in pulsed flow performance observed at these frequencies.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1045389X12457833">Table 2</xref> lists the maximum, minimum, and peak-to-peak pressures for the microjet exit flow. The peak-to-peak pressure response is plotted versus frequency in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1045389X12457833">Figure 14</xref>. It is shown that there is minimal reduction in overall performance (6.4% reduction) for frequencies up to 400 Hz. For frequencies greater than 400 Hz, a linear decay in performance is observed as the frequency increases. For example, there was a 28.5% reduction in peak pressure changes from 500 to 1000 Hz. The higher harmonics produced by the actuator are characterized by plotting the power spectral density of the pressure response at the microjet exit. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1045389X12457833">Figure 15</xref> shows the power spectral density for the cases of a 100 and 1000 Hz input voltage to the stack actuator. The base scale for the decibel levels is 20 µPa. These two frequencies are arbitrarily selected to illustrate higher harmonic behavior due to the internal nonlinearities of the actuator. Recall in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-1045389X12457833">Figure 13</xref> that the piezoelectric stack actuator exhibits rate-dependent hysteresis with increasing hysteresis at higher frequencies. This internal behavior and fluid losses and deformation of the top and bottom diaphragms affect the higher-order pulsed pressure harmonics. At the first harmonic, approximately a 5-dB attenuation is measured between the 100- and 1000-Hz input signals.</p>

Six different phases of the microjet flow cycle are shown. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1045389X12457833">Figure 16</xref>, the flow becomes supersonic for a 100-Hz input signal as the diaphragm opens, while subsonic at other time instances through a full cycle, thus creating highly unsteady momentum. As the micronozzle is a purely converging nozzle, often referred to as a sonic nozzle, the maximum Mach number at the exit is 1, where the fluid velocity is equal to the sonic velocity. Hence, the jet is underexpanded outside the nozzle where the supply pressure corresponds to a fully expanded jet Mach number of approximately 1.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1045389X12457833">John and Keith, 2006</xref>). This Mach number calculation is an approximation based on the total pressure measured at this location. The velocity of such an underexpanded jet is usually expressed as a fully expanded jet velocity that can be calculated from the nozzle pressure to ambient pressure ratio. This ratio is approximately 3.8, which gives an ideal Mach number of 1.5 according to standard isentropic flow tables for compressible flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1045389X12457833">John and Keith, 2006</xref>). Hence, the bounds on the true Mach number are between 1 and 1.5. Similar behavior was observed at 800 Hz where the jet is also underexpanded, which is evident from the presence of shock cells in the flow. This shows the capability of the actuator for generating unsteady supersonic jets at a relatively high pulsing frequency despite reductions in exit pressure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-1045389X12457833">Figure 14</xref>).</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>The bandwidth of a piezoelectric hydraulic actuator has been characterized to understand microjet flow dynamics over a relatively broad frequency range. Through the use of hydraulic amplification, a 22-mm-long piezoelectric stack actuator was used to control the flow of a 400-µm-diameter microjet. Pulsed flow was characterized up to 1.6 kHz where minimal attenuation of the microjet exit pressure was observed up to 400 Hz. The attenuation relative to 1 Hz actuation increased to approximately 40% and 60% in peak-to-peak pressure at 1 and 1.6 kHz, respectively. In comparison to internal actuator dynamics, the stack actuator displacement exhibited slight increases in displacement up to approximately 1.0 kHz based on in situ strain measurements and external capacitor probe measurements, which suggest that the bandwidth of the actuator is primarily associated with the hydraulic fluid dynamics, diaphragm deformation rates, or airflow through the microjet. Similar conclusions for piezoelectric hydraulic actuators have been made based on computational fluid dynamics and theoretical estimates of hydraulic flow that show that the piezoelectric blocked forces approach the fluid dynamic pressure losses at frequencies near and above ~700 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1045389X12457833">John et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A specially designed pressure probe using an ultraminiature high-response pressure transducer was used to measure the dynamic response of the piezoelectric actuator. The reduced diameter probe resulted in improved measurement accuracy of the pressures at microjet exit. This was because the microjet diameter (400 µm) was significantly smaller than the original probe diameter (1.6 mm), which leads to nonrepeatable pressure measurements since the pressure is not uniformly applied to the probe. This is because the internal diaphragm in the pressure transducer contains several small holes that lead to uncertainty unless the pressure is applied uniformly using the reduced diameter probe (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1045389X12457833">Figure 6</xref>). The steady pressure measurements were also compared with an even smaller diameter (200 µm) pitot probe. Variations in pressure as a function of distance from the microjet exit were also quantified. Low-frequency measurements illustrated the same 25 psig pressure at 0.25 mm relative to steady flow pressure data. This modification of the pressure probe provides a quantitative assessment of the pressure oscillation and bandwidth exhibited by the actuator.</p>
<p>The pressure measurements were correlated with micro-Schlieren flow visualization measurements, which illustrated supersonic flow up to at least 800 Hz. Phase-locked images illustrated that shock cells were present at 100 and 400 Hz with some attenuation occurring 800 Hz as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-1045389X12457833">Figures 16</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-1045389X12457833">17</xref>. The results are promising for further quantitative measurements using techniques such as particle image velocimetry to understand interactions between the microjet in ambient and external flows over different aerodynamic control surfaces.</p>
<p>The results are promising for establishing ideal pulsed flow interactions with a main flow field to understand how the microjet amplitude, frequency, and phase affect the efficacy of flow control and its impact on flow properties, acoustics, and overall aeroacoustic performance. Future opportunities focused on establishing these interactions under ambient conditions and under external flow fields are desired. Particle image velocimetry experiments should be conducted to obtain quantified performance metrics. In addition, rate-dependent nonlinearities of the ferroelectric material may affect microjet interactions with the external flow field. Since these effects are amplified through the hydraulic circuit, large nonlinear and hysteretic pressure versus electric field responses can occur as discussed in prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1045389X12457833">Oates and Liu, 2009</xref>). This introduces higher-order harmonics that contribute to the pressure data plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-1045389X12457833">Figure 15</xref>. Reductions of such effects may be accomplished using lower hysteresis ferroelectric relaxor materials or feedback control algorithms. In particular, higher harmonic or narrowband control may provide advantages due to its simplicity and robustness without strong knowledge of the nonlinear and multiphysical dynamic behaviors.</p>
