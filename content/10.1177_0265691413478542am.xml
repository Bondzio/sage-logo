<p>Michael Seidman has forged a reputation as an iconoclastic social historian of the Spanish Civil War. In 1997, for instance, in the journal <italic>Historia Social</italic> (published in Spain), he advocated the study of areas in the Civil War where nothing ever happened (on the argument that these sectors made it possible for events to transpire in other places). Studying issues such as desertion on his chosen quiet fronts, the US-based historian argued that soldiers on both sides of the conflict showed low levels of ideological commitment and demonstrated a taste for the kind of consumerist individualism which became associated with the second half of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>In his latest book, Seidman once again cocks a snook at convention. This time he seeks to explain why the rebels and insurgents who gathered around General Franco won the Civil War. Turning his back on those scholars who prioritize the advantage given to Franco by German and Italian intervention, the idiosyncratic historian argues that we should devote our attention to social and economic history and specifically the role of food, animals and the organization of the economy.</p>
<p>The approach leads Seidman down some unusual tracks. On page 96, by way of illustration, he observes that ‘[m]ules played perhaps the least celebrated but most critical role in the Spanish civil war’ before proceeding to argue that pack animals were as decisive as ‘fascist weapons’ (97). He goes on to hew his case from a profitable seam of examples of mules lugging ammunition, food and the injured. Crucially, for the University of North Carolina scholar, the insurgents husbanded their animals much more successfully than their government opponents. By carefully winning over vets and farmers the Francoists boosted livestock numbers in their zone by 20 per cent during the conflict. Those on the government side, by contrast, developed the pernicious habit of turning their donkeys into sausages.</p>
<p>Seidman also credits the Francoists with building a stable currency and raising funds through a judicious array of taxes. Indeed the funds brought in by the fiscal system ‘counterbalanced their enemies’ advantage in gold reserves’ (125). Such unglamorous facts, often drawn from his avid consumption of newspapers, give Seidman the confidence to claim that ‘[f]ewer Nationalist [sic] desertions can be tied to better training, logistics, pay and the likelihood of victory as the war endured’ (237).</p>
<p>Seidman also credits the Francoists with forestalling desertions by carefully nurturing the morale of their supporters. He singles out a network of female pen pals, in particular, for providing soldiers with a great sense of solace. Generous quantities of tobacco, the promotion of old religious fiestas and ample opportunities to devour Hollywood movies all helped keep up the spirits of Franco’s men.</p>
<p>Seidman’s undoubted instinct for novelty, however, could be wisely tempered by some more sober judgements. In the case of the government side, for instance, it is in fact tricky to divorce food supplies from international politics. The blockade of the port of Bilbao, for a long time aided and abetted by the British, and the sinking of supply ships heading for government ports by Italian submarines, provide just two examples. Similarly, with all Seidman’s stress on mules it would have been helpful to have informed the reader that Texaco and Shell stocked the Francoists with 3,500,000 tonnes of oil, and on credit. With the payment delayed, as Seidman does tell us, the Francoists could call on the foreign reserves to snap up 12,000 Ford, Studebaker and General Motors lorries. The argument on morale also needs to take into account just why the government forces were able to improve the efficiency of their fighting machine over the course of the war, despite all the international obstacles they faced.</p>
<p>Seidman’s use of language is also on occasion open to question. For instance he conflates his notion of counter-revolution with the fight against the Spanish government. But the Socialist, Republican and even Communist leaders who sat at the heart of this government were counter-revolutionaries too and toiled hard to defeat the revolution unleashed in their territory by the coup launched by Mola, Franco and other generals in July 1936. Seidman also seeks to draw out comparisons with other ‘counter-revolutions’, such as the civil wars in China and Russia. But this is done almost in passing and serves principally as a distraction from the wealth of information that he offers up on the Spanish case.</p>
<p>Overall, readers eager for rich detail on the organization of the Francoist war effort will find many nuggets in this book. But they would do well to not be carried too far away by the author’s enthusiasm.</p>
