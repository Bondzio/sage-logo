<abstract>
<p>Psychological research documents the extent to which physical appearance comparisons are associated with negative emotional experiences, but researchers typically study physical appearance comparisons isolated from other comparison experiences. As part of a signal-contingent experience sampling design, 87 female undergraduate students recorded whether they had made any comparison about any topic after they received a text message at three randomly chosen times a day for 7 days. In contrast to other comparisons, physical appearance comparisons were more likely to be upward contrasts to dissimilar targets associated with increased envy, less inspiration, less pride, and less anxiety. Women who reported more demographically similar close friends reported more envy following physical appearance comparisons in contrast to women who reported more demographically diverse close friends. Women who associated their body with a better quality of life reported more inspiration and less envy following physical appearance comparisons. More demographically diverse close friends and a more positive body image may protect women from the negative emotional consequences associated with physical appearance comparisons. These data indicate that the positive benefits for interpersonal judgments associated with close cross-group friends extend to intrapersonal reactions to physical appearance comparisons.</p>

<p>Traditional formulations of social comparison theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0361684312469792">Festinger, 1954</xref>) propose that people use comparisons to similar others in order to (a) reduce their uncertainty about where they might stand on a particular dimension, (b) feel better about their current situation, and (c) be inspired to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0361684312469792">Collins, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0361684312469792">Wood, 1989</xref>). There is empirical support for social comparison theory from studies of people’s comparison behavior in the context of opinion uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0361684312469792">Suls, Martin, &amp; Wheeler, 2000</xref>), social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0361684312469792">Masters &amp; Smith, 1987</xref>), and (academic) achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0361684312469792">Gibbons, Blanton, Gerrard, Buunk, &amp; Eggleston, 2000</xref>), but physical appearance comparisons do not seem to follow this traditional theoretical model for several reasons.</p>
<p>First, physical appearance comparisons are often associated with extremely dissimilar targets (e.g., actors, models, athletes) in contrast to similar targets in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0361684312469792">Groesz, Levine, &amp; Murnen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0361684312469792">Myers &amp; Crowther, 2009</xref>). Second, people often make physical appearance comparisons even if these comparisons make them feel worse about themselves or they do not believe they can change their current circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0361684312469792">Bosch, Buunk, Siero, &amp; Park, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0361684312469792">Martin &amp; Gentry, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0361684312469792">Myers &amp; Crowther, 2009</xref>). Third, physical appearance comparisons are associated with strong negative consequences including increased body dissatisfaction, disordered eating, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684312469792">Boroughs, Krawczyk, &amp; Thompson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0361684312469792">Cash, Melnyk, &amp; Hrabosky, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684312469792">Corning, Krumm, &amp; Smitham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0361684312469792">Myers &amp; Crowther, 2009</xref>). Although the consequences documented for other comparison topics include negative emotions and self-evaluations, these other comparisons also are associated with improved individual performance and active challenges to injustice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0361684312469792">Burleson, Leach, &amp; Harrington, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0361684312469792">Collins, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0361684312469792">Leach, Snider, &amp; Iyer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0361684312469792">Wood, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>However, without a direct contrast between physical appearance comparisons and other comparison topics, it remains unclear whether women’s everyday physical appearance comparisons are as different from other comparison topics (such as lifestyle, academic achievement, or opinions) as previous research suggests. If physical appearance comparisons represent qualitatively different comparison experiences in contrast to other comparison topics, researchers should be cautious before they apply traditional comparison theory to physical appearance comparisons. Determining if and how physical appearance comparisons differ in contrast to other topics also could suggest new and effective intervention methods or individual differences that might mitigate some of the negative effects associated with physical appearance comparisons. In our study, we investigate physical appearance comparisons in the context of other comparisons that participants experience. For 7 days, in response to three daily text messages, undergraduate women recorded whether they had made any comparison about any topic. This approach enabled us to learn about women’s spontaneous comparison experiences and explore the factors that might shape these experiences.</p>
<sec id="section1-0361684312469792">
<title>Diversity of Close Friends</title>
<p>One factor that could shape women’s physical appearance comparisons is the demographic diversity of their close friends. Cross-group friendship research documents the ways in which the increased demographic diversity among one’s close friends is associated with more positive attitudes toward out-groups, increased civic engagement, and stronger critical thinking skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684312469792">Gurin, Dey, Hurtado, &amp; Gurin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0361684312469792">Herek &amp; Capitanio, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0361684312469792">Pettigrew, 1997</xref>; H. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0361684312469792">Smith, Parr, Wood, Bauer, &amp; Abraham, 2010</xref>). The benefits of cross-group friendships also could extend to how people evaluate themselves, and in particular, how they evaluate their physical appearance. Women with more demographically diverse friends might be exposed to different and less constrictive physical appearance norms, they might be more likely to critically evaluate their own group’s physical appearance norms, and/or they might have fewer opportunities to compare themselves to demographically similar peers.</p>
<p>Close friends can create an appearance culture with shared norms and expectations about physical appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0361684312469792">Crandall, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0361684312469792">Jones, 2004</xref>). For example, the binge eating behavior of female sorority members’ close friends predicted sorority members’ binge eating behavior, and the more cohesive the friendship group, the more strongly the behavior of close friends predicted the sorority members’ eating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0361684312469792">Crandall, 1988</xref>). European American women, in particular, might benefit from more demographically diverse friends because they might be exposed to different physical attractiveness norms. Survey data indicate that European American women are more preoccupied with physical appearance defects and report higher levels of body dissatisfaction (with the same body size) in comparison to Latinas, African American, and Asian American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684312469792">Boroughs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0361684312469792">Fitzgibbon, Blackmen, &amp; Aveilone, 2000</xref>). Heterosexual women are less accepting of diverse body sizes, report more disordered eating, and are more focused on physical appearance in comparison to lesbians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0361684312469792">Haines et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, women, in general, are more preoccupied with physical appearance in comparison to men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0361684312469792">Boroughs et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, women with more demographically diverse friends may be more likely to think critically about whether the “thin (White) ideal” is an appropriate yardstick for assessing feminine attractiveness in contrast to women with less demographically diverse friends. Close cross-group friendships increase people’s empathy and positive feelings for the out-group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0361684312469792">Paolini, Hewstone, &amp; Cairns, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0361684312469792">Pettigrew, 1997</xref>), enable people to distance themselves from their in-group (the “deprovincialization effect”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0361684312469792">Pettigrew, 1997</xref>), and increase critical thinking skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684312469792">Gurin et al., 2002</xref>). It is possible that the increased tolerance, openness to experience, and other qualities that distinguish undergraduates with more cross-group friends from undergraduates with fewer cross-group friends also could protect them from the more negative emotional consequences of physical appearance comparisons.</p>
<p>Finally, the relative demographic diversity among one’s close friends could reduce the number of possible targets for physical appearance comparisons. Prior signal-contingent experience sampling studies (H. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0361684312469792">Smith &amp; Leach, 2004</xref>; W<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0361684312469792">heeler &amp; Miyake, 1992</xref>) indicate that most comparisons are to similarly situated peers. Even though physical appearance comparisons often involve media-based comparisons, physical appearance comparisons to peers are more frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0361684312469792">Leahey &amp; Crowther, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684312469792">Patrick, Neighbors, &amp; Knee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0361684312469792">Ridolfi, Myers, Crowther, &amp; Ciesla, 2011</xref>). If we assume that many comparisons are imposed by the situation and not always freely chosen, the degree to which one’s close friends are demographically similar to the comparer could shape the relative frequency of physical appearance comparisons. Alternatively, women with more demographically diverse friends may make as many physical appearance comparisons as women with more demographically homogeneous friends, but a lack of physical appearance similarity could lead women to “mentally undo” these comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0361684312469792">Gilbert, Giesler, &amp; Morris, 1995</xref>), perhaps mitigating the affective impact. As far as we know, no one has investigated how the relative demographic diversity among one’s close friends is related to women’s physical appearance comparisons. Therefore, before participants began the 7-day testing period, they completed a measure of close friend diversity.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the relative importance of close friend diversity as a potential predictor of physical appearance comparisons, we also included two measures of individual differences in how women feel about their own bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684312469792">Cash &amp; Fleming, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0361684312469792">Cash &amp; Labarge, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0361684312469792">Cash et al., 2004</xref>). Body image is a multidimensional concept that includes the extent to which evaluations of one’s body influence one’s mood, self-esteem, or satisfaction and the extent to which body image concerns are salient or important to one’s general self-image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0361684312469792">Cash et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0361684312469792">Forand, Gunthert, German, &amp; Wenze, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0361684312469792">Ridolfi et al., 2011</xref>). Women who are more invested in their appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0361684312469792">Cash &amp; Labarge, 1996</xref>) or view their body as negatively impacting their quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684312469792">Cash &amp; Fleming, 2002</xref>) may react more strongly to physical appearance comparisons in contrast to other topics. To avoid priming participants’ ideas and theories about physical appearance, we included these measures as part of a posttest that participants completed after the 7-day testing period.</p>

<title>Discrete Emotions</title>
<p>An important goal of our project is to move beyond general measures of positive and negative affect (H. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0361684312469792">Smith &amp; Leach, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0361684312469792">Wheeler &amp; Miyake, 1992</xref>) to the specific discrete emotions that are most likely to be associated with different comparison topics (R. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0361684312469792">Smith, 2000</xref>). Different emotions are associated with different action tendencies and antecedents (F<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0361684312469792">rijda, Kuipers, &amp; ter Schure, 1989</xref>
<bold>; </bold>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0361684312469792">Lazarus, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0361684312469792">Scherer, Schorr, &amp; Johnstone, 2001</xref>; R. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0361684312469792">Smith, 2000</xref>). For example, anger, fear, and sadness all represent negative emotions, but anger is associated with active challenges toward particular targets, fear is associated with the desire to escape, and sadness is associated with withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0361684312469792">Frijda et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0361684312469792">Scherer et al., 2001</xref>). In other words, different discrete emotions direct people’s attention and resources toward relevant goals and away from irrelevant goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0361684312469792">Hill, DelPriore, &amp; Vaughan, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Social comparison research suggests at least two dimensions that could discriminate among different discrete emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0361684312469792">Buunk &amp; Ybema, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0361684312469792">Leach et al., 2002</xref>; R. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0361684312469792">Smith, 2000</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0361684312469792">1</xref>
</sup> The first dimension is the direction of the comparison. Early research suggested that downward comparisons are associated with positive affect whereas upward comparisons are associated with negative affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0361684312469792">Wood, 1989</xref>). However, subsequent research indicates that under different circumstances, upward comparisons could lead to positive affect and downward comparisons to negative affect. The key is whether the comparer contrasts or assimilates themselves with the target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0361684312469792">Buunk &amp; Ybema, 1997</xref>; R. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0361684312469792">Smith, 2000</xref>). For example, if a young woman contrasts her physical appearance with a better looking target, she might feel envious. But if she feels connected to a better looking target (perhaps viewing the target as part of a shared reference group or possible role model; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0361684312469792">Schmitt, Silvia, &amp; Branscombe, 2000</xref>), this assimilative comparison could lead to feeling inspired.</p>
<p>Therefore, the second dimension that should discriminate among different discrete emotions is whether people view the comparison target as similar (leading to assimilation) or dissimilar (leading to contrast) from themselves. Upward comparisons to a dissimilar target should be associated with envy; upward comparisons to a similar target should be associated with inspiration; downward comparisons to a similar target should be associated with anxiety; and downward comparisons to a dissimilar target should be associated with pride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0361684312469792">Leach et al., 2002</xref>; R. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0361684312469792">Smith, 2000</xref>). In an event-contingent sampling study of physical appearance comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684312469792">Patrick et al., 2004</xref>), undergraduate women described their physical appearance comparisons to strangers who were better looking as unintended and associated with negative affect. These data describe the type of upward contrasts to dissimilar targets that should be associated with discrete emotions like envy.</p>
<p>However, in a separate signal-contingent study of physical appearance comparisons, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0361684312469792">Ridolfi and colleagues (2011</xref>) found that women’s physical appearance comparisons, regardless of comparison direction, were associated with increased checking of one’s appearance for flaws and increased guilt. Importantly, physical appearance comparisons to peers were not always associated with general negative affect, suggesting the importance of considering a wide range of positive and negative discrete emotions. Therefore, in our study, we measure six outcomes associated with individual comparison experiences: comparison direction, target similarity, and emotions associated with envy, inspiration, pride, and anxiety.</p>
<p>The argument for a qualitative distinction between physical appearance comparisons and other comparison topics is informed by both correlational and experimental research. However, these methods may not be the best way to answer basic descriptive questions about comparisons. For example, if survey measures require people to estimate how often they make physical appearance comparisons in the context of other questions about body image, exercise, and eating behavior, or peer norms and comments about appearance, it creates at least two potential problems. First, the questions make issues of appearance more salient than they might normally be. Second, people are not very good at estimating behavioral frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0361684312469792">Reis &amp; Gable, 2000</xref>). For example, people’s estimates of how much television they watched during a previous week are much lower in comparison to their daily reports of watching television.</p>
<p>Experimental designs can avoid making physical appearance salient, but one could argue that they model what could be, not what actually occurs. Exposure to thin media ideals clearly influences women’s self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0361684312469792">Bosch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0361684312469792">Harper &amp; Tiggemann, 2008</xref>), but requiring women as part of an experimental design to compare themselves to these ideals does not tell us how often women make these sorts of comparisons during their daily lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0361684312469792">Myers &amp; Crowther, 2009</xref>). Further, 82% of the experimental studies reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0361684312469792">Myers and Crowther (2009</xref>) for their meta-analysis infer physical appearance comparisons (as opposed to directly measure participants’ comparisons). Researchers may assume that participants made comparisons that participants did not make.</p>
<p>One way to avoid these problems is to collect natural and spontaneous comparisons over time. Rather than asking participants to estimate how often they compare their physical appearance to others (an answer that can reflect both cognitive and motivational biases), researchers can count the number of times participants report a physical appearance comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0361684312469792">Reis &amp; Gable, 2000</xref>). In our study, women completed a comparison checklist each time they received a text message sent to them three times a day for 7 days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0361684312469792">
<title>Study Questions</title>
<p>With these data, we investigate three questions. First, we use hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to examine whether physical appearance comparisons are associated with different attributions and discrete emotions in contrast to other comparison topics. Based on past research on physical appearance comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0361684312469792">Leahey &amp; Crowther, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684312469792">Patrick et al., 2004</xref>), we expect women to be more likely to describe physical appearance comparisons as upward contrasts to dissimilar targets in contrast to other comparison topics. These patterns also suggest that physical appearance comparisons will be more frequently associated with feelings of envy and less likely to be associated with pride, inspiration, and anxiety in contrast to other topics.</p>
<p>Second, we use HLM to explore whether individual differences in body image quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684312469792">Cash &amp; Fleming, 2002</xref>), the importance of physical appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0361684312469792">Cash &amp; Labarge, 1996</xref>), and demographic diversity among women’s close friends (H. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0361684312469792">Smith et al., 2010</xref>) predict women’s physical appearance comparison experiences. Because close cross-group friendships are associated with greater tolerance of other people’s differences and increased critical thinking about one’s own group, we predict that women with more demographically different friends will report less negative emotional reactions to physical appearance comparisons in contrast to women with more demographically similar friends. We also predict that women who view their body as impacting their daily lives more negatively will report more negative emotions (and fewer positive emotions) following physical appearance comparisons in contrast to other comparison topics. Finally, we predict that women who place more importance on physical appearance should be more likely to notice and react more strongly to physical appearance comparisons in contrast to other comparison topics.</p>
<p>Although HLM enables us to determine what characteristics distinguish physical appearance comparison ratings and discrete emotions from other comparison experiences, it does not allow us to determine whether individual differences among participants are related to the relative frequency (over the course of the 7 days) that participants reported physical appearance comparisons. For example, participants who are more invested in their appearance may not describe their physical appearance comparisons differently from participants who are less invested in their appearance, but they may make more frequent physical appearance comparisons in contrast to participants who are less invested in their appearance. Similarly, participants with more demographically similar friends might report more frequent physical appearance comparisons in contrast to participants with more demographically diverse friends because demographically similar comparison targets are more available. To answer this third question, we present partial correlations between the percentage of the total comparisons that participants described as about physical appearance and the three individual difference measures.</p>

<sec id="section5-0361684312469792">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Women students (<italic>N</italic> = 87) at a mid-sized university in the Western United States completed the project. One participant began the project, but did not complete the checklists or final questionnaire. Their average age was 20.8 (ranging from 17 to 55 years; <italic>SD</italic> = 6.24). Based on the recoding of participants’ answers to an open-ended question about their ethnic/racial background, 1 participant identified as African American, 3 Asian American, 8 Hispanic or Latina, 2 multiracial, and 73 (84%) European American. Five participants identified as bisexual, 1 as lesbian, and 81 (94%) as heterosexual.</p>

<sec id="section6-0361684312469792">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Undergraduate volunteers were recruited through class announcements, an e-mail to all psychology majors, and personal invitations to undergraduate acquaintances. Researchers met with potential participants individually or in small groups of 2–3 participants. We told participants that we were interested in learning more about people’s experiences with comparisons to other people, to groups, or even to one’s self at different points in time. If they chose to participate (no one declined), they completed a pretest questionnaire, a set of 21 comparison checklists during the 7-day testing period, and a posttest questionnaire.</p>
<p>We asked participants to have access to a cell phone for the 7-day testing period and to carry the booklet of 21 comparison checklists with them at all times. A researcher sent three text messages each day between the hours of 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. to each participant. When participants received a text message, they were asked to take their first available opportunity to complete a checklist from the checklist booklet. If they had not made a meaningful comparison (as defined below), they simply recorded the time that they responded to the text. We assured participants that all their answers would remain completely confidential and anonymous (they selected a codename to use as a method for connecting the pretest questionnaire, the comparison checklist booklet, and the posttest questionnaire).</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0361684312469792">Wheeler and Miyake (1992</xref>), we defined a comparison as comparing oneself or one’s group to another person, group, idea, or experience and offered some examples including (a) noticing a coworker’s car/salary/partner/office and then thinking about how their own car/salary/partner/office relates to it, (b) thinking about their current situation in comparison to their past or imagined future, or (c) seeing an advertisement on television/magazine/the internet and thinking about how they compared to what they saw. We made it clear that these were just examples. We were interested in their comparison experiences, and they should decide what qualified as a meaningful comparison. However, we also pointed out that simply noticing a similarity or difference from another person would not be called a comparison unless it was accompanied by some psychological reaction. After each checklist, there was a blank page that participants could use to record any further thoughts or questions that they thought might be relevant for understanding their answers. The researcher briefly read through the checklist with each participant to ensure that the participant understood all the questions. After answering any remaining questions about the checklist or the text message signaling, the researcher gave participants contact information in case they had any other questions or problems before the final meeting.</p>
<p>A researcher used her mobile phone to send text messages (in a single batch) to all participants at randomly generated times within the following three time blocks: 10 a.m.–1 p.m., 1 p.m.–5 p.m., and 5 p.m.–10 p.m. Within at most 3 days after the end of the week, a female undergraduate researcher met with participants either individually or in small groups of 2–3 participants. During this meeting, participants returned the comparison checklist booklet, completed the posttest questionnaire, and discussed their experience with the researcher. The researcher reminded the participants that the data would be anonymous and that aggregate study results and any related study summaries would be available on a website created for the study.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<sec id="section8-0361684312469792">
<title>Pretest: Close friend diversity</title>
<p>Before the 7-day testing period, participants completed a close friend diversity measure in which they recalled up to five people whom they considered to be their closest friends. For each friend, participants checked whether this target friend was their closest friend; was male or female; was the same or different age; had the same major, different major, or not applicable; identified as the same or different sexual orientation; was the same or different ethnicity; was a fellow university student or not; came from the same hometown or not; was a roommate or not; and had the same or different religious background. We embedded the questions about demographic differences within a series of questions about respondents’ differences and similarities with their close friends in order to avoid people’s tendency to inflate estimates of demographically diverse friends when they answer direct questions about the number of close friends who belong to specific out-groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0361684312469792">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2011</xref>). The pretest questionnaire also included self-evaluation and community service measures used for an unrelated project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0361684312469792">
<title>Testing: Comparison checklist</title>
<p>During the 7-day period, participants completed a comparison checklist 3 times per day. The comparison checklist was an adapted version of Wheeler and Miyake’s (1992) Rochester Social Comparison Record. Participants indicated how they felt after the comparison by checking any relevant feelings that applied from a list of 32 emotions taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0361684312469792">Watson, Clark, and Tellegen (1988</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0361684312469792">Iyer, Leach, and Crosby (2003</xref>). Because we wanted participants to review a large set of emotion terms quickly and efficiently, we opted for a simple checklist format as opposed to rating each term on individual Likert-type scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0361684312469792">Craig, 2005</xref>). We created four categories of emotion words to represent envy (envy, inferior, discouraged, insecure, resentment), anxiety (anxious, worried, fearful, guilty), pride (proud, confident, superior, pleased, satisfied), and inspiration (admiration, inspired, hopeful, encouraged, optimistic). We summed the number of emotions checked for each category.</p>
<p>Participants also reported the sex, ethnicity, and age of the comparison target and how the target was related to the participant. Additionally, participants could check 1 of the 18 possible comparison topics. If participants made a comparison, they answered several questions including (a) how they rated themselves or their situation in comparison to the target from 1 (<italic>much worse</italic>) to 9 (<italic>much better</italic>) and (b) how similar they felt to the target from 1 (<italic>very dissimilar</italic>) to 9 (<italic>very similar</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0361684312469792">
<title>Posttest: Body image</title>
<p>After the 7-day testing period, participants completed the Body Image Quality of Life Assessment (BIQL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684312469792">Cash &amp; Fleming, 2002</xref>), which assesses to what extent one's body image affects one's day-to-day emotions. For example, participants indicated from 1 (<italic>very negative affect</italic>) to 7 (<italic>very positive affect</italic>) the extent to which their body image affected their “experiences at work or school,” “relationships with friends,” and “personal feelings about myself.” For our sample, the Cronbach’s α was .83, which although lower than Cash and Fleming’s (2002; α = .95) is still adequate. In their study, Cash and Fleming reported a strong test–retest reliability of .76, as well as evidence for both convergent and discriminant validity. For example, higher BIQL scores predicted weaker internalization of cultural beauty standards, less preoccupation with one’s weight, less body shame, and less appearance investment.</p>

<sec id="section11-0361684312469792">
<title>Posttest: Appearance schema</title>
<p>Participants next completed the 14-item Appearance Schema Inventory (ASI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0361684312469792">Cash &amp; Labarge, 1996</xref>), which is designed to measure the extent to which people invest in physical appearance, internalize physical appearance social stereotypes, and believe physical appearance shapes their interpersonal relationships. For example, participants indicated their agreement from 1 (<italic>disagree strongly</italic>) to 5 (<italic>agree strongly</italic>) with statements such as “Attractive people have it all,” “I should do whatever I can to always look my best,” and “Aging will make me look less attractive.” For our sample, the Cronbach’s α was .89, which is similar to Cash and Labarge’s (1996; α = .84). Cash and Labarge reported evidence for both convergent and discriminant validity; for example, higher ASI scores predicted greater public self-consciousness, poorer social self-esteem, more depressive symptoms, and more disordered eating.</p>

<sec id="section12-0361684312469792">
<title>Posttest: Study experience</title>
<p>The posttest checklist questionnaire also included five statements about participants’ experiences during the testing period that they could rate from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 7 (<italic>extremely</italic>) covering how difficult it was to record comparisons, how accurate they thought their ratings were, whether the checklists interfered with their daily life, whether they thought that they increased the number of comparisons that they made, and whether they forgot to turn on their telephone to receive text messages. This checklist questionnaire also included measures about physical health and stress that were used for an unrelated project.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>First, we present information about participant reactivity. Second, we present basic descriptive results about the two individual difference measures and the demographic characteristics of participants’ close friends. We also present basic descriptive results about the number and type of comparisons that participants reported. Third, we utilize HLM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0361684312469792">Bryk &amp; Raudenbush, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0361684312469792">Tabachnick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0361684312469792">Ullman, 2003</xref>) to examine predictors of comparison ratings and discrete emotions because the data from the comparison checklists (including comparison direction, target similarity, and discrete emotions) represent within-person differences nested within between-person individual differences among participants in ASI, BIQL, and close friend diversity. To answer the fourth question about whether individual differences among participants are related to the percentage of physical appearance comparisons that participants made over the course of the 7-day testing period, we report the partial correlations between the percentage of total comparisons that participants identified as being about physical appearance and each of the three individual differences or between subjects factors.</p>
<sec id="section14-0361684312469792">
<title>Participant Reactivity</title>
<p>The 87 participants reported 1,156 total comparisons, responding on average 67% of the times they received texts and ranging from 2 to 21 comparisons per participant (<italic>M</italic> = 13.29; <italic>SD</italic> = 5.26). This response rate is similar to the percentage of comparisons reported by participants in previous signal-contingent comparison studies (70% for Study 1; 67% for Study 2; H. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0361684312469792">Smith &amp; Leach, 2004</xref>). Participants reported that recording comparisons was not difficult (<italic>M</italic> = 2.48, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.42), that their data were somewhat accurate (<italic>M</italic> = 4.04, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.13), that the project did not interfere with their daily life (<italic>M</italic> = 2.05, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.44), and that they rarely forgot their phones (<italic>M</italic> = 1.34, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.46). In general, participants reported that they did not increase the number of comparisons they made because of the study (<italic>M</italic> = 2.57, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.83). However, their reports of reactivity varied with 33 (37.9%) reporting no increase, 37 (43.1%) reporting some increase, and 17 (19.0%) reporting a large increase in how much they noticed comparisons. As an additional test of participant reactivity, we treated the testing day as a Level 2 predictor of the number of comparisons that participants reported on each testing day.

<title>Friendship patterns and individual differences</title>
<p>The mean score for the BIQL was slightly positive (<italic>M</italic> = 4.90, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.95), and the mean score for the ASI was relatively low (<italic>M</italic> = 1.48, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.63).

There were no other reliable correlations among the close friend demographic categories.</p>
<p>We explored whether participants with more diverse friends might experience these friendships differently in comparison to participants with less diverse friends.

To measure envy (an emotional response to upward comparisons to dissimilar targets), we summed participants’ checks of envious (on average, checked 15.1% of the time), inferior (12.5%), discouraged (15.1%), insecure (13.4%), and resentment (8.9%). To measure pride (an emotional response to downward comparisons to dissimilar targets), we summed participants’ selections of proud (11.7%), confident (11.6%), superior (11.4%), pleased (9.1%), and satisfied (9.4%). To measure inspiration (an emotional response to upward comparisons to a similar target), we summed participants’ checks of admiration (8.6%), inspired (12.3%), hopeful (11.4%), encouraged (12.0%), and optimistic (14.4%). To measure anxiety (an emotional response to downward comparisons to a similar target), we summed participants’ checks of anxious (7.5%), worried (13.8%), fearful (5.4%), and guilty (6.6%).

<p>Participants reported physical appearance as the topic for 11% of these comparisons.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0361684312469792">2</xref>
</sup> In contrast, 20% of these comparisons were about academic skills, intelligence, talent, or ability; 21% were about lifestyle (defined as about social status, possessions, lifestyle, or wealth); and 3% were about opinions. For the analyses, we compared comparison experiences in which participants checked the topic as including physical appearance (<italic>f</italic> = 190) with comparisons in which participants did not check physical appearance as a topic (<italic>f</italic> = 966). Participants reported physical appearance comparisons in which they compared themselves to a past, future, or imagined self (<italic>f</italic> = 20, 9.8% of the physical appearance comparisons); just as they reported intrapersonal comparisons for other topics (<italic>f</italic> = 95, or 9.5% of other comparison topics). We include temporal comparisons in all the following analyses.</p>
<p>Physical appearance comparisons were most frequently the product of observation (51.9% compared to 31.4% of other comparisons), χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 27.19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and comparisons to strangers (34.8% compared to 12.5% of other comparisons), χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 55.30, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Physical appearance comparison targets were mostly female (84%), perceived as younger than 30 years old (93.2%), and identified as European American (67%) or an unknown ethnicity (20%). Almost twice the number of physical appearance comparisons involved the mass media (15%) in contrast to other comparisons (9%), χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 5.57, <italic>p</italic> = .02.</p>
<p>Participants frequently reported that they did not know why they compared physical appearance (44%); in contrast, participants indicated that they did not know why they made a particular comparison for 29% of the other comparison topics, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 13.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. Participants did not report that they were any more likely to do something following physical appearance comparisons (15.8%) relative to other comparison topics (14.2%), <italic>t</italic>(1150) = 0.58, <italic>p</italic> = .57. Of the 29 participants who recorded an active response to a physical appearance comparison, they most frequently mentioned an interest in increased exercise (48%), eating less or more healthy (20%), or changing the way that they present themselves (32%). Active responses to other comparison topics included laughing, crying, praying, and looking for a new place to live, but participants most frequently mentioned talking or writing to someone (26.8%), practicing or studying more (18.1%), and thinking positive thoughts (6.3%).</p>

<title>Comparison Topic as Predictor</title>

We also tested a similar set of HLM models for each outcome in which we substituted other comparison topic contrasts as a predictor of participants’ comparison experiences. If these contrasts are statistically reliable, perhaps physical appearance comparisons are not as unique as we propose. All HLM analyses were conducted using maximum likelihood models.</p>

<title>Other comparison topics</title>
<p>We also explored whether similar differences among discrete emotions emerged for other social comparison domains by substituting new dummy variables for the comparison topic contrast. For example, we recoded comparison topic to represent lifestyle comparisons (coded as 1 for lifestyle comparisons and 0 for all other topics) and used this new variable in the same equation to predict participants’ comparison experiences.

<title>Individual Differences as Predictors</title>
<p>The second HLM question is whether individual differences in ASI, BIQL, and close friend diversity moderate the impact of comparison topic on participants’ comparison experiences. To illustrate any reliable interactions, we present a separate set of HLM models for physical appearance comparisons and other comparison topics (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0361684312469792">Table 2</xref>). Each set of these smaller models includes three Level 2 predictors (ASI, BIQL, close friend diversity) but no interaction terms. The three between-person predictors (ASI, BIQL, and close friend diversity) were centered on the grand mean. The Level 1 equation was the same as the equation listed above. The Level 2 equations reflect our interest in the three between subjects or individual difference predictors as possible main effects and also as part of potential cross-level interactions with the Level 1 predictor of comparison topic. The equations were:</p>

<title>Comparisons and Individual Differences</title>
<p>The HLM results indicate that physical appearance comparisons are associated with different attributions and emotions, but these results do not indicate whether the relative frequency of physical appearance comparisons over 7 days is related to individual differences in ASI, BIQL, or close friend diversity. To investigate this possibility, we determined the partial correlations among these variables. In these correlations, we control for participant ethnic background (dummy coded as 1 to indicate an ethnic majority and 0 to indicate an ethnic minority background) and the two individual differences not involved in the target relationship (e.g., controlling for BIQL and ASI when assessing the correlation between percentage of physical appearance comparisons and close friend diversity).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present work advances our understanding of the predictors and outcomes of comparisons in three ways. By using a signal-contingent experience sampling design, we gained a deeper understanding about the types of comparisons that women experience throughout the day, the discrete emotions they feel as a result and importantly, how the demographic diversity among their close friends may protect them from the negative emotions (particularly envy) that often follow from upward comparisons.</p>
<p>Physical appearance comparisons were qualitatively different from other comparison topics. They were more likely to be the product of upward contrasts with (dissimilar) strangers and associated with more envy, less pride, less inspiration, and less anxiety. Although participants reported more physical appearance comparisons to media figures relative to other comparison topics, these comparisons comprised a small percentage of physical appearance comparisons and the general pattern of results remains the same if these comparisons are excluded.</p>
<p>The increased frequency of envy, insecurity, inferiority, resentment, and discouragement associated with physical appearance comparisons in contrast to other comparison topics is especially striking. Envy, in particular, is associated with aggression, irrational decision making, and reduced cooperation (R. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0361684312469792">Smith &amp; Kim, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0361684312469792">van de Ven, Zeelenberg, &amp; Pieters, 2009</xref>). It can lead to efforts to narrow the gap between oneself and the envied target or a desire to pull the envied target down to one’s inferior position (R. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0361684312469792">Smith &amp; Kim, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0361684312469792">van de Ven et al., 2009</xref>). Most importantly, it directs people’s attention toward the envied target (and away from other things) and can deplete their self-regulatory resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0361684312469792">Hill et al., 2011</xref>). These consequences are quite different from the consequences associated with guilt—the only discrete emotion directly investigated in previous signal-contingent experience sampling research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0361684312469792">Leahey &amp; Crowther, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0361684312469792">Ridolfi et al., 2011</xref>). In fact, in our study, participants associated guilt with physical appearance comparisons much less frequently (7.2%) in comparison to envy (30.4%). Although guilt and envy might lead to a similar desire to change one’s situation more, guilt is driven by self-focus and a high sense of control whereas envy is driven by other focus and a low sense of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0361684312469792">Leach et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0361684312469792">Roseman, Spindel, &amp; Jose, 1990</xref>). How one might discuss physical appearance comparisons or intervene to change women’s interpretations of such comparisons should be very different if envy, and not guilt, is the more frequent emotion that women report.</p>
<p>It is surprising that participants reported less anxiety, worry, fear, and guilt following physical comparison experiences in contrast to other comparison topics, particularly given evidence from other experience sampling studies that shows women who report increased body dissatisfaction also report increased guilt following physical appearance comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0361684312469792">Leahey &amp; Crowther, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0361684312469792">Ridolfi et al., 2011</xref>). But it is important to remember that participants were undergraduates following classes, taking tests, and juggling school work and other activities. It may not be that physical appearance comparisons elicited relatively less anxiety, but that other comparison topics elicited relatively more anxiety. Although the analyses did not reveal any statistically reliable differences, one might hypothesize that the relatively more frequent comparisons about intelligence and academic skills could be associated with more guilt and anxiety for these undergraduate students in contrast to other comparison topics. Perhaps, if our sample included participants who came to the study with weight or body image concerns, we might expect physical appearance comparisons to be associated with increased guilt and anxiety.</p>
<p>Still, as argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684312469792">Cash and Fleming (2002</xref>), it is a mistake to assume that all physical appearance comparisons are associated with negative emotions. Although pride and inspiration are not as frequently associated with physical appearance comparisons as they are with other comparison topics, they do occur. By using an adjective checklist for the emotion measure, participants could consider a broad range of positive and negative emotions quickly—an approach that is particularly useful given the ephemeral nature of emotion and participants’ possible reluctance to report less socially desirable experiences (R. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0361684312469792">Smith &amp; Kim, 2007</xref>). By parsing out different discrete emotions, we can see more clearly the ways in which physical appearance comparisons are qualitatively different from other comparison topics.</p>
<p>Further, individual differences in the extent to which women associated their body with positive or negative affect impacted their reactions to physical appearance comparisons in predictable ways. Participants who associated more positive emotions with their body (higher BIQL scores) also reported more inspiration and less envy after physical appearance comparisons. However, the BIQL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0361684312469792">Cash &amp; Fleming, 2002</xref>) did not predict how frequently participants made physical appearance comparisons. In contrast, the degree to which participants reported that physical appearance was important to them predicted the frequency of their reported physical appearance comparisons, but did not determine the direction, target, or how women felt about these comparisons. These different patterns illustrate the importance of distinguishing between the degree to which people are motivated to seek information about appearance and the more general impact of their body image on their affective experience. One can imagine an athlete who feels quite positive about her body’s impact on her life but at the same time, is not especially interested in physical appearance. It is only when physical appearance is salient (either by choice or fate), that her positive feelings about her body should lead to more positive emotions (like inspiration).</p>
<p>These results also indicate that the relative demographic diversity among women’s close friends is associated with their emotional reactions to comparisons. Women with more homogeneous sets of friends reported more envy following physical appearance comparisons. Although numerous research studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0361684312469792">Gurin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0361684312469792">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2011</xref>) have identified the value of close friendship diversity for increasing tolerance, empathy, and civic engagement (especially for ethnic majority undergraduates), our data suggest that close friend diversity also might protect women from some of the negative emotional consequences associated with physical appearance comparisons. What is less clear is why this might be the case. For example, women with more diverse close friends may be exposed to new and less constrictive appearance norms, they could be more tolerant of physical appearance differences among people, they might think more critically about their own group’s norms, or they may have fewer opportunities to compare themselves to demographically similar targets.</p>
<p>However, it is less clear that the targets (most frequently identified as strangers) of physical appearance comparisons reflected the demographic diversity of participants’ close friends. Participants with more diverse close friends did not report fewer physical appearance comparisons relative to participants with more homogeneous close friends, suggesting no evidence for the simple hypothesis that participants with more demographically diverse friends would encounter fewer targets relevant for physical appearance comparisons.</p>
<p>Second, it is possible that participants, almost all young European American women, who reported more demographically diverse friends were exposed to different appearance norms. For example, one might hypothesize that participants who have a close African American friend might be exposed to more forgiving norms about body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0361684312469792">Fitzgibbon et al., 2000</xref>), and it is this exposure that mitigates the negative emotional consequences of physical appearance comparisons. Research suggests that heterosexual men are less likely to report disordered eating and body dissatisfaction compared to heterosexual women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0361684312469792">Phares, Steinberg, &amp; Thompson, 2004</xref>). Similarly, European American, Asian American, and Latina women report more body shame and dissatisfaction in comparison to African American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0361684312469792">Fitzgibbon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0361684312469792">Grabe &amp; Hyde, 2006</xref>). Finally, lesbians report less body dissatisfaction in comparison to heterosexual women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0361684312469792">Haines et al., 2008</xref>). However, a recent meta-analysis of 98 studies indicates that the mean differences in levels of body dissatisfaction among various demographic categories tend to be small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0361684312469792">Grabe &amp; Hyde, 2006</xref>) and are moving toward the European American female ideal. Therefore, it is premature to assume that exposure to different cultural appearance norms explains this effect.</p>
<p>Finally, perhaps it is the individual differences or the situational contexts that support the development of cross-group friendships that impact the appearance norms that young (European American) women adopt. In other words, women who report more demographically diverse close friends are more tolerant of any differences among people (including appearance) and are more likely to think critically about their own group’s norms (including appearance norms) in contrast to women who report less demographically diverse friends. Of course, without further research, we cannot know whether women who value physical appearance less tend to befriend more demographically diverse people, or whether befriending more demographically diverse people leads women to value physical appearance less, or whether there is some third variable that can explain the relationship. What we do know is that women with more diverse close friends did not report statistically significantly less contact or closeness to their friends compared to women with more homogeneous friends. Nor was close friend diversity related to self-esteem, self-certainty, team or sorority membership, or a general interest in social comparison information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0361684312469792">Gibbons &amp; Buunk, 1999</xref>)—suggesting that there does not seem to be any obvious individual differences among women with more or less demographically diverse close friends.</p>
<sec id="section31-0361684312469792">
<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>Before we consider the broader implications of these data, it is important to recognize at least three limitations. First, signal-contingent designs prevent any clear conclusions about causality and limit the extent of our measurements. We cannot know what comparisons participants chose to report and what they did not, or whether they may have been reluctant to report some of the more negative emotions that they experienced. We also cannot know to what extent comparisons were chosen or imposed by participants’ local context. For example, participants frequently reported not knowing why they made a physical appearance comparison. This could represent evidence of more implicit spontaneous comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0361684312469792">Gilbert et al., 1995</xref>) or an attempt to present oneself as not consciously interested in one’s appearance. Still, it seems difficult to argue that participants radically changed their self-presentation when reporting physical appearance comparisons in the midst of all the other comparisons that they reported during the project.</p>
<p>Second, almost all participants are young European American women. Greater demographic diversity may protect European American women from harmful physical appearance comparisons, but we do not know whether it will protect members of other demographic groups in similar ways, or even if members of other demographic groups will experience similar emotions following physical appearance comparisons. It will be extremely important to see if the same patterns emerge with participants from a variety of different ethnic backgrounds, sexual orientations, and ages. It also is important to recognize that almost all these participants were students—a role that gave them the flexibility to participate in an experience sampling study, but also can explain the frequency of comparisons about academic skills. We should be careful not to assume that these patterns would be the same for other samples of women. Still, given the well-documented vulnerability of young, heterosexual women and girls to problems associated with their physical appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684312469792">Corning et al., 2006</xref>), identifying any factors that might protect them from these problems is critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684312469792">Franzoi &amp; Klaiber, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, there are limits to our individual difference measures. For example, the close friend diversity measure does not allow us to determine what specific ethnic backgrounds are represented among women’s close friends. We chose this approach because we felt it was important to capture the relative diversity of participants’ close friends without broadcasting our interest in particular forms of demographic diversity and their impact. When researchers directly ask students to name friends from a different ethnic background, the number of friends from different backgrounds listed by students dramatically increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0361684312469792">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2011</xref>). We also do not know anything about the physical appearance of these close friends. It is quite possible that demographically diverse friends still represent fairly similar body types (imagine, for example, members of a women’s basketball team). Therefore, an important question for future research will be to determine whether the type as well as the frequency of demographic diversity among one’s close friends is associated with different norms and attitudes toward physical appearance. It also will be very important to learn whether demographic diversity among one’s close friends is related to diverse body types.</p>
<p>Finally, we do not have separate measures of participants’ body mass index (BMI), disordered eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0361684312469792">Leahey &amp; Crowther, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0361684312469792">Leahey, Crowther, &amp; Mickelson, 2007</xref>), contingent appearance-based self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0361684312469792">Patrick et al., 2004</xref>), or body objectification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0361684312469792">Buchanan, Fischer, Tokar, &amp; Yoder, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0361684312469792">Haines et al., 2008</xref>)—individual differences shown to be related to greater concerns with one’s appearance and greater body dissatisfaction. Interestingly, in their signal-contingent experience sampling investigation of physical appearance comparisons and body dissatisfaction, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0361684312469792">Leahey and her colleagues (2007</xref>) found that women’s BMI did not moderate the effects of upward comparisons on immediate affect or behavior (although heavier women did report lower appearance self-esteem compared to thinner women). Still, it will be important to include these constructs in future research.</p>

<title>Practice Implications</title>
<p>The present work has promising practical and clinical implications. In the United States, an estimated 46% of female adolescents and 26% of male adolescents report dissatisfaction with their body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0361684312469792">Neumark-Sztainer, Wall, Eisenberg, Story, &amp; Hannan, 2006</xref>). Body dissatisfaction and disordered eating often co-occur with obesity and weight gain over time, and they are risk factors for eating disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0361684312469792">Neumark-Sztainer et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0361684312469792">2007</xref>). Researchers argue that negative and frequent physical appearance comparisons are a key predictor of body image problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0361684312469792">Corning et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0361684312469792">Franzoi &amp; Klaiber, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0361684312469792">Jones, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0361684312469792">Myers &amp; Crowther, 2009</xref>). The data from our project confirm the assumption that women’s experiences with physical appearance comparisons are qualitatively different from other comparison experiences. Further, envy, an emotion associated with depleted self-regulatory capacity and a focus on the envied target, is most frequently associated with physical appearance comparisons. However, women who reported more positive general attitudes toward their bodies also associated inspiration, an emotion associated with self-improvement, with physical appearance comparisons. These diverse emotional reactions are an important reminder that not all physical appearance comparisons will be associated with negative emotions and problematic behaviors (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0361684312469792">Franzoi et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data also suggest that the increased demographic diversity among one’s close friends could mitigate the negative emotions associated with physical appearance comparisons. The increased empathy toward out-groups and more critical attitudes toward in-group norms and attitudes documented in previous intergroup contact research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0361684312469792">Pettigrew &amp; Tropp, 2011</xref>) could extend to how women, at least, interpret physical appearance comparisons. It is important for clinicians and educators to recognize the extent to which comparison experiences are simply a part of daily life. However, a closer examination of the discrete emotions that these comparisons elicit and the ways in which one’s close friends can shape women’s interpretations of these experiences can lead to interventions that target more destructive emotional responses like envy and resentment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section33-0361684312469792">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It is clear that individual women experience physical appearance comparisons differently, but these differences are not simply the product of upward comparisons or because famous people are the preferred targets. Instead, physical appearance comparisons appear to elicit more frequent feelings of inferiority and envy. Further, the negative emotional impact of physical appearance comparisons was mitigated for women who associated their body with a more positive quality of life and reported more demographically diverse friends. In particular, women with more demographically diverse close friends did not report fewer physical appearance comparisons, but they appeared less bothered by them. By studying physical appearance comparisons within the context of all the comparisons that women experience, we can understand why these comparisons lead to qualitatively different emotional experiences without priming participants’ lay theories and stereotypes about physical appearance.</p>

<p>Social comparisons can elicit a wide range of discrete emotions that can be categorized in a multitude of ways (see F<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0361684312469792">eather, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0361684312469792">Leach et al., 2002</xref>; R.
