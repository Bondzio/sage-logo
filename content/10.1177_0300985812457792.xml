The aims of this study were to examine the alterations in β-catenin expression in canine melanoma as well as the causes of these changes (eg, E-cadherin or exon 3 mutations) and to compare identified changes between skin and oral melanomas. Forty-two primary canine skin and oral melanoma tissue samples were used in the study. The expression levels of <italic>ctnnb1</italic> and the levels of E-cadherin/β-catenin complex in the tissues were determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The mutational status of β-catenin exon 3 was examined by DNA sequencing. RT-PCR revealed higher levels of <italic>ctnnb1 </italic>expression in oral melanoma tissues compared with normal melanocytes, irrespective of sex or histopathological appearance of the tissue (ie, amelanotic vs melanotic). Immunohistochemistry revealed simultaneous loss of membrane E-cadherin/β-catenin complex and cytoplasmic accumulation of both proteins in 37 cases (84%). Intranuclear β-catenin was also detected in all tissues with reduced membrane β-catenin expression. In mutational analyses, one amelanotic oral melanoma showed 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); however, after protein translation, all the SNPs were silent mutations. The present study demonstrates that dysregulation of E-cadherin/β-catenin complexes is involved in both types of canine melanotic tumors and that the disruption of E-cadherin/β-catenin complexes and increased β-catenin may induce tumor progression and malignancy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>canine melanotic tumor</kwd><kwd><italic>ctnnb1</italic></kwd><kwd>β-catenin</kwd><kwd>E-cadherin</kwd><kwd>exon 3 mutation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Melanotic tumors originate from the transformation of melanocytes and represent a common neoplastic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0300985812457792">9</xref></sup> The transformed melanocytes often lose normal contact with the surrounding keratinocytes and proliferate into the surrounding tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0300985812457792">25</xref></sup> In dogs, melanotic tumors account for 9%–20% of skin tumors, and they are the most common malignant tumors of the oral cavity and digits of dogs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0300985812457792">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0300985812457792">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0300985812457792">27</xref></sup> In the oral cavity, these tumors primarily arise from the gingiva, but they also come from the lingual, buccal, pharyngeal, tonsillar, and palatine epithelium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0300985812457792">25</xref></sup> The tumors usually grow rapidly and are invasive, often recurring after surgical removal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0300985812457792">25</xref></sup> Metastasis is common (∼70%–90%), irrespective of the location of the tumor in the oral cavity, and usually carries a grave prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0300985812457792">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0300985812457792">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0300985812457792">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0300985812457792">27</xref></sup> Unlike oral or digit melanoma, however, melanotic tumors arising from hairy skin are usually benign and surgically curable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0300985812457792">25</xref></sup> The pathogenesis of each type of tumor is largely unknown.</p><p>β-Catenin, which is encoded by the <italic>ctnnb1</italic> gene, has 2 functions: regulation of cell-to-cell adhesion and involvement in Wnt/β-catenin signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300985812457792">19</xref></sup> In the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, β-catenin acts as an activator of the T-cell factor (Tcf)/lymphoid enhancer factor (Lef) family of transcription factors in the nucleus, resulting in increased cell division and proliferation. In the absence of Wnt signals, the cellular concentration of free β-catenin is kept low through phosphorylation and subsequent degradation by a protein complex of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), and axin. GSK-3β recognizes and phosphorylates specific serine/threonine residues in exon 3 of β-catenin, leading to β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0300985812457792">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300985812457792">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0300985812457792">23</xref></sup> In the absence of the signals, β-catenin becomes a component in cell-to-cell adhesion through cadherin–catenin complexes. E-cadherin is known as a cadherin type of the epidermis in dogs. Therefore, in the absence of Wnt signal, an abnormal increase of β-catenin in the cytoplasm is associated with dysregulated degradation (eg, dysfunction of the GSK-3β/APC/axin complex or failure of the complex to recognize β-catenin), increased inflow of β-catenin (eg, release from disruption of adherens junction), or increased β-catenin synthesis (eg, from enhanced Wnt signal through receptor tyrosine kinases).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0300985812457792">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0300985812457792">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0300985812457792">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0300985812457792">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0300985812457792">23</xref></sup></p><p>In our previous study, we showed that dysregulated β-catenin expression is involved in canine skin melanotic tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300985812457792">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300985812457792">11</xref></sup> We demonstrated a substantially increased expression of <italic>ctnnb1</italic> mRNA by RT-PCR and the migration of unbound β-catenin into the cytoplasm (in both benign and malignant tumors) or the nucleus (in malignant tumors only).</p><p>The aims of this study were (1) to examine the dysregulation of β-catenin in canine oral melanoma, (2) to examine correlations of E-cadherin/β-catenin complex levels with the mutational status of β-catenin exon 3, and (3) to compare any correlation between skin and oral melanotic tumors.

In addition, E-cadherin/β-catenin complexes were scored as “preserved” when both proteins had membranous expression and as “reduced” when the expression of at least one protein was low. Last, the immunoreactivity of nuclear β-catenin was recorded as “positive” when the immunolabeling appeared throughout the nucleus.

When compared with the wild-type sequence of canine β-catenin exon 3, only 1 oral melanoma revealed 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DNA sequence (T8C, G16A, T55C, T85C, T109C, T118C, C127G, C145T, A154G, T181C, C196G, A205G, and A226G). In the translated sequence, however, there were no amino acid changes, indicating that the SNPs did not affect the amino acid sequence of β-catenin exon 3.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section11-0300985812457792"><title>Discussion</title><p>Like our previous study of canine skin melanotic tumors, this study also demonstrated that dysregulation of β-catenin is present in canine oral melanoma. We detected a consistent increase in <italic>ctnnb1 </italic>expression in all the cases examined and altered localization of β-catenin protein in 21 of 24 cases (87%). Although increased RNA synthesis does not always equate with increased protein synthesis, the increased expression of <italic>ctnnb1 </italic>mRNA suggests the possibility that increased β-catenin synthesis may affect the intracellular accumulation of β-catenin protein. Along with the expression pattern of <italic>ctnnb1 </italic>mRNA, we examined the changes in membrane E-cadherin in skin and oral melanomas and confirmed that the release of both proteins from the cell membrane seems to occur in parallel, irrespective of whether the tumor was benign or malignant. In particular, all skin (<italic>n</italic> = 2) and oral melanoma (<italic>n</italic> = 21) samples with reduced membrane β-catenin protein also showed nuclear labeling for the protein. The results of IHC suggest the possibility that the disruption of E-cadherin/β-catenin complexes releases β-catenin into the cell and that this β-catenin enters to the nucleus, resulting in cell division/proliferation through the activation of Tcf/Lef family transcription factors.</p><p>The search for β-catenin exon 3 mutations that can induce recognition failure by GSK-3β showed no changes in the amino acid sequence of β-catenin protein, indicating that degradation failure by GSK-3β does not affect the intracellular accumulation of the protein in canine melanotic tumors. In cell line–based studies of human melanomas, exon 3 mutations have been found to be widespread, but studies using surgically extracted skin melanotic tumor tissues have indicated that the mutations rarely occur in clinical cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0300985812457792">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0300985812457792">19</xref></sup> Tumor cells with exon 3 mutations seem to be better at adapting to cell culture conditions, but the exact reason for this behavior is unclear. It also suggests that the results of cell line–based studies, especially for melanomas, should be interpreted with caution. This is why the present study was carried out with surgically extracted tumor tissues.</p><p>In a comparison of <italic>ctnnb1</italic> mRNA expression levels between skin melanotic tumors and oral melanomas, the skin tumors showed much higher levels of expression than the oral cases, although most of the skin melanotic tumors were benign (16/18, 88.9%). Considering the role of β-catenin in cell division/proliferation, these results suggest that increased synthesis of β-catenin protein may be involved in tumor development; however, this is not a crucial factor in the progression to malignancy in canine melanoma. Rather, it seems that its intranuclear translocation is a crucial factor in determining whether the tumor will proceed to malignancy. To confirm this hypothesis, a future study aimed at correcting abnormal Wnt/β-catenin signaling will focus on blocking the nuclear translocation of β-catenin in a canine melanocyte cell line.</p><p>Besides the releasing of β-catenin into the cell cytoplasm, the loss of membrane E-cadherin is also involved in the reduction of intercellular adhesion, in parallel to an invasive growth behavior in human melanoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0300985812457792">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0300985812457792">13</xref></sup> The mechanism of down-regulation of E-cadherin in human melanoma is not fully understood; however, its down-regulation is known to be involved in some processes that potentially promote melanoma development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0300985812457792">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0300985812457792">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0300985812457792">22</xref></sup> Results from our present study also demonstrated that significant loss of E-cadherin is a frequent event in canine melanotic tumors regardless of tumor location and its invasiveness; however, its exact mechanism and role in tumorigenesis need to be investigated.</p><p>Although extensive research and therapeutic trials are ongoing, the incidence of human melanoma in the Caucasian population has been increasing for several decades.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0300985812457792">21</xref></sup> Alterations in Wnt/β-catenin signaling have been found in 30% of human cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0300985812457792">16</xref></sup> In these cases, increased β-catenin translocation into the nucleus is thought to mediate fundamental roles in the radial and vertical growth of tumor mass, crossing the basement membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985812457792">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0300985812457792">23</xref> </sup>Therefore, a mouse model has been developed to study Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vivo. However, this model has limitations. For example, mice have a different location of melanocytes, compared with humans, and no incidence of spontaneous melanoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0300985812457792">15</xref></sup> In contrast, spontaneous canine melanoma has several similarities to human melanoma, beside the dysregulated β-catenin confirmed by our studies, that make the system advantageous: (1) similar location of melanocytes (epidermis and hair follicle), (2) similar age at incidence of disease onset, and (3) shared histopathological and biological characteristics, especially for short radial growth and rapid vertical growth of the tumor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0300985812457792">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0300985812457792">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr"
