<abstract>
<p>The circumstances that lead to incarceration may potentiate the HIV/AIDS epidemic and this has become an emerging public health concern. In the United States and in most jurisdictions, HIV prevalence in the correctional setting is higher among female inmates than male inmates. This dichotomy is not fully understood and few studies have focused on women in the South. Using data from the South Carolina (SC) electronic HIV/AID Reporting System, the SC Law Enforcement Criminal History database, and a public access website of the SC Department of Corrections, the authors describe the epidemiological characteristics and correctional history of a population of HIV-infected women in SC diagnosed between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2005.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that at the end of 2006 approximately 1.1 million individuals were infected with HIV in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078345812456376">CDC, 2008a</xref>). Although African American (AA) women represented 12% of all U.S. women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1078345812456376">U.S. Census Bureau, 2010</xref>), this racial group comprised 66% of the women diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078345812456376">CDC, 2008b</xref>). This racial disparity may suggest that prevention and intervention initiatives are not resonating with this demographic group or factors that potentiate this disparity have not been adequately addressed.</p>
<p>In 2008, South Carolina (SC) ranked ninth among all states and the District of Columbia in AIDS case rate among female adolescents and adults (SC rate, 11.1 per 100,000 population; U.S. rate, 7.5 per 100,000 population; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078345812456376">CDC, 2010</xref>). Whereas AAs comprise only 30% of the SC population, they make up 73% of the total persons living with HIV/AIDS. More than 8 out of 10 women with HIV are AA, and they have an HIV/AIDS case rate 12 times greater than White women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078345812456376">South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control HIV/STD Division, 2008</xref>). In 2008, AA women accounted for 15% of the SC population but were 26% of the persons living with HIV/AIDS; in comparison, White women accounted for 33% of the SC population and only 5% of the persons living with HIV/AIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078345812456376">South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control HIV/STD Division, 2008</xref>). The SC gender epidemiology suggests that AA women are at increased risk of HIV infection.</p>
<p>Previous CDC HIV testing recommendations emphasized risk-based strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078345812456376">CDC, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078345812456376">2001</xref>), but this approach has proven to be ineffective and fails to identify a large proportion of individuals who are HIV infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345812456376">Duffus et al., 2009</xref>). The revised recommendations promote routine screening in health care settings and emphasize the need to test in facilities outside of traditional medical settings, such as correctional institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078345812456376">Branson et al., 2006</xref>). To address the implications of HIV infection in correctional facilities, the CDC published HIV Testing Implementation Guidance for Correctional Settings in January 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078345812456376">CDC, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The influence of criminal justice involvement on the HIV/AIDS epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078345812456376">Hammett, Harmon, &amp; Rhodes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078345812456376">Maruschak, 2007</xref>) has received increased attention and has emerged as a growing public health concern. In the United States, HIV prevalence in the correctional setting is higher among female inmates than male inmates (3.5% and 2.2%, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078345812456376">Maruschak, 2001</xref>). Additionally, in state and federal prisons in the Southern and Northeastern United States, the prevalence of HIV is 35% to 100% higher among females than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078345812456376">Maruschak, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The epidemiological characteristics, risk factors of having an AIDS diagnosis, and a more detailed knowledge of risk behaviors of HIV-infected women with a history of criminal justice involvement have not been extensively investigated. This investigation will characterize demographics and risk factor information for the population of HIV-infected women in SC diagnosed between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2005. Because of the different HIV testing strategies employed (discussed below), our hypothesis is that adverse health outcomes (lower CD4+ T-cell and higher viral load [VL] values) would be more prevalent among HIV-positive women without a history of incarceration or who went to jail compared to HIV-positive women who went to prison.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1078345812456376" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The data were obtained from four sources: the SC enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System (eHARS), the SC Law Enforcement Division (SLED) Computerized Criminal History (CCH) database, the SC Department of Corrections (SCDC) public access file transfer protocol website, and the 1999 U.S. Census Bureau. The institutional review boards for the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC), the University of South Carolina, and the SC Office of Research and Statistics (ORS) Data Oversight Committee approved this study.</p>
<p>In this study, eHARS data on women who were diagnosed with HIV infection between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2005, were used for analyses. The following variables were requested from eHARS: race/ethnicity, date of first positive HIV test, gender, urban/rural status at time of diagnosis, age at HIV diagnosis, disease stage at diagnosis (HIV/AIDS), mode of HIV exposure (heterosexual, intravenous drug use [IDU], no identified risk factor [NIR], no reported risk [NRR]), source of HIV report (county health department, private or group practice, state [prison or mental health facility], hospital, and other [another state, blood banks or businesses, federal laboratories, or unknown sources]), and county of HIV diagnosis. All reported CD4+ T-cell and VL values following HIV diagnosis were also extracted.</p>
<sec id="section3-1078345812456376">
<title>SLED CCH and SCDC Data</title>
<p>Criminal history data for this analysis were derived from two womenâs prisons and more than 250 law enforcement agencies (jails, detention centers, lockups) where individuals were arrested and fingerprinted. The following variables were requested from SLED CCH files: date of arrest, arrest type, and arresting agency (state jail, county jails, Alcohol Beverage Control, Department of Natural Resources). Jail admission and release dates were unavailable. The initial CCH data file contained 18,732 arrests. After the removal of duplicate observations and other inclusion and exclusion criteria (described below), the final data set for analyses included 4,924 arrests. Data from the SCDC were extracted from a public access website. The following variables were included in this data file: prison admit date, prison release date, current status (incarcerated, parole, release, probation), current location (county, if known), birth state, birth county, most serious offense, sex registry (Y/N), total sentence, and sentence length.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1078345812456376">
<title>Data Linkage</title>
<p>The SLED CCH and eHARS data files were linked at the ORS facility using patient name, date of birth, gender, race/ethnicity, and social security number (if available). Persons trained in eHARS security guidelines and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act confidentiality procedures at ORS performed the data linkage and the investigators were provided with a de-identified data set (without names, address, or social security numbers).</p>
<p>HIV infection has been reportable by name to SC DHEC since 1986. eHARS data quality exceeds CDC minimum standards on reporting timeliness (95% within 6 months of diagnosis) and completeness (98%, based on comparison with other data sources; SC DHEC, unpublished data, 2008).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1078345812456376">
<title>Inclusions/Exclusions</title>
<p>Study exclusions were as follows: missing date of HIV diagnosis; an HIV diagnosis date that was not between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2005; the date of AIDS diagnosis preceded the date of HIV diagnosis; duplicate observations for arrests; women who died during the study period (because of the inability to assess care-seeking behavior between 2006 and 2008); arrests that occurred prior to 1986; age 18 years and younger; non-SC residents; Asian/Pacific Islanders, American Indian/Alaskan Natives, and those of multiple races because of too few numbers; HIV risk categories where numbers were too small for meaningful analysis (e.g., adult receiving clotting factor, adult receiving transfusion or transplant); missing values for urban/rural residence at diagnosis; and a missing first CD4+ T-cell value. The analytical population was 1,392 HIV-infected women (of whom 950 had history of arrests).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1078345812456376">
<title>Testing Strategy and Opportunities to Receive an HIV Test</title>
<p>In the general community (women without criminal justice involvement) and in SC jails and detention centers, the opportunity to receive an HIV test is voluntary. Prior to the revised CDC testing recommendations, HIV testing relied on a risk-based strategy that fostered many missed opportunities for early HIV diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078345812456376">Duffus et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, emphasis was placed on women who went to prison because HIV testing has been mandatory upon entry into SC prison facilities since 1998. Those women who test HIV positive are guaranteed access to ongoing care in a separate ward with treatment by HIV specialists.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1078345812456376">
<title>Definitions</title>
<p>Disease stage at diagnosis was defined as either HIV (first CD4+ T-cell count â¥ 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) or AIDS (first CD4+ T-cell count &lt; 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> or first CD4+ T-cell count â¥ 200 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> with an AIDS defining illness [i.e., tuberculosis, candidiasis, cytomegalovirus]).</p>
<p>History of criminal justice involvement with opportunity to test for HIV infection, the exposure variable of interest, was categorized as <italic>Previous Arrest(s)</italic> (as evidenced by an arrest date in the CCH database, which consisted of only arrests to jails), <italic>No Previous Arrest,</italic> or <italic>Prison</italic> (as evidenced by a prison admit date in the SCDC database, and included people who went to prison but also could have gone to jail). Arrest categorizations were grouped as follows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078345812456376">Polonsky et al., 1994</xref>): violent offenses (assault and battery, murder, harassment, armed robbery), property offenses (arson, burglary, shoplifting, petty larceny), public order offenses (disturbing the peace, disorderly conduct), drug/alcohol offenses (distribution of crack cocaine, driving under the influence, open container, trafficking marijuana), sex crimes (criminal sexual conduct, prostitution), other (contempt of court, trespassing, financial transaction fraud), and no arrest data determined (the arrest date was reported but the type of arrest was not).</p>
<p>Engagement in HIV care was assessed for 3 consecutive years: 2006, 2007, and 2008. Both CD4+ T-cell and VL laboratory values are used to monitor clinical outcomes and therefore can be used as proxy for care engagement. Because reporting of CD4+ T-cell and VL values was not mandatory until 2004, the years 2006 to 2008 were examined to increase the probability that test values would be captured in eHARS. The Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1-Infected Adults and Adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078345812456376">Panel, 2009</xref>) were used to create an HIV care variable, which was categorized as follows: <italic>In Care</italic> meant an individual had a lab value reported every 6 months for all 3 years, <italic>Transitional Care</italic> meant an individual received care for at least 1 but fewer than all 6-month intervals during the 3-year period, and <italic>Not in Care</italic> meant an individual had received no HIV-related care between 2006 and 2008.</p>
<p>To control for estimated duration of infection prior to diagnosis, a variable that approximated the number of years infected was created using the first CD4+ T-cell value. On average, an HIV-infected patient loses between 80 and 100 CD4+ T-cells per year without treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078345812456376">McCance &amp; Hueher, 2006</xref>). Longini and colleagues created a mathematical model to estimate the duration of HIV infection using the first CD4+ T-cell value obtained at diagnosis. Using this model, the estimated duration of infection variable was created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078345812456376">Longini, Clark, Gardner, &amp; Brundage, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Study participants had to have values for all of the explanatory variables used in the multivariable model. These variables included race/ethnicity, urban/rural status at time of diagnosis, age at HIV diagnosis (categorized as follows: &lt; 20 years, 20 to 29 years, 30 to 39 years, 40 to 49 years, â¥ 50 years), mode of HIV exposure (i.e., heterosexual, IDU, NRR [individuals who were not asked a question about their HIV transmission category], NIR [individuals who did not have any of the specified transmission categories]), source of HIV report, duration of infection, history of previous incarceration, and percent below poverty.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1078345812456376">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>Categorical variables were summarized using percentages and continuous variables (CD4+ T-cell count, VL values, and duration of HIV infection) were summarized using the median and interquartile range (IQR). The KruskalâWallis statistic was used to test for differences between history of previous incarceration and the first CD4+ T-cell and VL values as well as the association between age and the duration of HIV infection.</p>
<p>Bivariate analyses (chi-square tests) were conducted to determine the independent associations between disease stage at diagnosis (AIDS, HIV) and the aforementioned covariates. Multivariable logistic regression analyses compared the characteristics of HIV-infected women who had AIDS at their first positive diagnosis with women who had only HIV at diagnosis. For multivariable analysis, full models were reduced via backward elimination (<italic>p</italic> value for elimination defined as &gt; .05) to achieve a parsimonious model. <italic>P</italic> values of less than .05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section10-1078345812456376">
<title>Population Characteristics</title>
<p>Of the 1,392 women who were newly diagnosed with HIV infection between January 1996 and December 2005, 837 (60%) had concurrent AIDS at diagnosis (median age: 35 years; IQR: 28 to 42) and 555 (40%) had HIV infection only (median age: 32 years; IQR: 25 to 40; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1078345812456376">Table 1</xref>). The reported modes of HIV transmission were heterosexual contact 951 (68%), NIR 248 (18%), IDU 109 (8%), and NRR 84 (6%). The majority of study participants, 1,199 (86%), were AA. More than half (786/1,392; 56%) had previous arrests, 435 (31%) had no history of previous arrests, and 171 (12%) had served or were serving time in prison at the time of data analysis. The majority of participants, 956 (69%), lived in urban areas of South Carolina. Overall, the median estimated duration of infection prior to HIV diagnosis was 7 years: 3 years for women diagnosed with HIV and 10 years for women concurrently diagnosed with AIDS. Overall, 178 (13%) women were Not in Care, 724 (52%) were in Transitional Care, and 490 (35%) were In Care. Of the 171 women with a prison sentence, 12 (7%) were Not in Care, 105 (61%) were in Transitional Care, and 54 (32%) were In Care (results not shown).</p>

<title>Multivariable Logistic Regression Analysis</title>
<p>The final multivariable logistic regression model included mode of HIV exposure, history of previous incarceration, and estimated duration of HIV infection. Mode of HIV exposure was an important predictor for disease stage at HIV diagnosis. When compared to heterosexually infected women, IDUs (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.28, 4.00]) were more likely to have AIDS at HIV diagnosis, after adjustment for incarceration status and duration of infection. Women who went to prison were more likely (aOR = 1.65, 95% CI [1.00, 2.71]) to have AIDS at HIV diagnosis when compared to women without a history of previous incarceration. There were no statistically significant differences with regard to age and history of incarceration. Estimated duration of infection was also associated with AIDS at HIV diagnosis. For every 1-year increase in the duration of infection, the odds of an AIDS diagnosis increased by 68% (aOR = 1.68, 95% CI [1.60, 1.77]; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1078345812456376">Table 2</xref>).</p>

The odds of having an arrest related to a violent offense decreased with increasing age. For example, women â¥ 50 years old were 57% less likely to have an arrest related to a violent offense compared to women aged 20 to 29 (OR 0.43, 95% CI [0.22, 0.84]).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study describes the epidemiologic characteristics and predictors of AIDS disease stage at diagnosis in a cohort of women diagnosed with HIV infection between January 1996 and December 2005. The primary exposure was history of criminal justice involvement with opportunity to test for HIV infection. Opportunities to test for HIV infection in the community or in correctional facilities will influence the disease stage at diagnosis. Because 56% of the women in this study cohort had a previous arrest, criminal justice involvement represents an important opportunity to diagnose SC women early. However, this study demonstrated that 60% of the women had AIDS at the time of their HIV diagnosis, which suggests an estimated duration of infection of 7 to 10 years prior to being diagnosed. This finding underscores the importance of implementing routine HIV testing to facilitate early detection of HIV infection, specifically in correctional institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1078345812456376">Spaulding et al., 2007</xref>). This is important because women who are aware of their status take appropriate precautions to prevent virus transmission to their partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078345812456376">Hader, Smith, Moore, &amp; Holmberg, 2001</xref>). For example, in the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Research study and the Women Interagency HIV study, HIV-infected women were more than twice as likely to report consistent condom use than women who were not HIV infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078345812456376">Moore et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1078345812456376">Wilson et al., 1999</xref>). More research is needed to investigate and identify barriers to HIV testing among women.</p>
<p>Similar to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078345812456376">McDavid, Li, &amp; Lee, 2006</xref>), there is a racial disparity among women in SC, with heterosexual AA women being disproportionately affected. Sixty-eight percent of the women reported heterosexual contact as their mode of HIV exposure and 86% were AA. The Diffusion of Effective Behavioral Interventions project (DEBI), developed by the CDC, is used to provide training and technical assistance on selected evidence-based HIV/STD interventions to state and community HIV/AIDS programs. However, of the 12 DEBIs, only one, <italic>SISTA</italic>, focuses on heterosexually active AA women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078345812456376">AED Center, 2009</xref>). Given the prevalence of HIV infection among AA women, more culturally and gender-appropriate research needs to be conducted to help create interventions to prevent ongoing transmission in high-risk populations.</p>
<p>Over half (56%) of the study sample had a previous arrest/arrests, primarily jails, and 12% had served time or were serving time in prison at the time of data analysis. Unlike prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078345812456376">Gellert, Maxwell, Higgins, Pendergrass, &amp; Wilker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078345812456376">Hankins et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1078345812456376">Smith et al., 1991</xref>), available arrest data allowed the determination of the nature of the crimes committed by the women in our cohort. The majority of arrests were property (34%) and public order (17%) offenses, and not sex (2%) or drug (9%) offenses, which are associated with physical HIV transmission. Older women were also more likely to have drug-related arrests when compared to their younger counterparts. The factors that contribute to or influence illegal behavior need to be investigated to assess how these behaviors can influence or propagate HIV infection and transmission. Property-related offenses could be used as a proxy to describe other risk behaviors or could be committed in an effort to support a drug habit (e.g., steal to get money to support heroin or crack addiction). Securing resources to improve housing stability, employment opportunities, or education may help mitigate reasons for risky behaviors. Also, with more than half of the population having been to a jail, the study results support previous recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078345812456376">Bauserman, Ward, Eldred, &amp; Swetz, 2001</xref>) for implementation of routine HIV testing in jail facilities. With such a testing strategy, it is likely that some of these women could have been diagnosed early in their disease progression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078345812456376">Beckwith and colleagues (2007</xref>) have shown routine testing to be feasible and highly acceptable in jail populations. Helping high-risk individuals in jails learn their HIV status and linking them to care is also an important public health opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1078345812456376">Spaulding et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have documented incarceration as positively influencing HIV disease progression (increase in CD4+ T-cell and decrease in VL values; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1078345812456376">Springer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1078345812456376">Stephenson et al., 2005</xref>). Many of these women have behaviors that increase the risk of incarceration and HIV acquisition, but health and health care may not be a priority when assessing the hierarchy of needs. Accordingly, many incarcerated women may be unaware of their HIV infection, which leads to disease progression, and screening during imprisonment may be the first opportunity for HIV testing. Surprisingly, women in this study who went to SC prison were more likely to have a concurrent AIDS diagnosis. A possible explanation is that all women who go to SC prisons will have mandatory testing for HIV infection upon entry whereas women who go to voluntary testing facilities have to actively seek testing. Consequently, more complete ascertainment may have been achieved among women who go to prison due to mandatory testing. Prisons and jails, specifically in Southern states, should consider implementing prevention programs geared at HIV education for incarcerated women. Such prevention programs could serve as teachable moments to women who are largely out of reach of the medical system in their communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078345812456376">Boutwell &amp; Rich, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Engagement in HIV care is important when assessing disease progression. Of the 171 women who went to prison, where access to health care is guaranteed, 12 of them were Not in Care during the years 2006 to 2008. Upon further investigation, 11 of the 12 were not in prison in those years. This suggests that the majority of women in prison were actively engaged in HIV care because of CD4+ T-cell and VL reports to eHARS during incarceration. In addition, 61% (105/171) of the women who went to prison were in Transitional Care, of whom 19% (29/105) were incarcerated during the 2006 to 2008 time period. These findings highlight the need for better program collaboration and service integration (PCSI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078345812456376">AED Center, 2009</xref>) among previously incarcerated individuals and women in the general population to afford better continual care engagement. PCSI relies on a multidisciplinary approach for improving public health outcomes. As such, effective prerelease programs and discharge planning for prison inmates should be developed to ensure proper linkage (and retention) to HIV-related health care services, HIV case management, mental health and substance abuse assessments (or treatment if necessary), and housing and employment assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078345812456376">Boutwell &amp; Rich, 2004</xref>). These programs not only support inmates in making a seamless transition back into the community but also could prevent the reversal of any therapeutic gains (reduction in VL, increase in CD4+ T-cells) achieved while in prison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1078345812456376">Springer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1078345812456376">Stephenson et al., 2005</xref>) and may prevent secondary HIV transmission to the general populace on release. The PCSI approach can also be used in the general population to mitigate the barriers for retention and continuity in HIV care for those who do not encounter the correctional setting.</p>
<p>This study had several limitations. First, secondary data analyses can provide only descriptive sociodemographic data and predictive modeling. Socialâcontextual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078345812456376">Poundstone, Strathdee, &amp; Celentano, 2004</xref>) and population factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078345812456376">Koopman et al., 1997</xref>) play an integral role in HIV transmission and warrant further exploration. Qualitative research studies that include interviews or focus groups, for example, can help gather this much-needed information. Second, although this study focused on women, inherent with HIV risk are sexual relationships with other individuals or drug-using partners. Given that the majority of our population reported a heterosexual mode of HIV exposure, the assessment of risk behaviors for sexual partners is of equal importance, but such data were not available for analysis. Unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078345812456376">Khan and colleagues (2007</xref>), who demonstrated that among women, their partnerâs incarceration was strongly associated with multiple new sexual partners as well as transactional sex, this study was unable to quantify the number of women who also had partners with a history of previous incarceration. Future research should incorporate women and their partners to better understand individual and group/partner dynamics and how this affects HIV transmission. Third, information regarding arrest classifications (i.e., felony vs. misdemeanor) was incomplete and could not be analyzed. More studies detailing arrests and arrest classifications are suggested to examine the influences of these factors on risk for HIV infection and transmission. Fourth, classifications of care engagement were derived by the report to eHARS of any CD4+ T-cell or VL value over 3 consecutive years. Although this was the most efficient means of classification given the data parameters, there are inherent limitations in the inability to completely assess HIV care engagement for all years postdiagnosis. However, any negative impact is expected to be minimal because HIV laboratory values in SC are electronically reported and mandatory by law. Regardless of disease stage at diagnosis, an individual should remain actively engaged in primary HIV care. Fifth, whereas the eHARS database was established as a statewide surveillance system and has undergone evaluation, the SLED CCH database was not intended for research or surveillance and certain variables may be missing/incomplete. Nonetheless, the data sources that were requested were comprehensive enough to not impede data analysis. Furthermore, during the data cleaning process, special attention was given to arrest categorizations to ensure that groups were correctly classified. We also recognize that while the CD4+ T-cell value is used to determine an HIV or AIDS diagnosis, other clinical indicators (opportunistic infections) are used to determine HIV or AIDS status at diagnosis. Additionally, the estimated duration of infection was included in the model because during the assessment of confounding, exclusion changed the effect estimate of the primary exposure (incarceration history) by greater than 10%. Finally, although only 2% of the arrests were sex-related offenses, this study only included records of documented crimes. For instance, although 34% of the people with arrests had property-related offenses, it is unknown whether sexual or drug-related crimes were committed but that individual was not apprehended, or that only one charge was listed and multiple lesser charges were dropped.</p>
<p>This population-based cross-sectional analysis described the epidemiological characteristics of HIV-infected women in SC. An astounding 68% of this cohort had a history of incarceration (prison [12%] or jail [56%]). Correctional facilities should consider the routine dissemination of HIV-related prevention messages and the provision of HIV screening since these institutions are key points of contact for many women who will eventually return to the community. More than half (52%) of the study women were in Transitional Care between 2006 and 2008, which suggests that while women seek care, there are barriers to retention and continuity of HIV care. Through integrated service delivery at the client level, the implementation of PCSI may help to decrease HIV transmission and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078345812456376">AED Center, 2009</xref>) among incarcerated women. This study highlights the need for interagency and service collaborations. The development of cultural and gender-specific initiatives that focus on high-risk incarcerated populations should be considered in future public health intervention efforts.</p>
