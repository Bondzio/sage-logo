<p>The heart of this book is a detailed examination of the Voshchazhnikovo estate in Yaroslavl’ province during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, based on a close examination of the estate records held in Moscow and Yaroslavl’ itself. Located in the south-eastern part of Yaroslavl’, Voshchazhnikovo had been granted to the Sheremetyev family by Peter the Great in 1706. By the 1850s the estate included more than 3500 serfs and consisted of both farmland and a variety of small-scale manufacturing enterprises. Dennison suggests that it was very much an ‘average’ part of the enormous Sheremetyev holdings, both in terms of its size and prosperity. The book looks in detail at the structure of the estate and the behaviour of its serf population, with Dennison devoting chapters to family and communal structures, land, labour, savings and consumption. The central argument of the book is that Russian serfdom was a much more open and dynamic society than is usually envisaged, and Dennison uses a wide variety of evidence to demonstrate the vibrancy of the serf economy of Voshchazhnikovo. She shows how the serfs were well integrated into the labour market, with the Sheremetyevs allowing them to move away from the estate to take up seasonal work across European Russia and to employ other peasants to work on their communal allotments. The estate’s serfs also diversified away from agricultural work and Dennison shows how they established a variety of enterprises, ranging from paper mills to tanneries, with these businesses employing labour both from among their fellow serfs and from outside the estate.</p>
<p>While the serfs on the Sheremetyev estate held their land in communal tenure, Dennison suggests that this was a far more complex situation than is normally associated with the commune. She shows how serfs bought and sold land, suggesting that these were not <italic>ad hoc</italic> transactions, but that they represented the development of an institutional framework – albeit informal – for the establishment of property rights. Dennison argues that the Voshchazhnikovo serfs were also well integrated into systems of credit and savings, showing that there was a thriving market of lending and borrowing on the estate, with the estate archive containing records of credit contracts and the formal disputes that arose over their enforcement. Alongside this engagement with credit was a busy market in consumer goods, and Dennison shows that serfs were making decisions to purchase clothing and household goods rather than paying the dues that were owed to their Sheremetyev landlords. The picture that Dennison gives of the Voshchazhnikovo estate suggests that this was a much more vigorous and fluid society than is usually associated with Russian serfdom, and her assiduous work in Russian archives presents us with a picture of a rural society that was different to the backward economy that has often been portrayed as acting as a brake on Russian economic development.</p>
<p>This is a very valuable addition to earlier work, but Dennison’s book attempts to go much further than this. A large part of her argument is taken up with attacks on what Dennison refers to as the ‘Peasant Myth’. Dennison’s account suggests that the views of the Russian peasantry popularized in the nineteenth century by Herzen and Tolstoy came to have a disproportionate influence on the ways in which the Russian rural world has been studied. The ‘peasant myth’ characterized by Dennison includes the idea that communal land tenure lay at the foundation of peasant society and that this had a profound effect on peasant behaviour, somehow restricting enterprise and enabling the development of an egalitarian rural society. Chayanov’s peasant-based economic ideas are introduced as evidence of the durability of this approach to the rural world, but Dennison ascribes too much influence to this view of the peasantry, and her book does not discuss the much more varied and nuanced approach to the history of Russian serfdom that developed after the 1861 emancipation. While Dennison hopes to ‘grasp the Peasant Myth by its roots’ (16), a local study of a single estate provides insufficient evidence for this purpose. While Dennison defends her use of micro-history, she acknowledges that the idea of a ‘representative’ Russian estate is unrealistic and that the pre-Emancipation rural world was one of great diversity. The centrepiece of this book – the detailed study of the Voshchazhnikovo estate – is of great value as a piece of careful and perceptive history, but the wider argument that Dennison makes should be treated with caution.</p>
