<p>Humanity in the modern age faces a stark contradiction between its democratic ideals and authoritarian economic institutions. Capitalist democracies expect each citizen to participate in political and civil affairs, yet aggressively nullify this right at the workplace. The working class has long fought to shatter this compartmentalisation of democracy, and, on occasion, it has been successful. <italic>Ours to Master and to Own</italic> chronicles the experiences of ordinary people in overthrowing the monarchs of their workplace and replacing them with an empowering democracy.</p>
<p>Immanuel Ness and Dario Azzellini’s book victoriously stands as a <italic>sui generis</italic> compendium that reminds us that democracy should not stop at the workplace entrance. Clocking in at a hefty 400-plus pages, the book is densely packed with research and abundant accounts of democratic worker control. The success of the book is a result of its scope, ambition, and commitment to critical objectivity. Rather than being cheerleaders for a cause, the authors make critical insights that cut across the rigid dogmas that fester within many radical texts. The authors manage to inspire hope while staying coolly detached from their subject material. The shining achievement of this collection, though, is its insightful examinations of worker control under a variety of political and economic contexts. However, the book can feel a bit uneven in its content. This unevenness is exacerbated by the noticeable omission of some very well known and successful cases of workers’ self-management that might have contributed toward its robust analysis.</p>
<p><italic>Ours to Master and to Own</italic> presents nearly two-dozen contributions on workers’ self-management, written by a variety of authors. The accounts are loosely arranged chronologically and then grouped into a historical, political, or economic context. Put simply, no other book has documented worker self-management so thoroughly in any single collection. Collected within this volume are oft-forgotten stories of ordinary workers around the world defying capitalism, such as those in Antonio Gramsci’s factory council movement in Turin, Italy; workers’ self-management movements in Java, Indonesia; Brazil’s recovered factories movement; British Colombia’s telephone workers occupation; and many others. Worker-controlled factories have faced tremendous adversities, identity crises, and often forceful repression within capitalist society. Faria and Neves give an apt summary of their experiences in their chapter, by utilising an ecological metaphor (pp. 414-15):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>perhaps the designation ‘amphibian’ is preferable, as it describes a creature that lives in two different environments depending on its life stage. In that case, the cooperatives of resistance, and among them some RF’s [Brazilian recovered factories], represent nymph-stage amphibians that will either flourish or decline depending on the historical process in which they evolve.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is useful for helping readers make sense of the tragic ends of most worker-controlled factories. Most accounts unfold like a Greek tragedy, whereby our inspiring protagonist eventually succumbs to an inevitable demise. The authors provide lessons and commentary while leaving the greater analyses for the reader to puzzle out.</p>
<p>However, some chapters feel weaker than others. Those accounts of worker control that were either confined or very short-lived, such as in British Colombia, or Algeria, are hard pressed to rival the wide proliferation of cases in Venezuela, Argentina, or Yugoslavia. Further, questions of internal organisation, alienation, Taylorist de-skilling and workplace relations are raised throughout, but the focus rarely strays from a narration of the details of the political or labour conflict. In a word, no reader will get everything they desire out of the accounts given. <italic>Ours to Master and to Own</italic> successfully paints a broad landscape of workers’ control, but the details in this sweeping vista are sometimes hazy.</p>
<p>The arrangement of the cases into contexts, however, deserves high accolades. The editors group the chapters into six sections. Part 1 gives a broad historical overview and theoretical debate. Part 2 deals with cases drawn from the early 20th century, many of which will be very new terrain for the reader. Part 3 discusses workers control under state socialism, while Part 4 is a varied collection of accounts of workers’ control during times of democratic or anti-colonial revolution. Part 5 details some accounts of worker resistance to the destructive neoliberal reformations of the 1970s and 1980s, and Part 6 ends the discussion with details of attempts at workers’ control since the 1990s. The excellent arrangement of these sections gives shape and structure to what would otherwise be an amorphous patchwork. There are patterns to this phenomenon that will become clearly visible to the reader as the book progresses. One of the more important lessons demonstrated is that worker self-management without a revolutionary consciousness is doomed to repeat the depredation of capitalism, and vice versa. The authors wisely keep their distance from ideological biases. They are unafraid to cut down labor unions, political parties, states, worker cooperatives and even the workers’ councils themselves. Ultimately, the book believes that ideology should serve the working class, and not the other way around.</p>
<p>The exclusion of some famous accounts of workers control, however, seems odd. It is puzzling to have two separate chapters on the short-lived experiments throughout Italy without a single mention of the 125 years of widespread workers’ control and revolutionary politics in its Emilia Romagna region. Whether the world-famous Mondragon worker cooperatives satisfies the criteria of a class-conscious movement is up for debate, but utterly ignoring their pioneering successes and failures feels like an elephant in the room.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <italic>Ours to Master and to Own</italic> is a masterful contribution that deserves serious attention from activists and academics. Ness and Azzellini’s ambitious collection may feel a bit uneven, but the book is far greater than the sum of its parts. The accounts of the ordinary workers in the book are rescued from their historical obsolescence to battle the pervasive scepticism of a post-capitalist society. <italic>Ours to Master and to Own</italic> is a must-read for anyone looking to advance the principles of democracy in their workplace.</p>
