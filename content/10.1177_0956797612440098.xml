<abstract>
<p>A central tenet of current memory theories is the independence of data-driven and conceptually driven priming. Although these types of repetition priming have different functional properties, it has remained unclear whether they are independent and additive or interact with each other. Therefore, we orthogonally combined these priming types in two experiments requiring occupation judgments for celebrities, represented by their faces or names. In both experiments, the sum of the effects of separate data-driven priming and conceptually driven priming equaled the effect of the combination of these priming types. These findings demonstrate for the first time the independence of data-driven and conceptually driven priming and so confirm a central tenet of current memory theories. This independence may thus be an important element for the development of future overarching memory theories.</p>

<p>Practice makes perfect. Repetition curtails the time it takes to recognize a person’s face or name and to retrieve the corresponding biographical knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612440098">Bruce &amp; Young, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612440098">Burton, 1998</xref>). The resulting response time (RT) benefits are examples of the effects of <italic>repetition priming</italic>, the paramount form of <italic>implicit</italic> (<italic>nondeclarative</italic>) memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612440098">Roediger &amp; McDermott, 1993</xref>). In contrast to <italic>semantic</italic> or <italic>associative</italic> priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0956797612440098">Bruce &amp; Valentine, 1986</xref>), which is usually short-lived (but may also be longer lasting, as shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0956797612440098">Becker, Moscovitch, Behrmann, &amp; Joordens, 1997</xref>), repetition priming affords facilitation that is long lasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0956797612440098">Cave, 1997</xref>), even if the face or name has been seen before only once. Repetition priming has been subdivided into data-driven priming and conceptually driven priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0956797612440098">Jacoby, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797612440098">Richardson-Klavehn &amp; Bjork, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Data-driven priming</italic> refers to facilitated identification or classification based on perceptual information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612440098">Fig. 1</xref>). In the domain of person recognition, it occurs when faces or names are identified repeatedly, as in, for example, a familiar/unfamiliar judgment task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0956797612440098">Bruce &amp; Valentine, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612440098">Burton, 1998</xref>). Data-driven priming is disrupted by perceptual changes between the initially encountered stimulus and the following one, for example, by inversion of an upright face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612440098">Boehm, Klostermann, Sommer, &amp; Paller, 2006</xref>), and is eliminated when the initial and subsequent stimuli are from different domains (e.g., when a name is encountered after the face corresponding to that name has been viewed; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612440098">Burton, Kelly, &amp; Bruce, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612440098">Ellis, Flude, Young, &amp; Burton, 1996</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>Illustration of relevant parts of the person recognition system. An observer can identify a person as familiar by either seeing the person’s face or reading the person’s name; associated conceptual information, such as the person’s occupation, can then be retrieved from semantic memory. Data-driven priming (i.e., faster identification) occurs when a given face or name has been processed and identified previously. Conceptually driven priming occurs when conceptual information associated with the identity has been retrieved previously, regardless of whether the previously processed stimulus was the person’s face or name.</p></caption>

<p><italic>Conceptually driven priming</italic> refers to facilitated classification based on conceptual knowledge in semantic memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612440098">Fig. 1</xref>). It occurs, for instance, when the face or name of a famous person is presented repeatedly while occupation judgments have to be made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0956797612440098">Burton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612440098">Johnston &amp; Barry, 2006</xref>). In contrast to data-driven priming, conceptually driven priming is not diminished by perceptual changes in a stimulus.</p>
<p>These two types of priming thus facilitate the processing of different kinds of information and show different functional properties. The relationship between the two different forms of priming is critical to the theoretical understanding of memory. In the study reported here, we addressed the question of whether data-driven priming and conceptually driven priming are truly independent.</p>
<p>Although the functional differences between data-driven priming and conceptually driven priming are well documented for the domains of faces and names, as well as for other domains, the question of whether these priming types are independent or interact has rarely been addressed. An interaction between priming types would challenge most memory theories, which assume that data-driven and conceptually driven priming are independent and thus should be additive when they occur conjointly. More specifically, the multiple-memory-systems view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797612440098">Squire, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797612440098">Tulving, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612440098">Tulving &amp; Schacter, 1990</xref>) postulates that data-driven and conceptually driven priming stem from different memory systems. Similarly, the multiple-component approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612440098">Moscovitch, 1992</xref>) posits that data-driven priming results from a perceptual input module and that conceptually driven priming results from a central interpretive, semantic system. Particularly relevant to faces and names is the person recognition model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612440098">Bruce &amp; Young, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612440098">Burton, 1998</xref>), which postulates three main processing stages: face or name perception, person identification, and access to associated conceptual or biographical knowledge (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612440098">Fig. 1</xref>). In this model, data-driven priming results from facilitation within the two initial stages, and conceptually driven priming results from facilitation within the conceptual-knowledge stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612440098">Burton, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Alternatively, it is conceivable that data-driven priming and conceptually driven priming interact with each other. Such interactions are predicted by early versions of the transfer-appropriate-processing framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0956797612440098">Morris, Bransford, &amp; Franks, 1977</xref>) that classify tasks as perceptual or conceptual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0956797612440098">Richardson-Klavehn &amp; Bjork, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612440098">Roediger, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612440098">Roediger &amp; Blaxton, 1987</xref>). In this framework, when participants perform one kind of task after another, the type of priming that occurs depends on the nature of the two tasks. Conceptually driven priming—but not data-driven priming—should occur when both tasks are conceptual, even when the same perceptual information is processed. In contrast, when both tasks are perceptual, only data-driven priming should occur. Recent versions of the transfer-appropriate-processing framework have shifted the focus from the dichotomy of perceptual and conceptual tasks to the overlap between processes occurring during the two tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612440098">Roediger, Buckner, &amp; McDermott, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612440098">Roediger &amp; McDermott, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0956797612440098">Tenpenny &amp; Shoben, 1992</xref>), and these versions—like the theories described in the preceding paragraph—would predict the independence of data-driven and conceptually driven priming.</p>
<p>Tentative evidence for the independence of different priming types comes from studies showing their co-occurrence. In one study, data-driven priming in face recognition resulted from facilitated face perception and face identification, which co-occurred when invoked conjointly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612440098">Boehm et al., 2006</xref>). In other studies, priming in conceptual and naming tasks was larger within a given domain than across domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612440098">Brown, Neblett, Jones, &amp; Mitchell, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612440098">Ellis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612440098">Johnston &amp; Barry, 2006</xref>), and that difference suggests the presence of both data-driven priming and conceptually driven (or naming) priming in these tasks.</p>
<p>Although these studies suggest that different priming types may co-occur, they fail to demonstrate the independence of these different types of priming because either the different priming types were not manipulated orthogonally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612440098">Boehm et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612440098">Brown et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612440098">Johnston &amp; Barry, 2006</xref>) or they were measured in different tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612440098">Ellis et al., 1996</xref>). The present study is the first to investigate the independence of data-driven and conceptually driven priming by measuring them both separately and conjointly in the same task.</p>
<p>In each of two experiments, we presented either the faces or names of celebrities in a final test, and participants classified the faces or names according to occupation (actor/nonactor). Some of these stimuli were unprimed, and others had been primed in one of three priming phases that preceded the final test. Each of these phases induced a different kind of priming: data driven priming, conceptually driven priming, or conjoint data and conceptually driven priming (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612440098">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0956797612440098">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In Experiment 1, faces were shown in the final test. Data-driven priming of some of these faces had been induced by presenting the faces of some celebrities (as well as unfamiliar persons) in a previous familiarity judgment task. Hence, when the familiar faces were repeated in the final test, any priming effect resulted from face processing and person identification; because the familiarity task had not required access to conceptual knowledge, conceptually driven priming would have been absent. Conceptually driven priming of other faces was induced by showing certain celebrities’ names in a prior occupation judgment task. When the famous faces were shown during the final occupation task, conceptual knowledge had to be accessed again, but the change from name to face stimuli precluded data-driven priming. Conjoint data-driven and conceptually driven priming of still other faces was induced by presenting celebrities’ faces in an occupation judgment task before the final occupation task. In the final test, repetition could facilitate face processing, person identification, and processing of conceptual knowledge, so both data-driven and conceptually driven priming were possible. Thus, in Experiment 1, primed faces in the final test had been primed in one of three ways. In addition, some celebrity faces in the final test were unprimed (i.e., they had not appeared in any of the three preceding tasks).</p>
<p>In Experiment 2, the final occupation judgment task was performed on the names of celebrities instead of their faces. The corresponding priming phases were the same as in Experiment 1, except that the domains of the stimuli (faces vs. names) were interchanged. For example, the familiarity task (data-driven priming) was conducted on names rather than faces (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612440098">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>If data-driven priming and conceptually driven priming independently facilitate processing, as predicted by most memory theories, both types of priming could contribute to performance in the final occupation task, and the effect of priming in the conjoint condition should equal the sum of the effects of data-driven priming and conceptually driven priming. However, if the two types of priming interact, the sum of the individual priming effects should differ from the conjoint-priming effect. According to early versions of the transfer-appropriate-processing framework, there should be no priming from the familiarity task, but priming in the final occupation task should be elicited to a similar degree by the earlier occupation decisions on faces and names. These predictions apply likewise to testing with names and with faces.</p>

<title>General Method</title>
<p>In each experiment, 52 adults with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated for course credit and for monetary credit for printing course work. Data of 4 participants in each experiment were disregarded because their individual overall accuracy in the final test was 64% or less (chance performance was 50%). The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the School of Psychology at Bangor University. All participants gave written informed consent.</p>
<p>Gray-scale facial images and written names of 200 celebrities were prepared, and assigned (counterbalanced across participants) to the four experimental conditions of each experiment. Unfamiliar stimuli used in the familiarity judgment task were comparable facial images of 50 celebrities from countries other than the United Kingdom and 50 unfamiliar British names.</p>
<p>Each experiment lasted approximately 50 min and consisted of the three different consecutive priming phases (in counterbalanced order), followed by the final test phase (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0956797612440098">Table 1</xref>). All phases were run back to back, and before each phase, participants received short verbal instructions about the task and information about the stimuli to be presented. Stimuli were presented individually for 700 ms against a black background on a CRT screen, followed by a white fixation cross, which was shown for 2,300 ms. The width and height of faces were 7.8° and 10.7°, respectively, and names (first name plus surname; presented in white) covered up to 7.6° and 1.0°, respectively. On each trial, participants responded by pressing the “F” or “J” key of a computer keyboard with the left or right index finger, respectively. Assignment of keys to responses (familiar/unfamiliar, actor/nonactor) was counterbalanced. Instructions emphasized both speed and accuracy.</p>
<p>Experiment 1 explored the independence of data-driven priming and conceptually driven priming for famous faces, and Experiment 2 did so for famous names. Data analyses were restricted to the final test of each experiment. Comparisons were made using two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic> tests, with a significance level (α) of .05.</p>

<p>The mean age of the 48 participants in Experiment 1 (11 males, 37 females) was 20 years (range = 18–42 years). According to self-reports, 41 participants were right-handed, and 7 were left-handed.</p>
<p>Accuracy in the final occupation task was 82.3% for faces in the data-driven priming condition, 82.2% for faces in the conceptually driven priming condition, 84.7% for faces in the conjoint-priming condition, and 80.3% for faces in the unprimed condition. Together, all these accuracies indicate that participants were familiar with most of the celebrities presented. For the analysis of priming effects, only data from trials on which the celebrity was classified correctly were used. Priming effects were assessed by subtracting the RT in each priming condition from the RT in the unprimed condition.

<p>Again, accuracy was high: 80.0% for names in the data-driven priming condition, 82.9% for names in the conceptually driven priming condition, 85.4% for names in the conjoint priming condition, and 79.8% for names in the unprimed condition.

<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>The results of our two experiments demonstrated both data-driven priming and conceptually driven priming in occupation judgment tasks. In the conjoint conditions, both priming types were present. Going beyond similar studies of co-occurring priming types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0956797612440098">Boehm et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0956797612440098">Brown et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0956797612440098">Ellis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0956797612440098">Johnston &amp; Barry, 2006</xref>), we orthogonally combined data-driven and conceptually driven priming while holding the test task constant and found, in each experiment, that the magnitude of conjoint priming equaled the sum of the magnitudes of data-driven priming and conceptually driven priming when measured separately. Thus, data-driven priming and conceptually driven priming not only may co-occur but also are in fact independent.</p>
<p>Our study provides strong evidence for the independence of data-driven and conceptually driven priming. This independence is a basic, albeit somewhat implicit, tenet of several major memory theories, such as the multiple-memory-systems view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0956797612440098">Squire, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0956797612440098">Tulving, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0956797612440098">Tulving &amp; Schacter, 1990</xref>), the multiple-component approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0956797612440098">Moscovitch, 1992</xref>), recent incarnations of the transfer-appropriate-processing framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612440098">Roediger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0956797612440098">Roediger &amp; McDermott, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0956797612440098">Tenpenny &amp; Shoben, 1992</xref>), and, most clearly, the face recognition model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0956797612440098">Bruce &amp; Young, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0956797612440098">Burton, 1998</xref>). These theories have been developed from different perspectives and in different psychological areas. Thus, they should not be considered as competing with one another. Instead, they are partly complementary and partly convergent. They vary in the incorporated stimulus domains (e.g., words, faces), the addressed memory types, and their main levels of explanation (process, structure, component, system). Although for some time, memory researchers have discussed the rapprochement of memory theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0956797612440098">Blaxton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0956797612440098">Gabrieli, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0956797612440098">Moscovitch, Vriezen, &amp; Goshen-Gottstein, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0956797612440098">Roediger et al., 1999</xref>), a comprehensive formulation is still missing. However, most large-scale memory theories include data-driven priming and conceptually driven priming and converge on assuming independence of these two major types of priming. Our findings provide strong support for this important element in the development of overarching memory theories.</p>
<p>The present findings are difficult to reconcile with early views of the transfer-appropriate-processing framework that classify tasks as either perceptual or conceptual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0956797612440098">Roediger, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0956797612440098">Roediger &amp; Blaxton, 1987</xref>). Because the occupation judgment task is conceptual, this framework would predict only conceptually driven priming in this task (e.g., priming in a conceptual task that uses object names and pictures; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0956797612440098">Vriezen, Moscovitch, &amp; Bellos, 1995</xref>). Such a prediction is at odds with the data-driven priming that we observed, and the reason for the absence of data-driven priming in the study by Vriezen et al. is unknown. However, faster responses in conceptual tasks with object names or pictures can reflect binding of stimuli to responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0956797612440098">Horner &amp; Henson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0956797612440098">Schacter, Dobbins, &amp; Schnyer, 2004</xref>), although such stimulus-response binding, in contrast to conventional priming, usually requires multiple study presentations. Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether stimulus-response binding generalizes to perceptual tasks and holds for person recognition and other domains.</p>
<p>Could there have been cross-contamination between tasks leading to conceptually driven priming in the data-driven priming condition when the familiarity task was preceded by a priming phase that induced conceptually driven priming? This was not the case because data-driven priming in both experiments was 5 ms smaller when order of priming phases was counterbalanced relative to when the familiarity task occurred first. Moreover, this reduction was comparable to the average reduction in the other two priming conditions when analyzed in the same way (Experiment 1: 5 ms; Experiment 2: 7 ms). These findings rule out such cross-contamination.</p>
<p>Although in Experiment 2, accuracy was higher in the conceptually driven priming condition than in the data-driven priming condition, and conceptually driven priming was smaller than data-driven priming, there was no speed-accuracy trade-off between conceptually driven and data-driven priming. Compared with the baseline, unprimed condition, both the conceptually driven priming condition and the data-driven priming condition resulted in faster RT without decreasing accuracy. Moreover, conditional-accuracy functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0956797612440098">Lappin &amp; Disch, 1972</xref>) within each of these conditions indicated that accuracy increased with speed.</p>
<p>To conclude, we have shown for the first time that data-driven priming and conceptually driven priming act independently. This finding refutes early versions of the transfer-appropriate-processing framework. However, it confirms a basic tenet of most major memory theories, such as the multiple-component approach, the multiple-memory-systems view, the person recognition model, and later versions of the transfer-appropriate-processing framework. The present data provide evidence for a fundamental yet previously untested assumption of leading memory theories and therefore may be important for the development of a comprehensive theory of memory.</p>
