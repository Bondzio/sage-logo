<p>As a clinical psychologist in private practice, I often assess and treat individuals presenting with executive functioning (EF) issues. I was looking forward to reading Dr. Barkley’s new book devoted to this important area. The title promised to answer the what, how, and why of EF; the inside of the cover guaranteed a “ground-breaking volume” that “sheds new light” on this critical area by offering a comprehensive model of EF. The book indeed does deliver on these claims. The writing is clear, rich, and “dense.” Dense in the sense that I found myself needing to reread passages and sentences to appreciate a nuance or think through a concept. In many ways, the experience was similar to my early days in graduate school as I struggled with a new vocabulary and concepts. Like graduate school, the effort was worth it!</p>
<p>Chapter 1 does an excellent job of laying out the problems with the concept of EF as it is operationally defined (or not defined), assessed, and conceptualized. The common approach is to look at EF through the lens of cognitive psychometrically based models. These models fail to capture or even address the impact of EF problems on other crucial areas of functioning including the social, economic, or emotional domains. Barkley proposes a new model that has the social purpose of EF on “center stage” (p. 35); a conceptual shift that has notable implications for helping people manage their behavior, relationships, and lives.</p>
<p>The next seven chapters are devoted to explaining and developing Barkley’s extended phenotype model of EF. The author skillfully moves the reader from the pre-executive level though the executive function levels using each chapter to build a comprehensive model. Critical and helpful parts of this model are the eight conceptualized developmental capacities that are present within each level. They include the following: the spatial capacity, the temporal capacity, the motivational capacity, inhibitory capacity, the conceptual/abstract capacity, the behavioral/structural capacity, the social capacity, and cultural capacity. These capacities are dimensional versus categorical readily serving as diagnostic markers for each level. The definition rendered by the author in Chapter 8 is the “final definition” of his proposed EF theory:
<disp-quote>
<p>The use of self-directed actions so as to choose goals and to select, enact, and sustain actions across time toward those goals usually selected in the context of others often relying on social and cultural means for the maximization of one’s long-term welfare as the person defines that to be.” (p. 171)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With this thorough, systematic explanation as a background, Chapter 9 takes this theory and applies it to our understanding of EF and its disorders. Disorders are defined in this chapter not by <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (<italic>DSM</italic>) criteria but rather within the scope of impairment in specific EF areas, for example, impairment of self-motivation or disturbance of emotional regulation. This categorical structure is helpful in providing the reader with a way to integrate this theory into their clinical thinking.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 is devoted to the evaluation and clinical management of EF deficits. Consistent with the tone of the book, this chapter does not provide a clear-cut formula to assessing and treating EF problems. Dr. Barkley wants the clinician and researcher to “broaden their views of EF treatments beyond that suggested by the traditional psychometric view of EF” (p. 198). In fact, he is critical of traditional psychological testing that is psychometrically based. Many of today’s clinicians doing assessment would agree. The contemporary standard of practice for clinical assessment is that it is a collaborative process between the examinee and the assessor; it is not just a score. Barkley writes that using EF tests alone is not the correct procedure; rather he espouses the use of archival data, structured interviews, and rating scales—a practice that should already be a part of clinical assessment for EF impairment. The author’s point would have been reinforced and perhaps made even stronger if he had included clinical examples or case studies.</p>
<p>The final section in the book is on the clinical management of EF deficits. The extended phenotype model encourages clinicians and researchers to look beyond cognitive functioning to more complex behaviors within a social and cultural context. Time management, self-restraint, self-motivation, problem-solving of all types, and affective self-regulation are such behaviors with implications for the individual, the family, and the community. Rather than a point-by-point list of recommendations, Barkley outlines a number of principles of EF deficit management. While some of these principles are clinically known and practiced, it was important to look at them from the prospective of the extended phenotype model of EF. Particularly helpful principles included externalize information, externally represent or remove gaps in time, externalize motivation, and intervene at the point of performance in natural settings.</p>
<p>It did seem like an additional chapter would have been important devoted to needed research in this area. In understanding the extended phenotype model of EF, many possible areas of scientific study come to mind. I would have appreciated having the author list or detail what he thinks are prioritized areas of research.</p>
<p>Dr. Barkley writes at the conclusion of his book that he hopes that the extended phenotype model has a “merit and utility in understanding the nature of EF” (p. 209). I believe that it does. As a clinician, I found myself thinking more about the what, how, and why of EF assessment, management, and treatment using this stimulating new model.</p>
