<p>This article introduces the Maritime Piracy Data (MPD), a dataset dedicated to understanding the nature, dynamics, and causes of contemporary piracy and armed robbery against ships. Data on maritime piracy are presented in two formats: an event set and an annual, country-level set. The event data track every maritime piracy attack reported to the International Maritime Bureau’s Piracy Reporting Center (IMB/PRC) for a total of 3,413 events between 2000 and 2009. Entries provide event details including date, geo-coded location, attacker nationality, victim nationality, success, vessel type, violence level, loot taken, and/or ransom demanded. The annual data count the number of piracy events emanating from the world’s 147 coastal countries over the same decade for a total of 1,470 observations. Entries include country-level information regarding the maritime sector including coastal shipping traffic, coastline length, seaports, distances to major sea lane chokepoints, and merchant marine size. The article describes the main features of the data, provides descriptive statistics, and briefly illustrates their potential utility for research. The MPD has potential utility for scholars examining non-traditional threats generated by non-state actors; for those studying the potential relationships between governance and conflict on land and piracy at sea; and for individuals engaged in policy-relevant analyses evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of counter-piracy strategies and tactics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Concern over non-traditional security threats, or those threats generated by non-state actors in weak states, has recently increased dramatically.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022343312442520">1</xref>
</sup> Many now believe that significant international insecurity derives from transnational crime, terrorism, weapons trafficking, civil war spillover, and the spread of disease across borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022343312442520">Patrick, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022343312442520">Rice, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022343312442520">Rotberg, 2002</xref>). Growing popular anxiety has pressed leaders and scholars to devise strategies to counter and eliminate these new threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022343312442520">Bush, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022343312442520">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022343312442520">Obama, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022343312442520">Fearon &amp; Laitin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022343312442520">Herbst, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022343312442520">Krasner, 2004</xref>). However, given the perceived importance of non-traditional threats, they have received surprisingly little systematic scholarly attention thus far.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022343312442520">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>One such threat is maritime piracy, which is currently regionally concentrated in Southeast Asia, the Horn of Africa, and the Gulf of Guinea, and is believed to operate in concert with other threats such as terrorism, weapons, and human and drug trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022343312442520">Chalk, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022343312442520">Goldwyn &amp; Morrison, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022343312442520">Mak, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022343312442520">Murphy, 2010</xref>). A varied piracy literature already exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022343312442520">Anderson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022343312442520">de Groot &amp; Shortland, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022343312442520">Eklöf, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022343312442520">Hansen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022343312442520">Hastings, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022343312442520">Kontorovich, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022343312442520">Leeson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022343312442520">Menkhaus, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022343312442520">Middleton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022343312442520">Young, 2007</xref>). However, the wealth of data regarding piracy now available permits greater insights into the phenomenon. The Maritime Piracy Data (MPD) presented herein was created to provide leverage on important security questions regarding maritime piracy. For example, what are the causes and consequences of piracy? Is there a relationship between piracy and political violence, economic decline or governmental collapse on land? What strategies most efficiently deter or counter pirate attacks? And is piracy related to organized crime, terrorism, or insurgency? This article briefly introduces the MPD, presents some descriptive statistics, and demonstrates their key features for potential scholarly research.<sup>

<title>Overview of the dataset</title>
<p>The Maritime Piracy Data are presented in an event format and an annual format. The event dataset includes an entry for every pirate attack; the annual dataset counts the total number of attacks produced by each country. Both were created using detailed reports produced by the International Maritime Bureau’s Piracy Reporting Center (IMB/PRC). Victimized, or nearly victimized, vessels report incidents of piracy directly to the IMB/PRC. The direct reporting process has two foreseeable effects on data quality. One advantage is that the data are not subject to the influence of, or compiled by, governments. This ensures consistent coding across countries; that data availability and/or quality are not a function of state capacity; and that the data have not been manipulated for political purposes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the collection method may also generate blind spots. The IMB/PRC are subsidiaries of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), a non-governmental business organization mandated to advance the interests of the global shipping industry. As such, the data probably underestimate piracy against small, local ships and personal vessels uninvolved in international trade and, therefore, unfamiliar with the IMB/PRC. Additionally, information regarding incident reporting is only available in English, which likely further depresses reporting for smaller-scale incidents where the victims are non-English speaking. Nevertheless, the data produced by the IMB/PRC are consistent with other global reports and have been widely adopted by international institutions like the IMO because no alternative sources resolve the potential undercounting problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022343312442520">IMO, 2010</xref>).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022343312442520">4</xref>
</sup> Still, scholars interested in using these data for regional or country specific studies are advised to seek out supplemental local data wherever possible.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022343312442520">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>According to the IMB/PRC (2009: 3), piracy is ‘an act of boarding or attempting to board any ship with the apparent intent to commit theft or any other crime and with the apparent intent or capability to use force in the furtherance of that act’. Incidents fitting this definition of piracy and armed robbery against ships populate the dataset. It is worth noting that these crimes are not all considered maritime piracy according to international law. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the authoritative legal standard, alternatively defines maritime piracy as<disp-quote>
<p>any illegal act of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft, and directed: (i) <italic>on the high seas</italic>, against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or property on board such ship or aircraft; (ii) against a ship, aircraft, persons or property <italic>in a place outside the jurisdiction of any state</italic>.... (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022343312442520">UN, 1982</xref>: Article 101)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022343312442520">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Following the law, piracy must occur on the high seas and not within a state’s territorial waters. If piracy-like attacks occur within any state’s jurisdiction, then they are considered domestic crimes to be handled at that government’s discretion. Many instances fitting a common sense understanding of maritime piracy are excluded under this definition because piratical acts often take place where a state theoretically – even if not effectively – has jurisdiction. The IMB/PRC definition is now in wider practical use than the legal definition. Still, a user could easily filter for attacks meeting the UNCLOS definition by mapping the geographic coordinates and eliminating attacks in ports and within territorial waters.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022343312442520">7</xref>

</p>
<sec id="section3-0022343312442520">
<title>Event data</title>
<p>The event dataset captures attempted and successful pirate attacks during the period 2000–09. It counts 3,413 total attacks. In most cases, the IMB/PRC reports identify the country’s flag flown by the victimized vessel and the pirates’ country of origin. In cases where pirate origins were not provided – when attacks occurred in international waters with multiple littoral states and were listed as ‘unknown’ – the nearest littoral state was considered the pirate state. This approximation was necessary in 612 attacks.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022343312442520">8</xref>
</sup> When an attack was equidistant from two or more states or the location was absent, the <italic>piratestate</italic> variable was left missing and coded –999.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022343312442520">9</xref>
</sup> This –999 code was also used when the victim vessel’s origin was not reported for the <italic>victimstate</italic> variable.</p>
<p>Each event is coded as (0) a suspicious vessel, (1) an attempted attack, or (2) a successful attack.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022343312442520">10</xref>
</sup> Because the IMB/PRC does not follow up on kidnapping and ransom (k&amp;r) events or hijackings, an event coded ‘successful’ indicates that the pirates successfully commandeered the ship. It does not indicate that the pirates actually received a ransom payment, since not every attack is a k&amp;r event. Again though, information regarding pirated ships’ ultimate dispositions could be added to the data to assess, for instance, the determinants of successful or failed k&amp;r attempts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022343312442520">11</xref>
</sup> Each event is also coded according to the intensity of the violence employed: (0) no reported violence, (1) armed attack with threats but without physical violence, (2) armed attack with physical violence but without deaths, and (3) armed attack with physical violence and one or more deaths. The location of each pirate event is provided in geographic coordinates where available, as well as in geo-coded locations compatible with ArcGIS. Pirate events reported without geographic coordinates were estimated except when the location was too vague (e.g. ‘en route’ or ‘off Nigerian coast’). This yielded locations for 3,189 out of 3,413 events.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022343312442520">12</xref>
</sup> </p>
<p>Two additional sets of variables record the nature of the pirate attack: one reports the loot taken and the other, the ransom. Each has a dummy variable indicating whether or not loot or ransom was involved in the attack and a variable describing the loot taken or the ransom demanded. Many attacks included both. The goods stolen ranged from drums of oil and cargo taken to hawk on land to the crew’s personal belongings to equipment useful for subsequent pirate operations such as motors and lifeboats.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022343312442520">13</xref>
</sup> Finally, victimized vessels were divided into ten categories by type: (1) barge or tug, (2) carrier, (3) chemical tanker, (4) container ship, (5) fishing boat, trawler or vessel, (6) general cargo, (7) LNG, LPG, oil tanker, (8) tanker, product tanker, (9) yacht, leisure craft, passenger ship, and (10) other.</p>

<sec id="section4-0022343312442520">
<title>Annual data</title>
<p>The annual data count the number of pirate attacks emanating from each country during the period 2000–09. It is panel data, so there are ten annual observations for every country with a seacoast (147), totaling 1,470 observations. The variables cover each state’s geography and maritime sector on the intuition that location and territorial character are likely associated with the propensity to produce piracy. Countries that rely on maritime industries have a supply of capable potential pirates, and those with longer coastlines offer more opportunities to pirate and require more resources to police effectively. Therefore, coastline length and total area were collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022343312442520">CIA, 2010</xref>). A potential measure of maritime dependence using these variables could be coastline as a percentage of total area.</p>
<p>Two variables measuring the distance to the nearest sealane chokepoint were also created. Countries near or adjacent to chokepoints give pirates a tactical advantage over passing ships, which must slow down to maneuver<fig id="fig1-0022343312442520" position="float">

</fig> through these areas and avoid collisions. A categorical variable, <italic>chokepoint</italic>, indicates the chokepoint to which the distance measures refer: (1) Strait of Hormuz, (2) Straits of Malacca, (3) Suez Canal, (4) Bab-el-Mandeb, (5) Panama Canal, (6) Turkish Straits (Bosporus). <italic>Chokepoint1</italic> measures the distance (in nautical miles) from the country’s capital city to the nearest chokepoint (or nearest port city if the capital is not one). <italic>Chokepoint2</italic> measures the distance from the nearest deep-water port to the chokepoint.</p>
<p>The density of a country’s coastal shipping traffic helps to estimate the opportunity and potential loot for would-be pirates. Unfortunately, little is publicly available; most shipping data are proprietary. Further, while port-to-port information is often available, it is a poor indicator of pirate opportunity, particularly for weak states. For example, data for Somalia’s major northern ports (Bosasso and Berbera), adjacent to the Gulf of Aden, show they served 400 and 698 ships respectively during 1999 (the most recent year available) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022343312442520">UNCTAD, 2000</xref>). Yet the Gulf of Aden’s annual traffic was 20,000 ships and, at least insofar as proximity is concerned, those ships were potentially vulnerable to Somali piracy. Consequently, a dummy variable indicating a nearby shipping lane carrying at least 5,000 ships per year, <italic>traffic</italic>, was created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022343312442520">Kaluza et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, two variables account for the size of a country’s merchant marine. One indicates the total number of ships (<italic>mmtotal</italic>), whether domestic or foreign-owned. The other counts the number of domestic ships (<italic>mmdom</italic>), or those registered by a country’s nationals at home and abroad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022343312442520">CIA, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Descriptive statistics</title>
<p>The maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022343312442520">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022343312442520">2</xref> show worldwide patterns of piracy, generated using the event data and ArcGIS, for 2000 and 2009. During the decade, piracy was geographically concentrated in Southeast Asia and Africa, occurring most frequently within the Straits of Malacca, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Guinea, and the Indian Ocean. The five largest producers of pirate attacks were Indonesia, Somalia, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and Malaysia (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022343312442520">Figure 3</xref>). Together those states accounted for approximately 59% of attacks worldwide. Early in the decade, the Straits of Malacca’s littoral states, particularly Indonesia, produced the most piracy. From 2003 onward, Indonesian-based attacks declined steadily. Piracy in Somalia and by Somalis in international waters increased dramatically from 2006 onward.</p>
<sec id="section6-0022343312442520">
<title>Event data</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312442520">Table I</xref>, the highest number of pirate attacks (468) occurred in 2000 and the lowest number (239) occurred in 2006. The annual variation was not particularly large, however, ranging from 7 to 13.71%. Higher numbers were concentrated in the beginning of the decade and in 2009. In nearly 47% of the attacks pirates successfully commandeered the vessel or successfully stole from onboard. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022343312442520">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0022343312442520">5</xref> show attempts and successes in the Gulf of Aden and the Straits of Malacca, the decade’s piracy hotspots. The maps suggest that there may be an inverse relationship between pirate success and the distance from land, because successful attacks are often concentrated in narrow waterways. The visual correlation is especially stark in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022343312442520">Figure 4</xref>, where there are <fig id="fig2-0022343312442520" position="float">

</fig>many attempts but few successes in the vast Indian Ocean to the east of Somalia, but there is a greater density of success in the Gulf of Aden to the north. Of course, many other factors are involved in determining pirate success including anti-piracy operations, onboard defensive measures, and seasonal changes, many of which vary over time and would therefore go undetected in these illustrative maps.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0022343312442520">Figure 6</xref> reports pirate success rates. Worldwide, piracy was most successful early in the decade, hitting 53% in 2002 and 63% in 2003 (54% and 63% excluding Somalia). In every other year, success rates fluctuated between 38% and 49%. In Somalia, excepting a fluke of small numbers in 2002, the rate has tended to be lower. In its best year, 2008, Somali piracy was successful only 40% of the time.

This likely contributed to perceptions that Somali piracy was extraordinary. With only one year of data post-2008, any trends are mostly speculative. Preliminarily though, it appears that Somalis’ successes inspired many more attacks in 2009, while international efforts in the Gulf of Aden and shipboard defensive measures depressed the success rate.<sup>

<p>Globally, over 40% of pirate attacks involved no violence whatsoever. Referring again to the descriptive statistics in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343312442520">Table I</xref>, many nonviolent attacks were petty thefts or attempted but unsuccessful attacks. A majority, some 55%, involved violence or the threat of violence, and 110 attacks involved violence that caused the death of at least one victim. Regarding hijackings or k&amp;r attempts, it makes sense that pirates do not often kill their hostages; receiving a ransom depends on relinquishing their captives alive.</p>
<p>A quarter of all reported attacks were against carrier vessels. Cargo ships, container ships, and product tankers made up the next largest percentages of attacked vessels. Chemical tankers constituted an additional 8.73% of attacks (293). Though they have garnered disproportionate media attention, small, personal crafts comprised just over 3% of attacks.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022343312442520">15</xref>

<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343312442520">Table II</xref> shows that most countries, in most years, produced no pirate attacks. Two hundred and fifty-nine country-years saw between one and five pirate attacks produced. Seventy-nine country-years had between six and 20 attacks, and another 29 had between 21 and 91. Only six country-years saw more than 100 attacks.</p>
<p>Precisely half of all countries had at least 5,000 ships passing off of their shores annually. The lengths of countries’ coastlines vary considerably, as do the numbers of domestic ports. Canada’s seacoast is an extreme outlier, at 202,080 km, with nearly 150,000 kilometers more than the country with the next lengthiest coastline. Seventy-three countries have coastlines of 1,000 kilometers or less. An additional 21 countries have between 1,001 and 2,000 km. Finally, 51 countries have from 2,000 km to 54,000 km. Of coastal states, 41.5% have less than five major seaports, while another 33.3% have between six and 20. Another 32 countries have from 21 to 100 ports and only five have more. The USA has the most: 551 major ports.</p>

Looking only at countries’ domestically owned merchant marine, the picture changes. Notably, China replaces Panama as the country with the most ships and Panama’s total declines by thousands to 932. Scholars might use information regarding FOCs to uncover whether vessels registered to these countries – and held to lower shipping standards – are more likely to be attacked, or successfully attacked, than others. This could speak to selection, for example are pirates attacking ‘low-hanging fruit’ or lucrative targets such as oil tankers? Of course, they are not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>The MPD can be used in studies ranging from security studies to conflict processes. The event data are particularly well-suited for analyzing piracy’s micro-level dynamics and can be aggregated according to user preferences. In Somalia, scholars note that pirate attacks are launched predominantly from one region with four major pirate ports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022343312442520">Hansen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022343312442520">Coggins, 2011</xref>). The geo-coded locations of pirate attacks could indicate whether, as is commonly claimed, Somali regions that experienced illegal dumping or overfishing disproportionately produced pirates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022343312442520">Hansen, 2009</xref>: 13).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022343312442520">18</xref>
</sup> More generally, they can help to uncover what local circumstances engender or inhibit piracy. For example, why does northern Somalia produce so much piracy while Yemen, across the Gulf of Aden, produces so little? This kind of work might eventually yield models capable of forecasting attacks or identifying piracy-prone regions. Regarding micro-level effects, scholars have found that violent conflict causes decreased productivity in local fishing industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022343312442520">Hendrix &amp; Glaser, 2011</xref>). Piracy may have similar negative economic consequences if fishermen cannot take to the water and traders avoid pirate ports. Micro-level conflict analyses have mostly been restricted to land, but there is great potential to examine whether and how piracy is related to war, violence, crime, and economics.</p>
<p>The event data are also suitable for policy analysis. Considerable controversy surrounds ongoing international counter-piracy efforts in Somalia. Analysts could investigate whether counter-piracy tactics including increased port security, the maritime corridor, naval escorts or shipboard security are effective using a quasi-experimental research design. Which tactics are deterring or combating piracy? Are they worth the cost? Are successful anti-piracy strategies elsewhere instructive or is Somalia unique? Will counter-piracy tactics work across time or will pirates learn and adapt? These studies could also incorporate and compare data from the Straits of Malacca, where counter-piracy has had marked success.</p>
<p>The annual data are most appropriate for cross-national country-level studies examining how a state’s economic, political, and social conditions influence its propensity towards piracy. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022343312442520">Hastings (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022343312442520">de Groot &amp; Shortland (2010)</xref> suggest that state failure creates hospitable conditions for certain types of piracy, but inhospitable conditions for others. And <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022343312442520">Jablonski &amp; Oliver (forthcoming)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022343312442520">Daxecker &amp; Prins (2011)</xref> suggest that global maritime piracy patterns are tied to a country’s institutional and macro-economic conditions. Another topic about which there is little agreement is the extent to which piracy is related to crime and corruption or related to other non-traditional threats like terrorism and illegal trafficking. Existing qualitative and theoretical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022343312442520">Burnett, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022343312442520">Leeson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022343312442520">Mak, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022343312442520">Young, 2007</xref>) suggest several causal mechanisms connecting piracy, crime, insurgency, and terrorism that might be explored using the annual data. Why has there been so little maritime terrorism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022343312442520">Chalk, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022343312442520">Murphy, 2010</xref>)? When is piracy used as a tool for insurgency? How ‘organized’ is the crime of piracy? Moreover, the data can easily be combined with the major international relations and conflict datasets.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article introduces the Maritime Piracy Data dedicated to the contemporary problem of piracy and armed robbery against ships. The dataset offers researchers an unparalleled and accessible accounting of global trends in maritime piracy. Scholars can use it to analyze the causes, dynamics, and consequences of piracy and provide meaningful insights into how piracy might be deterred, limited, and stopped. Further, the data can help to evaluate the efficiency of ongoing counter-piracy efforts. Finally, though piracy is a security problem in its own right, the MPD can be combined with other datasets to better understand the dynamics of insurgency, transnational crime, and economics on land.</p>
<p>The MPD offer an important contribution to understanding the non-traditional threat of piracy. Future versions will include the ultimate disposition of hijacked and ransomed ships, give greater detail regarding ransoms, and track the fates of pirate perpetrators. The data will be updated bi-annually.</p>

<p>Some claim that piracy is underreported by as much as 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022343312442520">Chalk, 2008</xref>: 7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022343312442520">Hastings, 2009</xref>: 217). There are many potential reasons for this: lost time at sea dealing with law enforcement, inefficacy, potential insurance rate hikes, exposing the ship’s own unlawful behavior, even embarrassment. While underreporting obscures the true rate of piracy, it does not introduce any known, additional systematic bias into the data.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0022343312442520">
<label>5</label>
<p>For example, the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) provides piracy reports for Asia (2007–11). Annual totals for the ReCAAP and MPD data show slight variation for the three years of overlap, but the MPD does not appear to systematically undercount events relative to ReCAAP. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022343312442520">2007–09</xref>, ReCAAP counts 100, 96, and 101 attacks, while the MPD counts 107, 88, and 101 attacks. However, both may be biased due to factors described in footnote 4 as they rely on a similar reporting scheme. </p>

<p>One potential fix would be to redistribute FOC states’ victimizations according to the proportion of ships from each foreign country flying its flag. Continuing with the Panama example, the CIA reports that the largest foreign owner was Japan, with 2,347 ships or 37% of Panama’s total merchant marine. Therefore, we would distribute 37% of Panama’s victimizations (rounded to the nearest whole number) to Japan. This would yield more accurate estimates of those affected by piracy.</p>
