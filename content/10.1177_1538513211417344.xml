<abstract>
<p>In the last quarter century, the city of Los Angeles has suffered a chronic housing shortage due to exclusive zoning policies tied to the rise of antigrowth advocates over developers as the prime determinants of land use policy. This article considers the history of two major land use reforms affecting the city of Los Angeles in the 1980s: the General Plan Zoning Code Consistency Program (GPZCP) and Proposition U. These reforms represented the decline of the growth machine in 1980s Los Angeles and demonstrate the viability of an antigrowth regime in a large, non-suburban jurisdiction. This shift has not necessarily led to more democratic planning in Los Angeles. The GPZCP and Proposition U instead represented the empowerment of new antigrowth elites at the expense of old capital-driven elites. This has been to the detriment of hopeful homeowners and renters seeking economic and social opportunities in the city of Los Angeles.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The mission of this study is twofold. First, it will demonstrate the viability of an antigrowth regime in a large central city by investigating the dismantling of the growth machine in 1980s Los Angeles. Second, it will explore some of the impacts of this dismantling, and in effect, raise questions about the virtues and pitfalls of the growth machine. The decline of the growth machine and its consequences will be discussed in the context of two initiatives in particular: the General Plan Zoning Consistency Program (GPZCP) and Proposition U.</p>
<p>In sociologist Harvey Molotch’s influential essay, <italic>The Growth Machine: Toward a Political Economy of Place</italic>, he describes capitalist cities as “growth machines,” in which a land-based elite persuades the government to implement permissive land use policies so that the bulk of profits return to this elite.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1538513211417344">1</xref></sup> The benefits espoused by proponents of the growth machine, such as lower unemployment and superior public services, typically prove to be negligible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1538513211417344">2</xref></sup> Molotch’s study was influential among many, reflecting a grassroots reaction against unquestioned growth in many of the nation’s cities. The study reflected a trend in the 1970s and 1980s of planners turning against the developer-driven mode of growth that had dominated in previous decades.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1538513211417344">3</xref></sup> Clarence Stone noted this shift differentiating between the emerging “middle-class progressive regimes,” focused on issues such as environmental protection and historic preservation, and powerful “development regimes” focused on unbridled growth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1538513211417344">4</xref></sup> Brindley, Rydin, and Stoker note that in the 1980s, when neoliberal policies were so strongly guiding the governments of the United States and Britain, regimes less friendly toward growth could certainly arise and gain traction at the local level.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1538513211417344">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 1987, Molotch collaborated with John R. Logan to write <italic>Urban Fortunes: The Political Economy of Place</italic>. Here the growth machine was reexamined for its role of asserting “exchange value,” the market value of land, over “use value,” or the social value of land. The authors wrote: “The pursuit of exchange values in the city does not necessarily result in the maximization of use values for others. Indeed, the simultaneous push for both goals is inherently contradictory ….”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1538513211417344">6</xref></sup> A significant body of literature has coalesced around Molotch’s views presenting empirical evaluations of land use policies to further draw out the particulars of the challenges to the growth machine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1538513211417344">7</xref></sup> Studies found that the more effective challenges to the growth machine were a suburban phenomenon. As researchers Schneider and Teske noted, “it is easier to solve collective action problems in neighborhoods than in larger spatial units, and it may be easier to solve these problems in suburbs than in large central cities.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1538513211417344">8</xref></sup> Jurisdictions where growth machines were successfully challenged were in addition characterized by a white-collar majority.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1538513211417344">9</xref></sup> Successful antigrowth coalitions assert that “use value” is not always or even often achieved through the expansion of the marketplace; alternatively, they “seek to debunk the myth promulgated by the growth machine that the marketplace will provide economic benefits to everyone while protecting the environment and contributing to stable neighborhoods.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1538513211417344">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Antigrowth advocates have posited nongrowth or slow growth as alternatives to capitalist-driven planning, framing growth, in the words of Finkler, Popper, and Toner as “a legitimate question for public choice ….”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1538513211417344">11</xref></sup> However, the public in the United States is problematically limited to that narrowly defined by municipal or even submunicipal community boundaries because land use power is exercised from city halls. Justice Hall of the New Jersey Supreme Court, in his 1975 opinion on the first Mt. Laurel case, argued that market-serving development interests on the other hand recognize the wider public demand, for housing especially, and their accommodation to some extent must be necessary in order for land use regulation to serve, and not impede, the advancement of the general welfare.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1538513211417344">12</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section2-1538513211417344">
<title>The Los Angeles Growth Machine and Early Challenges</title>
<p>The concept of the growth machine has been applied to Los Angeles by critics of the real estate industry’s traditional influence on zoning policy there.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1538513211417344">13</xref></sup> In the history of planning and zoning in Los Angeles, the pre–World War II era of overzoning documented by Fogelson, and the postwar failure to contain urbanization in the San Fernando Valley, documented by Case and Gilles, unmistakably bear some markings of the growth machine. In the first case, small-scale land holders persuaded members of City Council to grant zoning designations that maximized their profits. Commercial designations were consequently granted nearly everywhere commercial development may ever be imaginable, virtually all along the city’s numerous broad boulevards. This “overzoning” for commercial use benefited the market, at least initially, but much to the detriment of the quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1538513211417344">14</xref></sup> This trend was criticized both by elite developers seeking stability in a more rigorously controlled environment, especially members of the Real Estate Board, and by the planning establishment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1538513211417344">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a second case, plans to pace urban growth with service provision and preserve agricultural uses in the San Fernando Valley in the 1940s were thwarted by the close relationships of large-scale tract developers with zoning board officials and City Council members.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1538513211417344">16</xref></sup> By the mid-1950s, the goal of urban containment in an agricultural setting had proven unachievable, and rezoning to urban uses was occurring without any reference to plans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1538513211417344">17</xref></sup> Under the growth machine, when zoning could not live up to the expectations of planners, plans were redefined to accommodate zoning trends. The 1955 Master Plan for the San Fernando Valley advocated halving the amount of land in agricultural zones and increasing by nearly 50 percent the amount of land in manufacturing zones.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1538513211417344">18</xref></sup> In the San Fernando Valley, planners tended to tolerate a situation of zoning “wagging the planning dog,” as Richard Babcock put it, in order to facilitate developer wishes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1538513211417344">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>What is unclear about the Los Angeles growth machine, at least in the second case, is whether the developers gained an undue reward, given that significant communities of middle-class homeowners coalesced within the residential communities produced by this elite. Molotch gives little attention to any potential virtues of the growth machine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1538513211417344">20</xref></sup> The Los Angeles case presents the predicament that the suppression of developers’ ability to enhance exchange values through development has preserved use value for current residents, but reduced potential use value to those excluded from the city by stifled supply and rising costs. As Logan and Molotch observed, “An apartment building, for example, provides a ‘home’ for residents (use value) while at the same time generating rent for the owners (exchange value).”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1538513211417344">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), passed in 1970, represented a significant step toward empowering homeowners against developer interests. In 1972, the California Supreme Court ruled that CEQA applied to all projects permitted by any government agency in the state, in the case <italic>Friends of Mammoth v. Board of Supervisors</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1538513211417344">22</xref></sup> Consequently, CEQA resulted in the requirement of performance-based evaluations for nearly all new development. These evaluations were intended to identify existing natural and man-made resources at development sites, and mandated the mitigation of developments’ negative impacts on these resources. Each local government was charged with assessing the environmental impacts of development in line with state guidelines. This was not without its costs: one 1980 survey found that statewide, “over designing” by developers in order to avoid triggering Environmental Impact Reports (EIRs) was contributing to the inflation of housing costs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1538513211417344">23</xref></sup> The costs of mitigation could have the impact of deterring less financially equipped developers altogether. Even when developers were not deterred, critics argued higher costs were passed on to consumers in terms of costlier housing units.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1538513211417344">24</xref></sup> A 2010 article by Paul Shigley of the <italic>California Planning and Development Report</italic> in the American Planning Association’s magazine <italic>Planning</italic> put it simply: “Go to almost any planning conference in California, and you are likely to find sessions about how CEQA prevents good planning. Viewed exclusively through an EIR, a high-density infill project often looks worse than a low-density greenfield subdivision.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1538513211417344">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Los Angeles Planning Department rebuked the preference of antigrowth advocates for development displacement even before CEQA: “By forcing people elsewhere,” the Department wrote in its 1970 Annual Report, “we simply leave the problem for future generations to solve … asking everyone to take their cars and pollute some other region is not the answer.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1538513211417344">26</xref></sup> The traffic displaced from a congested area will go somewhere else where there simply may not be a problem yet, and saving a rare old growth tree in a core location may be at the cost of sacrificing less unique but assumedly purposeful vegetation at the urban periphery.</p>
<p>As effective as CEQA was in discouraging development in Los Angeles and other core municipalities, zoning remained permissive in Los Angeles, allowing in the 1970s for 9.9 million people.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1538513211417344">27</xref></sup> In the 1980s, the state-mandated GPZCP greatly reduced this figure. In a separate move, antigrowth advocates successfully passed the referendum entitled “Proposition U” in 1986 to halve allowable FAR in the bulk of the city’s commercial zones, effectively cutting off the possibility of higher density commercial and residential development in those areas. These two actions, major hallmarks for community empowerment against developer interests in Los Angeles, spelled the fall of the growth machine in the city.</p>

<title>The GPZCP</title>
<p>Zoning’s consistency with planning is widely regarded by planners as a worthy pursuit; however, it may not be when planning represents special interests. The sacrifice of Los Angeles’ Comprehensive Plan to antigrowth interests began in the 1970s when Planning Director Calvin Hamilton sought to bring the Planning Department in line with antigrowth community groups, endorsing a density rollback study. The City Planning Department initially sought a rollback from a citywide zoning capacity of 7½ to 5 million.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1538513211417344">28</xref></sup> The final 1972 study advocated a zoning capacity reduction of 35 percent, with a one-third reduction in the development capacity of areas currently zoned for multifamily “R3” uses and a 50 percent reduction in the development capacity of land currently zoned for intensive multifamily “R4” and “R5” uses.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1538513211417344">29</xref></sup> The suggested 35 percent rollback would come close to reaching a population capacity goal of 4.1 million, a number based on accommodating a range of 1990 population predictions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1538513211417344">30</xref></sup> What was to happen when the city reached its post-1990 saturation point was not a subject of the study.</p>
<p>However, the figure of 4 million seemed far too permissive to critics, as it was still a great deal larger than the current population of 2.8 million. This was a time when area planning workshops were discussing no growth as a realistic alternative.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1538513211417344">31</xref></sup> The logic of the antigrowth movement explained that growth accommodation was really growth stimulation, that permissive zoning was a self-fulfilling prophecy maintained by regulators at the behest of wealthy developers.</p>
<p>The City Planning Department did attempt to rebuke the logic of antigrowth activists, criticizing the impression that housing construction generated demand. The Department of City Planning argued that this “inhumane” position “ignored the nature of population increase,” and that overly stringent zoning would not stop growth, but merely force it elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1538513211417344">32</xref></sup> Even the department’s compromise cap of around 4 million may have been irresponsible. While zoning for so much additional population seemed to some to be a gracious accommodation of future growth, so high were land prices and so dramatic the proposed reductions of allowable density that some critics feared the exclusion of lower-income earners from the housing market in a city where the vacancy rate was a mere 1 percent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1538513211417344">33</xref></sup> Even with the slow rate of population growth in the 1970s, smaller family sizes necessitated more small units, and affordability required smaller units at higher densities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1538513211417344">34</xref></sup> For their part, antigrowth advocates cited the economic reasoning of stabilized property values.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1538513211417344">35</xref></sup> However, the City Planning Commission opined that economics was not the concern of antigrowth advocates. If it was a concern, the Commission argued, the city should have incorporated an economic element into its General Plan discussing the repercussions of no-growth scenarios. In fact, the Regional Planning Commission had just done this, bringing in the opinion of the City Planning Commission “a sense of reality to the planning process that is too frequently lacking in general plans.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1538513211417344">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Unfortunately for antigrowth advocates, the Comprehensive Plan was at least for the time being a toothless document, difficult to implement except on a parcel-by-parcel basis. The State of California required in 1971 that cities’ and counties’ zoning enforce their respective general plans by January 1, 1974.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1538513211417344">37</xref></sup> However to avoid the task of challenging growth interests, housing interests, and long-standing property rights, the city took the position in the 1970s that the state consistency requirement applied only to general law cities and counties, which excluded Los Angeles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1538513211417344">38</xref></sup> Los Angeles’ City Council did approve a policy of down-zoning as a nod to antigrowth interests but the process progressed at a slow pace. Most down-zoning took the form of rezoning multiple-dwelling “R3” districts to one of the less permissive multiple-dwelling “Restricted Density” districts, an action the Department of City Planning argued satisfied the local Community Plans that composed the Land Use Element of the General Plan and still promised to provide more affordable, multifamily options.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1538513211417344">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the state did not permit Los Angeles to respond to its mandate at such a slow pace. In 1978, the state legislature passed Assembly Bill 283, sponsored by local Assemblyman Vincent Thomas who, according to the <italic>Times</italic>, “was feuding with the city over a zoning matter” in his native San Pedro, a harbor-side enclave of Los Angeles 25 miles distant from City Hall.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1538513211417344">40</xref></sup> A contemporary analyst said “it was really one of those funny little political things that happen between politicians.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1538513211417344">41</xref></sup> From this “funny little thing” came perhaps the most daunting task in the history of the Department of City Planning: the bill required that zoning conform to local General Plans by July 1, 1981, in charter cities of over 2 million, a clear singling out of Los Angeles since it was the only city in this category.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1538513211417344">42</xref></sup> The bill endorsed citizen lawsuits against the city if the deadline was not met. Home rule was compromised and Los Angeles could no longer pay lip service to antigrowth advocates by allowing a local hand in Community Planning and then ignoring the resulting plans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1538513211417344">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>The city was forced to implement widespread down-zoning, potentially challenging the long-existing property rights of countless property owners. The State, County and Federal Affairs Committee feared being placed in a “difficult financial position” as claims would roll in.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1538513211417344">44</xref></sup> Planning Director Hamilton for one expressed confidence to City Council that zoning could be reformed without threatening development rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1538513211417344">45</xref></sup> City Council believed otherwise, and sued the state over AB 283 in 1979.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1538513211417344">46</xref></sup> The city achieved an extension of the compliance deadline to July 1982. However, efforts by the city remained piecemeal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1538513211417344">47</xref></sup> Notification procedures for pursuing what it called the GPZCP did not come into being until March 1981.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1538513211417344">48</xref></sup> Councilman Howard Finn took the initiative to speed noncontroversial development conforming to the General Plan and prevent that which did not.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1538513211417344">49</xref></sup> An ordinance followed requiring tract maps to conform to the General Plan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1538513211417344">50</xref></sup> This however did not resolve the problem of nonconformance of existing parcels.</p>
<p>By the 1982 deadline, the city had only completed a quarter of the required workload.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1538513211417344">51</xref></sup> Governor Deukmejian vetoed a request to extend the deadline, and citizens began to turn to the courts for relief.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1538513211417344">52</xref></sup> The city issued a series of Interim Control Ordinances (ICOs) to avoid further lawsuits in Community Plan Areas where new construction was exceeding community plan required densities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1538513211417344">53</xref></sup> As late as November 1984, 30 percent of permitted projects were exceeding densities called for in the Community Plans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1538513211417344">54</xref></sup> In December 1984, a case filed by a coalition of forty-two Westside and Valley homeowner organizations resulted in a ruling giving Los Angeles until March 1988, to make its zoning consistent with its General Plan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1538513211417344">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>In March 1985, the Council passed 13-2 an “Interim Consistency Ordinance” prohibiting permits for buildings not consistent with the General Plan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1538513211417344">56</xref></sup> Before 1984, the city went about establishing zoning consistency in ten to twelve separate cases per community plan area, each concerning 5–600 parcels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1538513211417344">57</xref></sup> Now the staff considered the entirety of each Community Plan Area at once; on average, each rezoning concerned 7,000 parcels of land.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1538513211417344">58</xref></sup> In the process of rezoning, each Community Plan Area was divided into 2–300 subareas ranging in size from a portion of a block to several blocks, each containing 1–4 zoning designations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1538513211417344">59</xref></sup> Height districts were almost universally reduced, significantly trimming buildable area across the city. In addition, each subarea was given numerous permanent so-called Qualified Conditions or Q conditions to assure usage of land most consistent with General Plan goals: for example, barring the use of manufacturing-zoned land for residential uses or barring specific commercial uses when the General Plan called for up-zonings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1538513211417344">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>Curiously, a majority of the 200,000 non-conforming parcels were not on the wealthy Westside or in the Valley, the sources of most antigrowth sentiment, but in the central or southern portions of the city, where anxieties concerning new development were least prevalent and where the need for redevelopment was most acute.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1538513211417344">61</xref></sup> In low-income Southeast Los Angeles, citizens concerned about the Zoning Consistency Program said the General Plan was out of date or irrelevant for addressing the area’s problems, that the housing supply would only be further reduced by the Zoning Consistency Program, and that “slow growth” was simply not a relevant issue there.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1538513211417344">62</xref></sup></p>

<p>Overall, the Consistency Program limited the city’s population capacity to four million at a time when it was already over three million.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-1538513211417344">68</xref></sup> The Zoning Consistency Program left slim margins for growth in parts of the Valley.

The city generally implemented densities equal to or below the maximum threshold set by the Community Plans, and some developers held this concept of “lesser included zoning” to be excessive. When the court sided with developers in one 1992 case, the city expressed its anxiety that some 8,000 parcels may in fact be zoned too low.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-1538513211417344">72</xref></sup></p>

<title>Proposition U</title>
<p>Meanwhile, separate action was taken against large-scale commercial and residential development occurring in the commercial zones of the West Side and Valley. In the mid-1980s, Councilmen Marvin Braude and Zev Yaroslavsky championed the antigrowth efforts in Los Angeles with a series of proposals to cut down on residential development in commercial zones. Yaroslavsky and Braude fit the mold of antigrowth entrepreneurs, as defined by Mark Schneider and Paul Teske, finding opportunity in “different values to mobilize opposition to ‘downtown,’ pro-business growth policies.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-1538513211417344">73</xref></sup> Their efforts however met with a cool reaction in a City Council keenly aware of a growing housing shortage and the need to allow residential development in commercial zones.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-1538513211417344">74</xref></sup> If the antigrowth effort was a movement for physical preservation, it was also a means to trigger social change in the city as a whole: lower housing production meant higher costs and reduced affordability.</p>
<p>One of their proposals was to halve the allowable FAR for all uses in commercial and manufacturing zones in Height District “1” to 3:1. Height District “1” covered about 70 percent of the land zoned for commercial and manufacturing uses, and 85 percent of commercially zoned area alone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-1538513211417344">75</xref></sup> Laura Lake, a member of the antigrowth group “Not Yet New York” said of the initiative: “We are saying if we grow the way [developers] want to grow communities will die.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-1538513211417344">76</xref></sup> The initiative failed to get sufficient support in the council. However, owing to a 1980 California Supreme Court ruling in <italic>Arnel Development Co. v. City of Costa Mesa</italic> that citizen referenda could be used to rezone parcels regardless of their size or number, antigrowth advocates and their representatives in City Hall had an additional weapon to wield.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-1538513211417344">77</xref></sup> Convinced the voters would support a referendum on rezoning, Yaroslavsky took his cause to the homeowners’ associations of the Valley and Westside.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-1538513211417344">78</xref></sup> Proponents used $200,000 dollars from the campaign coffers of Braude and Yaroslavsky to gather over 100,000 signatures, more than enough to place an initiative on the ballot for that year. The referendum was titled “Reasonable Limits on Commercial Buildings and Traffic Growth,” but was more commonly known as Proposition U.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-1538513211417344">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>Opponents of the referendum in City Council attempted to push through legislation rezoning many of the city’s commercial areas to residential use, thus making Proposition U inapplicable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-1538513211417344">80</xref></sup> Allies of Braude and Yaroslavsky countered that instead of squandering voters’ rights, opponents should realize that the proposition would only redirect development toward more concentrated centers according to planning goals, and that even with an allowable FAR of 1.5:1, the affected boulevards could still be developed on average to five times their current density.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-1538513211417344">81</xref></sup> Opponents charged that this ignored economics as it did not take into account the extent of incentive necessary for developers to recover the cost of land in their developments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538513211417344">Figure 1</xref>). Yaroslavsky argued: “There is no down-zoning in this city that ever negatively affected the economics of the city. … We cut density by one-third on Melrose Avenue. The only thing that happened is rents continued to skyrocket.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-1538513211417344">82</xref></sup> Of course, this was exactly the problem according to those worried about costs.</p>

<p>Most troublingly for redevelopment advocates, Proposition U would stifle development where it was most needed and had not been opposed. Councilman Pat Russell, representing an area of South Los Angeles, stated, “By indiscriminately erasing established redevelopment and commercial areas, the initiative would erode our ability to provide future economic opportunities.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-1538513211417344">83</xref></sup> Councilman David Cunningham called it an elitist measure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-1538513211417344">84</xref></sup> Braude accused Russell and developers of using the city’s poor for their own interests, though certainly the most intensive lobbying in low-income areas occurred on behalf of Proposition U proponents. One group, Citizens for a Livable Los Angeles, put forward five thousand dollars to place an advertisement in support of Proposition U in South-Central’s <italic>Community Democrat</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-1538513211417344">85</xref></sup> The proposition’s supporters were able to gain allies in low-income minority areas by linking their cause with that of the Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles who were fighting a trash burning operation in their area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-1538513211417344">86</xref></sup> Others in the city’s low-income communities may have supported the initiative for a different reason: <italic>Community Democrat</italic> publisher Willard Murray believed the proposition would not stop development but direct it out of high-income areas and cause it to be more evenly spread.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-1538513211417344">87</xref></sup> The African American publication <italic>The</italic>
<italic>Los Angeles Sentinel</italic> opposed the proposition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-1538513211417344">88</xref></sup> Ted Watson of the Watts Labor Community Action Committee said it “doesn’t have any real relationship to what’s going on in South Central.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-1538513211417344">89</xref></sup></p>
<p>Transportation specialists were divided on the issue. Professor Martin Wachs of the University of California, Los Angeles, noted that it made sense to control traffic by pursuing lower densities. Professor Peter Gordon of the University of Southern California argued that it would exacerbate horizontal urban growth and dependence on automobile travel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-1538513211417344">90</xref></sup> For planners, the prospect of a voter initiative with so much power seemed a threat to the city’s planning traditions. The American Planning Association’s 1986 Los Angeles Conference was welcomed by the <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> with the words: “Welcome to Los Angeles Planners: R.I.P.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-1538513211417344">91</xref></sup></p>
<p>Why did Proposition U pass? In “The Reluctant Metropolis,” urban analyst William Fulton noted how similar countywide antigrowth initiatives in San Diego County, Orange County, and Riverside County were soundly defeated. This showed in Fulton’s view that “the dynamics driving growth were regional, but opposition to growth was local. People might vote against development in their neighborhood or in their small municipality, but they probably wouldn’t vote for sweeping restrictions all across the region—in part because they didn’t want to risk their jobs … and in part because they just didn’t care.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-1538513211417344">92</xref></sup> What was unique about Proposition U then was the size of the jurisdiction in question. Although the city of Los Angeles was larger than all the counties in Southern California except its own, its voters tended to think in parochial terms even on citywide matters. For antigrowth advocates, this was a supreme achievement. Proposition U had the most marked support on the Westside and in the Valley, but also drew support from the southern portions of the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-1538513211417344">93</xref></sup> The curious alliance between affluent Westside and Valley homeowners opposing development of all kinds and South Los Angeles citizens opposing the operation of only the most offensive land uses won the day for antigrowth advocates. The resulting “Neighborhood Protection Ordinance” reduced floor area ratio from 3:1 to 1.5:1 in all areas zoned for commercial and manufacturing uses within Height District “1” and created special height district regulation for Enterprise Zones, Center Study Areas, and redevelopment areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-1538513211417344">94</xref></sup></p>
<p>The immediate impact of Prop U on land development was hard to gauge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538513211417344">Figure 2</xref>). It came at the bottom of a development cycle during which the Department of Building and Safety noted an overall drop in applications for construction permits.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-1538513211417344">95</xref></sup> In a depressed economic climate, builders were less likely to object to the dominant “anti-building fervor,” preferring to downsize plans as demand temporarily waned.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-1538513211417344">96</xref></sup> In fact, Proposition U was only one intitiative in antigrowth activist Zev Yaroslavsky’s “10 point plan” for challenging what he understood as business as usual in Los Angeles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-1538513211417344">97</xref></sup> A second significant goal of Yaroslavsky’s agenda was to introduce a conditional use process for all projects of over fifty-thousand square feet.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-1538513211417344">98</xref></sup> In 1987, a court decision was handed down in favor of the “Friends of Westwood” who had sued the city to force the preparation of Environmental Impact Reports for large-scale projects. Although state law was clear on the subject, city policy had remained somewhat ambiguous.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-1538513211417344">99</xref></sup> The city immediately made it policy that staff should automatically conduct environmental reviews for all projects of over forty-thousand square feet, generating five hundred or more car trips per day, or having twenty-five or more residential units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538513211417344">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-1538513211417344">100</xref></sup></p>

<p>Three years later, a city ordinance mandated a “site-plan review” process for all projects meeting these thresholds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-1538513211417344">101</xref></sup> Site-plan review required the Planning Department to find a proposal’s consistency with zoning, the General Plan, any redevelopment plan if applicable, and that the proposed development would incorporate satisfactory mitigation procedures as may be required by CEQA. It also required that proposed development be compatible with development on neighboring properties and that if a residential development it would incorporate the appropriate type and placement of recreational facilities and amenities to improve habitability and minimize impacts on abutting properties. Site-plan review in essence limited the circumstances under which a developer could achieve by-right approvals for large projects and expanded the city’s ability to mitigate project impacts even beyond what was required by CEQA.</p>
<p>After the Westwood case, empowered antigrowth neighborhood associations scrutinized the development proposals with renewed gusto, using site-plan review as a mechanism to saddle development with conditions rendering it satisfyingly innocuous or infeasible. Los Angeles was not alone in this experience. The American Planning Association has expressed anxiety that nationwide, site-plan review processes allowed citizens to object to “overall project uses and densities.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-1538513211417344">102</xref></sup> This impediment to new development in Los Angeles arguably came at the cost of further displacing development and any negative impacts to fringe locations where they may be unaccounted for, and discouraging local benefits that may come from development.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-1538513211417344">103</xref></sup> Developers and their allies derided these new urban engineers as NIMBYs, sufferers of a “Not in My Back Yard” syndrome, cynical homeowners who refused to measure potential negatives of development against potential benefits to themselves and others. Interviewed by the <italic>Los Angeles Times</italic> on the meaning of NIMBY, Tina Eick of the Shadow Hills Property Owners Association said she resented the label, favoring not to see herself as a knee-jerk oppositionist. She was however in favor of hanging a “no vacancy” sign on the city’s front door.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-1538513211417344">104</xref></sup></p>

<title>Los Angeles: Growth Machine No More</title>
<p>In <italic>The Politics of Land Use Reform</italic>, planning scholar Frank Popper theorized that supplementation of local regulation with statewide policy making, CEQA and AB 283 being examples, gave voice to the collective interests of communities traditionally left out of the capital-driven bargaining process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-1538513211417344">105</xref></sup> Referenda proved to be another tool for empowering communities. However, if the Zoning Consistency Program and Proposition U represented a realignment of power, it was only to empower a new elite among affluent suburbanites. This new elite, unlike the developers, was fervently opposed to expanding consumer options.</p>
<p>The end of the growth machine engendered negative consequences for those who did not get into the market in time and were forced to deal with rising costs and fewer options in choosing where to live.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-1538513211417344">106</xref></sup> This in turn has threatened the environmentalist ambitions of many Angelenos: by excluding further utilization of already developed areas, homeowner preeminence has promoted development and population growth in areas otherwise profitable as agricultural land, distant from existing employment centers, possessive of their own fragile ecologies, or dependent on the costly expansion of infrastructure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-1538513211417344">107</xref></sup> This is arguably true of California as a whole, as Paul Shigley demonstrated. However, criticism of antigrowth advocates is not limited to California; certainly members of the business community elsewhere have been willing to call antigrowth activists: “elitists, unconcerned about the need for more jobs, opportunities for minorities, or the placement of an adequate infrastructure ….”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-1538513211417344">108</xref></sup></p>
<p>This is why, perhaps, in the 1980s, antiregulation defenders of property rights and advocates for the poor and minorities in urban California became occasionally aligned. In the context of the developing property rights movement of the 1980s, people quite outside of the deposed developer elite gained a new platform for social justice. Nationally, the Mt. Laurel cases perhaps represented the most significant forcing of “the builder’s remedy” at the behest of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-1538513211417344">109</xref></sup> Notable at this time in California was the alliance between property-rights advocate, the Pacific Law Foundation, and the San Diego Urban League in a fight against San Diego’s rezoning property for open space without what they considered just compensation. The joint position of the two organizations was that damages had to be available to prevent arbitrary land use decisions that inflated housing prices and excluded people from the market and better living conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-1538513211417344">110</xref></sup> Planning Director Hamilton meanwhile derided such efforts as “destroying the bulwark of property value protection.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-1538513211417344">111</xref></sup> One writer to the <italic>Times</italic> responded to Hamilton that if the benefits of zoning actions were so clear, the benefiting public should be able to pay for the losses of those sacrificing their rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-1538513211417344">114</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is arguably still the case today that antigrowth interests dominate land use policy in Los Angeles. The single-family house, opined Robert Greene in the <italic>L.A. Weekly</italic> in 2003, has become a revolutionary force in the past quarter century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-1538513211417344">113</xref></sup> However, there has been growing conflict in the past two decades between traditional antigrowth forces and various development-friendly interest groups concerned with the economic, environmental, and social sustainability of an increasingly exclusive city and region. Witness the city’s programs for mixed-use development in commercial areas previously cutoff by Proposition U, adaptive reuse of defunct commercial buildings according to more flexible building codes, and small-lot zoning to encourage a homeownership alternative to the traditional detached single-family home.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-1538513211417344">114</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the last two decades, land use policy in Los Angeles may at last be achieving a balance between local preservation concerns and regional growth needs, although convincing results remain to be seen. Should the more virtuous outcomes of the growth machine revisit Los Angeles, the undoing of a decade would be called for. One should not derive from the Los Angeles case an argument for uncontrolled and unlimited growth, but rather an appreciation of how a growth machine was capable of translating economic growth into social opportunity. Decades of antigrowth policy in built-up areas of Los Angeles have merely mismanaged growth: channeling it to places where housing is of lesser convenience and compromising the denser urban form often credited as being environmentally sustainable. In this sense, a less constrained marketplace facilitating reinvestment in built-up areas may dovetail better with the goals of social justice and smart growth pursued by planners than does an environment of greater oversight and regulation. Undoing the damage of past policies is undoubtedly a challenge, but recent pursuits in Los Angeles demonstrate that change is possible.</p>

<p>The shortage of housing in the City of Los Angeles has been a concern of the Planning Department and City Council since at least the 1960s, an Ad Hoc Committee on Housing was convened in 1980, a Housing Production Task Force in 1982, and a Housing Crises Task Force in 1999.</p>

<p>Numerous authors have documented the relationship of zoning to sprawl, thereby suggesting the relationship of zoning to sprawl’s many negative impacts: see for example, Andres Duany, Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, and Jeff Speck, <italic>Suburban Nation: the Rise of Sprawl and the Decline of the American Dream</italic> (New York: North Point Press, 2000); Oliver Gillham, <italic>The Limitless City: A Primer on the Urban Sprawl Debate</italic> (Washington, DC: Island Press, 2002); Jonathan Levine, <italic>Zoned Out: Regulation, markets and Choices in Transportation and Metropolitan Land-Use</italic> (Washington, DC: Resources for the Future, 2006); Christopher B. Leinberger, <italic>The Option of Urbanism: Investing in a New American Dream</italic> (Washington, DC: Island Press, 2008). Certainly the business community has been willing to blame antigrowthers for sprawl, see Vogel and Swanson (1989).</p>
