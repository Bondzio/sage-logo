<abstract>
<p>In batterer intervention programs, there are conflicting recommendations about best practices for responding to client dropout. Risk management philosophies emphasize the importance of swift and sure sanctions for failure to comply with program attendance requirements. In contrast, change theory emphasizes the importance of providing clients with multiple opportunities to engage in treatment. To clarify the implications of each of these philosophies, the current study examined rates of program dropout, reinstatement, and completion in a consecutive sample of 294 probation-mandated clients referred to a large batterer intervention program. Just over half (53.7%) of men completed intervention on their first attempt. Over the 2-year follow-up study period, 73 clients were reinstated once by the intervention program, 23 clients were reinstated twice, and 5 clients reinstated three (or more) times. Reinstated clients were, in general, more similar to men who failed to complete than those who completed on their first attempt. Although rates of dropout at each reentry point were quite high (56% to 80%), 32 of the 73 (43.7%) reinstated clients eventually completed. There were significant costs associated with providing clients with additional chances to complete the program, with successful reinstatement requiring an average of 7.55 phone calls to clients, 3.82 phone calls to referral agents, one letter, and 0.73 in-person meetings. Results are discussed in terms of practice and policy implications of risk management and change theory approaches to dropout.</p>

<body>
<p>Dropout is a significant problem for batterer intervention programs. Despite being court-ordered to attend treatment, between one quarter and one half of men drop out prior to completing in most programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512468321">Daly &amp; Pelowski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512468321">National Institute of Justice, 2009</xref>). Men most likely to drop out are younger, less educated, have more extensive criminal histories, and have more violence in their family of origin. Their lives tend to be less stable, in that they are more likely to be unmarried, unemployed, and are more likely to abuse alcohol and drugs. They also report less agreement with treatment goals and less motivation to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512468321">Bennett, Stoops, Call &amp; Flett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512468321">Brodeur, Rondeau, Brochu, Lindsay, &amp; Phelps, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512468321">Buttell &amp; Carney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512468321">Daly &amp; Pelowski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512468321">Daly, Power, Gondolf, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512468321">Jewell &amp; Wormith, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512468321">Stalans &amp; Seng, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to being a concern in its own right, high rates of program drop out make examination of program efficacy very challenging. In randomized control studies, high attrition leads to questions about whether men randomly assigned to treatment receive an adequate “dose” of intervention to be considered a treatment group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512468321">Gondolf, 2010</xref>). In quasi-experimental studies, concerns can be raised that men who drop out, and who are typically used as the control group, have many of the characteristics (e.g., younger, unemployed) that predict reoffending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512468321">Jewell &amp; Wormith, 2010</xref>). As a result of these challenges, attrition is recognized as a major contributing factor to uncertainty in determining the effectiveness of batterer intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512468321">Babock, Green &amp; Robie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512468321">Gondolf, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>From a practical perspective, batterer intervention programs have taken a variety of approaches to dealing with high rates of dropout. Some programs are most closely aligned with a risk management philosophy that views men’s ability to comply with the demands of mandated intervention is an important dynamic risk indicator for future assault. According to this perspective, any failure to meet program demands should lead to a swift and sure justice response including increased sanctions (e.g., incarceration) and heightened risk management (e.g., greater judicial monitoring). A risk management philosophy is supported by large, high-quality, longitudinal studies showing that program dropout is a significant predictor of reassault. For example, in his multisite examination, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512468321">Gondolf (2002)</xref> found that program completion was associated with a 44% reduction in the likelihood of partner-reported reassault, from a recidivism rate of 55% for program dropouts to a recidivism rate of 36% for program completers. Similar results were reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512468321">Bennett et al. (2007)</xref> in their analysis of recidivism among 899 men referred to 30 different batterer intervention programs (BIP) programs. These researchers found that program completion was associated with a 39% reduction in the likelihood of reassault. Finding such as these have led to a recommendation by the National Institute of Justice that: “To safeguard victims and/or new partners, prosecutors and courts should respond immediately to an abuser’s first failure to enroll in or attend a court-mandated batterer intervention program.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512468321">2009</xref>, p. 71).</p>
<p>Other batterer programs are more strongly guided by change theory that views cessation of problem behavior as a long-term process likely to involve many failed attempts prior to success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512468321">Norcross, Krebs, &amp; Prochaska, 2011</xref>). Endorsement of this philosophy leads to increased efforts to engage clients, including flexibility in policies around attendance. For example, programs might offer men two or three chances to complete their intake assessment and when men fail to meet program requirements, they may be encouraged to start the program again. A change approach also explicitly recognizes that the men who are most likely to drop out are often multiply challenged (e.g., by unemployment, substance addiction) and may need extra support in meeting the demands of intervention.</p>
<p>Adoption of a change philosophy is supported by a large body of literature on change in problem behaviors such as smoking, drinking, drug use, poor eating, and medical noncompliance. This research has clearly shown that few people change problem behaviors on their first attempt. Adult smokers, for example, typically make multiple attempts before successfully quitting smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512468321">Stead, Perera, Bullen, Mant &amp; Lancaster, 2008</xref>). Data on change in alcohol and drug use is even more telling. In an early but relevant longitudinal study of the course of alcoholism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512468321">Polich, Armor, &amp; Braiker (1981)</xref> reported that over 90% of individuals addicted to substances experienced at least one relapse in the 4 years following treatment. Yet, viewed at the 4-year point, almost half of alcoholics were no longer problem drinkers. Similarly in the case of drugs, although rates of relapse are extremely high, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512468321">Simpson, Joe, and Broome (2002)</xref> found that 5 years following treatment, only one in four treated cocaine addicts were still weekly users. Findings such as these have led the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Association (SAMHSA) and the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) to include enhancing motivation as one of its Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIP). This TIP recommends, among other things, that clinicians “keep the door open” to treatment opportunities for clients with low motivation to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512468321">Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, n.d.</xref>).</p>
<p>These conflicting recommendations around response to dropout lead to important and difficult policy questions for batterer intervention programs and their funders. Unfortunately, there is little research available for informed debates on these important questions. There is limited data available on the frequency of reinstatement into batterer intervention and little investigation into the characteristics and treatment progress of men who are given a second chance. In this article, we explore such questions using data from Changing Ways, a large, well-established batterer intervention program in southwestern Ontario, Canada. This agency operates with the philosophy that change is a long-term process that includes periods of progress and periods of challenge. Accordingly, clients who miss treatment sessions are immediately called and invited back to the next session. A client who misses more than two sessions (the maximum number allowed by the program) is invited to begin the program again as long as he can provide reasonable assurance that he is committed to attending and assuming that he was not charged with a breach of probation. We expected that the men who were reinstated in intervention would show many of the same disadvantages and risks common to drop out including younger age, greater lifestyle instability, lower motivation, and more extensive histories of abuse perpetration, and we explored whether reinstated clients who did and did not complete intervention on their second attempt would be distinguishable from each other. In accordance with the philosophy that change is a long-term process, we expected a reasonable proportion of men to benefit from having a second chance, but we were concerned with the potential costs of second chances in terms of additional phone calls, in-person meetings, and intervention sessions. Consequently, our analysis also included an estimate of the average cost to service providers of promoting client reinstatement into intervention.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Study data were from a larger project examining the progress and trajectory of male batterers through group treatment. For the purposes of the current study, the sample was limited to the 294 clients referred through the correctional system as a condition of their probation (i.e., clients attending voluntarily or as part of a presentence early intervention program were not included). All clients who consented to participate in the research project (consent rate 71.2%) had their progress at Changing Ways documented for a 2-year period following their initial intake appointment. Complete details on our sample of participants, including procedures for recruitment and data collection may be obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512468321">Scott, King, McGinn, and Hosseini (2011)</xref>. Briefly, clients were an average age of 34 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.28) and primarily identified their ethnicity as Canadian and/or from a European country. Over one third of clients were unemployed (<italic>n</italic> = 113; 39.2%). Clients had a substantial history of involvement in the criminal justice system. Two thirds of clients (62.7%; <italic>n</italic> = 180) had a restraining order in force and half had a previous charge for breaching a probation order (50.3%; <italic>n</italic> = 148).</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section4-0886260512468321">
<title>Program attendance, dropout, and reinstatement</title>
<p>Men’s first intake between October 2004 and June 2006 was used as the baseline point for documenting men’s involvement with intervention. To successfully complete intervention at Changing Ways, clients needed to attend 14 of the 16 sessions of the program. For this study, clients were coded as <italic>complete</italic> if they completed intervention requirements (i.e., 14 of 16 groups) on their first attempt. Men who failed to complete intervention requirements were further classified on the basis of their involvement in the program over the next 2 years. Men were classified as <italic>reinstated completed</italic> if they were discharged from the program (almost always due to missing more than the permitted two sessions), were invited to return to meet the conditions of their original charge and successfully completed, and <italic>reinstated noncompleted</italic> if they failed to complete the program after being invited back. Men were classified as <italic>dropouts</italic> if they failed to complete and could not be reinstated because they could not be contacted, failed to return phone messages or attend scheduled meetings, or refused to return to intervention. In the handful of cases where men were returned to treatment within two years as a result of a charge for a breach of probation or a new offense, men were classified on the basis of their original intake only.</p>

<sec id="section5-0886260512468321">
<title>Predictors of program attrition</title>
<p>On the basis of previous studies of the predictors of dropout, we collected data on clients’ age, current alcohol use, employment status, relationship status, and criminal justice history. Motivation was also examined as a potential predictor of attrition using men’s reports on the Attitudes Towards Correctional Treatment (ACT) scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512468321">Baxter &amp; Tweedale, 1995</xref>), a 33-item self-report measure assessing five aspects of motivation: treatment motivation and perceived need for treatment; perceptions of treatment and the program; perceptions of staff; optimism towards treatment outcome; and self-disclosure comfort.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886260512468321">
<title>Costs of reentry</title>
<p>Costs of reinstatement were estimated based on a detailed review of the clinical files of a random sample of one third of reinstated clients who did and did not complete intervention (i.e., 11 of 32 reinstated completers and 14 of 41 reinstated noncompleters). All contacts related to reinstating clients in treatment were counted including calls to the client and referrer, additional in-person meetings, and counseling sessions attended following reinstatement. To estimate dollar costs, we used a rate of US$130/hr for agency time (i.e., staff salary, administration cost, building costs, etc.) and we rounded all calculations to the nearest whole dollar. We allowed for 20 min. per phone call (including time to talk and to document call), 30 min. per formal letter, 90 min. for in-person meetings (1 hr face-to-face plus documentation), and 20 min. per treatment session (2 hr of direct group counseling, 1 hr of preparation, 1 hr of debriefing, and 1 hr of documentation divided by 15 to account for efficiencies associated with having 15 men in a group). Costs associated men’s first attempts to complete intervention were not included, nor were costs associated with contacting the partners of men who were enrolled in intervention.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260512468321">Figure 1</xref> shows the progress of our sample of 294 court-ordered clients through the program over a 2-year period. As shown, slightly over half (<italic>n</italic> = 158, 53.7%) of men completed intervention on their first attempt and the remainder (<italic>n</italic> = 136, 46.3%) dropped out. Over the 2-year follow-up study period, 73 clients were reinstated once by the intervention program, 23 clients were reinstated twice, and 5 clients reinstated three (or more) times. Dropout rates following reinstatement were higher than those associated with men’s first completion attempt. Specifically, upon first reentry, 71.2% of men dropped out. On second reentry, program attrition was more modest at 56.5%, but rose again to 80% for additional reentry attempts. Considered in total, of the 73 clients who were reinstated in intervention at least once, 32 eventually completed (43.8%) raising the overall rate of program completion from 53.7% upon initial entry to 64.6% over a 2-year period.</p>

<title>Predictors of Program Completion</title>
<p>Characteristics of four groups of clients were compared: completers, reinstated completers, reinstated noncompleters, and dropouts (i.e., men who dropped out and were not reinstated). Group differences were examined using ANOVA and post hoc Tukey comparisons for continuous variables. For categorical variables, χ<sup>2</sup> analysis was used with comparisons for groups deemed most likely to differ on the basis of observed frequencies. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0886260512468321">Table 1</xref>, there were significant group differences in the expected direction for 7 of 12 variables. Group comparisons for the majority of these variables distinguished men who completed on their first attempt from all other groups. Men who completed on their first attempt were more likely than other groups to be living with or hoping to reconcile with their partner, older, employed, and less likely to have a past breach of probation or restraining order. In contrast, men who dropped out and who were unable to be reengaged had higher rates of unemployment and substance use than other groups.</p>

<p>Two variables provide potential insight into differences between reinstated completers and noncompleters. Specifically, reinstated completers (as well as men who completed on their first attempt) were more likely to be employed than men who failed complete. Second, men who initially dropped out but then completed had particularly poor initial perceptions of staff suggesting that, for at least some of these clients, there may have been a poor fit between the client and the staff member who completed their intake at the time they were first enrolled.</p>

As shown, <italic>successful</italic> reinstatement was associated with an average of 7.55 phone calls to clients, 3.82 phone calls to referral agents, one letter, and 0.73 in-person meetings. <italic>Unsuccessful</italic> reinstatement attempts were associated with slightly lower numbers of phone calls to clients (4.00), referrers (3.36), letters (0.57), and in-person meetings (0.14) likely due to the reduced follow-up needed when clients failed to respond to attempted contact. A closer examination of the specific processes by which clients were reengaged reveals that this process was also quite time-consuming—although clients were contacted quickly, it typically took at least a month and sometimes 4 to 6 months to reengage men in intervention. Delays were partly a result of difficulties coordinating phone or in-person meetings between intervention program staff, probation officers, and clients to develop plans for reinstatement and sometimes due to significant difficulties getting clients to respond to contacts. We also examined the number of sessions that men completed following reinstatement. Like many other batterer intervention programs, Changing Ways requires that men who drop out restart the program. It is therefore not surprising that the average number of sessions attended following reinstatement for successfully reinstated clients was 14.45 (14 is the minimum required for completion). A lesser number of additional intervention sessions were completed by men who were reinstated and dropped out (average of five additional sessions completed).</p>

<p>Costs of reinstatement were also estimated. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0886260512468321">Table 2</xref>, our estimated average total cost/person to the agency was US$1,326 for a reinstated client who completed and US$600 for a reinstated client who failed to complete. Most of the differences in costs are associated with fewer intervention sessions and client contacts for unsuccessfully reinstated clients. Although for clarity, costs for reinstated clients who did and did not complete were presented separately, a more accurate assessment of cost combines data from both groups. As it is not possible to predict which clients will eventually be successful in completing the program following reinstatement, the estimated cost for one successfully reinstated client should include the costs associated with the reinstated client who completed along with costs associated with an equivalent proportion of reinstated clients who did not complete. Given a ratio of successful to unsuccessful reinstatement of 32:41, or 1:1.28, we can calculate total cost for one successfully reinstated client by summing the average costs for one reinstated completer with the cost of 1.28 reinstated noncompleter. Using this formula, one successfully reinstated client costs an average of US$548 in phone calls (average cost of US$327 for the reinstated completer plus US$221 [average cost of US$173 multiplied by 1.28] for reinstated noncompleters), US$353 in contacts with referrers, US$112 in formal documentation (i.e., letters), US$177 in additional meetings, and US$904 in extra intervention sessions to a total cost of US$2,094.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study examined rates of reinstatement into a batterer intervention program. The success of reinstated men in meeting attendance requirements, the characteristics of those men who multiply enter batterer intervention, and the costs of reinstatement in terms of program resources were the key concerns. Consistent with broadly documented rates of attrition, just over half of men court-mandated to attend batterer intervention completed on their first attempt. Using the strategy of calling men and usually their probation officers to invite men to return resulted in the reinstatement of 53.7% of clients who originally dropped out (73 of 136), 43.8% (32 of 73) of whom eventually completed treatment. In general, men who completed on their first attempt had profiles suggestive of lower risk of dropout: they were older, more consistently employed, and less likely to have a restraining order or a past breach of probation. Few variables reliably distinguished the group of reinstated men who did and did not complete intervention, though reinstated completers were more likely to be employed may have had particularly poor initial impressions of program staff.</p>
<p>Efforts to reinstate clients are certainly not without cost. When successful, reinstatement required an average of over seven phone calls to clients, over three phone calls to referral agents, one letter, and for most men, one in-person meeting. Costs of these contacts would vary significantly by agency; however, using fairly conservative cost estimate, we estimated that reinstatement is associated with a cost of just over US$2,000 for each successfully completed client. Also, given the high rate of dropout and reinstatement, it is relevant to note that on average, an agency might expect that one fifth of any treatment group will be made up of men who have been reinstated.</p>
<p>From the perspective of coordinated risk management, these findings may be interpreted to lend support for swift and sure breach enforcement following dropout. Men who fail to complete intervention on their first attempt have more indicators of risk, specifically younger age and greater past involvement with criminal justice, suggesting greater risk for reassaulting their partners. Moreover, many of these men fail to complete, even when given a (costly) second chance. Thus, one reaction to current findings might be for programs to greatly limit their willingness to reinstate men. Men who failed to meet program requirements would return to the justice system, get charged with a breach of their probation order, and bear the consequences associated with the additional charge.</p>
<p>Although one interpretation, the current article also provides the basis for considering a model of service that is more responsive to the potential needs of high-risk clients. Results clearly show that efforts to reengage clients are not futile, but rather, that by adopting a policy of encouraging reinstatement, batterer intervention programs can successfully prompt completion in 43.8% of reinstated clients. As mentioned, reinstated clients tended to most closely resembled men who drop out, not men who complete on their first attempt. If change is a long-term process complicated by other co-occurring risks and problems, then the fact that so many of these higher-risk reinstated men eventually complete might be considered a noteworthy success. Furthermore, it could be argued that the cost of US$2,094 per successful client is worthwhile, and is certainly far less than the costs of successfully prosecuting a breach charge and applying additional sanctions. In fact, with supplemental funding, intervention programs might also be able to develop services that better meet the needs of higher-risk clients so that rather than offering “more of the same”, clients who have failed to meet program requirements the first time around may be offered interventions to enhance their motivation, reduce barriers to attendance or address co-occurring problems.</p>
<p>It is our position, given the findings of this and other studies on the number of men who fail to complete on their first attempt, that at very least, programs and communities work together to develop <italic>deliberate</italic> strategies for applying risk management and change philosophies of intervention. The group of men who initially drop out and who can be reinstated is fairly large and deserves greater attention in research and programming. Consideration of these clients would represent a substantial change from the current situation where, unfortunately, response to men’s dropout appears to be guided as much by funding (i.e., whether programs are funded on the basis of the number of men who begin intervention or on the number who complete) and by individual justice players (i.e., whether dropout will be successfully prosecuted as a breach) as by ideas about best practice. More deliberate application of risk management and change theories would require that specific guidelines be developed for responding to dropouts, that funding reflect these guidelines, and that the success of such policies be formally tracked and evaluated.</p>
<p>Although useful in documenting patterns of dropout and reinstatement, the current study does have a number of limitations. Data used to estimate rates of reinstatement and subsequent completion were drawn from a single large agency in Canada. Other agencies operating in other jurisdictions and with different philosophies will undoubtedly have different rates of reinstatement (even if initial dropout rates are similar). Similarly, cost estimates were based on the practice of this one agency and would vary significantly if more or less ambitious aims for reinstatement were set. Finally, overall costs did not take into account contact with men’s partners or costs associated with contacting men who were never even reinstated (i.e., those classified herein as dropouts). Despite these limitations, data compiled for the current study serves as a starting point for considering theoretical perspectives and economic realities that might drive decisions made about men’s reinstatement into batterer intervention. In addition, we hope that drawing attention to this issue will prompt additional research and policy development relevant to the significant challenge of dropout in batterer intervention.</p>

<p><bold>Katreena Scott</bold>, PhD, C. Psych., is an associate professor and clinical psychologist in the Department of Human Development and Applied Psychology of the University of Toronto and the Canada Research Chair in Family Violence Prevention and Treatment. She has authored numerous articles and book chapters on the development of violent relationships, the efficacy of service to male batterers, the effect of abuse and trauma on children, and on empirically and ethically sound policies for working with abuse perpetrators. She is also the lead investigator on the <italic>Caring Dads: Helping Fathers Value Their Children</italic> program for fathers who have been abusive in their families. This program has had significant international impact and has been adopted for use in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, Japan, United States, and Ireland.</p>
<p><bold>Colin King</bold>, PhD, C. Psych., (supervised practice) graduated from the School and Clinical Child Psychology program at the University of Toronto. He now works as a psychologist in the Thames Valley District School Board in London, Ontario, working in the areas of school and clinical psychology. His research has been supported by scholarships from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) on topics such as family violence, intervention and efficacy of service for male batterers, and the intersection of the child welfare and education systems. His current work continues to focus on issues related to assessment and intervention, program development, and applied research within a school setting.</p>
<p><bold>Holly McGinn</bold> is currently a doctoral candidate in the School and Clinical Child Psychology Program at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of the University of Toronto (OISE/UT). Throughout her graduate studies, she has been an active member of Dr. Katreena Scott’s Family Violence Laboratory, where she has assisted with research evaluating treatment programs for men who have been abusive towards their intimate partners and children. In her master’s thesis, she examined the effectiveness of mandated batterer intervention programs in Ontario. She developed a thematic coding scheme to explore counselor reports and examine men’s success at meeting key behavioral treatment goals. More recently, her research interests have shifted to father-perpetrated child maltreatment and the relationship between maltreatment and children’s emotion regulation development. Specifically, her SSHRC-funded doctoral thesis has been designed to investigate relations between paternal socialization of emotion and children’s emotion regulation skills within the context of paternal aggression.</p>
<p><bold>Narges Hosseini</bold> is a PhD student in the School and Clinical Child Psychology program at the University of Toronto. Her research interest in the area of family violence started during graduate study in Iran, where she investigated the impact of childhood maltreatment experiences on adolescents’ developing self-concept at the University of Social Welfare &amp; Rehabilitation Sciences. After immigrating to Canada, she began working with Dr. Katreena Scott on an investigation of whether partners of offenders who are highly resistant to treatment experienced different levels of severity and types of abuse (compared to partners of low resistant offenders), before their male partners entered the intervention program. She is currently interested in how the intersection of gender, ethnicity, and immigration experience may be related to domestic violence. Her research at the moment explores how acceptance and experiences of domestic violence and help-seeking behaviors among Muslim immigrants. She specifically examines how different perspectives fit in the model, including intergenerational transmission (cumulative childhood abuse and exposure to community violence), a patriarchal approach (nonegalitarian attitudes toward women), structural and cultural perspectives and the process of immigration and acculturation.</p>
