<abstract>
<p>In order to further investigate the effect of the working gas (especially, the helium–argon mixture) on the actual operating characteristics (including static and dynamic characteristics) of a thermo-acoustic engine, an experimental standing-wave thermo-acoustic engine was built up in this study. The thermo-acoustic system was introduced in detail, and experimental results on the thermodynamic characteristics of the system with helium–argon mixtures, especially the dynamic and oscillating characteristics, were also presented. At different molar fractions in the helium–argon mixture, under different charging pressures, the pressure ratio and the pressure amplitude of the thermo-acoustic system gradually increase with heating temperature. Under given conditions of the charging pressure and heating temperature, there exists an optimal molar fraction in the helium–argon mixture. It is obvious that using a certain proportion of helium–argon mixture as the working gas, the on-set temperature of the thermo-acoustic system can be effectively reduced and this is helpful in using low-quality energy and enhancing the thermodynamic efficiency of the whole system. Using helium–argon mixtures can widen the application range of the thermo-acoustic system and obtain any frequency between the resonance frequencies of two pure substances. However, the unexpected large fluctuation of the resonance frequency will make the engineering application of the system difficult. These results will provide a reliable experimental basis for further improving the thermodynamic performance of the thermo-acoustic system and broaden the application range.</p>

<p>Recently, efforts to protect the global environment and solve the energy shortage have been exerted in the worldwide. The development of new energy sources and technologies to preserve the global environment is urgently required. The thermo-acoustic phenomena or thermo-acoustics effect [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912436789">1</xref></bold>], where the conversion between heat and sound energies takes place, could be possible to construct a green cooling system or utilize the waste heat. Thermo-acoustics is a relatively new field of science and engineering. When the oscillatory thermal expansion and contraction could themselves be caused by the acoustic wave under consideration, a temperature gradient in a channel can be obtained whose cold-end temperature is lower than room temperature, so-called thermo-acoustic refrigerator. If there is a temperature gradient in a channel, it is possible to obtain the oscillatory wave or acoustic power, so-called thermo-acoustic engine.</p>
<p>Thermo-acoustic phenomenon, first studied two centuries ago, was explained qualitatively by Rayleigh who pointed out that this phenomenon was due to the oscillatory thermal expansion and contraction of gas (or liquid), caused by the oscillatory motion of the gas along an imposed temperature gradient. The subject remained largely untouched for over 80 years, until 1969, when Rott [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957650912436789">2</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957650912436789">4</xref></bold>] published a series of publications that signalled a revival in thermo-acoustic research. Many researchers began to further study thermo-acoustic effects [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650912436789">5</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912436789">6</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>Till now, the thermo-acoustic effect has been mostly applied in the power generation field. One of its potential applications is for environmental protection. Refrigerators with Freon gas as their working fluid are being prohibited because of its destruction of stratospheric ozone. The thermo-acoustic refrigerator, which uses environmentally harmless working fluids, is expected to be an acceptable substitute. In 1986, Hofler [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650912436789">7</xref></bold>] invented a standing-wave thermo-acoustic refrigerator, using 10-bar helium with pressure amplitudes up to 3 per cent of mean pressure. Another reason is its simplicity, absence of lubrication or seals, and use of low-quality thermal energy. Hence, it can provide a simple way to generate self-excited pressure waves and output work. In 1990, Radebaugh and Swift [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650912436789">8</xref></bold>] first adopted a thermo-acoustic engine, instead of a traditional mechanical compressor, to drive a pulse tube refrigerator.</p>
<p>A thermo-acoustic prime mover is a natural heat engine which converts heat flow from a high-temperature source to a low-temperature sink into acoustic energy. According to the sound field, thermo-acoustic machines may also be categorized as standing-wave or/and travelling-wave system. In 1992, Swift [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650912436789">9</xref></bold>] built a standing-wave thermo-acoustic engine. Using 13.8-bar helium gas with harmonic suppression, the engine delivered 630 W of acoustic power to the acoustic load, requiring 7000 W of heater power at a temperature near 700 °C, and dumping its waste heat to water at 35 °C. Its efficiency was 9 per cent, which is 13 per cent of the Carnot efficiency between the temperature ranges. The peak pressure amplitude at this operating point was 0.9 bar, 6 per cent of its mean pressure.</p>
<p>In Zhou and Matsubara’s experiment [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957650912436789">10</xref></bold>], using the helium or nitrogen as working gases, with 833 W of heat input and 700 K of heating temperature, 26 W of acoustic power was delivered through an acoustic wave with an operating frequency 73 Hz. Harmonic wave and frequency shift phenomena (from fundamental mode to second mode), which are both harmful for a load such as a pulse tube refrigerator, were observed in their experiments with a longer resonant tube.</p>
<p>Chen <italic>et al</italic>. initiated their work with a standing-wave thermo-acoustic engine in 1995. In their research [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912436789">11</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650912436789">12</xref></bold>], systematic investigations were done on the influencing factors, including operating parameters (such as charging pressure, heat input, heating temperature, and working fluid), and structural parameters (such as length and diameter of resonant tube, and stack characters), and conversion ability with different stack materials. Special attention was also paid to the on-set and damping behaviour of thermo-acoustic oscillation. Yu and Jaworski [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957650912436789">13</xref></bold>] reveal the effects of the stack geometry, the characteristic channel dimension, and the local acoustic impedance on the critical temperature gradient of the stack using numerical method.</p>
<p>The earliest concept of travelling wave thermo-acoustic machines was proposed by Ceperley [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957650912436789">14</xref></bold>] in late 1970 s and Yazaki <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957650912436789">15</xref></bold>] in 1998. In 1999, Backhaus and Swift [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957650912436789">16</xref></bold>] designed and fabricated a novel travelling wave thermo-acoustic engine. The prototype engine can deliver 710 W of acoustic power from the loop to the resonant tube with a thermal efficiency of 0.30 (42 per cent of Carnot efficiency), which is comparable to that of a traditional internal-combustion engine (0.25–0.4) or a piston-driven Stirling engine (0.20–0.38).</p>
<p>Another method to improve performance of the thermo-acoustic system is to use gas mixture as working gas. The mixture with lower Prandtl number could generally improve the performance of thermo-acoustic device. Tijani <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957650912436789">17</xref></bold>] studied the Prandtl number of the mixture of helium–argon, helium–krypton, and helium–xenon, and finally analysed the effect of it on the performance of the refrigerator. The result showed that the lowest Prandtl number of 0.2, obtained with a mixture containing 30 per cent xenon, leads to a coefficient of performance (COP) relative to Carnot which is 70 per cent higher than with pure helium. However, recent discovery of thermo-acoustic mixture separation by Spoor and Swift [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957650912436789">18</xref></bold>] in which radial oscillating thermal diffusion and axial oscillating viscous motion in a gas mixture in a tube create time-averaged separation of the components of the gas mixture along the length of the tube, which made the thermo-acoustic research with the mixture more attractive. Geller and Swift [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957650912436789">19</xref></bold>] successfully used this method to separate a 50–50 helium–argon mixture into 30 per cent helium and 70 per cent argon at one end and 70 per cent helium and 30 per cent argon at the other end in a 2.5-m long resonant tube.</p>
<p>In order to further investigate the effect of the working gas (especially the helium–argon mixture) on the actual running characteristics (including the static and dynamic characteristics) of the thermo-acoustic engine, an experimental standing-wave thermo-acoustic engine was built up, and the system will be described in detail. The thermodynamic characteristics of the thermo-acoustic system with helium–argon mixtures in this system were experimentally investigated, especially the dynamic and oscillating characteristics. Experimental results will provide a reliable basis for further improving the thermodynamic performance of the thermo-acoustic system and widen the application range.</p></sec>

<p>Because the conversion from heat to sound occurs in the stacks and the necessary temperature gradient of the system is provided by the hot-end heat exchanger and cold-end heat exchanger together, the key parts of the thermo-acoustic system consist of the hot-end heat exchanger, the stack, and the cold-end heat exchanger, that is to say the thermo-acoustic core. The resonance tube is also another part of the thermo-acoustic oscillating system. When self-oscillation occurred in the thermo-acoustic core, the oscillation could be further strengthened and the oscillating amplitude could be enhanced in the resonance tube, so that the pressure wave which was needed could be produced. The structural dimension of the resonance tube affected the oscillating characteristic and its length was one of the primary factors which decided the oscillating frequency. In order to reduce the oscillating frequency and the total length of the system, the resonance cavity was introduced. In order to avoid breakage of the section and reduce irreversible losses, a taper connector was used to connect the hot heat exchanger and resonator tube. At the same time, considering the need for measuring temperature and pressure, testing connector was introduced in the experimental apparatus.</p>
<p>In this experiment, the temperature sensors were calibrated by a NiCr–NiSi sheathed thermocouple (Labficility Company) with outer diameter of 0.5 mm and length of 500 mm. Its accuracy is about ±1.5 K. In order to reduce the measuring error, a standard K-type connector and extension lead produced by Labficility Company are selected. The pressure transducers are high-precision piezoresistive-type pressure transducer with the measuring range of 0 to 4 MPa. Its precision is about <inline-formula id="ilm1-0957650912436789"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math1-0957650912436789"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mtext>per</mml:mtext><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mtext>cent</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. The self-oscillating frequency of the system could be obtained and controlled in real time via the Agilent 54621D Mixed-Signal Oscilloscope and the SR760 type Frequency Spectrum Analyser.</p>
<p>In control and measuring system, a temperature controller and a voltage adjuster are used to control heating temperature. The heating power is adjusted by changing charging voltage to the heaters and it is displayed by a digital dynamometer. The maximum heating temperature is limited to around 1000 °C because of the structure of hot heat exchanger.</p>
<p>In the experiment, the working gases are helium with high purity, argon with high purity, and mixture of helium and argon.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-0957650912436789"><title>3 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
<sec id="sec4-0957650912436789"><title>3.1 Influence of heating temperature on the pressure ratio and pressure amplitude</title>
<p>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912436789">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650912436789">3</xref> show the influence of the heating temperature on the pressure ratio and the pressure amplitude with different compositions of the mixtures (1.0He0.0Ar, 0.1He0.9Ar, 0.3He0.7Ar, 0.5He0.5Ar, 0.7He0.3Ar, 0.9He0.1Ar, and 0.0He1.0Ar) and the different charging pressures (0.6, 1.0, and 1.4 MPa). According to these figures, with different compositions and different charging pressures, the pressure ratio and pressure amplitude always gradually increase with the increase of the heating temperature. This can be explained by the fact that the temperature gradient of the stacks is the force driving the thermo-acoustic oscillation. Because the increasing rate of heating temperature in the hot heat exchanger was much larger than that in the cold heat exchanger, the temperature gradient of the thermo-acoustic system was augmented by increasing heating temperature. Therefore, the driving force of the thermo-acoustic oscillation was enhanced, and finally resulted in the improvement of the pressure ratio and the pressure amplitude.

<sec id="sec5-0957650912436789"><title>3.2 Influence of the binary component of helium and argon on the pressure ratio</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650912436789">Figure 4</xref> shows the influence of the molar faction of helium–argon mixture on the pressure ratio with a certain charging pressure and heating temperature. According to this figure, at different charging pressures and different heating temperatures, first the pressure ratio gradually increases with the increase of helium concentration in the helium–argon mixture. When the molar fraction of helium reaches 80 per cent, the pressure ratio reaches its maximum and the increasing rate is very remarkable. If the charging pressure was too large, the increasing degree would too evident. When the charging pressure was equal to 0.6 MPa, its increasing degree was more than 3 per cent. However, for 1.0 and 1.4 MPa, all the increasing degrees were more than 8 per cent. Then, with the increase in the proportion of helium, the pressure ratio of the system gradually decreased. It is obvious that the thermodynamic performance of the thermo-acoustic system can be effectively improved when a helium–argon mixture is chosen as the working gas.
<fig id="fig4-0957650912436789" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Influence of the molar fraction on the pressure ratio</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912436789-fig4.tif"/></fig></p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0957650912436789"><title>3.3 Influence of the binary component of helium and argon on the on-set and the damping temperatures</title>
<p>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650912436789">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957650912436789">6</xref> show the influence of the molar fraction of helium–argon mixture on the on-set and the damping temperatures. According to these figures, under the different charging pressures, the on-set and the damping temperatures of the pure argon are the highest. The maximum difference of on-set temperature between the pure argon and the pure helium reaches 100 °C, and the average value is more than 60 °C. For the damping temperature, their values are 100 °C and 70 °C, respectively. If a small fraction of helium gas was added into argon, it was evident that the on-set and the damping temperatures of the thermo-acoustic system fall. If the charging pressure is larger, then the fall is bigger. When the molar proportion of the helium to the argon is equal to 1:9, the maximum drop reaches 110 °C, and the average value is more than 80 °C. However, for the damping temperature, their values are 125 °C and 100 °C, respectively. With the further change of the working gas from pure argon to pure helium, the influence of the molar fraction on the on-set temperature of the system is not large until the molar fraction is equal to 50 per cent. However, for the damping temperature, its value is equal to 30 per cent. When the molar fractions are equal to 50 per cent or 30 per cent, both the on-set and the damping temperatures of the system decline to a minimum. Then, the on-set temperature of the system begins to rise with the molar fraction from 50 per cent to 90 per cent. Its value ranges from 30 per cent to 90 per cent for the damping temperature. When the molar fraction is equal to 90 per cent, the on-set and the damping temperatures of the system all rise to the new peak value, the rise reaching 80 °C with an average value of more than 60 °C. However, for the damping temperature, its rise reaches 90 °C with an average value of more than 70 °C.
<fig id="fig5-0957650912436789" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Influence of the molar fraction of helium–argon on the on-set temperature</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912436789-fig5.tif"/></fig>

<p>Therefore, using helium–argon mixtures as the working gas can effectively reduce the on-set temperature of the thermo-acoustic system, which is helpful for utilizing the low-quality energy and improving the thermodynamic efficiency of the whole system.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0957650912436789"><title>3.4 Influence of the binary component of helium and argon on the resonance frequency</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650912436789">Figure 7</xref> shows the influence of the molar fraction of helium–argon on the resonance frequency. According to this figure, with change of the working gas from pure argon to pure helium, the oscillating frequency of the system gradually rises. If the molar fraction of the helium is larger, the rising rate of the oscillating frequency is quicker. On the other hand, from the magnitude of the changing range of the frequency in the figure, one can find that the changing rate of the frequency of the system was too large when the molar fraction of the helium was 70 per cent. The authors of this article think that thermo-acoustic separating effect [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957650912436789">18</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957650912436789">19</xref></bold>] possibly becomes more severe in the thermo-acoustic system under high pressure ratio and this molar ratio of helium to argon, when the heating temperature changes from 400 °C to 700 °C. Because the propertation of the mixture in the tube was nonuniform, the resonance frequency changing rate became too large. Obviously, although helium–argon mixtures could improve the performance of the system, the large fluctuation of the frequency will certainly affect the engineering application of the thermo-acoustic system. For example, if using the thermo-acoustic prime mover to drive a pulse tube refrigerator, this large fluctuation will affect the refrigeration performance.

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0957650912436789">Table 2</xref> gives the change of the resonance frequency with the molar ratio of helium–argon. Because all the average temperatures and average pressures gradually increase with the increase of the heating power, its sound velocity happened to change and resulted in the change of the resonance frequency of the thermo-acoustic system. From this table, it can be found that for pure helium and pure argon, the maximum absolute change in the resonance frequency of the thermo-acoustic system with the heating temperature is less than 1.7 Hz, and its maximum relative change is less than 2 per cent. However, for helium–argon mixtures, the relative quantity is comparatively greater and generally larger than 2 per cent. When the helium-to-argon ratio is equal to 70:30, the maximum absolute change of the resonance frequency of the thermo-acoustic system with the heating temperature reaches 5.5 Hz, and its maximum relative valve reaches 9.2 per cent. Since, the stability of the pressure wave is one of the technical criteria for the thermo-acoustic prime mover. This will directly affect its engineering application.

<p>With the experimental standing-wave thermo-acoustic engine, the thermodynamic characteristics of the thermo-acoustic system with helium–argon mixtures were investigated in detail. These results would provide a reliable experimental basis for further improving the thermodynamic performance of a thermo-acoustic system, and its application will become larger.</p>
<p>The main experimental results were as follows.
<list id="list1-0957650912436789" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>For different molar fractions of helium–argon mixtures, under different conditions of the charging pressure, the pressure ratio and the pressure amplitude of the thermo-acoustic system gradually increase with heating temperature.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Using helium–argon mixtures can effectively improve the performance of the system. There exists an optimum molar fraction of helium–argon mixture. In the thermo-acoustic system, it ranges from 70 per cent to 90 per cent.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Using a helium–argon mixture as the working gas can effectively reduce the on-set temperature of the thermo-acoustic system, and be helpful for utilizing the low-quality energy and improving the thermodynamic efficiency.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Using helium–argon mixtures can widen the application of the thermo-acoustic system and allow the every resonance frequency between the resonance frequencies of two pure substances to be obtained. However, attention must be paid to the large fluctuations of the resonance frequency that will affect the engineering application of the thermo-acoustic system.</p></list-item>
