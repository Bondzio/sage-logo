<abstract>
<p>In this study, the authors investigated the relationship between personality characteristics of team members and two distinct aspects of team cohesion: (<italic>i</italic>) task cohesion and (<italic>ii</italic>) social cohesion. Information technology professionals were assessed on a broad range of traits organized around the framework of the Big Five personality factors. Across the set of Big Five traits, agreeableness was positively related to task cohesion and extraversion to social cohesion. As expected, neuroticism was negatively related to both task and social cohesion. Contrary to the expectations, one other personality construct, conscientiousness, was unrelated to task cohesion at the individual level. The implications of these findings and future research needs are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The study of work teams is becoming increasingly important, as they have been said crucial for organizational success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0258042X13484839">Barrick, Stewart, Neubert and Mount, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0258042X13484839">Hackman, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0258042X13484839">Neuman, Wagner, and Christiansen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0258042X13484839">Peeters, Van Tuijl, Rutte and Reymen, 2006</xref>; etc.) The composition of a work team is defined by the individual characteristic of its members. Demographic variables, attitudes, abilities and personality variables are examples of individual characteristics of team members that serve as inputs that influence team performance through intragroup processes. Intragroup processes refer to the interactions among team members including communication patterns, conflict, team cohesion, leadership development and other forms of influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0258042X13484839">Barrick et al., 1998</xref>). In other words, the characteristics of team members influence the way in which a team operates. The purpose of this study was to assess how individual characteristics of team members (e.g., personality), relate to team processes (e.g., cohesion).</p>
<p>Many studies focused on team’s personality composition and its effect on team process (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0258042X13484839">Barrick et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0258042X13484839">Mount, Barrick, and Stewart, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0258042X13484839">Neuman and Wright, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0258042X13484839">Van Vianen and De Dreu, 2001</xref> etc.) but very few related individual’s personality characteristics with team process (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0258042X13484839">Barry and Stewart, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0258042X13484839">Stewart, Fulmer and Barrick, 2005</xref>). In this study, we investigated the effects of individual’s personality characteristics on cohesion.</p>
<p>The present study examined the Big Five domain (i.e., conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism and openness to experience) in relation to team cohesion (i.e., task cohesion and social cohesion). Each of the five traits were analyzed at individual level. Another important objective of this study was to find out whether the effects of team’s personality composition on team processes could be replicated with individual’s personality characteristics. For this, we compared our results with those reported in Barrick et al. (1998) and Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001). With this approach, we extended the previous studies that focused on team’s personality composition only to individual’s personality characteristics.</p>
<p>Personality and team cohesiveness both influence team performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0258042X13484839">Barrick and Mount, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0258042X13484839">Evans and Dions, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0258042X13484839">Gully, Devine and Whitney, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0258042X13484839">Hough, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0258042X13484839">Mount et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0258042X13484839">Mullen and Copper, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0258042X13484839">Salgado, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0258042X13484839">Tett, Jackson and Rothstein, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0258042X13484839">Zaccaro, 1991</xref>; etc.) thus it becomes imperative to comprehend the association between the personality characteristics of team members and team cohesion especially in organizational setups which tend to employ work groups and work teams expecting high results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0258042X13484839">Aeron and Pathak, 2012</xref> in press).</p>

<title>Theoretical Background and Hypotheses</title>
<sec id="section3-0258042X13484839">
<title>Cohesion</title>
<p>Cohesion has been contemplated to be the most important small group variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0258042X13484839">Carron and Brawley, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0258042X13484839">Lott and Lott, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0258042X13484839">Mullen and Copper, 1994</xref>) and a critical variable in models of effective work teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0258042X13484839">Carless and De Paola, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0258042X13484839">Cohen and Bailey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0258042X13484839">Hackman, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Cohesion is typically recongnized as an individual team member’s desire to stick together within a team. Carron (1982) defined cohesion as ʻa dynamic process which is reflected in the tendency of the group to stick together and remain united in the pursuit of its goals and objectives’. This tendency to stick together is considered to stem from the interpersonal attraction towards the group or team. Interpersonal attraction to a group involves an individual’s degree of identification with the group or the degree to which he or she sees himself or herself belonging to a particular group and not to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0258042X13484839">Friedkin, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The two types of cohesion identified in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0258042X13484839">Carron 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0258042X13484839">Mullen and Copper, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0258042X13484839">Mudrack 1989(a)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0258042X13484839">Zaccaro and Lowe, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0258042X13484839">Zaccaro, 1991</xref>; etc.) include task and interpersonal (social) cohesion. Task cohesion is defined as an attraction to the group because of a liking for or commitment to the group task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0258042X13484839">Hackman, 1976</xref>). On the other hand, interpersonal cohesion reflects an attraction to the group because of ‘satisfactory relationships and friendship with other members of the group’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0258042X13484839">Festinger, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0258042X13484839">Lott and Lott, 1965</xref>). Social cohesion is the drive of team members to develop and maintain more social relationships and to socialize with each other (i.e., interpersonal attraction). Task cohesion is the extent to which there is a drive and commitment to achieving the goals of the team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0258042X13484839">Carless and De Paola, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The task orientation represents a general orientation or motivation towards achieving the group’s objectives and social orientation represents a general orientation or motivation towards developing and maintaining social relationships and activities within group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0258042X13484839">Carron, Brawley, and Widmeyer, 2002</xref>). Teams with task cohesion feel unified in working toward the completion of task outcomes. Both of these constructs are separate components of cohesion, suggesting that team members could feel unified and attracted to the team in completing task objectives but not necessarily develop social relationships. It is also possible that team members may feel sole purpose in socializing with one another and have little commitment to reaching specific task goals. Furthermore, member of the team may sense the importance of developing social relationships while at the same time working together to complete specific objectives.</p>

<title>Personality</title>
<p>The Big Five or the Five Factor Model (FFM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0258042X13484839">Digman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0258042X13484839">Digman, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0258042X13484839">McCrae and Costa, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0258042X13484839">McCrae and John, 1992</xref>) is a useful taxonomy and currently the one considered most useful in personality research. It is a robust taxonomy of personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0258042X13484839">Costa and McCrae, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0258042X13484839">Barrick and Mount, 1991</xref>) that provides a comprehensive framework to examine personality and its relationship to team process. The FFM was developed through systematic, objective and comprehensive studies of language to identify the trait domains and facets found most useful and important in describing others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0258042X13484839">Widiger and Trull, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality includes five basic dimensions: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience. Extraversion has traits like sociabeility, talkativeness, assertiveness and activity level, which contrast to traits such as cautiousness, silence, retiring, sober, passivity and reserve. Agreeableness has traits like kindness, trust, warmth, good nature, gentility, cooperative, forgiving and hopeful versus traits such as hostility, selfishness, distrust, irritability, ruthlessness, suspicious, uncooperative and inflexible. Conscientiousness includes traits like organization, thoroughness, reliability, careful, achievement-oriented, responsible, organized, self-disciplined and scrupulous versus irresponsible, disorganized, undisciplined, unscrupulous, carelessness, negligence and unreliability. Neuroticism includes traits as nervousness, moodiness, temperamentality, depression, anger, emotional and insecure versus calm, enthusiastic, poised, and secure, and Openness to experience contrast traits as imagination, curiosity, creativity, sensitivity, intellectual and polished versus shallowness, imperceptiveness, down to earth, insensitivity, narrowness, crudity and simplicity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0258042X13484839">Goldberg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0258042X13484839">John and Srivastava, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Within each of the five traits, a number of facets are notable. McCrae and John (1992) defined these terms as:
<list id="list1-0258042X13484839" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>Conscientiousness:</bold> It is defined as the extent to which people are efficient, organized, planful, reliable, responsible and thorough. Facet scale includes competence, order, dutifulness, achievement striving, self-discipline and deliberation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Extraversion:</bold> It is defined as the extent to which people are active, assertive, energetic, enthusiastic, outgoing and talkative. The facet scale includes warmth, gregariousness, assertiveness, activity, excitement-seeking and positive emotions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Agreeableness:</bold> It is defined as the extent to which people are appreciative, forgiving, generous, kind, sympathetic and trusting. Facet scales are trust, straightforwardness, altruism, compliance, modesty and tender-mindedness.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Neuroticism:</bold> It is defined as the extent to which people are anxious, self-pitying, tense, touchy, unstable and worrying. Facet scale includes anxiety, hostility, depression, self-consciousness, impulsiveness and vulnerability.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Openness to Experience:</bold> It is defined as the extent to which people are artistic, curious, imaginative, insightful, original and have wide interests. Facet scales are fantasy, aesthetics, feeling, action, ideas and value.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>All the five factors were shown to have convergent and discriminant validity across instruments and observers, and to endure across decades in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0258042X13484839">McCrae and Costa, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>The next section discusses previous theories and research into personality at the individual level that formulated the prediction of this study.</p>

<sec id="section5-0258042X13484839">
<title>Personality and Cohesion</title>
<p>This section discusses the empirical research that has examined the big five traits conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism and openness to experience. Research were reviewed for each trait to produce specific hypotheses made for the present study. Specifically, research will support hypotheses made between each trait and cohesion (task and social).</p>
<sec id="section6-0258042X13484839">
<title>Conscientiousness</title>
<p>Individuals high in conscientiousness are thorough, hard-working, responsible, planful, self-disciplined, organized, careful, achievement and task oriented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0258042X13484839">Barrick and Mount, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0258042X13484839">Costa and McCrae, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0258042X13484839">Goldberg, 1993</xref>) which are important attributes for accomplishing work tasks in all jobs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0258042X13484839">Barrick and Mount, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0258042X13484839">Barrick, Mount and Judge, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0258042X13484839">Hough, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0258042X13484839">Salgado, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0258042X13484839">Tett et al., 1991</xref>; etc.). These characteristics result in effort and perserverance towards team goal completion and commitment to task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0258042X13484839">Mohammed and Angell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0258042X13484839">Neuman and Wright, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0258042X13484839">Van Vianen and De Dreu 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Conscientious individuals tend to be more focused towards their work. In Barrick, Mount and Strauss (1993), conscientious sales representative were found to set higher goals for themselves. These higher goals provided the individuals with something to strive for and to achieve, possibly by focusing on specific task components of their job. Stewart, Fulmer and Barrick (2005) found that conscientiousness was related to the task role of an individual team member. In a meta-analysis by Judge and Illies (2002), conscientious individuals were found to have set goals, have high expectancy for completing these goals and believed that they will perform well.</p>
<p>Conscientiousness has been linked to interpersonal attraction and teamwork (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0258042X13484839">Barrick et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0258042X13484839">Hurtz and Donovan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0258042X13484839">Mount et al., 1998</xref>). The degree of responsibility felt by the conscientious individuals may influence their hard-working, assignment-oriented diligence. Preceding researches demonstrated that conscientious individuals have a need to succeed and react with a greater commitment to job in a team situation. Together these results suggest that conscientious individuals will produce greater commitment and motivation to accomplish a job. Thus, it was hypothesized that conscientious individuals will report higher task cohesion and social cohesion attitudes.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section7-0258042X13484839">
<title>Extraversion</title>
<p>Extraverts are sociable, gregarious, talkative, assertive and active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0258042X13484839">Barrick and Mound, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0258042X13484839">Costa and McCrae, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0258042X13484839">Goldberg, 1993</xref>) that enhances interpersonal interaction and facilitates teamwork (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0258042X13484839">Barrick and Mount, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0258042X13484839">Barrick et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0258042X13484839">Hough, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0258042X13484839">Hurtz and Donovan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0258042X13484839">Mount et al., 1998</xref>; etc.).</p>
<p>Individuals high in extraversion are enthusiastic, energetic and optimistic. They have desire to work with others and work towards achieving team goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0258042X13484839">Barrick et al., 1998</xref>), thus enhancing social cohesion. Meta-analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0258042X13484839">Barrick and Mount, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0258042X13484839">Barrick et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0258042X13484839">Hurtz and Donovan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0258042X13484839">Salgado, 1997</xref>) have suggested that extraversion emerges in jobs with more social requirements. People in these positions like people and potentially know how to influence others in their favor in order to perform their jobs effectively. Because of their social nature, extraverts have a more positive attitude toward teamwork situations and tend to develop more social relationships with other teammates. This led to the hypothesis that extraversion will relate to social cohesive attitudes in a team setting.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>H2: Individual extraversion will positively relate to social cohesion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Extraverts seems to enjoy jobs with more social components because they do not require high degree of a task focus or effort. It is possible that extraverts prefer more social interactions because these are less difficult for them than having focus on task performance. To support this assertion, Stewart et al. (2005) found that individual extraversion was negatively related to taking on a role within a team. This gives evidence that extraverts believe more in networking than in working hard to accomplish job. Thus, we expected no relationship between extraversion and task cohesion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0258042X13484839">
<title>Agreeableness</title>
<p>Agreeableness was found to be related to jobs involving interpersonal interaction and teamwork (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0258042X13484839">Barrick et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0258042X13484839">Hogan and Holland, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0258042X13484839">Hurtz and Donovan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0258042X13484839">Mount et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0258042X13484839">Peeters et al., 2006</xref>). Individuals high in agreeableness are friendly, tolerant, helpful, trusted, modest, altruistic, flexible, cooperative, caring and straightforward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0258042X13484839">Costa and McCrae, 1992</xref>). These characteristics facilitate interpersonal interaction and teamwork.</p>
<p>Agreeable team members are helpful, friendly, warm, trusting and tolerant. The quintessence of agreeableness is cooperation. The more agreeable each individual is, the more likely the team is to work together cooperatively. Individuals low on agreeableness may not work cooperatively in a team. This may affect interpersonal relations within the team. The more agreeable an individual is within a team, the more cohesive the team will become.</p>
<p>Agreeable individuals also seems to be more attracted to social situations. Agreeable individuals also actively take on more social roles within a team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0258042X13484839">Stewart et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that they enjoy social situations better than people low in agreeableness. ‘Team members who are person oriented or high on personal warmth toward others tend to enhance interpersonal (social) cohesiveness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0258042X13484839">Barrick et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Together these findings suggested that individuals high in agreeableness hold a more positive view of the social situations and teamwork. Thus it was hypothesized that individual agreeableness will relate positively to both task and social cohesion.</p>

<title>Neuroticism</title>
<p>Neurotic individuals exhibit characteristics such as worry, neverousness, anxiousness, temperamentalness, stress-prone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0258042X13484839">Barrick and Mount, 1991</xref>). Neuroticism is often lebeled by the positive pole of the trait emotional stability. Emotionally stable individuals are not anxious, self-pitying, tense, touch, unstable and worrying. This trait is predictive of social interaction and teamwork (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0258042X13484839">Barrick et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Hurtz and Donovan (2000) found that emotional stability was important for managerial, customer-service and sales position. Several job criteria (e.g., task performance, job dedication) were also related to emotional stability (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0258042X13484839">Barrick and Mount, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0258042X13484839">Barrick et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0258042X13484839">Hogan and Holland, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0258042X13484839">Salgado, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0258042X13484839">Tett et al., 1991</xref>) but emotional stability was most prominently related to interpersonal facilitation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0258042X13484839">Hough, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0258042X13484839">Hurtz and Donovan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0258042X13484839">Mount et al., 1998</xref>). Based on the findings it appeared that emotional stability produces not only social skills but also ability of an individual to be task-focused.</p>
<p>The task focus of emotionally stable individuals was also supported in other empirical research. A relationship was found in Stewart et al. (2005) between individual emotional stability and accepting task role in team settings. Emotionally stable individual can handle several tasks at once whereas neurotic individuals (i.e., individuals low in emotional stability) become stressed under these conditions. Therefore, emotionally stable individuals are more equipped to handle task-oriented role in a team settings. Results advocated that emotional stability (low neuroticism) at the individual level relate to both social and task components in work settings.</p>
<p>Neurotic individuals exhibit poor emotional adjustment and experience negative affects such as anxiety, insecurity and hostility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0258042X13484839">Judge et.al., 2002</xref>) whereas emotionally stable individuald are able to handle stress better than neurotic individuals and develop a more positive attitude toward the task and become more committed to it because of their task orientation. Teams that have members who are high on neuroticism will have difficult coordinating one another’s task and may experience disruption from temperamental and impulsive team members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0258042X13484839">Neuman et. al., 1999</xref>). Thus, if was hypothesized that neuroticism will negatively affect both task and social cohesion.</p>

<title>Overview of the Present Study</title>
<p>In the current research, we inspected the relationship between individual’s personality characteristics and cohesion. The present study tested a set of hypotheses regarding the relationship between the individual’s personality characteristics on the one hand and task and social chohesion on the other. We scrutinized the role of individual’s personality in a team and its effects on team cohesion.</p>
<p>In addition, the research tried to extend the studies by Barrick et. al. (1998) and Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001) which tested the relationship between cohesion (social and task) and teams personality composition measures (i.e., mean, variance, minimum, and maximum) rather than the individuals personality characteristics. We investigated whether the results from Barrick et al. (1998) and Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001) could be replicated with individuals’ samples than team samples.</p>

<title>Measures and Scoring</title>
<sec id="section15-0258042X13484839">
<title>Personality</title>
<p>We used the Neo Pi R test manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0258042X13484839">Costa and McCrae, 1992</xref>) to assess the FFM of personality. The test included 240 items on five domains (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience). Each of the five domains is represented by six, more specitic scales that measures the facets of the domain. Coefficient alpha reliability estimates for form S reported in the test manual were 0.92, 0.89, 0.87, 0.86 and 0.90 for neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, respectively. Test-retest reliability estimates over three months (N = 208) were 0.79, 0.79, 0.80, 0.75 and 0.83 respectively.</p>

<sec id="section16-0258042X13484839">
<title>Social Cohesion</title>
<p>We assessed social cohesion using Group Environment Questionnaire developed by Carron, Brawley and Widmeyer (1985). Social cohesiveness reflected individual team member’s perceptions about closeness and bonding regarding the team’s social activities. Participants responded to four items using a 9-point Likert-type scale, with high scores associated with favorable (highly cohesive) responses. Group Environment Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0258042X13484839">Carron, Brawley and Widmeyer, 2002</xref>) which was created to assess social and task cohesion was presented to individuals members. The items were reworded to apply in current setting. Examples of items include ‘Our team would like to spend time together outside of work hours’. Coefficient alpha reliability estimates reported in the test manual were 0.76.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0258042X13484839">
<title>Task Cohesion</title>
<p>This was measured with another five items from the Group Environment Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0258042X13484839">Carron, Brawley and Widmeyer, 2002</xref>), on 9-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly disagree, 9 = strongly agree) with coefficient alpha reliability 0.70. Task cohesiveness represented an individual team member’s perceptions about the similarity and closeness within the team about accomplishing the task. The wordings of items were changed to reflect an organizational environment. One such statement was ‘If members of our team have problems, everyone tries to help them’.</p>

<p><bold><italic>Conscientiousness:</italic></bold> In our sample, conscientiousness was unrelated to social cohesion (r = 0.13), thus rejecting hypothesis 1b. The result was similar to those found in Barrick et al. (1998) (r = 0.00, 0.03, 0.14 &amp; 0.08) and Vianen and De Dreu (2001) (r = 0.23, 0.04, 0.24 and 0.10). Both studies showed that no composition measures (mean, variance, minimum, maximum) of conscientiousness were associated with social cohesion.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Extraversion:</italic></bold> We found extraversion to be positively related to social cohesion (r = 0.27), thus supporting hypothesis 2. Our findings were akin to both previous studies which found extraversion to be positively correlated to social cohesion. Mean and minimum levels of extraversion were positively related to social cohesion in both Barrick et al. (1998) (r = 0.36 and 0.24) and Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001) (r = 0.38 and 0.32). However, the positive correlation between variance in extraversion and social cohesion found in Barrick et al. (1998) (r = 0.35) was not supported in Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001) (r = –0.07). The postive correlation between the maximum level of extraversion and social cohesion was only partially supported in Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001).</p>
<p>Extraverts are sociable, enthusiastic, energetic, optimistic, gregarious, talkative, assertive and active. Individuals high in extraversion have a desire to work with others and work towards achieving team goals and thus enhancing social cohesion. Our hypotheses supported this relationship. Too many extraverts in team can have negative effect on team process. A mix of different levels of extraversion will have a positive effect on team process and will enhance social cohesion.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Agreeableness:</italic></bold> For agreeableness, no correlation with social cohesion was found (r = 0.22), thus hypothesis 3b was not supported. Our results deviated from those of the Barrick et al. (1998) but were comparable to Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001). Barrick et al. (1998) found positive correlations between the mean and minimum (r = 0.32 and 0.38) level of agreeableness and social cohesion and negative correlations with the variance and maximum (r = –0.23 and –0.39), whereas in Vianen and De Dreu (2001) (r = –0.05, –0.07, –0.07 and –0.02) none of the personality composition measures were correlated with social cohesion.</p>
<p>Individual high on agreeableness are kind, trustful, warmth, courteous, flexible, good-natured, cooperative, forgiving, soft-hearted and tolerant. These characteristics facilitate interpersonal attraction and lead to cooperation and cohesion among members of a team. The more agreeable the team member, the more socially cohesive the team will be. However, the relationship could not be confirmed in our study.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Neuroticism:</italic></bold> We found a negative correlation between neuroticism and social cohesion (r = –0.27), thus supporting our hypothesis 4b. The results showed similarity to the results found in Barrick et al. (1998) and Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001) as they found emotional stability (low neuroticism) to be positively related to social cohesion. The men level of emotional stability (r = 0.53 and 0.43 respectively) was positively related to social cohesion in both studies while variance (r = –0.04 and –0.12 respectively) had no correlation. Minimum and maximum levels of emotional stability (r = 0.34, 0.18 and 0.22, 0.35 respectively) in both studies were in the same direction.</p>
<p>Individuals high in neuroticism are anxious, depressed, angry, embarrassed, emotional, worried and insecure. They do not feel confident and secure. Thus, they lead to a stressed and tense atmosphere within team that hinders capability of team members to work cooperatively thus decreasing social cohesion within.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Openness to experience:</italic></bold> We did not find any correlation between openness to experience and social cohesion (r = 0.12), thus rejecting hypothesis 5b. Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001) also did not found any correlation between personality composition measures of openness to experience (operationalized as autonomy) and social cohesion (r = 0.17, 0.06, 0.09, 0.01). Barrick et al. (1998) did not test this relationship.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Summary:</italic></bold> Our data corroborate the pattern observed by Barrick et al. (1998) and Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001) for the relationships between most of the personality traits—conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, emotional stability and openness to experience and social cohesion. As in previous studies, positive correlation was found between extraversion and social cohesion, negative correlation with neuroticism and no correlation with conscientiousness. As in Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001) no correlation was found with agreeableness countrary to Barrick et al. (1998) which found a positive relationship between the two variables. Furthermore, no relationship was found between openness to experience and social cohesion as in Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0258042X13484839">Table 4</xref> summarizes the relationship between personality and social cohesion as found in three studies.</p>

<p><bold><italic>Conscientiousness:</italic></bold> We did not find any correlation between conscientiousness and task cohesion (r = 0.16), thus rejecting our hypothesis 1a. The results were contary to those of Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001). They found the mean and the minimum level (r = 0.30 and 0.41) of conscientiousness were positively related to task cohesion. Variance (r = –0.51) in conscientiousness was negatively related to task cohesion i.e. homogeneity in conscientiousness to affect task cohesion. However, the maximum (r = 0.00) level of conscientiousness was unrelated to task cohesion.</p>
<p>Individuals high in conscientiousness are organized, thorough and reliable. Conscientiousness reflects dependability, carefulness, responsibility, organized, planful, hardworking, achievement-oriented and persevering. Teams consisting of individuals high in conscientiousness will be organized, approach task in structured way and low in disagreement, leading to achievement of team goals thus enhacing task cohesion within team. However, the relationship could not be established in our study.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Agreeableness:</italic></bold> Our hypothesis concerning the relationship between agreeableness and task cohesion (r = 0.44) was supported (hypothesis 3a). The findings were similar to those in Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001). They found positive correlations between the mean and minimum level (r = 0.38 and 0.32) of agreeableness and task cohesion.</p>
<p>Individuals high in agreeableness show strong compliance with team goals, high level of cooperation and reduce conflict within team thus strengthening task cohesion. Our study supported this relationship.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Extraversion:</italic></bold> As in Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001) no hypotheses was developed for the relationship between extraversion and task cohesion. Indeed, extraversion does not significantly relate to task cohesion (r = 0.16).</p>
<p><bold><italic>Neuroticism:</italic></bold> As hypothesized, we found a negative relationship between neuroticism and task cohesion (r = –0.28). Results in Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001) partially supported the relationship between emotional stability and task cohesion. Mean and the minimum level (r = 0.34 and 0.33) of emotional stability were positively correlated with task cohesion only for one of the sample i.e. students’ teams. However, a significant negative relationship was found with variance (r = –0.26) in emotional stability and task cohesion indicating that teams with members that were more homogeneous concerning their emotional stability rated their task cohesion higher.</p>
<p>Individuals high in neuroticism are not self-confident, stable, secure and contented about their goals and decisions. They are anxious, nervous, touchy and uncertain about their ideas. Hence, individuals high in neuroticism will lower task cohesion within team.<bold><italic/></bold></p>
<p><bold><italic>Openness to experience:</italic></bold> Our results does not supported the relationship between openness to experience and task cohesion (r = 0.05) (hypothesis 5a) as in Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001) openness to experience does not correlated with task cohesion (r = 0.03, –0.21, 0.08 and –0.11).</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Taken together, results showed that agreeableness contributed positively to task cohesion and as expected neuroticism negatively related to task cohesion, thus supporting hypothesis 3a and 4a. Hypothesis for conscientiousness (1a) and openness to experience (5a) were not supported. Our data showed the similar pattern observed by Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001) for the relationships between most of the personality traits agreeableness, emotional stability and openness to experience and task cohesion. The only difference found was for conscientiousness. The relationship between personality and task cohesion is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0258042X13484839">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Discussion</title>
<p>The relationship between team personality and team process has been subject of many studies. Far less research has considered the relationship between individual personality characteristics and team process. The current research develops on the studies by Barrick et al. (1998) and Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001). We examined the relationships between individual personality measures on the one hand and social cohesion and task cohesion, on the other.</p>
<p>We compared our results on individual’s personality and cohesion with those of Barrick et al. (1998) and Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001) on team personality composition measures and social cohesion and task cohesion. This comparison allowed us to examine the difference between the relationship concerning individual’s personality and cohesion viz-a-viz team personality and cohesion.</p>
<p>Result on individual’s personality largely confirm the conclusions reached on team personality composition by Barrick et al. (1998) and Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001). The results from all three studies showed that social cohesion is independent of the personality composition measures of conscientiousness. Also, our study and Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001) showed no relationships between social cohesion and openness to experience. Contrary to Barrick et al. (1998), this study and Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001) did not found any relationships between social cohesion and agreeableness. A positive relationship between extraversion and social cohesion were found in all three studies. Emotional stability and social cohesion were positively related in Barrick et al. (1998) and Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001) while a negative relationship between neuroticism (low emotional stability) and social cohesion was found in our study. This implies that team members experience more positive relationships with others in the group if the emotional stability of most of the team members is reasonably high and if there is no single member who is highly introvert.</p>
<p>Our results for task cohesion found a positive relationship with agreeableness as in Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001). Contrary to Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001) we did not found any relationship between conscientiousness and task cohesion. A negative relationship between neuroticism (low emotional stability) and task cohesion was found in our study as positive relationship between emotional stability and task cohesion was found in Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001). No relationship with openness to experience was established in our study as well as Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001). This implies that more agreeable the team members are the more cooperatively the team will work and high emotional stability of team members will lead to a more relaxed atmosphere that should promote the capability of team to work effectively.</p>
<p>The current results provide some evidence on how individuals’ personality affects team processes. The work needs to be expanded and confirmed with a larger sample so that the results can be generalized. In addition, results from Barrick et al. (1998) and Van Vianen and De Dreu (2001) needs to be tested on teams in Indian scenario. This will allow us the generalizability of results across different cultures and industries. Besides, future research in this respect would significantly benefit from a meta-analysis that methodically assesses and assimilate results obtained so far. Not only would such a meta-analysis enlarge our understanding of how team member personality influences team processes, it would also provide insight into what research problems will have to be contended with in the future.</p>
<p>However, the study does suggest some interesting implications for both researchers and practitioners. Significant relationships were found between certain personality traits and team process. This may perhaps suggest that teams can be developed and formed to at least include individuals with certain personality types to reduce team failures. For practitioners, if confirmed, this holds exciting implications for improving overall success of IT team projects. Teams can be formed to compose of the desired personality types leading to more successful teams and projects. There are many constructive prospects to pursue as a result of these findings. The relationships between team diversity in terms of personality and team processes can be explored further. The authors are in the process of expanding this pilot analysis into a major industry study to increases the applicability of these preliminary research findings. It is hoped that this work can initiate research and validation to determine an important aspect of personality and team dynamics.</p>
