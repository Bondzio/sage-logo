<p>A facile procedure for binding silver nanoparticles on polyester fabrics was reported. In this paper, the multifunctional polymer films were firstly formed through simple dip-coating of polyester fabrics in an aqueous solution of dopamine. Then the silver nanoparticles were in situ generated on the surface of dopamine-modified polyester fabrics in an aqueous solution of silver nitrate under room temperature. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry were used to characterize the structure and the content of silver nanoparticles. The antibacterial efficiencies of treated samples were quantitatively estimated. The results indicated that the dopa-polyester fabrics loaded with silver nanoparticles showed durable antibacterial activity.</p>

<p>Nanoparticles can endow fabrics with improved performance and functionality. The application of nanoparticles to textile materials relies on development of new technology that should provide desired effects for materials with long-term durability and stability without use of highly toxic organic compounds. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) can endue different textile fabrics with an antimicrobial effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0040517512454187">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0040517512454187">7</xref></sup> Although the mechanism of this action is still inexplicit, it was widely thought that AgNPs can interact with the constituents of the outer membrane of bacteria, causing structural change and degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0040517512454187">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0040517512454187">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recently, the manufacturing of sportswear, medical and protective textiles based on polyester fabrics has continually increased. Most of these fabrics are expected to be antibacterial. However, the hydrophobic behavior and low surface energy of polyester make surface treatment extremely difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0040517512454187">11</xref></sup> Most reported methods that were used to treat fabrics with nano-structured silver, such as electroless plating,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0040517512454187">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0040517512454187">14</xref></sup> vacuum deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0040517512454187">15</xref></sup> and so on, require multiple steps or complex reagents to prepare silver nanoparticles on the fabrics. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a facile route for the formation of robust silver nanoparticle coatings on the textile fiber surface. Dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine), a kind of low-molecular-weight catecholamine that mimics the adhesive protein, can spontaneously self-polymerize on various inorganic and organic surfaces and form uniformly films under mild conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512454187">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0040517512454187">19</xref></sup> Furthermore, the catechol groups in dopamine were redox active and therefore could perform as metal reducing agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512454187">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0040517512454187">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this paper, a facile procedure for binding AgNPs on polyester fabrics was reported. The polyester fabrics were modified with dopamine at first and then treated with AgNO<sub>3</sub> in an aqueous medium under room temperature. Dopamine was utilized as the binding agent and reductant. Silver ions (Ag<sup>+</sup>) were reduced to AgNPs and distributed homogeneously on the surface of dopamine-modified polyester fabrics. The polyester fabrics with AgNPs showed a highly antibacterial activity even after being washed 30 times.</p>

<p>Polyester fabrics supplied by Esquel Group (Gaoming, China) were cleaned by diethyl ether anhydrous before used. Dopamine hydrochloride was purchased from Webb Chemical Co., Ltd (Guangzhou), which was imported from Acros Organics, USA. Silver nitrate, Tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris), potassium phosphate monobasic (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>), sodium phosphate dibasic (Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All chemicals were used without further purification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040517512454187"><title>The modification of polyester fabrics</title>
<p>Dopamine with a concentration of 0.01 mol/l was dissolved in the buffer solution, which was prepared by Tris.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512454187">16</xref></sup> Then the pH value of the solution was regulated to a typical marine environments (pH = 8.5) with HCl. The polyester fabrics were dipped directly into dopamine solution with stirring for 24 h at room temperature, then were taken out and rinsed with deionized water until the solution turned clear. The polyester fabrics treated by dopamine will be called dopa-polyester fabrics in the subsequent discussion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040517512454187"><title>The in situ reduction of silver nanoparticles on the surface of dopa-polyester fabrics</title>
<p>The polyester fabrics and dopa-polyester fabrics were immersed into silver nitrate solution (0.29 mol/l) at room temperature for 8 h. Then the samples were rinsed with flowing deionized water for 10 min and dried at 40°C in the vacuum oven for 6 h. The obtained samples were respectively designated as polyester/Ag and dopa-polyester/AgNPs fabrics in the subsequent discussion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0040517512454187"><title>Scanning electron microscope</title>
<p>The surface morphologies of the dopamine functionalized and silver metalized dopa-polyester were investigated in a JEOL JSM 5600 scanning electron microscope (SEM). The SEM measurements were performed at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0040517512454187"><title>X-ray diffraction</title>
<p>X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization was performed by a D/max-2550PC diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (wavelength 1.54056).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0040517512454187"><title>Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry</title>
<p>The content of silver was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) using the prodigy spectrometer (Teledyne Leeman Labs, USA). The wavelength ranged from 165 to 800 nm.</p>
<p>Before ICP measurements, the sample needed to be digested according to the following procedure.</p>
<p>The sample was digested using a Multiwave 3000 microwave digestion system (Anton-Paar, courtaboeuf, France), equipped with a rotor for eight 80 ml type quartz vessels (operating pressure, 80 bar). Before use, quartz vessels were decontaminated in a bath of 10% nitric acid (67%, v/v), then were rinsed with ultrapure water and dried in a 40°C oven. Samples were weighed precisely to 0.01 g in the quartz digestion vessels and wet-oxidized with 1 ml H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (98%, v/v) and 4 ml HNO<sub>3</sub> (67%, v/v). One randomly selected vessel was filled with regents only and taken through the entire procedure as a blank. The digestion procedure had previously been optimized. After cooling at room temperature, sample solutions were quantitatively transferred into 100 ml polyethylene flasks. The digested samples were then filled with ultrapure water to the final volume before analysis by ICP-OES.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0040517512454187"><title>Washing fastness testing</title>
<p>The washing fastness testing of polyester/Ag and dopa-polyester/AgNPs fabrics was performed according to the ISO105-C10:2006 standard using the SW-12A II Launder-O-Meter Standard Instrument.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0040517512454187">21</xref></sup> The liquid ration was 50:1 and the washing temperature was 40°C. The samples were washed for 30 min in a solution of soap with a concentration of 5 g/l for one cycle, rinsed with deionized water and dried at 40°C in the vacuum oven for 6 h.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0040517512454187"><title>Antibacterial activity</title>
<p>The antibacterial efficiencies of treated samples were quantitatively estimated using Gram-negative bacteria <italic>E. coli</italic> according to the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) 100-2004 standard.</p>
<p>Before the microbiological experimentation, all glass wares and samples were sterilized by autoclaving at 121°C for 15 min. Finished fabrics (0.4 g), which were cut up into chips, were put into a 150 ml Erlenmeyer flask and inoculated with 35 ml phosphate buffer solution (pH = 7.4) and 1.0 ml of a nutrient broth culture containing 1–2 × 10<sup>5</sup> CFUs (colony forming units) of bacteria. The samples were then incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The polyester fabrics were used as a control. After serial dilutions with phosphate buffer solution were made, the bacterial suspensions were spread on nutrient agar plates and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Then the number of CFUs was counted. The reported data were the average value of three parallel runs.</p>
<p>The percentage of microbe reduction (<italic>R</italic>%) was calculated using the following equation:

<sec id="sec12-0040517512454187"><title>The reduction and binding of AgNPs on the surface of dopa-polyester fabrics</title>
<p>After the polyester fabrics and dopa-polyester fabrics were treated by silver nitrate solution, XRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512454187">Figure 3</xref>) was conducted to identify the formation of metallic silver. It can be seen that three major peaks found at 37.96, 44.28 and 64.82 on the 2θ scale correspond to the (111), (200) and (220) crystal planes, respectively. However, no corresponding peaks appear on the spectrum of polyester fabrics and the polyester/Ag fabrics shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512454187">Figures 3(a)</xref> and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0040517512454187">b</xref>). It was confirmed that metallic silver has formed only on the surface of the dopa-polyester fabrics.

However, when the samples were washed 30 times, it was noticed that there were relatively few particles remaining on the surface of the fabric, because the aggregated silver particles adsorbed only onto the surface of dopa-polyester fabric were washed away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512454187">Figure 4(b)</xref>). This confirms that polydopamine membranes own a strong metal-binding ability and adhesion property to the monodispersed silver nanoparticles. The possible Ag<sup>+</sup> in situ reduction mechanism for polydopamine has been discussed in our previous research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0040517512454187">21</xref></sup>

<p>The content of silver on the polyester/Ag and dopa-polyester/AgNPs fabrics was determined by ICP-OES analysis. From the results of ICP-OES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0040517512454187">Figure 5</xref>), it was evident that the content of silver adsorbed by the dopa-polyester fabrics was much higher than that adsorbed by the polyester fabrics, as expected. According to reports, it was mainly attributed to adhesion of the poly(dopamine) on the surface of polyester fabrics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0040517512454187">16</xref></sup> On the other hand, it can be seen that the amount of AgNPs decreased quickly during washed 1–10 times. It was considered that some AgNPs with large size or aggregation adsorbed just onto the surface of dopa-polyester fabrics were easily washed away. However, the content of AgNPs decreased slowly and sustained relatively steadily after washing 10 times. The content of AgNPs on the dopa-polyester/AgNPs samples remained 1.38 mg/g even if the fabrics were washed 30 times, which was in agreement with the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0040517512454187">Figure 4</xref>. However, the content of silver on the unmodified polyester fabrics was nearly zero after washing 30 times.

<p>Polydopamine coatings could be formed on the surface of polyester fabrics after treating with dopamine in the Tris buffer solution. The catechol groups in the polydopamine coatings could in situ reduce the Ag<sup>+</sup> to Ag<sup>0</sup> without adding any further reducing agent. AgNPs can be generated and distributed homogeneously on the surface of dopamine-modified polyester fabrics. The polyester fabrics coated with AgNPs show excellent durable antibacterial activity for at least 30 washes.</p>
