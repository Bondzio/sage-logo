<p>How, we might ask, are sport and religion connected? The truth is that, in Britain at least, these two cultural practices share a good deal of common ground primarily as a consequence of the role of Protestantism in the development of sport in Victorian times. Recent years have witnessed an increasing amount of academic discussion and debate around the sport–religion relationship. What this article aims to do is to map out the key historical features of this relationship while providing insight into the ways in which the Protestant Church continues to pursue sport as a form of outreach and ministry.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0040571X12440921" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past thirty or forty years there has been a steady growth in academic literature concerning the relationship between sport and religion – albeit predominantly from an American perspective.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0040571X12440921">1</xref></sup> What this article sets out to do is to map the key features of this relationship, focusing specifically on developments in the UK both during and since the Victorian period. The aim here is not simply to reiterate a series of existing arguments around the alleged origins of modern-day sport, but to bring together (and draw clear connections between) two key narratives that feature heavily within related literatures: those concerning ‘muscular Christianity’ and ‘rational recreation’. To this end, we begin by addressing the formative and innovative role which the English public schools and the Protestant church in Britain played in the growth of sport. Our discussion then goes on to locate these developments against a wider cultural backdrop of nineteenth-century social change. The subsequent decline of the relationship between the Protestant Church and sport in the UK during the twentieth century is acknowledged, but it is also argued that there are now signs of church growth and specifically sports ministry as a means of outreach, especially among young people. The final section of the article outlines how sports ministry workers may be seen to be re-engaging professionally in both church and non-church settings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0040571X12440921"><title>Sport, Protestantism and the English public schools</title>
<p>For all the innovative proactivity of the Victorians, it would be fair to say that, in Britain at least, the early nineteenth century Protestant church was far from convinced of the value of sport to Christian life. During this period Protestantism was characterized by what has been described as an ‘unrelenting hostility’ toward sport, largely perceiving it as an activity devoid of spiritual value.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0040571X12440921">2</xref></sup> As the century progressed, however, this negative perception began to change with sport coming to be seen (both in the UK and in the US) as a potential site of Christian witness. There were various reasons for this change of outlook, but an important influence was the English public schools.</p>
<p>A well-rehearsed argument in the literature surrounding the development of modern sport in Britain is that during the mid-nineteenth century certain sporting activities were transformed from a collection of unruly pastimes into a series of structured and codified games via the English public schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0040571X12440921">3</xref></sup> This transformation, it is argued, was primarily triggered by changes within the governance and practices of the schools themselves and, in particular, through the work of Thomas Arnold, Headteacher of Rugby School between 1828 and 1841.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0040571X12440921">4</xref></sup> For all the prestige that was attached to the English public schools at that time one of the characteristics that these institutions often failed to exhibit was a sense of leadership and order.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0040571X12440921">5</xref></sup> This was something that Thomas Arnold sought to address when he arrived at Rugby, an appointment which came not only amid criticisms of unruliness in the public schools themselves but at a time when broader fears of moral breakdown prevailed. Arnold resolved to remedy such evils at Rugby by introducing new forms of governance and new curricular structures. Central to these reforms were his religious beliefs and a desire to transform his young charges into ‘good Christian gentlemen’. One of the common misconceptions surrounding the prevalence of the games-playing ethos at Rugby is that Arnold himself was the instigator of such activities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0040571X12440921">6</xref></sup> Yet he appears to have had no real interest in sport. Rather, his colleague the Revd George Cotton is said to have overseen athletic provision at the school.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0040571X12440921">7</xref></sup> Moreover, the Arnoldian regime amounted to much more than simply playing games; an education in the ‘classics’ continued to be upheld as the guardian of moral character, and the passing of responsibility to older pupils (<italic>prefects</italic>) as the gateway to discipline, respect and ‘Christian manliness’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0040571X12440921">8</xref></sup> Word of Arnold’s reforms travelled fast both inside and outside the public schools. A central reason for this was the writings of two well-known authors of the time, Charles Kingsley and Thomas Hughes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0040571X12440921"><title>Sport and Victorian values</title>
<p>During the mid-nineteenth century Charles Kingsley (clergyman, academic, novelist and poet), and his friend and associate, Thomas Hughes (lawyer, politician and novelist), became key players in the relationship between sport and religion. Specific aspects of the work of these two figures stand out as especially influential in this respect, perhaps most notably Hughes’s <italic>Tom Brown’s Schooldays</italic> (1857) the story of a boy (Tom Brown) whose character is shaped during his days at Rugby school.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0040571X12440921">9</xref></sup> Hughes had been a pupil of Arnold at Rugby between 1834 and 1841, but the book is said to have been based on the experiences of his brother, George Hughes, who also attended the school. Along with the work of Kingsley, the sense of high moral value and masculine physical endeavour which Hughes’s novel portrayed collectively formed the basis of what came to be known as ‘muscular Christianity’; a term encapsulating spiritual, moral and physical purity alongside notions of Christian manliness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0040571X12440921">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of course, in reality, muscular Christianity had its roots in a whole range of ethical and moral concerns which were prevalent in Britain in the mid-1800s: the protection of the weak, the plight of the poor and the promotion of moral virtue. The incorporation of these (and other) issues into a framework of physical endeavour and spiritual purity resulted in the establishment of a series of core values which, in time, came to underpin the relationship between sport and religion: fair play, respect (both for oneself and others), physical and emotional strength, perseverance, deference, subordination, obedience, discipline, loyalty, co-operation, self-control, self-sacrifice, endurance. Especially significant here was a fervent Christianity and stoic masculinity which collectively engendered the formation of personal character and a respect for the physical body. Revered too were courage, temperance and <italic>esprit de corps</italic>, the ‘holy trinity’ of moral stature, most notably expressed by the life and works of Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the modern Olympic Games, who declared a familiarity with the work of Thomas Hughes and, after visiting Rugby in 1883, was said to be heavily influenced by that of Arnold.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0040571X12440921">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clearly, Charles Kingsley and Thomas Hughes were not the first to infer the moral value (or alleged manly qualities) of sporting pursuits. Such sentiments are evident within the work of previous writers such as J.-J. Rousseau, George Lawrence and William Clarke.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0040571X12440921">12</xref></sup> Specific to the work of Kingsley and Hughes, however, was a belief in the power of the culture of games to combat the perceived effeminacy of society and, for that matter, of the public schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0040571X12440921">13</xref></sup> More importantly, there was a growing concern in the mid-1800s that church congregations, (and Christianity per se), were succumbing to a wave of effeminacy. Some wanted Protestantism to become more intimately reconnected to masculine values. Ministers were criticized for promoting sentimentality and reflection over a more assertive philosophy of social action. Kingsley, for one, saw manliness as the antidote to this debilitating malaise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0040571X12440921">14</xref></sup> Muscular Christianity was certainly perceived as a response to the puritanical religiosity of the time and the somewhat static nature of the Church with regards to broader social issues. Both Kingsley and Hughes were also sympathizers of Chartism and concerned with the social injustices suffered by the working classes, seemingly redirecting their energies towards the Christian Socialist movement once the Chartist petition had been rejected in 1848.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0040571X12440921">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Be it attributable to Kingsley and Hughes or not, the upshot of the wider dissemination of the muscular Christian ideology was that the Protestant elite began to advocate the use of sports to promote the relationship between the development of mind, body and spirit. In turn, a series of broader social conditions and circumstances came to nurture its emergence, one of which was the Victorian preoccupation with sanitation and health, a mindset exacerbated by the vagaries of an increasingly industrialized working class.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0040571X12440921"><title>Sport, Victorian society and rational recreation</title>
<p>The rapid onset of industrialization in nineteenth-century Britain stimulated significant social change as everyday life began to reconfigure along broadly urban lines, generating a series of anxieties among the social elite over issues such as health, sanitation, welfare and productivity. This, in turn, led to a desire to improve and refine both the fortunes and habits of ordinary working folk in accordance with a variety of altogether more acceptable activities, a movement which Holt and others have termed ‘rational recreation’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0040571X12440921">16</xref></sup> Put simply, rational recreation comprised the will of the British middle and upper classes to reform society by diverting the attentions of the masses away from ‘unsavoury’ popular cultural pastimes (i.e. drinking, gambling and cruelty sports), replacing these with altogether more acceptable leisure-time pursuits in order to promote ‘rational’ (as opposed to irrational and unruly) behaviour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0040571X12440921">17</xref></sup> As the influence of the Church declined and its powers of moralization dissipated, legislation and repression emerged as the mechanisms by which such change took shape. In this sense, sport in the Victorian era flourished not only as a new kind of popular cultural pastime but also as a broader means of social control.</p>
<p>The Church did, of course, have a role to play here. During the mid to late nineteenth century, for example, it was not uncommon for clergy to be involved in sporting provision, some proving instrumental in the establishment of major sports clubs, a number of which still exist.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0040571X12440921">18</xref></sup> Employers too had similar ideas, with a selection providing sports facilities for their workers alongside more general encouragements (and sometimes requirements) regarding regular physical exercise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0040571X12440921">19</xref></sup> At a popular cultural level then, the development of sport during the nineteenth century may be seen as something of a battle ground with regards to class conflict. In this sense, it would be misguided to view muscular Christianity and rational recreation as entirely unrelated. For sure, there were differences in the way in which these two prevailing ideologies sought to manage the emotional and physical wellbeing of the working classes. In terms of the way in which both utilized sport and physical activity in order to do this, however, the underlying motive was one of disciplinary and controlling proportion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0040571X12440921"><title>Sport and the Church: a new era?</title>
<p>Given the class tensions surrounding sport and other popular cultural pastimes during the Victorian period, how then, we might ask, was the relationship between the Protestant church and sport configured? In line with the work of other historians, McLeod has noted that from the 1850s onwards, sports grew in popularity in Britain (both at a participatory and at a spectatorship level) and that, as a consequence, the Church came to recognize more readily the value of such pursuits both in terms of their social status and their religious significance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0040571X12440921">20</xref></sup> Indeed, it is clear that from the mid-nineteenth century churches actively began to explore connections with sport partly out of a desire to eradicate the strong sense of ‘puritanism’ permeating their orbits and the resultant alienation of ‘ordinary folk’. The second half of the nineteenth century witnessed a spectacular explosion of sport. By 1900 half a million or more played regularly in leagues.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0040571X12440921">21</xref></sup> Church sports teams began to spring up all over Britain, although they were much more common among liberal than among evangelical churches.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0040571X12440921">22</xref></sup> It has been estimated that in Birmingham in the years 1871–80 20 per cent of the total number of cricket clubs and just under 25 per cent of the association football clubs had connections with religious organizations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0040571X12440921">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The inclusion of sport as a part of church life often came about as a consequence of the introduction of a series of broader activities into congregational leisure time. These comprised such things as afternoon teas, picnics and occasional games. But church sporting provision was more complex than simply the setting up of football teams or the organization of leisure pursuits. Evident also was the formal establishment of libraries, chess, billiard, tennis and cycling clubs and, specifically for females, rounders, table tennis, hockey, gymnastics and calisthenics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0040571X12440921">24</xref></sup> All of this culminated in the development of a sophisticated network of activities the underpinning principles for which appear common to a range of denominations.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0040571X12440921">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Notwithstanding the increased level of tolerance demonstrated by liberal in comparison to evangelical churches, from 1850 onwards Protestantism in Britain had begun to accept sport as a legitimate and holistic lifestyle pursuit. To this end, it can be argued that sport added to a broader secularization of the Church around this time. Needless to say, there were ongoing debates and tensions surrounding the role of sporting activity in church life; these included anxieties over the kinds of moral values that it promoted and whether these were commensurate with Scripture, and the allocation of time to such habits amid the dissolution of strict sabbatarianism. One such example is that of Welsh rugby. Though several junior Welsh rugby teams were originally founded by churches, Smith and Williams have argued that non-conformists were often discouraged from participating.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0040571X12440921">26</xref></sup> The Welsh Revival of 1904–5 had a significant impact in this respect, with players stopping games to go to church, cancelling fixtures, dissolving their teams or transforming them into prayer clubs. In the wake of Evan Roberts’s crusade through the valleys of East Glamorgan in November 1904, Noddfa Chapel Treorchy suddenly found its Sunday School increased by the addition of a ‘footballer’s class’, which included the captain of Treorchy RFC who had renounced rugby forever. At Ynysybwl the entire team was baptized and all sporting activities were rejected for three years.</p>
<p>Hence, engagement between the Protestant Church and sport in the UK during the latter half of the nineteenth century was evident but not unilateral. Evangelicals remained less convinced of the value of sport. Matheson distinguishes between the appropriation of muscular Christianity within the Evangelical church and the classical model of Kingsley and Hughes, suggesting that the former was predicated more on a view of sport as an evangelistic tool rather than as having value in itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0040571X12440921">27</xref></sup> Generally speaking evangelicals viewed sport as a transient pastime to be put aside in order to take on the more important tasks of life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0040571X12440921">28</xref></sup> Key sporting figures of the time epitomized this stance. For example, at the age of 23, England cricketer C. T. Studd gave up cricket to devote his life to missionary work, first in China, then India and, finally, Africa, where he died in 1931.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0040571X12440921">29</xref></sup> The life of the Scottish athlete Eric Liddell charts a similar tale.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0040571X12440921">30</xref></sup> Liddell, whose story has become well known as a consequence of the 1981 film <italic>Chariots of Fire</italic>, won gold in the 400 metres in a new World Record time in the 1924 Olympics in Paris but is probably best remembered for his refusal to run in the 100 metres – his strongest event – because of the fact that the heats for the race fell on a Sunday. Viewing his faith as a more profitable pursuit than his athletic career, Liddell gave up competitive sport in 1925, returning to his birthplace, China, as a missionary teacher.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0040571X12440921"><title>Sport and Protestantism post-1945</title>
<p>As the relationship between sport and the Protestant Church grew stronger, muscular Christianity appeared in new and innovative guises. For example, the post-1945 period witnessed a significant rise in neo-evangelicalism on both sides of the Atlantic which brought with it a wide range of sports mission organizations such as the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and Athletes in Action in the US and, in the UK, Christians in Sport.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0040571X12440921">31</xref></sup> Given the significant role that these organizations (and those like them) played in the development of the sport–religion relationship, it is to a closer examination of their influence that we now turn.</p>
<p>In 1945 the young Youth for Christ (YFC) evangelist, Billy Graham, keen to make a lasting impression at a YFC rally at which he was speaking, invited America’s then leading distance runner Gill Dodds to compete against a local opponent and to talk about his Christian faith. It was a partnership made in heaven with Graham utilizing Dodds’s sporting fame to generate interest and appeal. It was to prove to be a seminal moment and, for Ladd and Mathisen, a ‘significant early step in the re-engagement of religion and sport’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0040571X12440921">32</xref></sup> creating, as it did, the first high-profile American muscular Christian role model after what Mathisen has called an ‘interlude of fifty years of uncertainty’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0040571X12440921">33</xref></sup> Billy Graham quickly realized the potential of sport for his evangelistic crusades, thereafter seizing every opportunity to present sporting heroes at such events. What Graham pioneered proved to be a new model of evangelical muscular Christianity which, over the next sixty years, provided the focal point of the sport–religion relationship for Protestant America.</p>
<p>The Christian presence in American sport made further ground in the 1950s and 60s with the formation of Athletes in Action (AIA) and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA). The FCA was founded in 1954, subsequently flourishing into a notable High School and coaches’ ministry. From its inception in 1966, AIA rapidly grew into a world-wide movement holding fast to its original mission statement to introduce athletes to Christ and, subsequently, to use their profile as an evangelistic platform. As the number of evangelical Christians in US professional sport began to increase, so too did opportunities for sports chaplaincy. With the support of the commissioner of Major League Baseball, Bowie Kuhn, in 1974 Baseball Chapel was established in order to provide a chapel programme for all major league baseball teams, with a minor league programme following in 1978.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0040571X12440921">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>Alongside the blossoming of sports chaplaincy came a redefinition of sports ministry in the life of American churches via increasing investment in resources and full-time sports ministers. Indeed, modern-day iterations of the sport–religion relationship seem a far cry from their muscular Christian roots. For example, the Peninsula Covenant Church in Redwood City, California, features among its facilities a gymnasium, eight floodlit tennis courts, a swimming pool and a basketball court, all of which run on a commercial basis. Similarly, visitors to the Saddleback Community Church in Southern California might pick up details of the church’s sports programme, including hiking, motorcycle ministry, racquetball, weekend mixed golf, family sports, sailing, water sports (water-skiing, white-water rafting, scuba-diving, kayaking, surfing), fishing, running, bowling, winter sports, basketball, softball and cycling.</p>
<p>While not as dramatic as in the US, sports ministry has also grown significantly in the UK. During the post-1950s period the voluntary municipal and commercial provision of sport grew in Britain but regular attendances at church progressively reduced, especially among young people. The secularization of sport was even more marked than the displacement of church from education and youth work. So much so that by the 1980s many congregations had no involvement in what was the most popular leisure choice for young people, and their youth went elsewhere to play sport. However, by this time moves were afoot to re-establish the relationship between sport and the church in Britain. In the mid-1970s, for example, a delegation from the UK were invited to attend a sports ministry conference in the US. On their return they decided to set up a Christian ministry for sport in the UK, culminating in 1975 with the launch of the Christian Sportsmen's Outreach. Over the next five years attempts were made to identify Christians in professional sport. Conferences were held at Bisham Abbey (1976) and Crystal Palace (1977). By 1980 the movement had been renamed Christians in Sport and registered as a charity. In 1984 Andrew Wingfield Digby was appointed to a salaried position as director of this growing organization and a Christians in Sport office was established in Oxford.</p>
<p>Today the spectrum of the Christian community’s interface with sport in the UK is vast, with around thirty-five different Christian organizations in existence. There are ministries focused on specific sporting activities such as Christian Surfers UK or Logos Golf Ministries. Ambassadors in Sport, Kick London and Sports Pursuits offer sports coaching delivered by highly qualified Christian coaches. Higher Sports provides simple-to-use coaching programmes with spiritual application to introduce children to football, rugby or cricket. Sports Chaplaincy UK (formerly SCORE) specializes in promoting sports chaplaincy, whether by supporting the network of over a hundred chaplains to sports such as professional football, rugby, cricket and horse racing, or by offering chaplaincy to an event like the 2010 Women’s Rugby World Cup. Organizations like Youth for Christ and Operation Mobilisation have dedicated sports staff. Increasingly UK sports ministries are taking their expertise abroad to serve and develop emerging sports ministry around the world. This is evident in the work of the Kings Foundation’s in Botswana, Christians in Sport’s training of young leaders in India and Uganda, Kick London and Ambassadors in Sport providing coach education in South Africa or Ukraine, and Verité Sport’s partnerships with women’s football in Togo and basketball in Kazakhstan. While some of this work might be seen as following in the traditions of the muscular Christian ethos, the majority of such projects are motivated by a broader desire to evangelize sport and/or to evangelize the world through sport.</p>
<p>A particularly significant development, in recent years, has been the increasing recognition of the potential of major sporting events as evangelistic opportunities. While the Church has traditionally been suspicious of major sports events it has now come to see these as an opportunity for witness and service. Mega-event ministry (as we would recognize it today) effectively began in 1988, at the summer Olympics in Seoul, Korea, and at the winter Games in Calgary, Canada. In the interim, mega-event strategy has evolved considerably. The initial focus was on the competitors themselves, along with those who came to watch the event live. In time the vision spread to encouraging the local church to use the interest generated in major events in their vicinity as a bridge to minister to the wider public. As the media revolution took hold, it became clear that approaches aimed at reaching people in the Olympic or World Cup host country could equally be applied to any city or country, when and where the event was given a significant media profile. The largest Christian campaign to take place thus far at a major sports event was at the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games when approximately forty-five denominations and para-church ministry groups participated (along with 700 churches) to stage outreach across Australia. ‘Quest Australia – More Than Gold’ facilitated the largest Christian community outreach on record during the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Quest’s structure included teams responsible for key areas of outreach such as: sports ministry, festivals, creative arts, athletes’ family hosting, prayer, resources, children and young people, communications, chaplaincy and evangelism. Examples of the ways in which practical outreach took place include: over 700 athletes’ family members being hosted in Christian homes as part of the Samsung Athletes’ Family Host 2000 programme, and the Salvation Army co-ordinating the distribution of 250,000 cups of water, tea and coffee, inside and outside Olympic venues during the Games. It is estimated that over one million sports-related Christian resources were distributed in the period leading up to (and during) the Sydney Olympics. Over 200,000 people attended 120 Torch Run and Opening Ceremony Festivals, staged by 500 churches across Australia. Planning for these events began a full 7 years before the outreach was staged.</p>
<p>Equally significant in the development of the relationship between sport and Christianity has been the impact of chaplaincy at major sports events. The first (unofficial) chaplains operated at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, an event infamously distinguished by the ‘Black September’ terrorist killings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0040571X12440921">35</xref></sup> Official chaplaincy within the Olympic Village which competitors inhabit is now an accepted part of the Games. At one level there is an opportunity for athletes to attend church services and to take part in communal acts of worship. However, mega-event chaplaincy goes much further than this, with chaplains providing pastoral services to competitors and, in many cases, developing longer term connections with those concerned.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0040571X12440921" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Throughout the preceding discussion our intention has been to present an overview of the way in which the relationship between sport and the Protestant Church has developed over the past 150 years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0040571X12440921">36</xref></sup> In so doing, we have argued that, through the work of Thomas Arnold at Rugby school and via the influence of writers such as Charles Kingsley and Thomas Hughes, the Victorian period played host to the emergence of the sport–religion relationship in Britain, and, as a consequence, longstanding religious values began to permeate and underpin sporting endeavour both at the grass-roots and the elite level. A series of broader social conditions and circumstances can also be seen to have nurtured the emergence of this relationship, one of which was a middle- and upper-class preoccupation with the social habits and pastimes of the industrialized working classes. We have subsequently highlighted how, over time, the ideological sporting values formulated during this period have been modified in various ways. Here, in closing, we offer our thoughts on the further development of this relationship and its potential in terms of broader notions of outreach and mission.</p>
<p>In his book <italic>Christianity’s Dangerous Idea: The Protestant Revolution from the Sixteenth to the Twenty-First Century</italic>, Alistair McGrath suggests that, because Protestant attitudes and opinions towards sport have traditionally demonstrated a tendency to fluctuate over time in accordance with prevailing theological and cultural assumptions, it is somewhat unwise to try to predict how such things might develop in future years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0040571X12440921">37</xref></sup> Given McGrath’s words of caution, how, we might ask, should we begin to think about future work in this area? For sure, there is evidence to suggest that both in the UK and the US the vestiges of evangelical negativism towards sport remains.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0040571X12440921">38</xref></sup> It is true, for example, that some churches and church leaders still see sport as something which detracts from (or counters) spiritual growth and maturity. At the same time, sport, as a specific area of ministry, has witnessed something of a resurgence in the UK in recent years and is now an established field of outreach both within church and para-church organizations and within secular settings. Likewise, those involved in sports ministry at a national level continue to forge forward in relation to establishing a presence in elite sport and within the context of mega-events; this is presently evidenced in and through the operation of the More Than Gold strategy, the interdenominational organization coordinating the Christian community’s involvement with the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games in London.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0040571X12440921">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>On a broader scale modern-day sports ministry also has a host of practical matters with which to deal. The culture of twenty-first-century secular sport is such that moral and ethical issues feature large amid the day-to-day processes of participation, spectatorship and media commentary all of which have the potential to manifest themselves, to some degree or another, within the context of church-based sports programmes. Likewise, nowadays Sunday church attendance often competes for the attentions of those wishing to play sport in secular circles, youth football’s move to Sunday mornings in the 1990s being a prime example of how such tensions and dilemmas may arise. Nevertheless, the popularity of sport (especially as an aspect of youth culture) continues to grow and, in this sense, one of the greatest challenges facing sports ministry workers is to provide a quality of service which competes with and surpasses all that the secular world can offer. Indeed, it is to keep pace with secular sporting provision, while distancing itself from the moral dissonance which it often promotes, that is arguably the most pressing challenge for modern-day sports ministry.</p>

<fn id="fn10-0040571X12440921"><label>10</label><p>Unlike Hughes, Kingsley did not approve of the term ‘muscular Christianity’. Indeed, though commonly attributed to him, the phrase did, in fact, emanate from a review of his book <italic>Two Years Ago</italic> which appeared in the <italic>Saturday Review</italic> in 1857 (see: B. Simon and I. Bradley (eds), <italic>The Victorian Public School: Studies in the Development of an Educational Institution</italic> (Dublin: Gill and Macmillan, 1975). The tenets of muscular Christianity should not solely be associated with Protestantism. On the contrary, a range of faiths and denominations have since allied themselves to such values and ideals. In turn, a number of scholars have suggested that the historical roots of the muscular Christian ethos date from well before the nineteenth century: see, for example, R. B. Ballou, ‘Analysis of the Writings of Selected Church Fathers to A.D. 394 to Reveal Attitudes regarding Physical Activity’, in E. F. Zeigler (ed.), <italic>History of Sport and Physical Education to 1900</italic>:<italic> Selected Topics</italic> (Champaign, Illinois: Stipes Publishing, 1973), pp. 187–99.</p></fn>

Lucas, ‘Baron de Coubertin and Thomas Arnold’, <italic>Bulletin du Comité International Olympique</italic> 98–9 (May–August 1967), pp. 58–60. The manifestation of these ideals within the context of the Olympic Games is, of course, most notably portrayed in the film <italic>Chariots of Fire</italic>, which tells the story of the Scottish athlete Eric Liddell.</p></fn>

<fn id="fn15-0040571X12440921"><label>15</label><p>Chartism was an English political movement for social reform most commonly associated with the period 1838–48, taking its name from the People’s Charter of 1838. While based on principles similar to those of Chartism the Christian Socialist movement advocated solutions to social ills through education and moral change rather than political negotiation and legislation.</p></fn>

As part of their analysis Ladd and Mathisen formulate a framework comprising the categories ‘engagement’, ‘disengagement’ and ‘re-engagement’ with regard to the relationship between sport and Protestantism. In turn, they argue that baseball legend Billy Sunday’s decision to quit professional baseball in the 1890s (as an activity incompatible with his new-found Christian faith) was the catalyst for the general American evangelical disengagement with sport.</p></fn>
