<abstract>
<p>The predictive value of selection criteria on outcome data from two cohorts of students (Total <italic>N</italic> = 525) accepted to an urban magnet high school were evaluated. Regression analyses of typical screening variables (suspensions, absences, metropolitan achievement tests, middle school grade point averages [GPAs], Matrix Analogies test scores, and demographic variables) on graduation and magnet school GPA indicate that most of the selection variables did not have predictive value. The results of the regression analyses are discussed, as well as the implications for using selection criteria in urban “select” schools.</p>

<body>
<p>Given the current demands to meet Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) as required by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042085911434569">No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB)</xref>, school districts are becoming increasingly focused on preparing students to take standardized tests, sometimes at the expense of preparing students to become successful citizens. Urban districts in particular have been challenged by the emphasis on meeting AYP, often changing their curricula and eliminating “specials” to spend more time preparing children for testing. With such an emphasis on standardized tests, many educational administrators may wonder whether these standardized tests are truly predictive of the lifetime success of their students in general, or even at a minimum, of academic success.</p>
<p>In many urban schools, the essential desire to improve test scores is closely linked to a concern about increasing graduation rates. Administrators are often concerned about their abilities to predict academic success in high school as measured by standardized test scores, as well as grade point averages (GPAs) and graduation rates. In addition to the general demands on districts to ensure AYP, schools that select their students based on what they believe are potentially predictive factors for success are even more concerned about the predictability of academic success. Often, urban districts use standardized test scores to select their “best students” for magnet or charter schools in an effort to increase the likelihood of graduation for those students, and thus for the district as a whole. When choosing students to admit to the select high schools, administrators often rely on potential predictors such as standardized group achievement tests, GPAs in middle school, student suspension rates, and attendance records. The predictive value of many of these and other academic factors, as well as factors such as parental involvement and personality traits, have previously been considered in the research literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085911434569">Anderson &amp; Keith, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042085911434569">Dollinger, Matyja, &amp; Huber, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085911434569">Hill et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042085911434569">Rysewyk, 2008</xref>). However, the findings do not all suggest the same predictive value for these variables.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085911434569">Anderson and Keith (1997)</xref> examined the relationship between student ability (as estimated through standardized vocabulary test scores) and academic success in at-risk (non-Asian minorities or students from low Socioeconomic Status families) high school students. Their results suggest that when compared with the quality of schooling, parental involvement, academic coursework and student motivation, student ability as measured through a standardized vocabulary test, best predicted academic success in high school. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085911434569">Anderson and Keith (1997)</xref> study also examined the relationship between academic achievement in high school and successful completion of academic coursework. Successful completion of coursework naturally leads to higher student GPAs, whereas failing to complete coursework leads to lower grades and thus lower GPAs. The authors found successful completion of academic coursework in high school was the second best significant and important predictor of academic achievement. They proposed that each additional academic course that an at-risk student completes may be expected to increase academic achievement test scores by 1/8 of a standard deviation. So completing two academic classes per year over the 4-year span of high school could amount to increasing the academic achievement test scores by about one standard deviation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085911434569">Anderson &amp; Keith, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Other studies have examined the relationship between junior high/middle school GPAs and high school GPA/graduation rates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085911434569">Nichols (2003)</xref> found that students who maintained GPA at or below ‘C’ in early grades were also likely to continue struggling academically in high school. In many cases, GPA continued to decline, and the students had difficulty in passing state proficiency exams.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042085911434569">Piliawsky and Somers (2004)</xref> examined the influence of academic tutoring on academic functioning (as measured by GPA) and graduation/drop-out rates. They hypothesized that academic tutoring would lead to increased academic achievement, which in turn would help prevent school dropouts and increase graduation rates. The results of their study indicate that although the students did not experience significantly increased GPAs in response to the academic tutoring, it was successful in decreasing drop-out rates among those students. Other previous research found that academic tutoring resulted in significantly fewer dropouts among at-risk adolescents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042085911434569">Janosz, LeBlanc, Boulerice, and Tremblay (1997)</xref> similarly found that as school grades declined, the risk of dropping out of high school increased.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042085911434569">Barclay and Doll (2001)</xref> conducted a meta-analysis of previous research concerning school dropout, which confirmed a relationship between school dropouts and early academic difficulties. Specifically, they reported a previous study which found that 90% of students who had dropped out of high school had failing academic records by middle school. In contrast to this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042085911434569">Palardy and Rumberger (2005)</xref> found little or no relationship between academic achievement in high school and drop-out rates. Rather, their findings suggest that schools that are effective in promoting student learning (i.e., academic achievement or GPA) are not necessarily effective in reducing drop-out rates. This implies that to improve schools’ effectiveness, they should focus on each of these factors independently (i.e., implement programs to enhance school achievement while also implementing programs to decrease school dropouts), rather than relying on one factor to influence the other.</p>
<p>Suspension rates have also been found to be related to high school graduation rates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042085911434569">Baker et al. (2001)</xref> conducted a meta-analysis of previous research and found that students who drop out of school are more likely to have been suspended or expelled than peers who graduated. Additional findings suggested that expulsions or suspensions were often cited by students as direct or indirect reasons for dropping out.</p>
<p>Finally, student attendance records have also been found to be related to high school GPA and graduation rates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042085911434569">Anderson and Keith (1997)</xref> examined indicators of behavioral motivation (including attendance records) in at-risk and general samples of high school students. Their results indicate that behavioral motivation is a significant and important predictor of academic achievement. Further, although this finding was strongest among at-risk high school students, this positive influence of attendance on academic achievement has also been found to be true for high school students in general. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042085911434569">Nichols (2003)</xref> also found a relationship between academic achievement and attendance and noted that students who struggle academically are also absent more frequently than students who do not struggle. Moreover, failing students averaged nearly twice as many yearly absences as students who were not failing. With regard to standardized achievement tests in reading, math, and language, Nichols found a negative relationship between achievement scores and average yearly absences. These findings support previous research findings regarding the relationship between academic achievement and attendance variables in high school students.</p>
<p>The present study examines the relationship between several potentially predictive variables that were being used by an urban school district to select students for enrollment in its magnet school. Several aspects of this study offer unique insight into the processes used by an urban district. Given the currently overwhelming emphasis on standardized testing, it is useful to carefully examine the predictive values of such tests when fully considering their value as assessment tools. In addition, the study provides an opportunity to look not only at the predictive value of the selection criteria on the likelihood of graduation, but also on the performance in high school and the relationship between all of these variables and behavioral variables such as suspension rates.</p>

<title>School</title>
<p>Selection and longitudinal outcome data from two cohorts of students accepted to an urban magnet school were examined in this study. The school originally opened about 30 years ago in response to a desegregation mandate. It is in an economically deprived urban area, with approximately 40% of students receiving free and reduced lunch at the school, whereas closer to 80% in the district receive free and reduced lunch. Approximately 5 years ago the admission requirements were “relaxed” to increase enrollment. The student population for grades 8 through 12 has been between 880 and 990 students per year for the past 10 years.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section5-0042085911434569">
<title>Regression Analyses</title>
<p>Several variables were being used in selecting applicants for admission to the magnet school. Both selection and outcome data from the 1999 and 2000 magnet-school cohorts were used in the analyses. The regression analyses examine the predictive values of the following screening variables:</p>
<list id="list1-0042085911434569" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Suspension and attendance data</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Metropolitan Achievement Test Reading scores (READ 7)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Metropolitan Achievement Test Math concepts scores (MATH 7)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>GPA in core subjects for sixth grade and the first semester of the seventh-grade year.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Matrix Analogies test scores</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Demographic variables (Gender, Ethnicity and SES)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The analyses include a logistic regression of those listed variables on the binomial variable of graduation (<italic>yes</italic> or <italic>no</italic>). In addition, a linear regression was conducted on the variable of GPA at the magnet school.</p>
<sec id="section6-0042085911434569">
<title>Logistic regression</title>
<p>The initial logistic regression of the above listed variables on graduation indicated that the regression equation that yielded the highest percentage of correct predictions (74.9%) of graduation included the following variables: MATH7, middle school GPA, suspensions, absences, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). A subsequent logistic regression was conducted that included only those variables. The results of that analysis suggest that ethnicity, SES, and gender do not significantly contribute to the prediction.</p>
<p>When included together, the remaining variables are predictive of graduation status. The middle school GPA is a very strong predictor of graduation from the magnet school. For each one-point increase in GPA, the odds of graduating increase by 255%. Similarly, the MATH7 is also a significant predictor, although it is not as strong as middle school GPA. A one-point increase in MATH7 score increases the odds of graduation by 1.9%.</p>
<p>When considering the behavioral variables of absences and suspensions, a negative predictive relationship is found. An increase of one absence in the total absences during sixth grade and the first semester of seventh grade decreases the odds of graduation by 10.2%. Similarly, an increase of one suspension in the total from sixth grade and the first semester of seventh grade decreases the odds of graduation by 60.2%.</p>
<p>If all of the above variables are taken into account, then girls are more likely to graduate from the magnet school than are boys. However, if we simply compare the rates of graduation for girls and boys without information about the other variables, then no significant differences based on gender in graduation rates are found.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0042085911434569">
<title>Linear regression</title>
<p>All of the above-listed variables were also included in a linear regression on the magnet school GPA. The results for the linear regression were extremely similar to the logistic regression, suggesting that variables that predict whether a student will graduate are also likely to predict how well they will perform at the magnet school, as measured by GPA. Specifically, a stepwise regression indicated that the best prediction for GPA came from an equation which included only middle school GPA, Math7, and suspensions (total from 6th grade and the 1st semester of 7th grade). All the other variables did not add any significant benefits in prediction. The equation that included middle school GPA, Math7, and suspensions yielded a statistically significant <italic>r</italic> = .625, indicating that approximately 39% of the variance in GPA can be accounted for by looking at the regression equation with those three variables. The final regression equation with standardized variables is,</p>

<title>Additional Analyses</title>
<p>Several additional analyses were conducted to further ascertain which variables may be related to performance at the magnet school, and to address whether the magnet school maintains representative diversity in the urban school district. The findings from those additional analyses are summarized in this section.</p>
<sec id="section9-0042085911434569">
<title>The diversity of the magnet school students</title>
<p>To assess whether the diversity of students at the magnet school is representative of the diversity of students in the district overall, chi-square analyses were conducted on the variables of gender, SES (as measured by free and reduced lunch status), and ethnic group. Separate analyses were conducted for the 1999 and 2000 cohorts, because the composition of students in the district changes slightly each year. The district data were taken from the years in which the selection data for the 1999 and 2000 cohort of students were collected, the 1998 and 1999 academic years, respectively.</p>
<p>The results indicate that for both years and all three variables, the magnet school students were not representative of the district. The <italic>p</italic> values for all six chi-square analyses were less than .001, suggesting that there is a statistically significant relationship between the distribution of students based on gender, SES, and ethnic group, and whether they attend the magnet school. There are more female students at the magnet school and fewer students with free and reduced lunch status. In addition, the distribution of ethnic groups is significantly different from the distribution in the district. There are more White students and fewer African American students at the magnet school than there are in the district overall. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042085911434569">Table 1</xref> provides the percentages of each group, as classified by gender, SES, and ethnic group for the magnet school students and for the urban district overall in the selection year (seventh grade). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0042085911434569">Table 2</xref> provides the same information for students in their 12th-grade year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0042085911434569">
<title>Differences in performance between pre-existing groups</title>
<p>In addition to looking at screening factors and demographic groups, it may also be useful to consider differences between other pre-existing groups in how they perform at the magnet school. To do this, analyses compared conditional and nonconditional admits, the 1999 and 2000 cohorts, and students who attended different middle schools, in both graduation rates and the magnet school GPA. No statistically significant differences in graduation rates, GPA, or semesters completed for those students admitted conditionally based on questionable test scores or GPA and those that were not admitted conditionally, were found.</p>
<p>Although the 2000 cohort completed significantly more semesters at the magnet school (<italic>M</italic> = 7.10) than did the 1999 cohort (<italic>M</italic> = 6.69), <italic>F</italic>(1,445) = 4.36, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, no statistically significant differences between the 1999 and 2000 cohorts in graduation rates or GPA were found. There are statistically significant relationships between the incoming schools and the number of semesters completed at the magnet school, χ<sup>2</sup>(80) = 108.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and between the incoming schools and the graduation rates at the magnet school, χ<sup>2</sup>(8) = 19.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. These data are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0042085911434569">Table 3</xref>. In these analyses, all schools outside of district are grouped as Category 1.

<title>Other analyses regarding performance at the magnet school</title>
<p>Other analyses related to the findings from the regression analyses examined the relationship between selection and outcome variables. There is a statistically significant linear relationship between the final middle school GPA and the final the magnet school GPA, <italic>r</italic>(443) = .51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. There are also statistically significant correlations between the READ and MATH scores for sixth and seventh grades (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 for all six correlations).</p>
<p>Although the regression analyses indicate that the demographic variables of gender, ethnic group, and SES do not contribute to the equations which best predict success at the magnet school, the data do suggest that the distribution of students based on SES is different for those that graduate from the magnet school than it is for those that do not. A chi-square, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 13.61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, for the data presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0042085911434569">Table 4</xref> indicates that the distribution of SES groups for students who graduate from the magnet school is not the same as the distribution of SES groups that begin at the magnet school. The slight discrepancy between the findings from the regression analyses and the chi-square analyses suggests that when the other variables which do contribute significantly to the prediction of graduation are taken into account, SES does not add anything to the prediction. In addition, the distributions of gender and ethnic groups for students entering the magnet school and students graduating from the magnet school are not significantly different.</p>

<title>Students who do not graduate from the magnet school</title>
<p>Another way to attain information about who does and does not perform well at the magnet school is to consider the students who leave the magnet school before graduating. Almost half (47.8%) of the 1999 and 2000 students did not graduate from the magnet school. The most common reason of leaving for those who did not graduate was poor grades (39.0%) followed by parent request (33.5%). It is important to remember that even though a student did not graduate from the magnet school, it is possible that he or she did graduate from a different high school.</p>
<p>When considering the potential relationship between demographic groups and reasons for leaving the magnet school, chi-square analyses suggest that the reasons for leaving are not generally different for different groups. Specifically, no significant relationship is found between gender and reasons for leaving. There is also no relationship between free and reduced lunch status and the reason for withdrawal from the magnet school. The relationship between ethnic group and reason for withdrawal does approach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = .053). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0042085911434569">Table 5</xref> provides the reasons given for withdrawal by students in each ethnic group.</p>

<p>Looking at other factors related to admittance to the school also does not seem to provide much insight into reasons for withdrawal. There is no relationship between the school from which the magnet school students came and their reasons for withdrawal. There is also no relationship between whether a student was admitted to the magnet school conditionally and their reason for withdrawal.</p>
<p>Of those who left the magnet school, the destination is unknown for 43.4%, whereas 41.4% transferred to a different local school, and 15.1% moved out of the district. Thus, of the 47.8% who did not graduate from the magnet school, at least 56.5% moved to different schools, from which they may have graduated.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although the urban school district has attempted to use several types of data to select the students who will be most likely to succeed at the magnet school, it appears that several of the input variables do not offer true value in that prediction. Although the attempt to select a variety of variables that might provide information not normally provided by standardized tests is admirable, that data does not seem to provide insight into the likelihood of academic success. For example, scores from the Matrix test, which measures nonverbal intelligence, have been used so that those students who may be intelligent in ways not often measured on academic tests might have the opportunity to attend the magnet school. However, those test scores are not good predictors of performance at the magnet school. This is likely due to the fact that success at the magnet school is not generally measured in nonverbal ways. Although only a few studies have examined the relationship between nonverbal intelligence and academic success, they have also found that the relationship is not statistically significant (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042085911434569">Jurden, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>There are, however, several variables already being used in the magnet school selection process which are reliable predictors of success. The best predictor overall is the cumulative middle school GPA at application time. This includes the sixth grade and first semester of the seventh grade. This variable is highly predictive of both senior high GPA and of whether a student will graduate. The only other academic variable which appears to contribute to a good prediction is the MATH test score from seventh grade.</p>
<p>Other variables which seem useful in predicting success are not academic, but instead might be considered behavioral. They are the total number of suspensions a student has in middle school at application time and to a lesser extent, the total number of absences. These findings suggest that in addition to striving to increase test scores, administrators might improve their graduation rates most by focusing on finding ways to make sure that attendance rates are high.</p>
<p>This information about the predictive value of these variables can be used in two different but complimentary ways. It can be used in creating the best methods for selecting students who will be most likely to succeed at the magnet school. It can also be used to target those students who are accepted for the magnet school, but are less likely to succeed. Those students may need extra academic help and encouragement to succeed.</p>
<p>Besides predicting academic success at the magnet school, the authors were asked to determine whether the makeup of students at the magnet school, as measured by gender, SES, and ethnic group was similar to the makeup of the urban district students overall. The answer is absolutely not. The magnet school students are diverse, but they are not diverse in the same way as the students in the district overall. However, success at the magnet school does not appear to be related to one’s gender, SES, or ethnic group.</p>
<p>In addition to the predictive value, or the lack of a predictive value for factors discussed in this article, future work in this area should combine the relative predictive values of the factors discussed here with other factors that have been shown to be uniquely predictive of success for certain populations. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042085911434569">Hill et al. (2004)</xref> demonstrated that although parental involvement was predictive of student aspirations, achievement, and behavior problems, the predictive value of parental involvement differed for different parental educational levels and ethnic background. Given the current segregated status of many of our urban schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042085911434569">Kozol, 2005</xref>), it is important to address how we might best predict and subsequently increase achievement for the populations that are currently in those urban schools.</p>
