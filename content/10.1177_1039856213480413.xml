<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to discuss the experience of psychiatry training in the decade 2000–2010. This period was a time of consolidating previous advances made during the decade of the brain, and one in which world events shaped the focus of policy and clinical care. Terrorist acts and war, and their consequences (people seeking refuge and asylum) contributed to a climate of fear which flowed on to psychiatric practice. Training at this time appeared preoccupied with risk assessment. We became more aware of the complexity of physical health problems in people with mental illness and were taught to prevent and manage them in our patients. During this decade, the internet and mobile technology shaped the way we communicate. For psychiatry, it delivered new ways to enhance mental health literacy, and access to information and on-line therapy and support.</p>

<sec id="section2-1039856213480413">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Local and world events in the 2000s influenced psychiatric practice and consumer involvement. A focus on risk may have led to more conservative management but also to recognition of the profession’s responsibility for the physical health of their patients. The new decade promises even more use of internet technology, a new education program and opportunities for trainees.</p>

<title>The zeitgeist</title>
<p>Internationally, perhaps the most defining date which set the tone for the decade was 11 September 2001. Shortly after this, there were the bombings in Bali and London and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Terrorism went from something in spy novels and Superman sequels to become part of the everyday lexicon. Inevitably, one consequence of these events was refugees. The Tampa crisis represented a nadir in Australian politics. Australian authorities turned away asylum seekers rescued by a freighter and instead employed the Navy to redirect them to Nauru and other small island nations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213480413">1</xref></sup> These actions promoted a local climate of fear and suspicion and saw public vilification of asylum seekers and refugees. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) maintained a strong stance opposing the prolonged detention of child asylum seekers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213480413">2</xref></sup> and played a significant role in ending this practice in Australia. Important research has been conducted in Australia concerning the mental health implications of detaining asylum seekers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213480413">3</xref></sup> and of post-migration and resettlement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213480413">4</xref></sup></p> <p>Locally, the Prime Minister Kevin Rudd’s apology in 2008 to the stolen generation of Indigenous Australians represented a significant cultural shift.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213480413">5</xref></sup> The formal recognition of the devastating transgenerational psychosocial consequences of the policy of forcibly removing Indigenous children from their families and placing them in care was a significant step towards healing and reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The Close the Gap campaign, launched in 2008 in response to the Social Justice Report, followed on from the apology and outlined targets to address the disadvantage in life expectancy, child mortality, education and employment in Indigenous Australians.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213480413">6</xref></sup></p> <p>The global financial crisis of 2007 contributed to the uncertainty and heightened perceptions of risk. Decades after deinstitutionalization, community mental health services remain under-resourced. Personally, this meant the frequent challenge (and frustration) of insufficient hospital beds and a lack of appropriate services in the community. The constant pressure on acute services tied up funding, such that new initiatives in early intervention struggled to become integrated and supported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213480413">7</xref></sup> Two significant Australian reports in this decade highlighted the crisis in mental health care, namely a lack of funding and unaffordability and other barriers to accessing mental health services.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213480413">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213480413">9</xref></sup></p> <p>The decade also saw the development of mobile devices - mobile phones included cameras, MP3 players - and later the internet and video calls. Communication expanded through social media such as Facebook and Twitter. Social media was used to enhance medical education via on-line clinical case study discussion and peer support groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213480413">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Preoccupation with risk</title>
<p>In an international climate of fear, psychiatry seemed to return to retrograde attitudes of paternalism and an obsession with safety. There was a noticeable focus on risk assessment in the management of patients of the public system. This was reflected in hospital policies, standardized assessment forms, and a shift in the focus of acute care in the stretched community services to those most “at risk”. Bed blocks in hospital became commonplace, often as a result of us struggling to accept the inevitability of risk in our clinical work. Clinical decisions seemed at times guided more by fear of adverse outcomes than individual needs and best interests. In New South Wales, Australia for example, the recommendations of the <italic>Tracking Tragedy 2008</italic> report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213480413">11</xref></sup> which reviewed homicide, serious injury and inpatient deaths of people with mental illness, were interpreted very narrowly by many public mental health units. Open or non-secured acute inpatient psychiatric units were perceived as problematic by the authors and many area health services quietly decided to lock their public mental health units in response. Thus, even voluntary patients were not truly free to leave when they chose. Numerous authors have tried to put risk into perspective by highlighting the lack of evidence for risk assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213480413">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213480413">13</xref></sup> This stance gained momentum towards the end of the decade.</p> <p>Running in parallel with the preoccupation with risk has been the increased recognition and shift towards improving the physical health of people with mental illness. In 2004, the theme of World Mental Health Day was “The relationship between physical and mental health: co-occurring disorders”.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213480413">14</xref></sup> The aims of the year were to see mental health receive the same recognition and treatment as physical health, to emphasize their interrelationship and promote holistic care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213480413">14</xref></sup> Curricula of psychiatry training at undergraduate and postgraduate specialty levels now routinely include topics such as the metabolic syndrome. During my period of training, there has been a strong emphasis on the responsibility of psychiatrists to prevent, assess and co-manage physical health problems in their patients.</p> <p>People with mental illness continue to have a high prevalence of smoking compared to the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213480413">15</xref></sup> This issue was a prominent theme during my training due to the enthusiasm of one of my fellow registrars.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213480413">15</xref></sup> This decade brought strong leadership on smoking cessation for people with mental illness, albeit not without ambivalence and passive resistance. Fears of psychiatric staff that smoking bans would result in increased aggression, use of seclusion and increased “as needed” medication use were not realized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213480413">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Trans-Tasman developments</title>
<p>The Orygen Youth Health Research Centre in Victoria, Australia has led an international shift in approach to youth mental health. Their integrated model incorporates client-centered early intervention, and promotes clinical staging for mental health diagnoses, evidence based practice and youth-friendly services. Trainees of this decade may not realize that early intervention teams are a relatively new addition to public mental health services. Similarly, Australian researchers were at the forefront of developing clinical practice guidelines for early psychosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856213480413">17</xref></sup> which were certainly emphasized during my training. Researchers from New Zealand have also made important contributions to understanding the development of psychosis. The longitudinal studies from Christchurch and Dunedin established the causal relationship between cannabis and psychotic symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213480413">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856213480413">19</xref></sup></p> <p>Perhaps one of the greatest shifts in psychiatry I observed as a trainee in the 2000s was the emergence of internet-based therapy. I became aware of this through the work of Gavin Andrews and colleagues in the Clinical Research Unit for Anxiety Disorders. This unit also has a website, including resources for clinicians and on-line therapy for consumers. The MoodGym website from the Australian National University also provides self-help cognitive behavioral therapy modules. On-line programs have largely demonstrated equivalent outcomes to antidepressants for depression and psychological treatment in primary care for anxiety disorders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213480413">20</xref></sup> adding another therapeutic tool and providing a more accessible avenue for treatment. For trainees of this decade, recommending internet resources, including materials from Beyond Blue, Headspace and Sane Australia, is a routine part of patient care.</p>

<sec id="section7-1039856213480413">
<title>Access to information</title>
<p>This decade saw unprecedented access to instant information through the internet for patients and clinicians. The use of electronic databases and critical appraisal of the vast electronic literature have become core skills taught to medical students and assessed in trainee psychiatrists in Australia and New Zealand. The community in general has also embraced the information freely accessible on the internet, including for mental health problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856213480413">21</xref></sup> However, clinicians remain hesitant to recommend websites to patients due to the poor quality of some websites, “fear of unsubstantiated treatments” and material which may adversely affect patient wellbeing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856213480413">22</xref></sup> This attitude exists despite reviews of internet information on depression and bipolar disorder which found mostly high quality websites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856213480413">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1039856213480413">24</xref></sup> Additionally, there are now 24-hour telephone mental health triage services in Australia and New Zealand to provide self-care advice and assessments, improve consumer access to services and facilitate appropriate care.</p> <p>Touchscreen technology has been used creatively to effectively engage with people at risk of or with established mental and physical illnesses. An example is provided by the HiTNet kiosks championed by Ernest Hunter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1039856213480413">25</xref></sup> Aboriginal communities have embraced the interactive touch-screen format of the kiosks, often located in health clinics. Options include choose-your-own-adventure-style video scenarios focusing on issues particularly relevant to youth, such as alcohol misuse and suicide. They provide culturally appropriate learning content for people with low literacy. The focus is on preventative medicine, with an emphasis on forming strong representations of culture and identity.</p>

<title>New clinical problems</title>
<p>With ready access to the internet at home and on mobile devices this decade, the boundaries between work and private time have become increasingly blurred. This increase in flexibility and convenience has come at a price, with expectations of instant responses, divided attention and less leisure time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1039856213480413">26</xref></sup> New clinical syndromes have emerged, such as internet addiction, a vaguely and controversially defined condition of excessive internet use and consequent impaired function in social and occupational roles and physical health problems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1039856213480413">27</xref></sup> Parallels have been drawn between the immediacy of feedback from social networking sites/technology and substance dependence: instant gratification, rewards and positive reinforcement driving behaviors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1039856213480413">28</xref></sup></p> <p>Cyber bullying is another new syndrome described, involving the use of electronic forms of communication in an aggressive intentional act.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1039856213480413">29</xref></sup> The term also encompasses cyber-stalking or monitoring of a partner’s behavior using electronic means.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1039856213480413">30</xref></sup> Cyberbullying may lead to serious psychological and physical problems, including depressive symptoms and emotional stress.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1039856213480413">
<title>Clinical practice</title>
<p>Trainees of my decade take for granted that multidisciplinary care is standard. There has been formal recognition that nursing and allied health colleagues may work as independent practitioners as well as part of mental health teams through the development of Nurse Practitioner positions and expansion into private practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1039856213480413">31</xref></sup> There has also been a shift towards measuring patient outcomes and expectations that evidence based practices will be utilized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1039856213480413">33</xref></sup> The importance of routinely including families and carers in the care of people with mental illness has been formally recognized, for example with the dedicated focus in the NSW Mental Health Act (2007).</p>

<title>Looking ahead</title>
<p>There was an auspicious local start to the new decade with a psychiatrist, Patrick McGorry, being awarded Australian of the Year in 2011. It was hoped that this may highlight mental health issues in the general community, and lead to restructuring services to reflect research findings, and more resources to fund innovative new programs.</p> <p>I finished my training towards the end of the decade and considered the outlook as a consultant. With a more accepting societal attitude to common mental health problems and ready electronic access to information, consumers have become empowered. This has led to a shift towards approaching clinical work in the spirit of partnership. When making clinical decisions, psychiatry trainees are taught to discuss options with patients in terms of individualized advantages and disadvantages, to consider what the person would find salient in relation to their mental health care, their vulnerabilities and strengths, and balance societal and professional expectations of risk management with the need to maintain a therapeutic alliance and patient autonomy.</p> <p>A fellowship spent in a local Aboriginal Medical Service which used integrated electronic medical records introduced me to the prospect of an increasingly electronic future. How could I see a patient, document the assessment faithfully, and generate letters and referrals within the standard allocated time? I had better learn to type. There would need to be a library of reliable internet resources at hand to recommend to patients and families, which was monitored to remain current. On-line therapies provide a relatively low cost, flexible option for patients.</p> <p>The new decade brings great change for RANZCP trainees. The Competency-Based Fellowship Program will commence in 2013, and with it a different approach to education and assessment. There will be a large new pool of medical graduates to attract to psychiatry and the challenge of accommodating increasing numbers of trainees into new positions. In recognition of this fact and the value of providing a broad experience during training (especially exposure to high prevalence disorders), the College has been progressively expanding opportunities for psychiatry training into specialty areas (such as intellectual disability) and the private sector.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>World events and social changes in the 2000s shaped the focus of clinical care and policy. Psychiatrists also recognized the need to be holistic in the care of their patients, particularly by accepting their responsibilities in physical health and individualizing management decisions, as well as including carers and families. This decade was marked by advances in technology, which had applications for psychiatry, facilitating rapid access to information, resources and therapeutic options. Effective and innovative avenues for mental health promotion have been major achievements of the decade. It is an exciting time to be embarking on a career in psychiatry: mental health is on the political agenda, opportunities to train in a variety of settings have arisen, and technology has provided new ways of engaging with patients and the community.</p>
