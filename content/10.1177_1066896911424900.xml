<abstract>
<p>Endometriosis is a common condition in women of reproductive age and has a known propensity to involve abdominal wall scars. The authors report 2 cases of endometriosis presenting as mass lesions involving the abdominal wall at the site of insertion of ventriculoperitoneal and lumboperitoneal shunts. In both cases, there was clinical evidence of shunt compromise. Endometriosis involving the site of shunt insertion is an extremely rare phenomenon with, as far as the authors are aware, only a single previously reported case. However, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a mass develops at a shunt site in a woman of reproductive age.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Endometriosis is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine corpus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911424900">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911424900">2</xref></sup> It is a common condition occurring predominantly in women of reproductive age, most frequently at locations within the pelvis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911424900">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911424900"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911424900">3</xref></sup> However, endometriosis also occurs uncommonly outside the pelvis, including in the lungs, gallbladder, bowel, ureters, kidneys, umbilicus, abdominal wall, and the central nervous system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911424900">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Endometriosis has a propensity to occur in abdominal wall scars, such as Cesarean section and hysterectomy scars, and also occasionally at laparoscopy port sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911424900">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911424900"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911424900"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911424900">7</xref></sup> We report 2 cases of abdominal wall endometriosis occurring at ventriculoperitoneal and lumboperitoneal shunt insertion sites.

<title>Case Reports</title>
<sec id="section3-1066896911424900">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>A 39-year-old para 1 woman with a Chiari I malformation had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt in situ for 7 years. She presented complaining of increasingly severe headaches, and it was planned to reposition the shunt surgically. On examination, a subcutaneous mass measuring 2 cm was found superficial to the shunt tract surrounding the peritoneal catheter in the anterior abdominal wall. This was excised. There was no past history of endometriosis or gynecological problems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1066896911424900">
<title>Case 2</title>
<p>A 38-year-old nulliparous woman with a history of benign intracranial hypertension complained of a 9-month history of tenderness and swelling with intermittent pain around the incisional site of a lumboperitoneal shunt that had been in situ for 7 years. There was associated headache and vomiting. The pain was noted by the patient to be more pronounced in the second half of the menstrual cycle. Examination revealed a firm nodule measuring 3 cm situated around the shunt site. Abdominal ultrasound was unremarkable. She underwent exploration of the shunt entry site with repositioning, and the mass was excised. There was no history of endometriosis. However, the patient had a prior miscarriage 16 years previously and was undergoing investigations for subfertility.</p>

<title>Pathological Findings</title>
<p>The biopsy specimen in cases 1 and 2 measured 20 × 20 × 10 and 10 × 7 × 6 mm, respectively. Grossly, both specimens consisted of fibrofatty tissue with no well-defined mass.</p>
<p>Histological studies of the 2 cases showed similar features. Adipose tissue and densely hyalinized collagenous scar tissue were present. In both cases, endometrioid-type glands and surrounding stroma were present, in keeping with endometriosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911424900">Figure 1</xref>). In each case, focally, the endometrioid-type stroma surrounding the glands was confined to a thin layer that was barely discernible. In case 2, many of the endometrioid glands were dilated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911424900">Figure 2</xref>). In case 1, there were also nodules of stromal endometriosis composed of endometrioid-type stroma without glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1066896911424900">Figure 3</xref>). The endometrioid glands and stroma exhibited nuclear staining with estrogen receptor, and the endometrioid stroma was CD10 positive.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report 2 cases in which endometriosis was diagnosed following removal of a nodule at the site of insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal and lumboperitoneal shunts. This appears to be an extremely uncommon phenomenon with, as far as we are aware, only a single prior report at the site of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911424900">5</xref></sup> There have been 2 other case reports of endometriosis in patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts, but the endometriosis did not involve the shunt site in either case.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911424900">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911424900">9</xref></sup> In both our cases, there was clinical evidence of compromise of the function of the shunt, with the patients complaining of headaches of increasing severity.</p>
<p>Masses at the site of a prior surgical incision in the abdominal wall have a broad differential diagnosis, including incisional hernia, abscess, hematoma, infection, suture granuloma, neuroma, exuberant scar tissue, or tumor seeding when the incision has been performed in a patient with an abdominal neoplasm. Similar differential diagnoses should be suspected when a mass develops at the site of a ventriculoperitoneal or lumboperitoneal shunt insertion. Endometriosis should also be considered in the differential diagnosis and should be suspected in a female patient of reproductive age, even if there is no history of endometriosis. In one of our patients, the symptoms were noted to be more pronounced in the second half of the menstrual cycle, and such cyclical fluctuation should also prompt a suspicion of endometriosis.</p>
<p>The diagnosis of endometriosis was straightforward in both our cases with endometrioid-type glands and surrounding stroma. In 1 case, there were also foci of stromal endometriosis with nodules of endometrioid-type stroma without glands. Stromal endometriosis has been described in the peritoneum, cervix, and ovary.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911424900">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911424900">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911424900">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896911424900"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896911424900">12</xref></sup> It is not uncommon, especially in the peritoneum. In 1 study, it was identified in 44.9% of a large series of peritoneal biopsies with a diagnosis of endometriosis, usually in association with, but sometimes unaccompanied by, typical endometriosis with glands and stroma; in 6.6% of the biopsies, there was stromal endometriosis alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911424900">10</xref></sup> Stromal endometriosis may be overlooked by the pathologist or not recognized to be a manifestation of endometriosis, especially if endometrioid-type glands are not present elsewhere. Another peculiar manifestation of endometriosis of the abdominal wall is the presence of multinucleate cells of skeletal muscle origin; these may also result in diagnostic confusion, especially if endometriosis is not present in the biopsy specimen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896911424900">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are several theories concerning the pathogenesis of endometriosis, but the “retrograde menstruation” theory, whereby endometrial tissue refluxes through the fallopian tubes during menses and implants outside the uterus, has gained the most widespread acceptance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911424900">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911424900">2</xref></sup> The coelomic metaplasia theory may account for some cases, and reports of endometriosis at distant sites, including the lung, kidney, and brain, support dissemination via lymphovascular channels perhaps from the uterus to the peripheral circulation. Gynecological surgery also plays a role in some cases by permitting endometrial tissue to escape into the pelvic and abdominal cavities from an incision of the uterus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911424900">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911424900">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896911424900">14</xref></sup> There is a well-known propensity for endometriosis to involve abdominal wall scar tissue such as Cesarean section and hysterectomy scars, perhaps secondary to implantation at surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911424900">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911424900"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911424900"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911424900">7</xref></sup> The underlying pathogenesis of the endometriosis in the cases we report is likely to be similar reflecting the known capacity of endometriotic tissue to seed areas of scarring. Neither of our patients had a history of endometriosis, although one was being investigated for subfertility. This is in accordance with a previous review of a large number of patients with scar-associated endometriosis in which a low percentage (13%) was documented to have concurrent pelvic endometriosis at the time of diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911424900">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In summary, we report 2 cases of endometriosis presenting as mass lesions on the abdominal wall at the site of insertion of ventriculoperitoneal and lumboperitoneal shunts. Endometriosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis in women, especially of reproductive age, presenting with a localized mass or other symptoms related to an abdominal wall shunt.</p>
