<abstract>
<p>Student nurses are confronted by many ethical challenges in clinical practice. The aim of the study was to explore <italic>Malawian</italic> students’ experiences of ethical problems during their clinical placement. A phenomenological hermeneutic design comprising interviews and qualitative content analysis was used. Ten students were interviewed. Three main themes emerged: 1) Conflict between patient rights and the guardians’ presence in the hospital; 2) Conflict between violation of professional values and patient rights caused by unethical behaviour; and 3) Conflict between moral awareness and the ideal course of action. The students had difficulties ensuring patient rights and acting in accordance with western norms and values which are not always appropriate in the Malawian context. The students require role models who demonstrate professional attitudes towards patients’ rights and values. There is a need to create pedagogical strategies in which a caring attitude and ethical reflection can be learned and cultivated in clinical practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Students frequently face ethical problems in their clinical practice. Awareness of such problems and challenges is important for their ability to perform moral practice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011412106">1</xref>
</sup> Ethical problems in daily care can arise when caregivers do not adhere to general ethical principles such as the right of a patient to autonomy, respect and dignity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0969733011412106">2</xref>
</sup> Ethical problems can be recognized by three hallmarks: value conflicts, uncertainty about the knowledge needed for decision making and giving rise to confusion.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011412106">3</xref>
</sup> The literature search provided evidence of ethical problems, the absence of ethical reflection and a moral course of action in practice both in western and African countries.<sup>

</p>
<p>Several relevant studies from Sub Saharan countries have been conducted on ethics and the moral course of action in practice. Akinsola<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733011412106">8</xref>
</sup> discussed the ethical problems faced by nurses due to scarce resources and lack of access to health facilities in rural Botswana. The same author revealed challenges for nurses such as truth telling, paternalism, coercion and self-determination brought about by the demands of taking a moral course of action in caring for patients. A study from Tanzania described nurses’ experiences of ethical dilemmas and workplace distress in different care settings. A number of themes emerged in the qualitative analysis: The nurses suffered from workplace distress and ethical dilemmas because they perceived a lack of respect, appreciation and influence. The analysis demonstrated that, on a daily basis, nurses found themselves working in difficult situations where they had few opportunities for resolving the problems they faced. Despite this, they tried to ensure good quality nursing care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011412106">5</xref>
</sup> Jewkes et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412106">9</xref>
</sup> conducted a qualitative study in South Africa on the midwife-patient relationship, in which patients and staff members were interviewed. Patients reported neglect as well as verbal and physical abuse from nursing staff.</p>
<p>Moral decision making based on professional values and patient rights is essential for patient wellbeing and health. Several studies have addressed the importance of teaching ethical principles, human rights and patient rights in nursing colleges in Africa to make future nurses aware of patient rights and moral conduct.<sup>

</p>
<p>The implementation of the Charter of Patients’ and Health Service Providers’ Rights and Responsibility (2004) in Malawi has raised people’s expectations of access to good quality health services.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0969733011412106">13</xref>
</sup> The Nurses and Midwives’ Council of Malawi often receives complaints from patients. Patients’ awareness of their rights is also frequently mirrored in Malawian newspapers.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0969733011412106">14</xref>
</sup> The fact that the Code of nursing ethics and Charter on Patients’ and Health Service Providers’ Rights and Responsibilities (CPHSPRR) in Malawi is based on western human right values has been considered a problem due to cultural differences in traditional values and beliefs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011412106">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0969733011412106">16</xref>
</sup> Practice as a learning environment is considered to be of great importance for enabling the students to develop their professional skills.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0969733011412106">1</xref>
</sup> Few studies have been conducted on ethics and students in Malawi. We therefore decided to conduct this study to further explore the topic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0969733011412106">
<title>Aim</title>
<p>The aim of the study was to explore students’ experiences of ethical problems during their clinical practice in Malawi.</p>
<p>Two research questions were formulated: 1) What was the student’s experience of ethical problems in practice? 2) Was the student aware of ethical problems in practice?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0969733011412106">
<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section4-0969733011412106">
<title>Design</title>
<p>A phenomenological hermeneutic approach was employed to interpret and investigate the students’ lived experiences.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0969733011412106">17</xref>
</sup> Phenomenology ensures an open attitude to the informants’ life-world, while hermeneutics allows a participatory dialogue and intersubjectivity between the interviewer and informants. The method includes active interpretative listening to the meanings contained in the statements, which gave the authors the opportunity to clarify and confirm the information provided during the interviews.<sup>

<sec id="section5-0969733011412106">
<title>Research ethics</title>
<p>Approval was granted by the National Health Sciences Research Committee in Malawi (NHSRC 2008 No.4/36c). The owners and board of management of the nursing colleges that took part in the study gave permission to conduct the interviews. The students attended the interviews voluntarily, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. They were assured that their name and identity would not be disclosed and that they had the right to withdraw at any time. They were also informed that the interviews would be audio-taped and the transcripts used for no purpose other than the study. The interview data were stored as numbered voice files and saved as proof files in a personal computer with a password and user identity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0969733011412106">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>A purposive sampling technique was used to recruit the study participants.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733011412106">19</xref>
</sup> The interviews took place in four different Nursing Colleges in north, central and south Malawi in spring 2009. Second and third year students were chosen to ensure that they had practical experience and theoretical knowledge of ethics. The students were recruited at their colleges by being asked by their teacher during class to voluntarily participate in the study. Three male and seven female students aged 20–36 years participated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0969733011412106">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The interviews, as well as all written and oral information, were in English, which is the official language used in student education in Malawi. The students were asked if they could provide any examples of ethical problems they had experienced during their clinical placement. They were also asked why they considered the situation as an ethical problem and to reflect on the ideal course of action. The interviews took the form of a conversation, and probing questions were employed to enable and deepen understanding of the situation described by the students.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011412106">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A semi-structured interview guide was used to explore students’ experiences and awareness of ethical problems in practice. The 45–60 minute interviews (<italic>N</italic> = 10) were audio-taped and conducted at the participants’ colleges. Three interviews were conducted jointly by the first (E.M.S.) and second author (V.M.), which enabled them to discuss and gain a mutual understanding of the data gathering process. Four interviews were conducted by the second author, who has many years of experience as a nurse and tutor in Malawi. The final three interviews were conducted by the first author, who has teaching experience of human rights, ethics and gender in several nursing colleges in Malawi. The interviews were transcribed verbatim by the first and second authors.</p>

<sec id="section8-0969733011412106">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The data were analysed by means of qualitative interpretative content analysis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733011412106">20</xref>
</sup> First, the authors read all the interviews several times to gain a general impression of the content. In the analysis process we aimed to be true to the phenomenon under study and give priority to the life world of the informants.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0969733011412106">18</xref>
</sup> The next step was to structure the content into themes and subthemes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0969733011412106">20</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0969733011412106">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Overall, three themes emerged from the data: Conflict between patient rights and the guardian’s presence in the hospital; Conflict between violation of professional values and patient rights caused by unethical behaviour; and Conflict between moral awareness and the ideal course of action.</p>
<sec id="section10-0969733011412106">
<title>Conflict between patient rights and the guardian’s presence in the hospital</title>
<p>This theme was derived from two sub-themes associated with patient rights: 1) <italic>informed consent and refusal of treatment</italic>; and 2) <italic>privacy and confidentiality</italic>. Almost all of the participants in the study found it challenging to respect patient rights because of the presence of the guardians. As stated in Malawian Patient Rights, a child patient has a right to bring a guardian whenever he/she goes to hospital. In general, family members act as guardians. The adult patient is also expected to have a guardian present at all times. The guardian plays an important role in ensuring that the patient receives food, sufficient care and moral support. Due to the presence of the guardian, the informants appeared to be concerned about the right of the patient to <italic>informed consent and refusal of treatment</italic>. One of the students explained:<disp-quote>
<p>Often the guardian refuses oxygen therapy for the patient, who may be dyspnoeic. It can be a baby, an old person or an adult. The nurses try to convince the guardians, but they still refuse. Maybe they had seen a very sick patient who was given oxygen and then died. So they think: Oh, oxygen kills.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These scenarios are still common in rural areas of Malawi and the fact that guardians can refuse treatment for the patient gives rise to ethical challenges in practice. When the guardian, the husband or uncle is the decision maker, it might lead to a breach of the paragraph on Patients’ Rights that states that the patient him/herself has the right to accept or refuse treatment. It also challenges the principle of autonomy. The patients, even competent adults, do not always have the decision making power to give informed consent to their own treatment. Decision making is traditionally influenced by the family or group. Group or family refers to the fact that a child or the adult patient does not belong to the mother, father, husband or wife alone, but also to other family members and the community. Sometimes therefore, treatment cannot be started before members of the community such as the mother in law, neighbours and significant others have made decisions. Being unable to start life-saving treatment is an ethical dilemma for the nurses. Another statement was:<disp-quote>
<p>The guardians might be afraid as they believe that the medicine the patient is administered in the hospital will not help because the disease is related to some magic or witchcraft.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The guardians may reject modern medicine because the illness of their loved one is associated with witchcraft or magic. Therefore they might believe that only traditional medicine will heal the disease. The data indicate that both patients and guardians are in need of good and relevant information, even if the suggested treatment might not be accepted.</p>
<p>The second sub-theme was related to patients’ right to <italic>Privacy and Confidentiality</italic> and focused on risks when many family members visit the hospital:<disp-quote>
<p>The whole family comes to the hospital and it is difficult to ensure privacy for the patients. The patients might not be comfortable telling everything to the guardians. The guardians normally put pressure on the patients or us, in order to obtain information.</p>

</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In Malawian culture, the patient’s responsibilities are assumed by family members, which gives the impression that his/her privacy is invaded. The usual attitude of the family members is that all information about the patient should be revealed to them.</p>
<p>Both patients and students seem to be pressurized by the guardians to reveal private and confidential information. One student nurse described the following experience from practice:<disp-quote>
<p>I was in a situation where the patient was dying. I decided not to tell the guardians the truth. I was not sure, as maybe God would let the patient live and I would appear a liar. I did not ask the nurse because I was supposed to tell the truth.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>According to Malawian patient rights, the patient has the right to know his/her prognosis, but sometimes it can be in the patient’s best interest to only disclose such information to the guardians. The student had been told by the nurse to disclose the truth to the guardian. The problem seems to derive from the student’s uncertainty and inexperience, as he/she was afraid that the patient would not die after all and therefore feared losing trust. In this case the guardian did not receive the information because the student did not disclose his/her uncertainty to the nurse or ask for advice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0969733011412106">
<title>Conflicts between violation of professional values and patient rights caused by unethical behaviour</title>
<p>The students reported a number of incidents involving nurses exhibiting what they considered to be ethical problems caused by unprofessional behaviour.</p>
<p>Sub-theme one was related to the patient right to <italic>respect and dignity</italic> and is illustrated by the following quotation:<disp-quote>
<p>If a patient is in labour and screaming, the nurse says: ‘Shut up. Why are you screaming? The others here are not screaming. Is your pain so special that you cannot keep quiet?’ Then the woman would rather go and have the baby with traditional attendants.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The most frequent incident mentioned by the informants was that nurses violated patients by ignoring their needs or shouting at them. The students offered many explanations for why the nurses behaved disrespectfully:<disp-quote>
<p>The nurses can be so harsh. Of course they are tired and angry because the guardians may have brought the patient too late.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>There can be many factors that hinder patients from coming to hospital in time, such as long distances, transport, finances and traditional beliefs. According to traditions in some parts of Malawi, the decision to go to hospital is made by key people other than the patient him/herself, such as husbands or uncles.</p>
<p>Sub<italic>-</italic>theme two; the patient right to <italic>equality and justice</italic> illuminated problems that nurses could face in order to take a moral course of action. One student nurse explained:<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes in the mission hospital here, we have noticed that people who are related to staff receive attention first, for example the wife of the priest, even if she comes later than the other patients.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In many cases it seemed to be difficult for nurses to adhere to the well-known Malawian rule of justice: ‘to treat on a first come-first served basis’ or ‘give priority to the most needy’. Another example of injustice was expressed by an informant:<disp-quote>
<p>In general it’s only educated people who know their rights. Uneducated patients may feel offended, but don’t speak out. For me it’s an advantage if the patient is not educated. I have the feeling that I can do whatever I want. But if I see an educated patient, then I know that he/she will question me.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>This quotation relates to attitudes. Not every patient seemed to be treated as being of equal value. It was unusual for uneducated patients to question people with more power, which may be the reason why the student believed that he/she had the right to act more disrespectfully towards such a patient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0969733011412106">
<title>Conflict between moral awareness and the ideal course of action</title>
<p>This theme was derived from two sub<italic>-</italic>themes:</p>
<p>Sub<italic>-</italic>theme one; <italic>moral distress</italic>, was based on the informants’ concerns caused by their knowledge of what is right in contrast to what they were able to do. An example of the students’ awareness is expressed in the following quotation:<disp-quote>
<p>It was a baby and the guardian refused a blood transfusion. I could do nothing and she died. I felt very bad.</p>
</disp-quote>Most of the informants gave examples of the ethical problem they faced when Jehovah’s Witness believers refused a life-saving blood transfusion. The Patient’s Rights of Malawi state that the patient has the right to accept or refuse treatment. The nurses will try to convince the family or group decision makers to accept treatment, but they often fail and are thus unable to respect the patient’s right to life saving treatment.</p>
<p>Sub-theme two; <italic>immoral actions</italic>, was described as follows by one of the students:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s the patient’s right to know about the treatment he/she is receiving. But it seems as if most of us are unwilling to tell them. We are told to do so because we are students, but the nurses take short cuts.</p>
</disp-quote>This statement shows that the students were aware of the gap between theory learnt at college and the moral course of action in practice. They often reported examples of what they referred to as ‘short cuts’ in practice such as malpractice on the part of the nurse. Both nurses and students knew that the patients had the need for and right to information about diagnosis, treatment, duration and side effects of medication.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section13-0969733011412106">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore students’ experiences of ethical problems in their clinical practice. The results indicate that they perceived a number of ethical problems related to patient rights, the guardian’s presence in the hospital, students’ professional values as well as unethical behaviour and moral awareness of the ideal course of action. A gap between western and Malawian cultural values was revealed. Overall, the study indicated three essential cultural factors. First, the necessity of a guardian’s presence and the structure of the hospitals, that reduces students’ and nurses’ opportunity to maintain the patient’s confidentiality and privacy. Second, the hierarchical community and family structure, where decision making is considered a matter for the patient’s extended family. Third, the cultural and traditional beliefs, which means that patients and guardians can refuse modern hospital treatment and care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011412106">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011412106">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0969733011412106">22</xref>
</sup> Most of the ethical problems experienced by the students seemed to cause confusion about how to adhere to western inspired ethical principles, value conflicts and uncertainty associated with what was right in clinical practice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011412106">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011412106">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<italic>The patient</italic>’<italic>s right to confidentiality</italic>, <italic>informed consent</italic>, <italic>acceptance or refusal of treatment and privacy</italic> seemed to cause many ethical problems. In a Malawian context, confidentiality may mean something different than in western countries. According to the principle of confidentiality, the students and nurses are only supposed to provide information about patients if the latter are unable to decide for themselves, if they have consented or for public health reasons.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0969733011412106">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0969733011412106">24</xref>
</sup> This can conflict with the common cultural expectation of family members that all information about the patient should be disclosed to them. The patient might not have the power to decide even if he/she is considered competent. This finding is confirmed by Chigona<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733011412106">25</xref>
</sup> who claims that there are conflicts between the principle of patient autonomy and the tradition and hierarchy within each tribe and family, since African ethics are more communitarian, hence more relational, than western oriented ethics. The students experienced pressure and confusion about what is the right thing to do.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0969733011412106">3</xref>
</sup> When the students’ sense of identity is defined by strong family and community bonds and decision making traditions, they might consider it right to provide information to guardians without the patient’s consent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011412106">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011412106">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0969733011412106">25</xref>
</sup> The strong family and community traditions can be an advantage for patients. The guardians may be the only ones to provide financial or moral support, transport and medication to the patients when in hospital. On the other hand, when men and older women are the decision makers about the health and treatment of women and children, there is reason to believe that this can be negative. Seljeskog et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733011412106">26</xref>
</sup> confirmed this in their study by stating reasons for women failing to go to hospital to give birth.</p>
<p>Another ethical problem experienced by the informants was that nurses often encountered challenges in obtaining informed consent from patients or guardians to start necessary treatment if it conflicted with traditional beliefs and culture.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011412106">27</xref>
</sup> This led to a common ethical dilemma between the nurse’s obligation to start life-saving treatment and the patient’s right to refuse. Chalanda<sup>

</sup> claimed that traditional beliefs and values in rural parts of Malawi influence the decision-making of patients and guardians. The patient might leave the hospital and consult a traditional healer if he/she thinks that the illness is caused by witchcraft. Kumar<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733011412106">28</xref>
</sup> holds that traditional birth attendants are considered safer than hospital nurses, especially when witchcraft is believed to be involved in the pregnancy and birth. It is important that the decision maker can understand the implications and danger of leaving hospital and/or refusing treatment. In such situations the nurses might find it beneficial for the patient that the guardians receive the same information about medication and prognosis, even if it is in conflict with the principle of confidentiality.<sup>

<p>The practice of truth telling to the guardians when their loved one is about to die can be difficult for an inexperienced student. Han and Ahn<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0969733011412106">30</xref>
</sup> conducted a study among a hundred Korean students. They described not telling the truth to the patient and not respecting the patients’ confidentiality as the most frequent ethical dilemmas in practice. Tuckett<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0969733011412106">31</xref>
</sup> holds that one of the arguments in favour of not telling the truth is uncertainty about, for example, the prognosis. Our findings indicate that, when uncertain, the students often ignored tasks they were given by the nurses instead of asking for supervision. This might be caused by the hierarchical nursing education system where the students reported that they feared being shouted at or punished in one way or another if they did not perform well.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0969733011412106">27</xref>
</sup> According to Arries,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011412106">21</xref>
</sup> another reason is that African students are socialized to respect authority and not to challenge it, resulting in people being more passive and accepting of the opinion of the authorities. Tveit et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0969733011412106">32</xref>
</sup> stated in a recent report that students are often left alone with responsibility in the clinic, due to a shortage of nurses and teachers. In such circumstances, the patient and guardians might not receive appropriate nursing care.</p>
<p>The violation of the <italic>patient</italic>
<italic>right</italic>
<italic>to respect and dignity</italic>, <italic>equality and justice</italic> worried the students. In the study, ethical problems of this nature included examples of poor practice on the part of both nurses and students. Similar findings have been presented by other researchers. Erdil<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011412106">4</xref>
</sup> conducted a descriptive study where students in Turkey observed ethical problems in their clinical practice. The study revealed unethical behaviour by nurses such as psychological and physical mistreatment of patients. The same study reported that the patients were not provided with appropriate information about their treatment, their privacy was ignored and they were discriminated against due to their social status. This is in line with a study of nurses in the obstetric services in South Africa, who stated that pregnant women feared being shouted at and neglected. The patients reported that the nurses were rude and inhuman.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412106">9</xref>
</sup> Muula<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011412106">15</xref>
</sup> holds that the reason the patients in Malawi do not react negatively to a hierarchical and paternalistic health care system may be that they are accustomed to it. Our findings indicate that students believe that patients of low social status will not react verbally against the nurse, because they may be afraid of punishment. A patient who complains when the nurse expects him/her to obey will be labelled rude and ungrateful. However, there are reasons to believe that the patients are insulted and hurt by the disrespectful and violating approach to hospital care. If the patients lose trust in the nurse, it can worsen the medical situation because they will avoid communicating information relevant to their condition.</p>
<p>Another serious implication caused by unethical behaviour is that when patients’ integrity is violated, they can avoid attending the hospital for help in the future. Instead, they or their family will seek help from traditional doctors or birth attendants. Kumar<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0969733011412106">28</xref>
</sup> argued that lack of trust in nurses and doctors is one of the factors that makes women choose traditional birth attendants instead of going to hospital. This is in line with a study conducted by Seljeskog et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0969733011412106">26</xref>
</sup> in rural Malawi on factors that influence women’s choice of place of delivery. The authors found that one of the main factors for not choosing hospital delivery was suboptimal communication and attitudes and that the barriers to using professional obstetric care can partly be attributed to the health care system itself. Giving birth in hospital is of great importance for women’s and children’s safety, and the Malawian Government strongly encourages every pregnant woman to deliver in hospital.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0969733011412106">33</xref>
</sup> The unethical behaviour and attitudes in our findings reflect aspects of hierarchy and power in the patient-nurse relationship. Jewkes et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0969733011412106">9</xref>
</sup> indicated an explanation for the unethical behaviour and attitudes towards patients. They found that nurses struggled to assert their professional and middle-class identity and that in the process they acted unethically in order to create a social distance and maintain their position. Patients with less education and power are more likely to be treated disrespectfully and unequally. In a study from Botswana, Akinsola<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0969733011412106">8</xref>
</sup> stated that the complaints about nurses come from the elite and middle class groups who live in cities. Many of Malawi’s adult population are illiterate and poor, which makes it difficult for them to know their rights and raise their voices against systems with power. This constitutes a major challenge for nurses to act respectfully and treat these vulnerable patients equally with those who have more power in society.<sup>

</p>
<p>The conflict between <italic>moral awareness</italic> and the <italic>ideal course of action</italic> may lead to <italic>moral distress</italic> and <italic>immoral actions</italic>. Moral distress can occur when one is aware of the mode of action for resolving an ethical problem, but is unable to implement it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0969733011412106">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733011412106">35</xref>
</sup> In a study from Tanzania, Häggström et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0969733011412106">5</xref>
</sup> argued that factors related to working conditions such as lack of time, overcrowded hospitals and shortages of staff and medication strongly influence nurses in their struggle to implement an ethically appropriate course of action. Our findings reveal that the ethical problems faced by students in order to adhere to the principles of justice and equality might be caused by the hierarchical hospital system of which they are a part. The doctors or hospital owner told the students to prioritize certain patients rather than the more needy ones. They are socialized to respect authority, be passive and accepting, even if they think it conflicts with the principle of beneficence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0969733011412106">21</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Slettebo and Bunch<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0969733011412106">36</xref>
</sup> hold that ethical problems can be caused by intersubjective matters such as the relationship between nurse and patient. In many countries, a common ethical dilemma known to cause moral distress is being unable to start life-saving treatment such as blood transfusion and oxygen therapy, knowing that the patient is not allowed to decide for him/herself. A study from a paediatric ward in California on parents’ refusal of medical treatment due to cultural or religious beliefs revealed that these complex situations led to emotional distress in the interaction between health care providers and family members.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0969733011412106">37</xref>
</sup> In Malawi there is no external factor such as a law stating that it is unacceptable for a parent to deny a child life-saving treatment. Muula<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0969733011412106">15</xref>
</sup> claims that it is a challenge for the health authorities and Nurses’ Associations of Malawi to be more active in initiating the discussion about whether such laws should be introduced. Lützen et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0969733011412106">35</xref>
</sup> argued that the psychological consequences of being aware of the ethical course of action, while at the same time lacking the power and resources to act, confuse the logic of right and wrong. Moral distress creates a negative and undesirable situation that puts ethical care at risk.</p>

<title>Implications for nursing education</title>
<p>The learning outcome of nursing education is clearly stated in the students’ curriculum to underline academic identity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0969733011412106">38</xref>
</sup> The challenge for the students is to integrate western oriented theory in such a way that it becomes relevant for their practice. Western-oriented professional principles and values need to be taught and reflected on in the light of the basic ethical principles and values of their traditional culture. Teaching and learning methods that encourage the use of reflective models will allow the student to critically reflect on nursing actions in practice, thus facilitating the development of ethical decision making competence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0969733011412106">39</xref>
</sup> Students’ critical reflection on moral practice should be encouraged by teachers and nurses in theory as well as in practice.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0969733011412106">4</xref>
</sup> Both clinical nurses and teachers have a responsibility to create a pedagogic strategy where they can act as role models and in which a caring attitude can be taught and encouraged.</p>

</sup> Consensus about the meaning of the content was reached after several discussions in order to ensure conformability; i.e. the interpretation was based on real events rather than the researchers’ personal constructions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733011412106">19</xref>
</sup> To establish dependability, the authors conducted independent analyses in order to strengthen the reliability of the findings. The second author (V.M.) has long experience and knowledge of the field. The discussions with the second author were important for interpreting the findings and remaining as close to the original meaning as possible. A limitation of this study is the small sample, which reduces the likelihood of generalizability. However, the 10 informants were recruited from four different colleges, in north, central and south Malawi.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0969733011412106">19</xref>
</sup> The hospitals where the students gained their practical experience were representative of hospitals in Malawi and geographically spread. The advantage of selecting students as informants is that they have recently learnt about professional ethics and value-based theory in the first year of their studies. They have not been influenced by or socialized into the hospital ward routines and habits, thus they see as well as experience situations with their own perceptions of what is right and wrong. However, the latter can be a disadvantage, as the students do not have the necessary experience to assess situations they perceive from a holistic perspective.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Clinical nurses and students in Malawi are supposed to act in line with western norms and values, which are not always appropriate in countries with communitarian traditional values and beliefs. This results in conflicts and confusion for the students in clinical practice. The study highlights the complexity of ethical education in clinical practice. Student nurses in all countries have to be taught to reflect on professional norms and values in the light of their own traditions and cultural nursing contexts in order to make them relevant to ethical problems in clinical practice. Teaching and learning methods that encourage the use of reflective models will allow students to critically reflect on how western individual oriented norms and values can be applied in nursing practice. The students need role models to be able to face challenges and act as role models themselves in order to motivate others and demonstrate professional attitudes towards patients.</p>
