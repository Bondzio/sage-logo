<p>With the 50th anniversary of the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) upon us, the time is ripe for an evaluation of the Council, its reception and legacy. Called by John XXIII (r. 1958–1963), who some thought would be merely a placeholder pope, “Vatican II” met in four fall sessions. Therein, the world’s Catholic bishops, aided by theological advisors, observers from other faith traditions, and experts from secular disciplines, met in St Peter’s Basilica, drafting and approving a series of documents. Today, the Council is the key marker for the Catholic transition from an insular, clerical and reactive church towards a dialogue with modernity, an acceptance of pluralism, and an increased emphasis on the laity. A main methodological marker of this re-orientation is John XXIII’s vision for an ecumenical council engaging the tasks of <italic>aggironamento</italic> (bringing up to date) and <italic>resourcement</italic> (returning to the sources as patterned on the example of the new theologians, a number of whom where censured by the Vatican before the Council and received Cardinal hats in the post-Vatican II period). That much is certain. However, from the start of the Council to the present day, debate has sometimes reached fever pitch about the true meaning and desirability of this shift. John XXXIII’s is a contested legacy; he is at once: (1) the horror of sedevacantist and conclavist groups who separated from mainline Catholicism over the changes precipitated by the Second Vatican Council, (2) beloved by liberal Catholics who invoke the somewhat amorphous “spirit of Vatican II,” and (3) de-lustered by an increasingly influential group of more traditionalist mainline Catholics calling for a “correction of the correction.”</p>
<p>Although styled as a memoir, <italic>Chronicles of a Vatican II Bishop</italic> wades rather tactfully but ultimately decisively into the debates about the vision and legacy of John XXIII and the Second Vatican Council. In terms of the former area, De Roo is clear in presenting his view that John XXIII had a remarkable and timely vision that remains pertinent today. In regards to Vatican II, De Roo’s message is also plain by the end of the monograph: the Council represents an act of worship, a time of great collegial learning, and a contextually necessary and significant “turning towards the world” (155) by the Catholic Church. As such, De Roo explicitly supports the view that the vast majority of bishops gathered at Vatican II had a vision of a more open Catholic church, one that would be constituted in a less hierarchical manner, where the Catholic Social Teaching principle of subsidiarity would translate into a situation that would give sufficient space for the local churches and the laity to make decisions for themselves, with the hierarchy intervening only in grave matters associated with justice and truth. In this way, the Catholic tradition, ever ancient and ever new, would work to foster other key aspects of Vatican II’s legacy as highlighted by De Roo, such as peace, justice, solidarity, cross-cultural respect and inter-faith understanding.</p>
<p>As the youngest Canadian bishop at the time, De Roo was uniquely placed amongst his colleagues. He would have virtually a lifetime to share “the Council’s message” (137) from his base in the diocese of Victoria, where he served as Bishop from 1962 until his mandatory resignation was accepted in 1999. De Roo implies that the fact that he was never promoted to a more prominent diocese is related to a witness for justice and human rights, which earned him the nickname “Red Remi.” Also notable is De Roo’s description of a local synod he called on Vancouver Island (1991–1996), which sought to build community and bring forward the example of Vatican II by using storytelling, amongst other methods, instead of debate, to craft a consensus-based and lay-driven vision to carry the diocese forward into the next millennium. The reader also is presented with De Roo’s candid description of a controversial property deal that landed the diocese of Victoria in a drawn out court battle around the turn of the century.</p>
<p>Of further significance for scholars of Catholicism is how De Roo shades the continuing legacy of the Council in terms of issues surrounding (1) peace and (2) ecology. In the first regard, he reports that a number of the Council Fathers had been interested in issuing an outright condemnation of modern warfare. De Roo adds that the main factor which prevented such a total banning of war was the fear of a number of European bishops that taming the communist threat, which seemed palpable at the time, might require active military force. The implication is that what De Roo shades as the renewing seeds of Vatican II would now favor peaceful solutions in any situation of conflict. Further, though ecological issues were not fully present within the consciousness of the Council Fathers at the time, he states that these seeds of the Council can also bear fruit when they are properly cultivated so as to support better relationships not only amongst people but also between humans and the rest of the natural world. In terms of this task, De Roo notes the influence of Thomas Berry and Pierre Teilhard De Chardin, amongst others, as alerting him to the need for a “world consciousness” (161) that celebrates the joy and divine spirit in all of creation.</p>
<p>As a result of De Roo’s tactful approach to the subject matter, there are a few somewhat contradictory elements in this monograph. For instance, in the introduction he states rather poetically, “I know that all the bishops [who attended Vatican II], without exception, wanted to achieve was to give our Church a renewed impulse whereby it could more lovingly and effectively present gospel values that Jesus brought into a world hungering for truth, justice with compassion, and lasting peace” (16). Yet, De Roo also tells a number of stories that plainly show resistance in this regard. However, these contradictory insights make sense in terms of the larger arc of the narrative presented in <italic>Chronicles of a Vatican II Bishop</italic> as it frequently returns to the absolute need to manifest the principles of dialogue, peace, justice and equality. An example of such an issue raised in this volume is what De Roo perceives as an urgent need to re-open the conversation about the current practice of the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church in ordaining only single males to the priesthood. Interestingly, the reader learns that the need to put this particular question to communal discernment was a subject that De Roo purposely broached during a lunch where he was seated next to Pope John Paul II in 1994. On that occasion, he earned a dismissive response from the pontiff, who, De Roo recalls: “turned and glared at me, then banged deliberately on the table with his right fist holding the knife handle. In loud and emphatic tone of voice he declared, ‘<italic>Deus providebit</italic>!’ (God will provide!). That was, sadly, the end of the exchange” (134).</p>
<p>In part because of such captivating stories, I am using this monograph for a comparative review assignment in my <italic>Introduction to Catholicism</italic> class later this term. Its accessible narrative style that nonetheless touches on key, but controversial, issues surrounding Catholic thought and practice, makes it ideally suited for this purpose. This monograph will also be useful for parish study groups, ecumenical dialogues, catholic studies scholars and other constituencies seeking to clarify possible meanings of Vatican II for the Catholic Church and its relationship to the wider world.</p>
