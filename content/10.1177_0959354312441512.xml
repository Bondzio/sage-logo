<p>This is the third part of a trilogy. The first article is a critique of current empirical research and the second presents the <italic>bricoleur</italic> model of practice. Here, I try to describe parts of what follows from what we all know about being human because we are human. This knowledge may be partly inherited: that is, we may have an inborn disposition to understand other members of our species in certain ways. An axiomatic system consisting of nine axioms is presented and discussed. They are labelled as follows: Mentality, Intentionality, Reflectivity, Verbality, Learning, Responsibility, Morality, Feeling, and Vulnerability. The axioms are formulated partly in terms of Wierzbicka’s semantic primitives, assumed to be found in all human languages. The usefulness of the axioms is taken to be testable only by general consensus.</p>

<p>This paper is the last part of a trilogy of articles. The first one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354312441512">Smedslund, 2009</xref>) points out that the current empiricist research tradition runs aground because of four characteristics of psychological processes: they are influenced by an indefinitely high number of factors; they are sensitive to outcomes and, hence, always changeable; the regularities that can nevertheless be found stem from participation in shared meaning systems already implicitly familiar (and, hence, gathering data on them is studying what we already know); and individuals are partly unique and unpredictable because they are influenced by random events.</p>
<p>The second article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354312441512">Smedslund, 2012</xref>) describes the sort of practice that is required under the conditions described in the first article. A <italic>bricoleur</italic> is a resource person who is enlisted when ordinary established procedures in daily life fail to work. The psychologist-<italic>cum-bricoleur</italic> relies mainly on three sources of knowledge: what we all know about being human because we are human, what we know about each other because we participate in shared meaning systems (language and culture), and what we know about each unique person and situation. The <italic>bricoleur</italic> then uses these three sources in innovative ways determined by the indefinitely variable concrete situations. It should be added here that education or training is not included here because it merely consists of a combination of formulations about the already-mentioned sources of knowledge, and of references to empirical research and empirical theories which, in my view, are of limited value, for the reasons outlined in the first article.</p>
<p>Whereas the first article dealt with research methods and the second with practical work, this paper poses the theoretical question of what we all know because we are human. This is the only area where we can expect generally valid knowledge. Most of the knowledge that we can get from studying people’s behavior in given cultures and from studying individuals is necessarily limited and changeable. However, taking an evolutionary perspective, it would not be surprising to find that we are also born with predispositions to have knowledge about some general characteristics of our fellow beings. Considering the importance of social life for survival, this is quite plausible. How can one formulate this knowledge? It could be that many details must be painstakingly determined empirically, in the same way as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354312441512">Shepard (1984)</xref> has determined aspects of our way of perceiving the inanimate physical environment. However, it may also be that some aspects of what we know about human beings can also be determined by analyzing what everyone in every culture regards as self-evident: that is, as impossible to deny. One may at least try to formulate such aspects, relying on one’s own judgment and on the judgments of other members of the scientific community, and finally on ordinary people in different communities. Much of what is consensually regarded as necessary across all communities may, at least to some extent, be genetically determined. A complication is that what we all know about being human is always intertwined with what we know because we share a language and culture, and with what we have learned about ourselves and other single individuals. The two latter kinds of knowledge are, and must be, learned, and cannot be expected to contain anything completely general, for the reasons described in the first article. One, admittedly roundabout and precarious, way of distinguishing what is innate from what is acquired is opened up by the contributions of the linguist Anna Wierzbicka and her collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354312441512">Wierzbicka, 1996</xref>), who have found a number of primitive concepts that appear to be shared by people speaking many different human languages. These primitive concepts may reflect species-specific dispositions to organize the world, since they seem to be present everywhere. However, some propositions cannot be derived from combinations of these primitive concepts, but are psychological. They can also be stated by means of these same concepts as axioms of the system called <italic>psycho-logic</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354312441512">Smedslund, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354312441512">1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354312441512">2002</xref>) or follow from the axioms and are theorems. The only other attempt that I know of at something like an axiomatic system in modern psychology, in addition to the well-known one created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354312441512">Hull (1952)</xref>, was made by Peter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354312441512">Ossorio (2006)</xref>, who used the term “maxims” for what I call axioms: that is, principles that we must take for granted. I have argued for the use of axiomatics elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959354312441512">Smedslund, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>It needs to be stated at the outset that psycho-logic should be conceived of as a proposal to organize and describe human activity in a certain way. Hence, it is normative, and involves a suggestion to talk in a certain way and to take for granted certain things about the world. It is not about the relations between words, but about what we should take for granted in our understanding of the world. Psycho-logic is stated in a technical language, clearly separate from, although related to, ordinary words and expressions.</p>
<p>The retreat of psycho-logic from ordinary to a technical language was already anticipated in an article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354312441512">Parrott and Harré (1991)</xref>. The main reason is that any attempt to define a word in ordinary language, or to formulate a generally valid psychological proposition in that language, is inevitably met by criticism, in the form of suggested exceptions.</p>
<p>The axiomatic system of psycho-logic can also be characterized as an attempt to create a calculus from our common knowledge, instead of leaving it as an unanalyzed collection of fragments. A calculus is a system allowing one to derive a large number of predictions from a small number of assumptions. It is a venture that may or may not turn out to be useful, since one cannot know in advance if, and to what extent, the assumptions we presumably all make about persons can be reduced to a limited number of axioms, and derivations from them (theorems). Some comments on axiomatics are also presented in my 2011 article.</p>
<p>The present paper is an attempt to present and discuss an axiom system that I originally presented in 1988 (pp. 109–110) and later in 1997 (pp. 105–107), 2002 (pp. 61–63), and 2004 (pp. 176–177). The fluctuations that have occurred, besides minor changes in wording, are mostly shifts in the status of propositions between being regarded as axioms, theorems, or definitions. An axiom is a proposition that we take for granted and that cannot be derived from other propositions. The suggested psychological axioms are hard to deny because the consequences of their negations seem absurd. A theorem is a proposition logically derived from the axioms. A definition is a statement of the complete meaning of a term by means of other terms.</p>
<p>The English terms for the primitive concepts suggested by linguist Anna Wierzbicka are used as a starting point for development of a technical language. For the benefit of readers who are unfamiliar with Wierzbicka, I present a list of some of the English terms selected to represent the semantic primitive concepts: I, YOU, SOMEONE, SOMETHING, PEOPLE, THIS, THE SAME, OTHER, ONE, TWO, SOME, MUCH/MANY, ALL, KNOW, WANT, THINK, FEEL, SEE, HEAR, SAY, WORD, DO, HAPPEN, MOVE, THERE IS, LIVE, GOOD, BAD, BIG, SMALL, WHERE, SIDE, INSIDE, FAR, NEAR, UNDER, ABOVE, HERE, WHEN, AFTER, BEFORE, A LONG TIME, A SHORT TIME, NOW, KIND OF, PART OF, VERY, MORE, LIKE, IF, IF…WOULD, BECAUSE, NOT, MAYBE, CAN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959354312441512">Wierzbicka, 1996</xref>). I cannot discuss here the extensive linguistic fieldwork and the considerable methodological and theoretical difficulties involved in establishing such primitives. The entire project is clearly controversial, since it assumes that words are not ambiguous, but that their meanings can be reduced to definite combinations of primitives. I have nevertheless selected this approach since it promises to keep close to the simplest irreducible parts of descriptive language.</p>
<p>The conflict between Wierzbicka and collaborators, who take it that ordinary word-meanings can be reduced to combinations of primitives, and researchers inspired by Wittgenstein, who regard ordinary words as undefinable, can be resolved by assuming that ordinary words, although undefinable, have fixed meaning-components that cannot be formulated. Otherwise, the usefulness of words in a language would be unexplainable.</p>
<p>The semantic primitives appear to be very useful in communication with clients. However, for scientific and professional use, one may need to develop more refined technical concepts. To take one example, the quite fuzzy usage of the primitive term “know” needs to be sharpened to refer only to “what is taken for granted” (excluding such uses as “knowledge is always uncertain”). Also, questions such as the exact distinction between “know” and “think,” and many others, transcend the scope of the present article and must be treated elsewhere.</p>
<p>In psycho-logic, one is not concerned with semantic regularities, such as “surprised persons always have experienced something unexpected.” In earlier treatments, the difference between logical relations built into language and basic psychological assumptions that go beyond language was not sufficiently recognized. The latter are not semantic since they do <italic>not</italic> follow from the lexical meaning of the words involved. For example, we assume that a person can <italic>see</italic>, and that a person can <italic>learn</italic> from experience. These terms refer to how persons function, and we always take these functions for granted. Presuppositions of this kind make up the content of the axioms of psycho-logic.</p>
<p>Here, I will not be concerned with the pre-history of the axiom list. This would take up too much of the available space. The historically interested reader is referred to the list of references mentioned above. However, it should be mentioned that the axioms stated here do not describe what persons <italic>are</italic>, but what persons <italic>take for granted about</italic> every person. Psycho-logic is about how persons view persons: that is, about subjective phenomena.</p>
<p>In what follows, P and O are two persons interacting with each other:<disp-quote>
<p>Axiom 1 (Mentality). <italic>P takes it that O can think, want, feel, perceive, say, and do.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this axiom, the term “perceive” is used as a common denominator for the terms “see,” “hear,” “smell,” “taste,” and “sense” (in the skin and in the body). These all specify the organs that mediate perception. The axiom refers to mental processes that are taken for granted to go on in all persons. Attributing them to someone amounts to a recognition of the other individual as a human being. In the absence of contrary information, everyone automatically attributes all these processes to persons. The survival value of this package of automatic attributions probably stems from its high validity. It nearly always pays off to automatically assume these processes in others. Only very exceptionally does one encounter individuals who are <italic>blind, deaf, mute</italic>, or <italic>immobile</italic>, and so on. Interacting with such individuals, still taken to be persons, always requires considerable readjustment and learning.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Axiom 2 (Intentionality). <italic>P takes it that what O knows, thinks, feels, perceives, says, and does is determined by what O wants.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The automatic attribution of mental processes to a person is, in this axiom, supplemented by the assumption of an over-arching intentionality or goal-directedness. This feature is included in practically all existing approaches to psychology, including “<italic>psycho-analysis</italic>,” “<italic>reinforcement theory</italic>,” <italic>evolutionary psychology</italic>, and <italic>cybernetics</italic>. (See also the survey of the topic by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354312441512">Malle, Moses, &amp; Baldwin, 2001</xref>). Intentionality, or directedness, is a central part of what we automatically attribute to persons. Philosophers frequently write about intentionality but discussion of their alternative conceptualizations is beyond the scope of the present article.</p>
<p>The attribution of intentionality to the different mental processes takes somewhat different forms. The most direct application is to <italic>saying</italic> and <italic>doing</italic>. These activities are clearly channeled by what is intended. Perceptual processes all focus on what is taken to be <italic>relevant</italic> for the achievement of actual or potential goals. The central processes referred to as <italic>know, think</italic>, and <italic>feel</italic> are likewise intentional, but in somewhat different ways. <italic>Knowing</italic> is activated only when it is relevant for goal-directed activity. This also goes for <italic>thinking</italic>, which also involves monitoring of <italic>possibilities</italic> for acting, relative to both present and potential goals. Finally, <italic>feeling</italic> is the assessment of the situation relative to the current goals of the person.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Axiom 3 (Reflectivity). <italic>P takes it that O can know that O knows, thinks, feels, perceives, says, and does.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This axiom refers to a very important characteristic of how humans are seen. The ability involved is to know <italic>that</italic> something is the case. Axiom 3 states that it is taken to be <italic>possible</italic> for O to “know that” some mental process is going on. It should be added that one probably cannot formulate anything very general and precise about <italic>when</italic> and <italic>how</italic> O becomes “conscious <italic>of</italic>” something in his or her own mental processes. It can be surmised that this occurs only if the situation is problematic, and when unreflective automatic processes fail to engender a solution. The present axiom merely asserts that there is always attribution of a potential <italic>capacity</italic> to reflect in every person.</p>
<p>That the axiom states only a <italic>possibility</italic> implies recognition that we do not always take it that someone knows <italic>that</italic> he or she knows, wants, thinks, perceives, says, and does something. In modern empirical psychology this is sometimes regarded as discovery of “the unconscious,” but this is not really a discovery and has always been known, although not accentuated to the degree done, for example, in psycho-analysis. Statements such as “I have always taken it for granted that …, but I didn’t know <italic>that</italic> I did this, until now” are not uncommon.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Axiom 4 (Verbalization). <italic>P takes it that O can say something about what O knows that O knows, thinks, feels, perceives, says, and does, and only about that.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This axiom states that we cannot talk about what we do not know that we know, think, feel, and so on.</p>
<p>Even though the axioms on Reflectivity and Verbalization are closely related, they are not identical. We all take it that others can know <italic>that</italic> they know something, and yet not talk about it. What the Verbalization axiom expresses here is the fact that we take it that one cannot <italic>talk</italic> about what one does not know <italic>that</italic> one knows.</p>
<p>Since we can only talk about something that we know <italic>that</italic> we know, think, feel, and so on, talking is a good indicator of what we know reflectively. In fact, it is the only direct indicator. We usually get to know if O knows something reflectively by asking him or her about it. What O knows unreflectively can only be inferred from O’s behavior. Example: A woman always smiled when a social situation got difficult. When others commented on this, she said,<disp-quote>
<p>Yes, you are right. I always smile, but <italic>I didn’t know that I did, until now</italic>! I think I must have learned very early that smiling faces mean that everything is OK, and I want that to happen. Angry faces and voices scare me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We all take it that the other person can know that something is the case, and yet not say it. This axiom expresses the fact that we take it that one cannot talk about what one does <italic>not</italic> know that one knows, and so on.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Axiom 5 (Learning). <italic>P takes it that what O thinks will happen after now follows from what O thinks happened before now.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The axiom is here, somewhat inelegantly, stated exclusively in terms of semantic primitives. The ability to learn is central in our image of what a person is. We take it that a person can learn and remember. Indeed it would be incompatible with the image of a person as goal-directed if he or she were completely unable to learn and remember. This axiom adds an important feature to our image of mental processes, namely their <italic>irreversibility</italic>. We know that a person can never return to exactly the same state, because what happened in the meantime is remembered. Experimenters realized early that subjects could not be used as their own controls, because they remembered, and were changed by, what happened in the preceding experimental condition. To avoid this, and also the fact that individuals always differ, group averages were resorted to, and the randomized controlled trial design was gradually introduced.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Axiom 6 (Responsibility). <italic>P takes it that O is responsible for what O says and does.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>People attribute to a person primary responsibility for that person’s statements and acts. It is always important <italic>who</italic> is taken to have said or done something. <italic>Who</italic> said or did something determines <italic>who</italic> is punished or rewarded, and also <italic>who</italic> can be expected to repeat (or not to repeat) the act, and so on. Complications of this are frequently discussed, but basic responsibility is never discarded. Even when a person is taken <italic>not</italic> to be ultimately responsible, responsibility in the basic sense (it <italic>was</italic> O who did it) is retained. Lack of responsibility is explained by assumptions that either deny complete normal personhood (the individual is regarded as “crazy,” or “retarded”), or imply that the individual is a victim of deceit or misunderstanding.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Axiom 7 (Morality). <italic>P takes it that O has a want to do what O thinks is right and a want not to do what O thinks is wrong.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The axiom asserts that people think that a desire to do what the person thinks is right always exists, but it does not assert anything about the momentary relative strength of that desire, which means that it does not exclude that a person may behave in a way that he or she thinks is wrong. When this is the case, we assume that the person wants something else more strongly than doing what is right.</p>
<p>This axiom expresses something more than what can be deduced from the axioms of Intentionality, Responsibility, and Learning. It adds something to what P takes for granted about O, namely something normative. A person is taken to be social, and this assumption probably has a very high usefulness and survival value. In everyday life, we simply take it for granted that we are dealing with social individuals. Even when it is said that a person does not know the difference between right and wrong, this is usually an over-simplification. Very rarely, if ever, does a person lack a distinction between what is regarded as right and wrong in the society to which he or she belongs. We usually attribute knowledge of such a distinction to persons along with a desire to comply with it. However, we can take into account that what is right and wrong for a person may be relative to a particular group or society.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Axiom 8 (Feeling). <italic>P takes it that how O feels follows from the relation between what O wants and what O thinks.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This proposition reflects that we take it that a person is a whole system and that this system continuously monitors the relation between what is wanted and what is thought about the situation. It involves evaluation of many probabilities of alternative outcomes, resulting in feeling good or bad (as well as in responding both in action and in thinking and talking). Good and bad feelings are consistent with the notion that people are intentional. However, how one feels can be separated from how one perceives the situation and from what one wants. Hence, the proposition about feeling is treated as a separate axiom.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Axiom 9 (Vulnerability). <italic>P takes it that O thinks everyone can do something bad to O.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Vulnerability is taken as a valid psychological description of every person. The axiom plays an important role in the proof of several theorems about personal trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354312441512">Smedslund, 1997</xref>, pp. 68–73). It is hard to think of an interpersonal situation in ordinary life where the participants do not feel at least potentially vulnerable. (This does not mean that they necessarily know <italic>that</italic> they feel vulnerable.) From an evolutionary perspective, one may expect that people have developed concepts about, and mechanisms to deal with, this vulnerability. The axiom is about attribution of a recognition of a <italic>possibility</italic> of being harmed, not a recognition of a <italic>probability</italic> of being harmed. It is likely that the universality of religions is linked to the universal experience of vulnerability that people share. The universality and importance of the concept of <italic>trust</italic> appears to be a manifestation of this.</p>
<p>The preceding critical analysis yields nine axioms. This number is preliminary. It is open to changes depending on whether propositions are given the status of axiom, theorem, or definition, and whether other psychological topics are introduced. The tentativeness also illustrates that there is a margin of freedom in formulating and organizing such general propositions. Further results will depend on much more elaborate analytic work than can be done within the scope of the present introductory article. It should be mentioned here that the inevitable inclination to be critical of the axioms and think of exceptions should be moderated by considering that the words are not intended to be used as loosely as in ordinary language, but in a technical sense. Example: a reviewer wrote “Can’t I feel indifferent when I do not achieve a goal?” What does it mean to feel indifferent? Quite literally it would seem to mean that something (in this case achieving the goal) makes no difference. But, again, having a goal means wanting to achieve something. How can one be indifferent when not achieving one’s goal? To have a goal at least means that achieving it is preferred to not achieving it: that is, this makes a difference. So, in psycho-logic, one cannot be indifferent when not achieving one’s own goal.</p>
<p>The best method one can use to evaluate the necessity of these propositions is <italic>the negation test</italic>. This means to consider whether the proposition could possibly be wrong: that is, whether the negation of the proposition makes any sense or not. In the case of axioms, a negation should not make any sense at all. However, the negation test cannot remain subjective. Only if everyone in the scientific community agrees that something must necessarily be assumed should one, provisionally, accept it. The ultimate test should be a complete and general agreement among people about the meaningfulness of a negation of the specific axiom. A number of studies of the assumptions of psycho-logic have been conducted (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354312441512">Smedslund, 2002</xref>) and generally support it. Using well-controlled methods, the consensus figures for samples of native speakers of English and Norwegian are around 97–98 %. Hence, the “objectivity” of at least some of the axioms is provisionally supported.</p>
<p>The mentioned nine axioms and their implications seem to account for at least part of the psychological knowledge shared by all people. It is up to future researchers to decide whether the axioms so far stated are optimally formulated, and especially to what extent they can be seen to describe human characteristics that are given a priori.</p>
<p>Especially Axioms 3 and 4, about <italic>Reflectivity</italic> and <italic>Verbality</italic>, express something that is specific to humans as distinguished from other primates. The processes described by these axioms enable one to deal with the hypothetical, to deny something, and analyze and evaluate possibilities and probabilities in advance of real decisions. This ability to reflect <italic>on</italic>, and talk <italic>about</italic>, what goes on, including one’s own mental processes, adds tremendously to the adaptability of human beings. Any human group can do this.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The two preceding parts of this trilogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959354312441512">Smedslund, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959354312441512">2012</xref>) have presented the reasons why it is difficult for psychologists to achieve generalized empirical knowledge, and the strategy for practicing that corresponds to this. The present article outlines fragments of the a priori contingent knowledge we have. Can the negative view of the applicability of traditional science to psychology be upheld?</p>
<p>An alternative to outright rejection of the methods of traditional academic psychology could be to continue to use them and simply accept that the data have a limited generalizability. This would require a much increased sensitivity to the limitations of our alleged accumulated knowledge and still would not be very helpful since it cannot take into account the tremendous variability and fortuitous nature of practical situations and individual persons.</p>
<p>Another approach would be to leave open the ultimate explanation of the regularities described in the nine axioms and simply rely on them. One could disregard the question of whether these describe inherited characteristics of all members of the species <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, or merely refer to what all members of this species must learn very early because of commonalities in the life conditions of all humans. However, irrespective of how these regularities are interpreted, derivations from the axioms may have very limited use in practice, where one always must, in addition, take into account innumerable and fortuitous details of concrete situations.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, that the attribution of a <italic>caring</italic> attitude is necessary condition for a <italic>trusting</italic> personal relation to exist. This can be logically proven, given definitions of words like care and trust in terms of primitive concepts (P cares for O = df P wants O to feel good and not to feel bad; P trusts O = df P thinks that O will not do anything bad to P), and the axiom about <italic>Vulnerability</italic>. This predicts something in a very abstract way about a psychological reality. The exact cues indicating that someone cares for you can vary almost indefinitely and may even be impossible to describe, but they may, even so, be well understood by a person in a given situation at a given time. In general terms, we only know that <italic>if</italic> P personally trusts O, <italic>then</italic> P must think that O cares for P. This can be proved logically, given the definitions of care and trust and the axiom of <italic>Vulnerability</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354312441512">Smedslund, 1997</xref>, p. 70).</p>
<p>What kind of “law” is this? It appears to be quite removed from any detailed observational anchoring. The proposed relation is between two complex concepts (trust and care) none of which can be linked in a fixed way to directly observable criteria. The “law” is about a relation between <italic>kinds</italic> of experiences. It seems as if the search for something invariant in psychology can only succeed by focusing on entities similarly removed from the directly observable and recordable physical realm. We seem to be led to a level of analysis different from that of direct observations, and consisting of reports by persons about experiences.</p>
<p>The “science” suggested here rests on basic characteristics of the species <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> and on primitive concepts that are not likely to change very fast. It remains to determine more extensively what can be deduced from the proposed axioms. However, it is already clear that there is one great limitation to what we can predict in psychology, namely the role of the <italic>fortuitous</italic> in the lives of intentional and ever-learning individuals with tremendously variable (and also fortuitous) genetic constitutions. We can, for example, predict behavior by applying the psycho-logic-axioms to individuals, and by assuming that there are no relevant unforeseeable events.</p>
<p>Some confusion can be traced to the difference between the natural-science observational level and the report and talk level. The science of psychology concerns events that can be talked about, even if they cannot be literally observed in the same way as in biology or chemistry. There can be no bridge between the two levels because of the enormous complexity of the neural mediation processes. Care and trust cannot today be usefully measured with physical instruments.</p>
<p>What kind of science can this be? Consider some examples: The person who hates you usually is a person who tries to harm you. The indifferent person does not do anything to benefit you and does not do anything to avoid harming you. So you prefer that a person cares for you and, therefore, tries to benefit you and to avoid harming you. If you think he or she does care for you (and understands you, etc.), you will tend to behave trustingly since you expect not to be harmed. There is no fixed bridge between analysis at this level and particular observations and measurements capable of physical specification.</p>
<p>Persons behave logically, but with subjective premises. To trust a person who you think cares for you and understands you (and also has <italic>own-control, self-control</italic>, and the <italic>requisite competence</italic>) is logical. I have analyzed this elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354312441512">Smedslund, 1997</xref>, p. 70).</p>
<p>Psycho-logic is a system that predicts behavior by means of logic. Therefore, it is a suggestion about how one should talk and analyze what goes on. You can predict what a person will do now, or in the immediate future, by means of logic, assuming that you know the person’s momentary premises and momentary subjective situation. How do you know what someone is going to do here and now? Well, you know it only when you know what the person momentarily takes for granted and wants to achieve. This is partly determined by fortuitous factors and the context and must be ascertained for each case of here-and-now. We need to describe the features that momentarily characterize the person and the situation. Given these premises, behavior is derivable from the psycho-logic axioms. Some sets of premises can be quite complicated, and deduction of their consequences can be difficult, especially if some of them are not verbalized. They may even be unknown to their owners. Only when we find them can we predict behavior. If we do not know the premises, the behavior of a person remains unpredictable.</p>
<p>Psycho-logic builds on the assumption that people are subjectively logical because they are intentional and continuously monitor their situation (know, think, see, hear, etc.).</p>
<p>Human premises are always composed of thoughts and wants. This follows from the Intentionality axiom (2). To act intentionally is to want something and to be guided by the situation.</p>
<p>All psychologies have assumed something similar to this. However, they have not consistently assumed logic, because they have not been consistently focused only on the subject’s point of view. Often they have been partly focusing on the objective side of a result, and that has led to pseudo-problems occasioned by the idea that people are partly irrational (illogical). If a child makes an objective error, it is often assumed that this is due to an “irrational” (“illogical”) psychological process, rather than assuming that the child is acting logically on momentary premises of his or her own.</p>
<p>For social purposes it is often important that the child learns that something is a wrong answer, and why it is so, but this does not warrant the conclusion that the child is illogical! From the point of view of psycho-logic, persons are never illogical, but they always act upon what follows logically from a set of explicit or implicit momentary premises. I repeat, an act can only be understood when we know what premises it follows from. The preceding can also be stated in the following way. Intentionality presupposes subjective logicality since one cannot pursue a goal in a subjectively self-contradictory manner. One must be logically consistent within a time period in order to be said to behave intentionally in that period.</p>
<p>People are rarely explicitly logical, although their behavior can be described as logical consequences of a set of premises (most of which are never explicitly stated). Your manner of confidently stepping into a dark room is, among other things, a consequence of taking it for granted that there is a floor. This presupposition does not occupy you at all, yet it is there as a part of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354312441512">Alfred Schutz and Thomas Luckmann (1973)</xref> called the “relevance structures of the life world.”</p>
<p>The axioms of psycho-logic describe some very general presuppositions that appear to be shared by all people. One can speculate that they are selected evolutionarily by the strong survival value of knowing in advance the general nature of the beings of the same species that you live with.</p>
<p>The question remains of how much of what we all know is covered by these axioms. Are there areas not covered by the axioms that everyone also knows? And is it possible that some persons do not rely on all the axioms in some situations? Also, are people’s unreflective (automatic) processes always channeled in ways describable by something equivalent to these axioms? These are questions for future research.</p>
