<abstract>
<p><bold>Background:</bold> The Traveller community are an indigenous minority group in Great Britain and Ireland who experience premature mortality. While minority populations worldwide are known to have high rates of risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), Traveller CVD risk has not previously been defined.</p>
<p><bold>Design:</bold> All-Ireland cross-sectional census survey of the Traveller minority population (<italic>n</italic> = 10,615 families).</p>
<p><bold>Methods:</bold> A subsample of adult respondents completed a health survey (<italic>n</italic> = 2023). CVD was defined as self-report of doctor-diagnosed heart attack, angina, or stroke. CVD risk factors and measures of social position were examined in the Traveller group using age-adjusted prevalence and prevalence ratios (PR). Comparisons were made with a general population sample of low socioeconomic status.</p>
<p><bold>Results:</bold> Age-adjusted prevalence of CVD in the Traveller population was 5.6% (95% CI 4.6–6.8), similar to that in the comparator population. Compared to those without CVD, Travellers with CVD had a higher prevalence of self-report of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, current smoking, and a measure of distrust. Compared with the general population sample, Travellers had a higher prevalence of diabetes (adjusted PR 2.8, 95% CI 2.1–3.8) and lifestyle-related risk factors such as smoking (PR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2–1.4), fried food consumption (PR 2.8, 95% CI 2.4–3.2), and physical inactivity (PR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2–1.4).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This comprehensive census survey confirms CVD as an important health risk in the economically disadvantaged Irish Traveller community. Our findings add to the international knowledge base on minority populations and CVD risk.</p>

<p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of death worldwide, causing 29% of all deaths in 2004.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741826711428059">1</xref></sup> Higher rates of both atherosclerotic risk factors and coronary artery disease have been noted in many minority indigenous populations, including aboriginal populations in North America,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741826711428059">2</xref></sup> New Zealand,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741826711428059">3</xref></sup> and Australia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741826711428059">4</xref></sup> as well as in nomadic populations such as the Roma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711428059">5</xref></sup> Irish Travellers are an indigenous minority population with a nomadic tradition. Their value system, customs, language, and traditions make them an identifiable group, both to themselves and others,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711428059">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711428059">7</xref></sup> and this self-identification as a Traveller is used as a definition of the population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741826711428059">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741826711428059">8</xref></sup> Travellers are believed to have originated within Ireland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741826711428059">9</xref></sup> with evolving genetic evidence as to this ‘endogenous’ origin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741826711428059">10</xref></sup> They are distinct from the much smaller Roma population in Ireland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741826711428059">11</xref></sup> It is estimated that there are over 40,000 Travellers living in the island of Ireland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741826711428059">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Travellers suffer premature mortality, as evidenced in a recent census of Travellers on the island of Ireland, which described a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for heart disease and stroke in Travellers of 348 (95% confidence interval (CI) 300–401) compared with the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711428059">13</xref></sup> While increased CVD mortality,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741826711428059">14</xref></sup> high levels of smoking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741826711428059">15</xref></sup> and an increased prevalence of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741826711428059">16</xref></sup> have been previously described in the Traveller community, there has been no examination of CVD epidemiology and CVD risk factors in a large, representative sample of this population. Social disadvantage, a construct which encompasses disadvantage in education, employment, social support, and economic status, has been shown to be independently associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711428059">17</xref></sup> Social disadvantage has long been a problem for the Traveller community, but its association with CVD risk in Travellers has not been examined.</p>
<p>The All-Ireland Traveller Heath Study (AITHS) is a programme of studies on the Traveller community on the island of Ireland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711428059">18</xref></sup> This analysis uses AITHS census survey data to describe the frequency of self-reported CVD and CVD risk factors in Travellers, to examine the association between measures of social disadvantage and typical CVD risk factors with CVD, and to draw comparisons of CVD risk factor and morbidity rates with a socioeconomically comparable general population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1741826711428059" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>The AITHS census survey was a cross-sectional survey of all Traveller families on the island of Ireland. The AITHS was undertaken by the University College Dublin (UCD) School of Public Health, Physiotherapy, and Population Science in close collaboration with steering groups from the Republic of Ireland (ROI) and Northern Ireland (NI) with both Traveller and national government representatives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711428059">18</xref></sup> The study received ethical approval from the UCD research ethics committee in ROI and the Office for Research Ethics Committees of NI.</p>
<sec id="sec3-1741826711428059"><title>Study population</title>
<p>The sampling frame was all family units self-identifying as Travellers on the island of Ireland. Study planning included a scoping exercise to locate and perform a preliminary enumeration of Traveller families. All family units were then approached for study recruitment during the census survey fieldwork period (a 6-week period from October 2008 in ROI and February 2009 in NI).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711428059">18</xref></sup> After informed consent had been obtained, one person from each unit acted as the family enumerator. Families with a child aged 5, 9, or 14 answered a child health subsurvey. If no such child was resident in the family unit, a further key respondent (age ≥15 years) was selected for a health interview (at random: either a health status or health utilization questionnaire). Questions were answered either directly by the selected respondent or by proxy by another respondent. Only directly answered questionnaires were retained for this analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741826711428059"><title>Study instrument</title>
<p>Travellers historically have an oral tradition with low literacy rates. This can present a challenge to data collection. The study team designed a novel oral-visual data collection instrument,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711428059">18</xref></sup> which was administered using laptop computers, by 472 trained peer researchers drawn from the Traveller community itself. This instrument contained predominantly images, with minimal text prompts, and training was provided on its use for all peer researchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711428059">18</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741826711428059"><title>Data items</title>
<p>Questionnaire items were derived from previous Irish population surveys, such as the national Surveys of Lifestyle and Nutrition (SLAN),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741826711428059">19</xref></sup> and international surveys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711428059">20</xref></sup> Both the items and the data collection instrument were piloted with Traveller groups, and feedback informed the questionnaire development. Data were collected on known risk factors for atherosclerotic diseases, including self-report of diabetes mellitus, smoking status, and self-reported dietary factors and physical activity. Hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia were determined by self-report of a doctor-diagnosis of high blood pressure and/or high cholesterol in the preceding 12 months. CVD was defined as self-report of a doctor-diagnosis of heart attack, angina, or stroke in the preceding 12 months.</p>
<p>Consultation with Traveller groups recommended that the respondent burden with food frequency questionnaires would be too great for this population. Therefore dietary information was collected by direct questioning on key foodstuffs known to be related to atherosclerosis risk (fried or ‘fast’ foods, and salt). Data on measures of social position and social disadvantage included employment status, marital status, educational, and literacy status, items capturing experience of discrimination (EOD),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711428059">20</xref></sup> and a measure of perceived support from social and personal structures. Participants provided a measure of self-rated health (using a Likert scale), and answered the statement ‘Generally speaking, most people can be trusted’. The individual EOD items were converted to a scale by counting whether the respondent had ever experienced discrimination in nine common situations because of their membership of the Traveller community (range 0–9).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741826711428059">20</xref></sup> Perceived social support was measured on a four-point scale for six common sources of support (spouse or partner, parents, children, other relatives, friends, and/or religious personnel). Scores were summed for persons who had provided valid answers for at least three sources of support (88.2% of respondents) and a percentage score was attributed to each respondent. This social support scale was then analysed in tertiles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741826711428059"><title>Comparator population</title>
<p>Comparisons were made with a sample of the general Irish population using data from a publicly accessible recent Irish population survey, SLAN 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711428059">21</xref></sup> This study surveyed a random sample of ROI adults aged ≥18 years, identified through the Geodirectory. Key data in SLAN and AITHS were collected using comparable data items, including self-report measures for the CVD risk factors. Age data in SLAN were available in 5-year age groups. In ROI, eligibility for free health care is income tested through the general medical services (GMS, or ‘medical card’) scheme, and this has previously been demonstrated to be a proxy for social disadvantage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741826711428059">22</xref></sup> The group of persons with medical cards was therefore used as the comparator for the AITHS data, as they were deemed to be of lower socioeconomic status (SES). SLAN collected data on 10,364 participants during 2006, of whom 3718 (35.9%) had GMS ‘medical cards’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741826711428059">21</xref></sup> Almost all Travellers (94%) in ROI have a GMS ‘medical card’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711428059">18</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741826711428059"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The prevalence of CVD was examined in the Traveller population by age and sex strata, with confidence intervals calculated using the binomial distribution. CVD risk factors with a theoretical or established <italic>a priori</italic> association with CVD were examined in the Traveller population by CVD status using age-adjusted prevalence rates (by the direct standardization method,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741826711428059">23</xref></sup> standardized to the Traveller population data). Associations between the risk factors and CVD were examined within the Traveller population using Poisson regression modelling with robust variances,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741826711428059">24</xref></sup> with the risk factor in question as the dependent variable, prevalent CVD as the independent variable and adjusted for age. Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence rates of CVD and CVD risk factors were examined in the Traveller and the SLAN low SES populations (again using the direct standardization method, standardized to the combined Travellers and SLAN low SES population). Prevalence ratios (PRs) were estimated using Poisson regression, with the risk factor as the dependent variable, Traveller status as the independent variable, and adjusted by sex and age in 5-year increments. All analyses were undertaken using Intercooled Stata 9 (StataCorp, Texas).</p>

<sec id="sec8-1741826711428059" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>Data were gathered on 8492 of 10,618 identified Traveller family units (overall census response rate of 80.0%). Completed age, sex, and CVD data were available on 1878 of the <italic>n</italic> = 2023 Traveller direct respondents aged 18 and over who were selected at random to complete the health status section of the family interview (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1741826711428059">Figure 1</xref>). Travellers who reported CVD were older than those who did not (mean age 54.06 ± 14.48 vs. 34.99 ± 13.85; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1741826711428059">Table 1</xref> shows the distribution of self-reported CVD by age and sex strata in the Traveller group. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711428059">Table 2</xref> shows the age-adjusted prevalence and PR of typical CVD risk factors, lifestyle risk factors, and measures of social position in the Traveller population, by CVD status. For the trust and consumption of fried foods variables, strongly negative age associations were noted within the Traveller population, with a significant interaction effect noted between age and CVD in the regression model estimating the prevalence ratio for trust only (interaction term <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Therefore, the PRs reported for trust in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741826711428059">Table 2</xref> are stratified by age. In the Poisson models, significant positive associations were found between CVD and self-reported hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, diabetes, current or former smoking vs. never smoking, drinking alcohol more frequently, and increasing experience of discrimination. Significant negative associations were found between CVD and self-rating of health as good to excellent, consumption of fried food, and in the older age group, and agreeing that most people can be trusted (in the older age group).

After adjustment, there was no statistically significant difference in prevalence of self-reported CVD, hypercholesterolaemia, and hypertension in the Traveller and SLAN groups. In comparison with the SLAN population, the Traveller group were more likely to have diabetes, to be current tobacco users, to be physically inactive, to always use salt at the table, and to have higher consumption of fried or ‘fast’ foods. Travellers were less likely to consume alcohol frequently. Even in this comparison with a general population at low SES, unemployment was more prevalent amongst Travellers, as was early school leaving.

<p>To our knowledge, this study represents the most ambitious and large-scale study of the prevalence of CVD and CVD risk factors in the Traveller population in the literature. We have shown that self-report of prevalent CVD in the Irish Traveller population is associated not only with prevalent CVD risk factors, but also with a lower personal rating of health and low expressed general trust. Furthermore, there is a significant burden of lifestyle-related risk factors (current tobacco use, sedentary lifestyle, and salt and fried food consumption) and diabetes in the Traveller community when compared with a low SES sample of the general Irish population. The positive association between the conventional CVD risk factors examined and self-report of CVD is not unexpected. CVD risk factors have a similar impact on cardiovascular risk across ethnicities, and different rates of disease can be explained by different risk factor prevalence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741826711428059">25</xref></sup> Minority populations have been shown to have worse CVD risk profiles than majority populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741826711428059">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741826711428059">27</xref></sup> and this finding may be consistent with life-course understandings of disease aetiology which suggest that intrauterine or early life adversity may be associated with adult chronic disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741826711428059">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741826711428059">29</xref></sup> However, even amongst minority groups, there is evidence that Travellers may be in a position of marked disadvantage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741826711428059">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>We describe a strong negative association between a measure of trust and prevalent CVD. This is an important finding for the Traveller community, health professionals, and health policy makers. There is a known association of hostility and anger with coronary heart disease and hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741826711428059">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741826711428059">32</xref></sup> Trust is important in patient–caregiver relationships and can vary by ethnicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741826711428059">33</xref></sup> In contrast with findings in other studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741826711428059">17</xref></sup> other measures of social disadvantage were not associated with CVD in our analysis. This may be explained by a ceiling effect: most respondents were married, had high levels of social support, and were unemployed. Although Irish Travellers experience social exclusion from the general Irish population,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741826711428059">34</xref></sup> Traveller communities are known for their strong social and family support networks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741826711428059">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The comparison with the general population sample at lower SES frames the Traveller findings. The sex- and age-adjusted prevalence of self-report of doctor-diagnosed CVD, hypertension, and hypercholesterolaemia is similar between the populations. However, diabetes, smoking, consumption of salt and fried foods, and sedentary lifestyle are all more frequent in Travellers. Travellers have a higher burden of premature mortality than the general population, and analysis of the cause of death in Travellers shows a higher mortality ratio for heart- and stroke-related deaths in both Traveller men and women (SMR in males 337, 95% CI 203–536; and in females 489, 95% CI 261–837).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711428059">13</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1741826711428059">Figure 2</xref> shows the age distribution of the sample in this census substudy, with evidence of the premature mortality seen in the Traveller population pyramids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741826711428059">13</xref></sup> It may be that the equivalent rates of CVD and self-reported risk factors are due to an information bias. One study which conducted a physical and laboratory examination of the cardiovascular health of Roma people in Slovakia noted higher rates of detected cardiovascular disease in Roma compared with a general population sample, with increased rates of previously undiagnosed hypertriglyceridaemia and diabetes also in the Roma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741826711428059">5</xref></sup> Under-ascertainment of risk factors and disease in Travellers may be due to fewer attendances for preventive reasons, and poorer quality health service interactions when they do attend. Recall bias, late presentation, and higher case-fatality rates may also be contributing to under-ascertainment of CVD and CVD risk factors.</p>
<p>There is a clear need for primary care and preventive physicians to focus on CVD morbidity in Travellers. CVD risk factors should be prospectively identified and modified regardless of minority or ethnicity status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741826711428059">35</xref></sup> Standard primary and secondary cardiovascular preventive interventions, such as smoking cessation and cardiovascular risk assessment may be of reduced efficacy in persons at low SES,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1741826711428059">36</xref></sup> requiring innovative ways to intervene on these populations’ risk factors. Targeted screening programmes with a clear referral pathway to secondary care may assist in risk factor identification: the UK pilot of the ‘Healthy Hearts Project’ has shown that a brief screening intervention is acceptable to minority groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741826711428059">37</xref></sup> In Ireland, the Traveller Health Networks provide outreach health-related support to Travellers. Whilst published evidence of the efficacy of health interventions for minority populations is not consistently available, one review identifies at least moderate evidence for targeted screening programmes which bypass usual service providers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741826711428059">38</xref></sup> and supports strategies such as service provider training programmes, to reduce minority group health inequalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741826711428059">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Greater consumption of fried or ‘fast’ foods was negatively associated with self-reported CVD in the Traveller group. Young Travellers report greater fried food consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741826711428059">18</xref></sup> This negative association with CVD may relate to the cross-sectional nature of the data. Older Travellers with greater fried food consumption may have a higher case-fatality rate from CVD. We also considered that Travellers with established CVD may have modified their diet, although this population do not have an established history of secondary prevention lifestyle change.</p>
<p>Our study has some limitations. The associations described with CVD in this study are with prevalent, rather than incident disease, and assumptions relating to causality cannot be made. The comparisons between Traveller and general population data are based on different surveys at different time points (2008 vs. 2006), and thus need to be interpreted with caution. As a survey study, all variables were collected by self-report. This is in common with many such epidemiological studies. Self-report may lead to an information bias with under-reporting and under-ascertainment of such factors. However, self-reported frequencies of disease have previously been shown to be acceptable proxies for doctor-diagnosed disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741826711428059">39</xref></sup> Although formal studies of questionnaire reliability were beyond the scope of this study, the study instrument was designed to have content and construct validity and was piloted with the Traveller peer researchers. Data on obesity or body mass index were not collected, as consultation with Traveller groups prior to the study informed us that Travellers typically do not measure their weight. More women than men provided survey data: this is in common with experiences in other health surveys in minority populations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741826711428059">40</xref></sup> and also reflects the tradition of Traveller women taking primary responsibility for health matters. Study strengths include the high survey response rate, large sample size, and the use of innovative methodologies to access this hard-to-reach group. Use of peer researchers enhanced the study response rate, as they had an established relationship of trust with the local Traveller population. Computer-aided data collection allowed us to gather information in a culturally-appropriate way and avoid an excessive missing data burden.</p>

<sec id="sec10-1741826711428059" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This comprehensive census survey confirms CVD as an important health risk in the economically disadvantaged Traveller community, with high rates of both lifestyle- and social capital-related CVD risk factors. Cultural sensitivity towards Traveller traditions may assist health-care providers in achieving a better patient-caregiver relationship. Our findings add to the international knowledge base on minority populations and CVD risk.</p>
