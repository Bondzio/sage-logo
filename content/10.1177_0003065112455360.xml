<p>All of our five senses reside in the body. The preceding papers bring us “back to our senses” and put the body back into its rightful and important place in psychoanalytic thinking.</p>
<p>As analysts, we “listen” using our own idiosyncratic sensory “listening devices.” Some of us favor what we hear, others what we see, or touch, taste, or smell to find our way in the world. These sensory modalities develop unconsciously through our innate capacities and are honed from specific experiences that shape the senses that we privilege. As analysts, we attempt to “listen” using many of our senses, but some analysts may have developed specific sensory capacities, listening devices they can unconsciously access while listening to patients.</p>
<p>The papers printed here were originally presented on the panel “Analytic Listening and the Five Senses.” The authors each describe their particular sensory predilections and how their artistic, musical, or poetic discipline informs their listening. In particular, they describe how their capacity to access unconscious processes allows them to know something before they come to know it consciously.</p>
<p>I am a potter and bring with me a particular kind of listening that I unconsciously developed over years of placing my hands to the clay as I threw pots. I “listen” as I touch the clay, listening to its movement, its textures, to its non-shape before it starts to take shape. As an analyst, I find myself listening to the silences, to the movements, to the non-words, the non-shapes. If I can tolerate the space of this kind of not-knowing and tolerate the waiting, then I might have the chance to come to know even more.</p>
<p>During the panel, the presenters spoke about some similarly intuitive unconscious process that allowed them to come to know more about their patients and themselves. This kind of knowing did not come from listening to the content of the analytic dialogue, although using words is a necessary vehicle for the work. But each of the panelists described a kind of knowing that emerged through some sensory listening, not consciously known but operating on a presymbolic, preconscious, and unconscious level. In their various ways, they came to trust the “hints” that emerged, the bodily states they experienced, and the spontaneous drawings (in Jonathan Palmer’s case) that could tell them more of what was being unconsciously experienced in the analytic dyad and in the room.</p>
<p>This kind of work relies on the analyst trusting the intuitive, sensory self, listening more through the body, coming to know more than the words themselves, and making connections with patients not yet able to put their thoughts into words. This kind of work is also about being present in the moment, while not thinking about the moment. It is about being attuned to the patient and oneself at a more “primitive,” sensory level, a level that is the foundation for the rest of the work. It is about accessing the presymbolic, nonlinear, nonconscious part of our minds, and experiencing our patients, ourselves, and the total surround through our bodies, our senses, our gestures, our nonverbal tones and moods.</p>
<p>These analyst authors, who are also artists, musicians, and poets, may have particularly ready access to their preconscious and unconscious states of mind, but many other bodily based activities (athletics, martial arts, working with one’s hands) may facilitate the development of such access. When these activities are practiced over time, in a repeated and disciplined way, they become part of one’s unconscious, implicit memory.</p>
<p>You have read the papers, but I wish to comment about the actual experience at the panel in San Francisco. The ballroom was packed, and an air of excitement filled the room. There was often the laughter of relief, murmurs of agreement, a deeply felt gratitude that something known was finally spoken about. It was obvious from the audience’s questions and comments that the panel had touched on something important, and too long ignored.</p>
<p>Indeed, the audience seemed to understand something of these artistic, sensory, unconscious experiences but had lacked both words to describe them and permission to inquire into them. The panelists, using their spoken words, the music beneath their words, their artwork and drawings, created a space for the audience to feel, to think, and to imagine in ways not evident in other meetings, in other papers, and in our field more generally.</p>
<p>These papers give us a new way to think about how to conduct our work and how to think about our goals. Perhaps the psychoanalytic endeavor is not solely about gaining insight; perhaps these papers are highlighting another aim: to have bodily based access to unconscious processes in both our patients and ourselves in order to feel more enlivened, true, and real as we struggle to live fuller lives. We’ve all been immersed in the practice of the “talking cure,” but these papers point us in a new direction. They are redirecting us back to the body, and are paving the way for a freedom to feel, think, and speak further about the body and the senses in our psychoanalytic work.</p>
