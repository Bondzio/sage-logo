<body>
<p>Ten years ago, one of us (DC) co-authored an article in the <italic>Medical Journal of Australia</italic> reviewing the then-current knowledge base regarding the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486211">1</xref></sup> Particular emphasis was placed on the role of the so-called ‘atypical’ antipsychotics clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and amisulpride. It is timely, a decade on, to take another look at the field, to provide some updated guidance for clinicians. In particular, we review the newer atypical antipsychotics in terms of efficacy, effectiveness and side effect profiles. But first, we ask what types of evidence we can now rely on, to inform these matters.</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856213486211">
<title>Randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses vs. other sources</title>
<p>Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have long been held as the gold standard by which to judge the efficacy of any treatment. One of the problems with this is that single studies might not have sufficient statistical power to show separation from placebo (placebo response rates appear to be steadily increasing)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213486211">2</xref></sup> and also, it is difficult to integrate often disparate findings from different studies. To address these issues, the last decade saw a massive increase in the number of meta-analyses being performed.</p>
<p>Meta-analyses allow numerous studies to be considered and reduced to a single composite analysis of efficacy. Care needs to be taken to assess heterogeneity across studies and ensure the integrity of the studies themselves. The Cochrane Collaboration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cochrane.org">www.cochrane.org</ext-link>) in particular has strict rules regarding which studies should be included in meta-analyses. Again, this restricts the evidence base and might exclude other studies, which might be informative to the clinician but not reach the methodological rigour required for meta-analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213486211">3</xref></sup> Also, meta-analyses tend to have rather simple conclusions regarding just one or two outcome measures, which do not do justice to the nuances of clinical practice nor allow a balanced judgement to be made about the particular clinical profiles of different medications. With these caveats in mind, the general conclusions of recent meta-analyses of antipsychotic trials tend to converge in the finding of little, if any, efficacy advantage for atypical antipsychotic drugs over typical; however, their side effect profiles are quite different, with a lower propensity for inducing extrapyramidal side effects, yet with some agents showing a stronger signal for the metabolic syndrome, in particular.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213486211">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213486211"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213486211"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213486211">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another problem with industry-sponsored RCTs is the lack of generalisability of the selected patients to those in routine clinical practice;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213486211">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213486211">9</xref></sup> this is due to issues such as exclusions based on, for example, comorbidities including suicidality, and not being able to enrol people lacking the capacity to consent to a clinical trial. Most of the RCTs are of short duration (6–8 weeks), whereas schizophrenia is all too often a life-long illness and so, what matters most with treatment is the long-term in relation to efficacy, as well as tolerability. Also, the studies tend to pit a single study drug against placebo (with or without an ‘active’ comparator), limiting broader between-drug comparisons. In an attempt to address some of these issues, a number of large multi-drug studies with broader inclusion criteria than usual RCTs have been conducted.</p>
<p>In the US, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-sponsored CATIE trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213486211">10</xref></sup> found the time to discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs for any reason to be similar for the atypical agents quetiapine, risperidone and ziprasidone, and the typical agent perphenazine; yet olanzapine had a marginally longer time to discontinuation, but this might have been influenced by methodological issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213486211">11</xref></sup> The biased allocation to treatment, excluding from the perphenazine group those with a history of extrapyramidal side effects (EPSE), compromised the value of this study. The CUtLASS 1 study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486211">12</xref></sup> assesses 237 people with schizophrenia across 14 UK health services, randomised to either typical or atypical antipsychotic therapies and followed for 52 weeks: the typical drugs (one-half of these patients were prescribed sulpiride) were no better than atypical (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone or amisulpride) in terms of quality of life (the primary outcome), symptoms, nor patient preference.</p>
<p>Finally, EUFEST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213486211">13</xref></sup> is an open, randomised European study of first-episode psychosis patients, which reported all-cause discontinuation rates within 12 months of 72% for haloperidol, 40% for amisulpride, 33% for olanzapine and 53% for quetiapine. The atypical agents show statistically lower discontinuation rates than haloperidol, but symptom reduction is similar across all agents. These studies, overall, suggest only modest benefits (mostly tolerability) for the atypical agents on broad outcome measures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213486211">14</xref></sup> Findings do need to take into account inter-patient variation in symptom response and tolerability, as well as dosing issues; particularly, the higher doses of typical agents are more likely to be associated with treatment-emergent EPSE and in long-term use, with higher rates of tardive dyskinesia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213486211">15</xref></sup> The high discontinuation rates in all these studies do underline the fact that we still do not have a ‘perfect’ antipsychotic.</p>

<title>The newer agents</title>
<p>A number of agents have been approved by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for the treatment of schizophrenia, over the last decade. All have proven therapeutic efficacy in adults with schizophrenia, and whilst all are classed as atypical antipsychotics, they vary in terms of the mechanism of action and side effect profile. We provide here a brief summary of these agents (presented in alphabetical order). Readers are directed to texts by Stahl,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213486211">16</xref></sup> Bazire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856213486211">17</xref></sup> and Castle et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1039856213486211">18</xref></sup> as well as the Australian Therapeutic Guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1039856213486211">19</xref></sup> for further details and references.</p>
<p><italic>Aripiprazole</italic> is a partial agonist at dopamine D2 receptors and is thus touted as a ‘dopamine system stabiliser’. It is also an antagonist at serotonin 5HT2 receptors. Rates of Parkinsonism appear low, but initial akathisia can be very unpleasant for the patient, so a low-dose incremental strategy is advised, commencing with 5 mg and building up to 15 – 30 mg, dependent upon response and tolerability. The agent is associated with little by way of weight gain, hyperlipidaemia or diabetes, and it does not raise prolactin levels.</p>
<p><italic>Asenapine</italic> has a complex pharmacology, with antagonism across a range of dopamine, serotonin and alpha-1/2 receptors; it has lower affinity for histaminergic receptors than olanzapine, quetiapine or clozapine, and has little or no affinity for muscarinic receptors. The registration trials used twice-daily dosing, but after a rapid initial distribution the elimination half-life is 24 hours: many patients can be adequately treated with a single dose at night, particularly given that it can be rather sedating. Some patients find that asenapine causes insomnia and akathisia, in which case shifting the dose to the morning is sensible. It is generally well tolerated, with a relatively benign profile in terms of EPSE, metabolic side effects and hyperprolactinaemia. Asenapine is formulated as a wafer that needs to be placed under the tongue, with avoidance of food or drink for 10 minutes thereafter. Some patients find the taste unpleasant or experience a transient numbness at the placement site.</p>
<p><italic>Paliperidone</italic> is the active metabolite of risperidone and like risperidone, is an antagonist at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2 receptors. It is formulated as a capsule that uses a technology (OROS) to osmotically control release in the gastro-intestinal system, ensuring a smooth dose-release curve. As it is largely renally excreted, it has little by way of hepatically-mediated drug-drug interactions. Usual daily dosing is from 3 – 12 mg. Side effects are usually seen more prominently at higher doses and include postural hypotension and EPSE. Hyperprolactinaemia is not uncommon and it requires monitoring, as outlined below. Weight gain is similar to that seen with risperidone. Some QTc prolongation may be seen and baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) is recommended, with avoidance of other agents that might prolong the QTc interval.</p>
<p>There is also a long-acting formulation of paliperidone that uses nano-crystal technology, does not require refrigeration, and can be given into deltoid or gluteal muscle. Initial titration is intra-deltoid 150 mg on day 1; 100 mg on day 8; and thereafter, monthly. An average dose is 100 mg monthly, but higher or lower doses may be used, dependent upon patient response and tolerability. Long-acting injectable agents have an important role to play in ensuring adherence to treatment in people with schizophrenia. The potential role of paliperidone palmitate in this regard is reviewed by Newton and colleagues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1039856213486211">20</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>Sertindole</italic> is a selective inhibitor of dopamine D2 receptors in the mesolimbic system (when compared with the nigrostriatum) and an inhibitor of 5HT2 receptors and alpha-1-adrenoreceptors. It is shown to be as effective as haloperidol in the treatment of psychosis and it is superior to haloperidol and placebo in the treatment of negative symptoms. It was also compared with risperidone, again showing some superiority in efficacy, notably for negative symptoms. It has a lower level of EPSE, compared with haloperidol. Sertindole has been associated with QTc prolongation, requiring an assessment of benefit versus risk, when prescribing, and appropriate cardiac monitoring. It is given once daily, in a usual dose range of 12 – 20 mg.</p>
<p><italic>Ziprasidone</italic> is an antagonist at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT2 receptors. It needs to be taken twice daily and must be taken with food, as this enhances absorption. It is generally well tolerated, with a low propensity to metabolic syndrome, but some patients find it sedating, especially early in treatment. Its alpha-1-adrenergic antagonist properties mean that it can cause postural hypotension in some patients. There are also concerns about its propensity to prolong the QTc interval: baseline ECG and ongoing monitoring is suggested, as outlined below. Dosing for schizophrenia is in the range of 40 – 200 mg daily, in divided doses, with up-titration in the initial phases. There is also a short-acting intramuscular formulation, with 10 – 20 mg often being effective in the acute phase of illness.</p>

<title>The metabolic syndrome and hyperprolactinaemia</title>
<p>There is now overwhelming evidence that people with schizophrenia suffer from a markedly elevated cardiovascular risk, compared to people without a mental illness. In the recent Australian Study of High Impact Psychoses (SHIP), for example, 46% of participants had a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30, while 82% had abdominal obesity, 21% diabetes, 31% hypercholesterolaemia and 20% hypertension; over one-half of the participants met the criteria for metabolic syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1039856213486211">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856213486211">22</xref></sup> Furthermore, the majority had a sedentary lifestyle and two-thirds were current smokers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1039856213486211">23</xref></sup> There is also striking evidence that cardiovascular risk factors go undetected and undertreated, amongst people with schizophrenia. For example, in the SHIP study, only 40% of those with diabetes were receiving treatment, as were 39% of those with hypercholesterolaemia and 52% of those with hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1039856213486211">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Pertinent to this article, it is clear that a number of antipsychotics are associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. Weight gain is particularly problematic with clozapine, olanzapine and quetiapine, though less so with asenapine, ziprasidone and aripiprazole. A number of these agents can cause a rapid increase in cholesterol, and clozapine and olanzapine in particular are associated with emergent diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1039856213486211">24</xref></sup> Thus, the side effect profiles of these agents should be borne in mind when prescribing, especially as antipsychotics are usually used in the long, rather than the short term. It is imperative that patients are warned about the risks associated with the medications that are prescribed and followed with metabolic monitoring (a metabolic monitoring form is available from the corresponding author, upon request). A healthy diet and regular exercise should be encouraged, as specific programmes promoting a healthy lifestyle show encouraging results for some patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1039856213486211">25</xref></sup> Certain pharmacological strategies, such as the addition of metformin, might be helpful for some patients in ameliorating weight gain associated with antipsychotics, notably olanzapine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1039856213486211">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>The general health risk issues associated with antipsychotic use needs to be balanced against the benefits associated with these agents in terms of mental health. Also relevant is the finding in a Finnish study of 66,881 schizophrenia patients that shows lower 11-year mortality rates in patients on antipsychotics than those not receiving treatment. Clozapine was associated with the lowest mortality rate, with a notable reduction in suicide rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1039856213486211">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another side effect associated with some of the antipsychotics, notably the typical agents and amisulpride, risperidone and paliperidone, is hyperprolactinaemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1039856213486211">28</xref></sup> Hyperprolactinaemia can cause menstrual irregularities, sexual dysfunction, gynaecomastia and galactorrhoea; sensitive but direct questioning of the patient is required regarding these effects, as patients might be too embarrassed to divulge these problems. Other consequences of hyperprolactinaemia include osteopaenia and (possibly) an increased rate of breast cancer. In prolactin-raising antipsychotics, testing of baseline and at least annual prolactin levels is suggested. Inder and Castle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1039856213486211">28</xref></sup> provide clinical guidelines to follow, if a raised prolactin level is detected.</p>
<p>Cardiac effects, notably prolongation of the QTc interval, is associated with a number of antipsychotics, but particularly the typical agents thioridazine and pimozide (now withdrawn from the market), droperidol (oral form withdrawn), and the atypical agents ziprasidone and sertindole. For these agents, baseline and repeated ECGs are recommended, as well as avoidance of these agents in patients with prolonged baseline QTc interval. At particular risk are those with a prolonged QTc interval, with either concurrent cardiac disease or a metabolic disturbance, such as abnormal potassium levels.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1039856213486211">
<title>Treatment resistance and the place of combination therapy</title>
<p>It remains the case that a proportion of people with schizophrenia will not respond adequately to first or second line antipsychotics. In such cases, clozapine can be highly effective, but it does carry a side effect burden (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1039856213486211">Table 1</xref>) that relegates its use to only patients who have failed to respond to a reasonable trial of at least two other antipsychotics. The benefits of clozapine for treatment-resistant patients were again demonstrated in the CATIE study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213486211">10</xref></sup> and its association with lowered rates of suicidality is emphasised in the large Finnish study mentioned above.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1039856213486211">27</xref></sup></p>

<p>For those patients who do not respond to clozapine (this may be up to 70% of those who commence a trial, according to some estimates), the range of effective interventions is very limited. First of all, poor adherence should be considered as a factor in clozapine resistance. A number of augmentation strategies were tried, mostly combining clozapine with other antipsychotics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1039856213486211">29</xref></sup> Taylor and Smith<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1039856213486211">30</xref></sup> carried out a meta-analysis of studies lasting up to 16 weeks, where a second antipsychotic was added to clozapine. They found only marginal clinical benefit overall and conclude that much longer treatment trials are required to adequately investigate this issue.</p>
<p>Some strategies do show promise. Risperidone was added to clozapine in a number of mostly brief, small-scale studies; the results are decidedly mixed, but the most technically sophisticated study shows significant benefits over placebo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1039856213486211">31</xref></sup> The addition of aripiprazole to clozapine is shown to offer benefit for negative symptoms, while also reducing weight and cholesterol on the combination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1039856213486211">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1039856213486211">33</xref></sup> Amisulpride augmentation of clozapine also shows promise.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1039856213486211">34</xref></sup> Despite the relative scarcity of evidence, aripiprazole and amisulpride are frequently added to clozapine in current clinical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1039856213486211">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>With respect to non-antipsychotic augmentation of clozapine, lamotrigine shows some promise in reducing overall symptomatology with good tolerability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1039856213486211">36</xref></sup> Valproate is frequently added to clozapine for its anticonvulsant effect and there is also some possible benefit for reduction of aggression; however, the additional weight gain associated with valproate can be problematic.</p>
<p>Combinations of antipsychotics not involving clozapine are becoming commonly utilised in clinical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1039856213486211">29</xref></sup> A meta-analysis that includes acute psychosis studies found that use of combination antipsychotics is superior to antipsychotic monotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1039856213486211">37</xref></sup> Interestingly, a large Finnish epidemiological study found that antipsychotic polypharmacy over a follow-up period of 11 years was only second to clozapine in reducing mortality from all causes (including suicide and cardiovascular disease, analysed separately) in the treated patients, while the highest mortality was associated with no use of antipsychotics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1039856213486211">27</xref></sup></p>

<title>The role of antidepressants in schizophrenia</title>
<p>Depressive symptoms are common in patients with schizophrenia and there is a high suicide risk in the disorder.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1039856213486211">38</xref></sup> Sometimes depressive symptoms are present during the prodrome and before the onset of an acute episode of schizophrenia, or they may be present whilst a patient is acutely unwell or in the aftermath of the acute psychotic episode. During the prodrome and the acute illness, the symptoms usually will respond to the direct treatment of the psychosis. Depressive symptoms should not be confused with the side effects of some medications, which can cause excessive tiredness, fatigue, lethargy and EPSE, such as akinesia. If depressive symptoms occur following a remission of psychosis and they meet the criteria of major depression, they warrant active treatment. A psychological intervention may suffice, but an antidepressant, usually a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor, may also be indicated. Antidepressants must be introduced cautiously in patients suffering from schizophrenia, as these medications can on occasion aggravate the psychosis and side effects such as akathisia. The evidence for the benefit of antidepressants in schizophrenia is inconclusive, but there is some evidence that antidepressants may diminish negative symptoms. These issues are discussed in detail by Bosanac and Castle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1039856213486211">39</xref></sup></p>

<title>Emerging treatments</title>
<p>A number of novel approaches to the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia are being explored, departing from post-synaptic dopamine blockade, which is the primary modus operandi of all marketed antipsychotics. There has been particular interest in glutamatergic mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1039856213486211">40</xref></sup> A single 4-week study of a metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist showed some efficacy for both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1039856213486211">41</xref></sup> further studies failed to confirm these initial findings and this agent was withdrawn by the manufacturer. Despite this, the glutamatergic system remains a reasonable target for new schizophrenia drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1039856213486211">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>Alpha-2 receptor antagonism is another area of exploration, particularly for the amelioration of negative symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1039856213486211">43</xref></sup> Muscarinic mechanisms have also been postulated, but the implications for treatment are still unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1039856213486211">44</xref></sup> Finally, cannabidiol, a constituent of the plant <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic>, appears to have antipsychotic efficacy, raising the profile of the cannabinoid system and its potential role in schizophrenia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1039856213486211">45</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have provided a 10-year update on the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia, with a particular emphasis on clinical aspects. Despite the advent of atypical antipsychotics with a lower propensity for EPSE, including what can be devastating tardive dyskinesia, efficacy has not improved over typical antipsychotics. These medicines are not automatically substitutable, and a patient may tolerate one and not another, and may respond better to one than another. The majority of evidence to inform clinical decision-making is based on short-term studies, while these illnesses require long-term treatment. Benefits are still modest and adherence is variable. There is great scope for additional treatments and novel therapeutic approaches.</p>
