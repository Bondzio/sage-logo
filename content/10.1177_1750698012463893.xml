<abstract>
<p>This article investigates contrasting memories of East Germany’s 1968 based on a sample of six life story interviews. Given the iconic events of West Germany’s 1968, there has been a growing interest in the events happened on the other side of the Iron Curtain. In unified Germany, however, commemorations of 1968 in the German Democratic Republic have focused on a particular type of 68er biography: those who broke with the regime as a result of the Warsaw Pact’s invasion of Czechoslovakia on 21 August 1968 and chose to pursue various forms of opposition in its wake. This article lends more nuance to the subject by examining three individuals who chose this path alongside three others who followed a different trajectory. The crushing of the Prague Spring and their own imprisonment for protesting against it led the latter to shun open opposition in favour of pursuing change from within official structures. By highlighting the plurality of East German experiences and memories of this period, this article seeks to make a contribution both to the study of the international 1968 and to the thriving scholarship on how the East German past is remembered in united Germany.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the mid-1990s, the Franco-German Green party politician Daniel Cohn-Bendit, who had played a prominent role in the student protests of 1968 and their commemoration in both France and Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1750698012463893">Cohn-Bendit, 1986</xref>), participated in a panel discussion about Germany’s recent unification. Wondering aloud what separated East Germans from West Germans, Cohn-Bendit produced a simple answer: ‘The West had 1968 and the East did not’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1750698012463893">Peifer, 1997</xref>: 1). Cohn-Bendit’s quip drew on an interpretation of the Western 1968 that had gained currency since the late 1980s – of the student protests as a watershed in the Federal Republic’s history, separating the old, stagnant Republic of the 1950s and early 1960s from a liberalised period thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1750698012463893">Albrecht et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1750698012463893">Görtemaker, 1999</xref>: 475–524). The Western ‘68ers’ had supposedly set a ‘cultural revolution’ in motion, and in so doing, had been important agents in liberalising and democratising German society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1750698012463893">Baier, 1988</xref>). As a result of not having undergone this transformative process, Cohn-Bendit’s logic ran, East Germans were fundamentally different creatures.</p>
<p>Recent scholarship has produced a more differentiated understanding of the Western protest movements and the historical agency of the 68ers to show that the iconic events of the late 1960s were embedded in more long-term processes of social, cultural and political change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1750698012463893">Schildt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1750698012463893">Von Hodenberg and Siegfried, 2006</xref>). Cohn-Bendit’s provocative verdict nevertheless provides insights into the discursive setting of reunified Germany. It reflected a wider contemporaneous trend of using the history of the Federal Republic as a yardstick with which to evaluate the East German past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750698012463893">Clarke and Wölfel, 2011</xref>: 12). West Germany’s ‘pluralism and creative diversity of the post-1968 decades’ were invoked particularly frequently to contrast with the German Democratic Republic’s (GDR) alleged backwardness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1750698012463893">Lindenberger, 2001</xref>: 43–44). It was in this context that a growing number of former GDR citizens first insisted that, although the events had been less visible than the Western ones, the years around 1968 had also been an important moment in the history of East Germany and had left a lasting mark on those involved (Von der Goltz, 2011a, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1750698012463893">2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>Those who made this point had, for the most part, been in their late teens or early twenties in the 1960s, a time when East German society had been ‘on the move’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1750698012463893">Sywottek, 2000</xref>). Coming of age, they had often rejected the tastes and lifestyle, and sometimes the politics and authoritarian behaviour of their elders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1750698012463893">Wierling, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1750698012463893">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1750698012463893">Ohse, 2003</xref>). They had been touched by some of the same music that inspired their Western counterparts, had invested their hopes in the prospect of Socialist reform symbolised by the Prague Spring, and had often printed and disseminated leaflets or written slogans on walls that denounced the Warsaw Pact’s invasion of Czechoslovakia on 21 August 1968 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1750698012463893">Kowalczuk, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1750698012463893">Wolle, 2008</xref>). All in all, East Germany’s security service, the Stasi, confiscated over 10,000 leaflets and registered 1690 graffiti slogans that defied the intervention. While they paled in comparison to the highly visible unrest in the West as well as the better-known student demonstrations in Poland and Czechoslovakia, the East German protests that took place in the aftermath of the intervention still exceeded those that had occurred after the construction of the wall on 13 August 1961 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1750698012463893">Tanzscher, 1994</xref>: 35–36). Of the 506 protesters who had been imprisoned throughout the GDR by November 1968, two-thirds were under 25 years old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1750698012463893">Tanzscher, 1994</xref>: 122–29). Invoking both the similarities with and differences to the West German revolt, those who first spoke up about these experiences in the 1990s portrayed themselves as distinct ‘Eastern 68ers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1750698012463893">Havemann, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1750698012463893">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750698012463893">Kleinert, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1750698012463893">Simon, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>These early voices sought to counter Western-focused narratives and claimed the inclusion of East German perspectives into the commemorations of 1968 in unified Germany. Their primary concern was to emphasise that the GDR had had a civic culture as well and should thus not be invoked as a negative foil to highlight the achievements of the Federal Republic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1750698012463893">Klessmann, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1750698012463893">Lühmann, 2008</xref>). At times, the debates also acquired a more competitive note, particularly when controversy surrounding the activist past of prominent members of the first Red–Green coalition government flared up. In 2001, Werner Schulz, a Green Member of Parliament (MP) originally from East Germany, who had been involved in the peace movement of the 1980s, gave an interview to the news magazine <italic>Der Spiegel</italic> that struck a deliberately confrontational tone. While the West German 68ers – and specifically prominent members of his own party, such as the then Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer – had battled West German policemen, he argued, he had stood up to a truly repressive regime when throwing stones at Soviet tanks passing through the Saxon town of Zwickau on their way to Prague. Westerners, however, wilfully neglected the East German side of the story, partly, he alleged, because they envied activists from the former GDR who had helped to bring about a <italic>real</italic> political revolution in 1989. Schulz thus offered an inverted version of the Western narrative that linked 1968 to the attainments of the ‘cultural revolution’: ‘The Western leftists dreamt of revolution, but brought about a reform of society. We dissidents, by contrast, wanted a reform of socialism, but sparked a revolution that has changed Europe to this day’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1750698012463893">Schulz, 2001</xref>: 57). Schulz thus attributed nothing less than the GDR’s demise and the integration of Eastern and Western Europe to the activism of those Easterners shaped by 1968.</p>
<p>That the meaning of 1968 is frequently contested and subject to competing interpretations has become something of a truism. Several recent studies have shed light on the memory and myth of 1968 in different European countries and stressed the elastic plurality of this marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1750698012463893">Cornils and Waters, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1750698012463893">Reynolds, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1750698012463893">Ross, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1750698012463893">Von Lucke, 2008</xref>). While debates about 1968, especially in Western Europe, are often framed by the divisions between left and right, Schulz’s statement, for one, hints at one of the idiosyncrasies of the East German case. The Western revolt is undoubtedly also a reference point in other countries formerly behind the Iron Curtain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750698012463893">Apor and Mark, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1750698012463893">Glushko, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1750698012463893">Osęka, 2011</xref>). In unified Germany, however, memories of East German activism have to compete with post-war West German narratives that loom particularly large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750698012463893">Clarke and Wölfel, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>As we have seen, one of the legitimising strategies of Eastern activists has been to link their experiences of 1968 directly to the ‘peaceful revolution’ of 1989 and thus to a narrative of the GDR’s demise that emphasises popular agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1750698012463893">Neubert, 1997</xref>: 25) and which is rapidly solidifying and becoming institutionalised; it now dominates official commemorations of the regime’s collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1750698012463893">Jarausch, 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1750698012463893">1</xref></sup> Like Werner Schulz, they argue that the failure of the Prague experiment in 1968 revealed the futility of socialist reform from within, and in so doing, provided a training ground for the future civil rights movement that ultimately helped to bring down the Socialist regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750698012463893">Miethe, 2009</xref>). By setting disillusioned reformers on the path to peaceful revolution, the ‘defeat’ of 1968 thus bred the ‘success’ of 1989.</p>
<p>In unified Germany’s officially sponsored memory culture that – while no monolith – often juxtaposes examples of opposition and resistance with the Party’s political domination and Stasi repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1750698012463893">Lindenberger, 2001</xref>: 45), such voices have received the most sympathetic hearing. Two of the museums established to showcase Germany’s dual post-war history, the Bonn-based <italic>Haus der Geschichte</italic> and the Leipzig-based <italic>Zeitgeschichtliches Forum</italic>, for instance, tell the story of Eastern youth opposition in the 1960s exclusively from their perspective.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1750698012463893">2</xref></sup> Their standing is further enhanced by dedicated archival collections in Berlin, Jena and Leipzig that showcase the writings and achievements of East Germany’s oppositional groups.</p>
<p>Accounts that focus on the consequence of 1968 for later oppositional groups no doubt pick up on an important legacy of 1968; this article, however, offers a more pluralist reading of what this period meant for GDR activists and highlights the multiple pathways they followed in its wake. It draws on six life story interviews with East German activists who protested against the Warsaw Pact’s intervention in Czechoslovakia and engaged in more or less loosely organised forms of political activism around 1968. These stories, chosen from a larger sample of interviews with East German activists,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1750698012463893">3</xref></sup> were conducted by the author as part of a collaborative, pan-European oral history project about 1968, which interviewed people who had been politically active in the late 1960s and early 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750698012463893">Gildea et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1750698012463893">Gildea and Mark, 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1750698012463893">4</xref></sup> The interviews with five men and one woman investigated in this piece were selected on the basis of the fact that, even though all six had largely moved in similar circles in the late 1960s, their subsequent trajectories and reflections of what East Germany’s 1968 meant revealed particularly striking contrasts. Furthermore, almost all of them had spoken out in public or written short articles about 1968 on previous occasions, revealing a desire to write themselves into and shape the historical record. The oral history interview often brought to light more detailed and complex renderings of their political biographies than their public utterings. Rather than offering an exhaustive study of East German protesters – many of whom were young male workers and apprentices who often took to the streets spontaneously and have been less vocal about this period since (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1750698012463893">Gehrke, 2007</xref>) – this article thus takes a closer look at six individuals who consider 1968 an important moment in their political socialisation, but do so in starkly contrasting ways.</p>
<p>As we will see, the first three individuals investigated in this piece largely wrote their lives into the version of what 1968 meant that is outlined above: for them, it highlighted the repressive nature and unreformability of the GDR dictatorship. They saw 1968 primarily as a symbol of disappointment and defeat, and one they invoked to legitimise their ever-intensifying struggle against the system in its wake.</p>
<p>By contrast, the second group of individuals saw 1968 as an impetus to forfeit open opposition in favour of pursuing change from within state structures. Rather than turning them against the GDR, the defeat of socialist reform in 1968 led them to engage more closely with and often to endorse the existing system. Taking a closer look at the divergent narratives and trajectories of a range of individuals who had been engaged in similar causes around 1968 – and had often known each other intimately – this article seeks to demonstrate the advantages of oral history in recapturing the contingency of activism in 1968 and probing officially-promoted accounts of the past that typically reduce historical complexity.</p>

<title>‘That’s when the lights went out …<italic>’</italic> 1968 as the last chance of reform</title>
<p>Gerd Poppe (born in 1941) is one of those East German activists who pursued a successful political career after 1989, which saw him become a Green Party MP and the German government’s Human Rights Envoy under the Red–Green Coalition. He writes his experiences with activism around 1968 into a broader story framed by frequent encounters with state repression that shaped his outlook from an early age. Raised by parents with Social Democratic leanings who kept their distance from the regime, Poppe traces his opposition to state socialism back to his childhood in the late 1940s and early 1950s, a time when East Germany was moulded into a Socialist state based on the Soviet model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750698012463893">Land and Possekel, 1998</xref>: 126; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1750698012463893">Ross, 2000</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1750698012463893">5</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Of course we were instilled with a great disgust with Nazi crimes, but on the other hand this was also linked to a glorification of Stalinism. And it was somehow always clear that there was something not quite right about it. [ … ] There was a picture of Stalin in every classroom, Stalin adorned school books, and in these every second or third story was about Stalin, the ‘wise and unrelenting freedom fighter and the smartest human being, the greatest human being on earth’, this was drummed into schoolchildren like crazy. (Gerd Poppe, personal communication, 11 June 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although he was only just about to turn 12 years old, Poppe claims that the Soviet dictator’s death on 5 March 1953 was a ‘joyous day’ for him. ‘I could not understand at all why people were sad. [ … ] we were fed up with him [ … ] even though I didn’t know many details [about Stalin’s crimes] at this stage’. The crushing of the Hungarian Uprising in 1956, which he followed on the radio in his native Rostock, brought further clarity: ‘Now it was clear that the existing system was suspect’ (Gerd Poppe, personal communication, 11 June 2008). The construction of the Berlin wall 5 years later was a ‘total catastrophe’. Before then, he had visited West Berlin as often as he could to watch Western films and to buy books, a lifeline that was severed on 13 August 1961.</p>
<p>A physicist by training and already married with young children, Poppe moved to Stahnsdorf on the outskirts of Berlin in the mid-1960s and took up a job in a semiconductor factory. He began experimenting with communal living, setting up a weekend commune together with like-minded friends who sought alternatives to the nuclear family. He references the socialist reformers of the Prague Spring as an inspiration, but describes the invasion of Warsaw Pact troops in August 1968 as the truly ‘formative’ experience. Together with some of his fellow weekend communards and a visitor from West Berlin who was a member of the Socialist German Student League (SDS), he went to the Czech Cultural Centre in the East German capital to protest. And yet, it took some time until Poppe would perceive the events in Prague as a real caesura:<disp-quote>
<p>Of course I had absolute doubts about whether anything could be reformed there [in the GDR] after the invasion in Prague in ’68. But I hadn’t given up entirely. And then there was a kind of time lag from ’68 until about ’72–’73 during which we saw that the so-called ‘normalisation’ in Czechoslovakia went hand in hand with considerable repression, but we had not completely given up on the idea that a similar attempt could be repeated. (Gerd Poppe, personal communication, 11 June 2008)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the 1970s, Poppe was part of various loose circles that sought to understand the path to socialist reform by theoretical means, often looking for guidance in the writings of Trotsky: ‘Some never gave up and continued until 1989. That wasn’t my thing. For me that ended in the course of the 1970s’ (Gerd Poppe, personal communication, 11 June 2008). Frustrated with clandestine discussions of theory, Poppe began to engage in more open forms of opposition. In retrospect, the events of 1968 seemed to vindicate and solidify a firm oppositional stance that had developed from an early age. Poppe now thought that ‘as long as we just explain things to each other, read texts, or write down our ideas and make only seven press copies, and give them to the same people who had had the same idea already … this will not produce any results in the end.’</p>
<p>Because of increasingly irreconcilable approaches to fostering change, the oppositional circles he had been part of were torn asunder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750698012463893">Engler, 1999</xref>: 330–31; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750698012463893">Land and Possekel, 1998</xref>). While some decided to ‘march through the institutions’, he belonged to the ‘part that bid farewell to these leftist groups and said from now on we want to be people who act in public, outside of the state apparatus … Explicitly’ (Gerd Poppe, personal communication, 11 June 2008). Poppe highlights that choosing this path entailed numerous risks, including imprisonment and giving up even the smallest privileges: ‘No professional career any longer. Nothing. That was something you had to accept or not’. He and his second wife Ulrike were amongst the most prominent civil rights activists of the 1980s, setting up the <italic>Initiative für Frieden und Menschenrechte</italic> (Initiative for Peace and Human Rights) and publishing the underground journal <italic>Grenzfall</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1750698012463893">Neubert, 1997</xref>: 499, 578). His efforts were rewarded when the regime collapsed in 1989: Poppe joined the Round Table talks that negotiated the transition to democracy and was elected to unified Germany’s parliament in 1990.</p>
<p>He is convinced that East Germany’s 1968 has to be understood first and foremost as evidence of the Eastern quest for democratisation, something he contrasts explicitly with Western activists of 1968 who dreamt of bringing about a political revolution in a liberal democracy. ‘It was something different. We didn’t seek to overthrow democracy, we wanted to have it in the first place’ (Gerd Poppe, personal communication, 11 June 2008).</p>
<p>In the story of Claudia Wegner (born in 1942), who moved in some of the same East Berlin circles as Poppe in the late 1960s and early 1970s, 1968 was an even more important staging post. Unlike Poppe, whose parents had shaped his anti-regime attitude, Claudia Wegner and her younger sister Bettina (born in 1947) – who would become a famous political singer–songwriter – had been raised by dedicated Communist parents. When she references Stalin’s death in 1953, she describes how, as a ‘glowing Communist’, she was asked to be a guard of honour next to a bust of the deceased dictator. ‘And I was so proud! [ … ] The rebelliousness only began properly when I was an adult. At first, I was rather apolitical for a relatively long time’ (Claudia Wegner, personal communication, 24 June 2010). Their parents did not run into conflict with the Socialist state until their children did, but the Wegner sisters had nevertheless been raised very openly and amidst lively political discussions. Wegner explains that the regime’s officially sanctioned anti-fascism went a long way towards binding young people to the socialist project. For a long time, she aspired to emulate her parents’ example.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Because they weren’t hypocrites. They really were honest Communists. My father and mother put up leaflets in ’33, against Hitler. And my father deserted during the war with a group of very young soldiers [ … ]. Of course they were role models for us. After all, not everybody from that time can say that their parents were anti-fascists. And this is how the GDR kept us from looking at them critically, because they [the party leadership] had almost all been in prison. Honni [Erich Honnecker, General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party from 1971 onwards] had been in jail. [ … ] they had a bonus. But this didn’t last forever. At some point it was used up. (Claudia Wegner, personal communication, 24 June 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A trained nursery teacher, Wegner felt increasingly uneasy about the authoritarian character of child rearing in the GDR. The political events of August 1968 were the real turning point, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1750698012463893">Wegner, 2007</xref>):<disp-quote>
<p>Yes, that was actually the start. On the one hand my unease about the way I was supposed to do my job [ … ], which I abhorred. But of course it was really the events in Prague. The images one could see of the tanks in Prague [ … ] We were all in favour of Dubček. Obviously, I also went to the [Czechoslovak] Embassy once, threw flowers over the fence, and then ran away, because everybody who showed up there was arrested immediately. (Claudia Wegner, personal communication, 24 June 2010)</p>

<p>Her act of defiance remained undetected, but her younger sister Bettina, who had just had a child with the budding novelist Thomas Brasch, was arrested and sentenced for distributing leaflets against the invasion: ‘It became really extreme when my sister was imprisoned because of the leaflet campaign about Dubček. [ … ] I was so angry then that I couldn’t remain in my “sofa world”. That’s when it all started’ (Claudia Wegner, personal communication, 24 June 2010). Wegner became interested in alternative ideas about child rearing popular among the West German New Left at the time, and as a single mother, was also tempted to live communally, but had trouble finding suitable accommodation in a country where housing was strictly state-controlled. Furthermore, she was part of various loose oppositional and artistic circles in East Berlin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1750698012463893">Neubert, 1997</xref>: 240). Many of her friends, including her long-term partner, set up small, clandestine groups that discussed the writings of Trotsky. Wegner, however, was not interested in theory and instead dedicated much of her time to helping activists who were imprisoned. She describes how she envisaged change in the GDR in very clear and simple terms that centred on freedom from repression.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We spent thousands of evenings talking about how we imagined it: everything should be free, we just wanted democracy, we wanted to live democratically, we wanted to be able to express our opinion, we wanted to paint pictures, we wanted to write poems that weren’t banned, for which we didn’t have to go to prison. We didn’t want our children to be bullied, we wanted school to be different. Well, we just wanted democracy. That’s what we wanted. And we wanted to keep socialism, because we also thought that it was ok if big companies were owned by the people. [ … ] But that’s all a little bit more difficult than we imagined at the time. (Claudia Wegner, personal communication, 24 June 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because the state denied such basic freedoms and increasingly targeted Wegner as an opponent of the regime, she became ever more hostile to the conditions she found herself in. Over time, she turned into a ‘real enemy of the GDR’, she explains. By the mid-1980s, the pressure from the security apparatus became unbearable for her and her teenage daughter, and her sister Bettina had already been forced out by the regime. When Claudia fell in love with a man from West Berlin, she decided to move to the West.</p>
<p>Like Wegner, Bernd Eisenfeld (1941–2010), who lived in Karl-Marx-Stadt (present-day Chemnitz) in the 1960s, eventually emigrated to West Germany after years of being persecuted for his oppositional stance. The GDR had introduced conscription in 1962, but the young Eisenfeld refused to do traditional military service when called up in 1966, serving as part of the first cohort of <italic>Bausoldaten</italic> (‘construction soldiers’) instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1750698012463893">Eisenfeld and Schicketanz, 2011</xref>). Banned from his job as a bank clerk and denied a place at university once he had finished his 18-month-long stint in a construction unit, Eisenfeld found himself captured by the ideas of the Czechoslovak reformers:<disp-quote>
<p>During this whole time, the whole year of ’68 until the intervention I was totally engaged in favour of the Prague Spring and thought: whether I’m banned from my profession or denied a place at university doesn’t matter [ … ]. There obviously is hope that things still change and can be changed [ … ] Well, my ideas about socialism and freedom – that’s why I supported the Prague Spring really intensely. I went to Czechoslovakia myself to get information. What occurred there from January [1968] onwards was exactly the kind of change that I envisaged for the GDR. (Bernd Eisenfeld, personal communication, 27 April 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Eisenfeld’s father had been a member of the Nazi party and had spent several years in a Soviet labour camp after the war. He portrays his decision to take a stand against the invasion of 21 August 1968 as having been driven by a sense of historical obligation that stemmed from his father’s moral lapses, a narrative device not uncommon amongst members of the GDR opposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750698012463893">Land and Possekel, 1998</xref>: 136; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1750698012463893">Miethe, 2009</xref>: 127). He thought that ‘if you don’t do anything, all the accusations, the indirect accusations against your father cannot be justified. That’s why I felt under moral pressure to act’ (Bernd Eisenfeld, personal communication, 27 April 2010). As a result, he declared his support for Dubček at public events, and two days after the intervention, sent a supportive telegram to the Czechoslovak Embassy in East Berlin. After handing out leaflets condemning the invasion in September, he was arrested and sentenced to 2½ years in prison, which he served in full. The violent suppression of the Prague reformers and his imprisonment marked a turning point for Eisenfeld, who, until this point, had hoped that ‘socialism and freedom’ could be combined:<disp-quote>
<p>That’s when the lights went out, so to say, when it came to hoping for change in the GDR. Therefore this was a really, really, really, really momentous story. I knew: the Prague Spring failed although the majority of the population and decision-makers wanted it. The GDR intervened. Nothing is going to happen for 20 years. (Bernd Eisenfeld, personal communication, 27 April 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Now convinced that the GDR offered no alternative, Eisenfeld began to explore his options for emigration to West Germany: ‘I thought that there I had the possibility to do what I could no longer do in the GDR’. Initially denied his wish, he was finally allowed to leave with his family in 1975. Once he had settled in the West, he considered exposing the repressive nature of the Socialist regime his most important task: ‘I didn’t leave in order to put the GDR to one side, but in order to make clear what went on there’. He published a book that introduced a Western audience to the civil courage and peaceful intentions of the <italic>Bausoldaten</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1750698012463893">Eisenfeld, 1978</xref>) and landed a job with the Gesamtdeutsches Institut, a federal organisation tasked with fostering ideas of German unity and educating West Germans about the repressive nature of the East German regime. In the 1990s, he began working for the Federal Commission of the Stasi Files charged with researching the history of East Germany’s security apparatus. Eisenfeld was convinced that, like those activists who had remained in the GDR and engaged in open opposition to the regime in the 1980s, those who emigrated had done their share to undermine the Socialist state by virtue of their absence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1750698012463893">Eisenfeld, 1995</xref>). Interviewed shortly before his death in 2010, he was convinced that the suppression of the Prague Spring had offered a single valuable lesson: the futility of socialist reform. That some East German activists had continued to nurture hopes in reform from within long after 1968 had been a mistake that weakened the oppositional groups in the wake of the GDR’s collapse in 1989, he argued:<disp-quote>
<p>For me, ’68 was the last chance to experiment with something like the Czechs had done. [ … ] The last chance. [ … ] And that’s why [ … ] I am extremely grateful to the Czechs and Slovaks. They forced me to make a decision that I probably could not have made otherwise. (Bernd Eisenfeld, personal communication, 27 April 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These three narratives differ in some important respects. Gerd Poppe describes 1968 as one of several encounters with state repression that solidified his intuitive anti-regime attitude and ultimately taught him the futility of socialist reform and the importance of visible opposition. Wegner portrays 1968 as an even stronger political and personal rupture that brought her into proper opposition to the regime for the first time. For Bernd Eisenfeld, 1968 equally marked a pivotal moment that buried his previous hopes in socialist reform once and for all and made him determined to emigrate to the West. While they followed different trajectories that in some ways reflected the myriad faces of East Germany’s opposition – Poppe became a full-time activist within the GDR and an influential political figure in united Germany, Wegner focused on her private life once she had left East Germany behind, and Eisenfeld made it his mission to expose GDR injustice after his emigration to the West – 1968 occupies a similar place in their accounts. They invoke the enthusiasm generated by the Prague Spring, but highlight even more clearly the sense of disappointment and hopelessness caused by the intervention of 21 August. Seen from this angle, 1968 was a highly significant personal and political marker; the socialist regime had revealed its true nature, and the idea of reform from within had lost its allure forever.</p>

<sec id="section3-1750698012463893">
<title>‘It could only work, if one went into the system’. 1968 as an impetus for change from within</title>
<p>This was not the only way in which interviewees made sense of 1968 in East Germany, however. As other studies have shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1750698012463893">Apor and Mark, 2011</xref>), activists in the former Communist bloc, who remained on the left, have challenged the idea that the Eastern 1968 could be seamlessly associated with the post-1989 political settlement. Rather than perceiving 1968 as the death knell of socialist reform, for them, it often marked the beginning of a quest to pursue change from within official structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1750698012463893">Land and Possekel, 1998</xref>: 27; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1750698012463893">Gildea et al., 2013</xref>). Rather than existing in a separate sphere, those who viewed 1968 from this perspective had often been part of the same circles in the late 1960s as the activists discussed above.</p>
<p>Burkhard Kleinert (born in 1948), for one, was part of Gerd Poppe’s weekend commune in Stahnsdorf near Berlin in the late 1960s. The communards shared an interest in film, literature and music; discussed anti-authoritarian child-rearing methods; and were bound by a complex web of relationships. Naturally, some of Kleinert’s memories echo Poppe’s. He explains that their discussions revolved around ‘civil rights, the development of democracy, a reasonable approach towards intellectuals and minorities’ (Burkhard Kleinert, personal communication, 27 April 2010). Ultimately, however, both the political future Kleinert envisaged and the means in which he chose to pursue change differed fundamentally from the ideas of his one-time fellow communard. Their takes on what 1968 meant are noticeably different as a result.</p>
<p>Kleinert had been politicised at home from a young age. His father had been a Soviet prisoner of war and a member of the National Committee for a Free Germany, a German anti-Nazi organisation that operated from the Soviet Union during the Second World War. Kleinert’s father became a leading Socialist cadre in the early GDR, but was purged in 1958 for ‘liberalist convictions’ in one of the last inner-party purges after Stalin’s death. Kleinert explains that he thus became aware of the socialist system’s shortcomings and contradictions early on. The ‘cultural revolution’ of the 1960s then fell on fertile ground; he was into beat music and rock’n roll, grew long hair, and soon ran into trouble at school and within the official Socialist youth organisation, the Free German Youth. After the Warsaw Pact’s intervention in Prague in August 1968, he and some friends printed flyers on a children’s stamp pad declaring ‘Keep your hands off red Prague!’ and threw them out of a car window in their native Finkenwerder. The authorities could not trace them at first, but Kleinert was arrested in late 1969 following a tip off. He spent two weeks in prison, lost his place at university and was forced to ‘prove himself in industrial production’ for a year. His enthusiasm for the Prague Spring and his protest against the intervention thus had very real consequences for him, but he does not evaluate the outcome negatively. Instead, he downplays his open defiance of the regime as evidence of his youthful idealism and explains that he ultimately sought different means of effecting change:<disp-quote>
<p>Of course we suffered with them [the Czechoslovaks] intensely, when it came to the Prague Spring. But, I mean, I was only 20 in August ’68, and of course that came with a lot of youthful indignation. [ … ] That I took part in the leafleting campaign stemmed from a kind of emotional concernment. One just had to let it out. It was unbearable. [ … ] Later on things were quite a bit different. (Burkhard Kleinert, personal communication, 27 April 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A sense of ‘frustration’ and a ‘feeling of defeat’ were widespread in his circles in the aftermath of the intervention, but many people around him began to ‘reconsider’ their position and sought a ‘deeper analysis of society’, one less based on ‘emotional’ considerations. Rather than opting for publicly visible activism in the vein of Poppe, Kleinert set up one of the small, heavily conspiratorial and theory-focused discussion circles with Trotskyist leanings that existed across the GDR in the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1750698012463893">Gehrke, 2009</xref>). While he kept his ties to such circles into the 1980s, he also joined the Socialist Unity Party (SED) in 1976, hoping that this two-thronged approach and ‘generational change’ would inevitably lead to reform from within over time. Although the Prague reformers had failed in their quest to ‘humanise’ socialism from above, the need to work within official structures in a more pragmatic fashion was a lesson Kleinert had drawn directly from the Prague Spring and its suppression. His very background and outlook seemed to offer proof that meaningful impulses for change could come from within – in spite of the regime’s history of crushing dissent:<disp-quote>
<p>I mean, the Communist Party was decisive in the Prague Spring. [ … ] Now, I came from a home where I’d made the experience that one could be a Communist without following the party line, [that there was a] possibility of lateral thinking. [ … ] So [I had made] the experience that the impulses for change could come from within the left. That was important for us, for me at least. [ … ] There was an interest in reforming existing structures, to change them, but to keep them in the end. (Burkhard Kleinert, personal communication, 27 April 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These hopes stayed alive for the next two decades, fed once again by Gorbachev’s reforms in the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s. Consequently, Kleinert explains that ‘for people of my political stripes, ’89 was a defeat’. The collapse of the socialist system and German unification under the auspices of the West has not changed his ideas fundamentally. He has remained a member of the SED’s successor party PDS (Party of Democratic Socialism, renamed <italic>Die Linke</italic> – The Left – in 2007), serving as local mayor of Berlin’s Prenzlauer Berg district from the mid-1990s onwards. Kleinert has penned several articles commemorating East Germany’s 1968 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1750698012463893">Kleinert, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1750698012463893">2001</xref>) and is adamant that this was a significant time in the history of the GDR and the moment of his ‘political initiation’. But rather than being defined negatively by his experiences of repression, he considers both his enthusiasm for the Prague Spring and the consequences he suffered as a result as part of a broader trajectory that led to a more sober and meaningful engagement with socialism on the regime’s own terms: ‘For me it [1968] is an important part of my personal development. I wouldn’t ever want to miss it. I also wouldn’t want to miss my year in industrial production, because it was also an important experience. These are just … I am personally very satisfied with my life’ (Burkhard Kleinert, personal communication, 27 April 2010).</p>
<p>Gert Groszer (born in 1948) and Frank Havemann (born in 1949), two of the founders of East Berlin’s Kommune 1 Ost, East Germany’s best-known experiment with communal living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1750698012463893">Brown, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1750698012463893">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1750698012463893">Kätzel, 2002</xref>), describe a similar transformation from engaging in open acts of defiance to a conscious ‘march through the institutions’ of the Socialist state. Set up in 1969 and, as the name suggests, initially inspired by West Berlin’s Kommune 1, the commune was located in an apartment on Samariterstraße in the district of Friedrichshain and consisted of two couples – Gert Groszer and his wife Franziska, and Frank Havemann with Erika Berthold – and their three young children. The communards were part of a large East Berlin circle of friends with loosely oppositional leanings, many of whose members were the children of leading East German functionaries or well-known dissidents. Erika Berthold’s father headed the Party’s Institute of Marxism–Leninism and Frank Havemann’s father was the physical chemist and philosopher of science Robert Havemann, perhaps East Germany’s most prominent oppositional figure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1750698012463893">Vollnhals, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Gert Groszer’s mother ran one of the few independent East German publishing houses, and he describes his upbringing as bourgeois and vaguely oppositional. Taking a critical stance towards the socialist regime thus came relatively naturally to the young Groszer. Like the other interviewees, he and his circle were deeply affected by the Prague Spring and shocked by the intervention. ‘When we found out what was happening in Prague, we wanted to do something’ (Gert Groszer, personal communication, 29 April 2010). Some members of the group printed and disseminated flyers or painted slogans on houses that denounced the invasion. Groszer wrote pro-Dubček slogans on a street in East Berlin, but was never caught. Other friends of his, including Frank Havemann, however, were arrested. Although he was put on trial and sentenced to prison, Frank Havemann does not identify himself as the victim of a repressive regime. Instead, he argues, his act of defiance actually forced the regime to take him seriously and to engage in a meaningful dialogue for the first time:<disp-quote>
<p>We painted slogans on walls and disseminated leaflets without considering whether this was an effective tool or thinking about the consequences it could have for us. And then we were imprisoned. But we didn’t feel like victims, we were perpetrators. We protested against these things [ … ] and our act was recognized. Not by people in the street who saw [the slogans], because they were painted over immediately, but it was recognized in that we were sent to Hohenschönhausen [prison]. [ … ] I did not perceive [my imprisonment] as an injustice, but as an act of recognition. (Frank Havemann, personal communication, 29 April 2011)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In Havemann’s account, the acts of protest were not failed attempts to spread the reformist message to a wider public, but a successful bid to get the regime to engage. The experience thus emboldened rather than disillusioned him.</p>
<p>All the inhabitants of Kommune 1 Ost and members of their extended circle had been close to – and often in awe of – Frank’s father and the singer Wolf Biermann. In the aftermath of 1968, however, some of them, including Frank, began to question these political mentors who had been pushing them towards seeking greater publicity for their cause. This went hand in hand with a substantial change of political direction among some members of the commune. According to Groszer, they now thought:<disp-quote>
<p>Hang on, if socialism can really exist, perhaps it looks like our reality. Perhaps it cannot be done differently. One should try to change sides and to engage with Marxist theory and so on to see whether we can test it [this assumption AvdG] [ … ]. And because we just pulled it off, a breach opened up within our circle of friends and acquaintances that exists to this day. [ … ] We said: ‘We will try this. We will see how far it goes’. It meant ‘going through the institutions’, as the left termed it. (Gert Groszer, personal communication, 29 April 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Havemann, who is still a member of the Left Party, says that he had already begun to reconsider his position towards the state during his time in prison. He shared a cell with an artisan from Mecklenburg who had tried to escape to West Germany via Prague on a false passport. While Havemann felt great sympathy for the West German student movement, this man told him that he wanted to ‘kick [Rudi] Dutschke’s arse’ when he arrived in the West. ‘So I already felt like I had more in common politically with my interrogator than my fellow prisoner’ (Frank Havemann, personal communication, 29 April 2011). He felt similarly alienated by the workers he encountered during his forced stint in ‘industrial production’ at VEB Elektrokohle Lichtenberg, which followed his incarceration. Many of them had ‘reactionary views’, he explains. His encounters with people who truly rejected the Socialist system therefore ‘played an important role when it came to searching for a possibility to become politically active again, in this country that I didn’t want to leave. How can you go about it?’ Like Groszer, he came to the conclusion that ‘It could only work, if one went into the system’ (Frank Havemann, personal communication, 29 April 2011).</p>
<p>This change of course did not just open a temporary breach, but had substantial and long-term personal consequences for the group. Whole families were torn apart. Frank Havemann broke with his father and younger brother, seeing the former only intermittently until his death in 1982, something he regrets greatly. Gert Groszer and his wife Franziska separated, partly because of their political differences.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1750698012463893">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The remaining three communards Frank Havemann, Erika Berthold and Gert Groszer, as well as their friend Klaus Labsch, moved to a bigger communal apartment on Gartenstraße in Berlin’s Mitte neighbourhood, which they re-christened ‘Socialist Living Collective’ to demarcate themselves from Western ‘communards’ whom they now considered too ‘bourgeois’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1750698012463893">Mark and Von der Goltz, 2013</xref>). Havemann joined the Free German Youth and SED and began to study physics, which he had originally been barred from doing because of his protest in 1968. He eventually obtained his doctorate and began to work for the GDR’s Academy of Sciences. His change of political direction thus afforded him the opportunity to pursue his chosen career path, a possibility that did not exist for those activists of 1968 who continued to defy the regime openly.</p>
<p>Gert Groszer’s ‘march through the institutions’ even landed him the post of may in a small village in Brandenburg. He had volunteered for the National People’s Army soon after 1968 and later joined the SED. He relates how he spent the best part of the 1970s and 1980s trying to outflank the regime on the left and injecting revolutionary enthusiasm back into the project of building socialism. He impressed his army superiors by keeping three thick volumes of Marx’s <italic>Capital</italic> in his locker, donated much more than his required share to supporting the struggle of the North Vietnamese Communists, and completed all compulsory tasks with conspicuous fervour. In the interview, Groszer describes a series of events that confirmed his belief that the system was capable of change from below – a belief that was no doubt fed by Erich Honecker’s ascendancy, which seemed to herald a new ‘Socialist dawn’ in the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1750698012463893">Engler, 1999</xref>): Groszer relates that he was allowed to keep his hair relatively long in a state that often sheared long-haired youths against their will (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1750698012463893">Enkelmann, 2000</xref>), was able to protect some of his fellow soldiers from unjust punishment and managed to expose small cases of corruption within the Party.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>There were many things that I experienced positively. [ … ] Again and again I had proof that if you did something, you made it. That’s why the original idea – [to march] through the institutions – was very much confirmed. [ … ] When we did something, it worked. And when we didn’t do anything, it didn’t work. (Gert Groszer, personal communication, 29 April 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As was perhaps to be expected in a country with an exceptionally high surveillance rate unparalleled in the history of repressive regimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1750698012463893">Bruce, 2010</xref>), both Frank Havemann and Gert Groszer were approached by the Stasi soon after embracing state socialism. Havemann turned them down, but not because he objected to being asked:<disp-quote>
<p>I didn’t want to do it. [ … ] Not because I was principally against it, I was more or less for the state and the Party and didn’t think that the Stasi was so bad. I thought that one had to protect the revolution. [ … ] But I knew that I wasn’t made for [ … ] this kind of double role. (Frank Havemann, personal communication, 29 April 2011)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Groszer, on the other hand, agreed to act as an informant. While he now wishes that he had said no, he interprets this decision firmly within the framework of his quest to improve the system hands on:<disp-quote>
<p>For us, it was clear that a state needed a secret service. But it was also clear that collecting information and so on is shit work. But it simply has to be done, that’s what I thought. And why shouldn’t I do it? Should someone else always have to do the dirty work? Is it beneath me? (Gert Groszer, personal communication, 29 April 2010)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He argues that his conversations with his Stasi handlers gave him a platform to voice his grievances:<disp-quote>
<p>All the things I couldn’t do within my party group, the real problems and concerns, I could [voice] there. [ … ] That’s where I went with a lot of my doubts and knew that, if at all, they will be picked up there.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1750698012463893">7</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like Havemann, Groszer felt emboldened by Gorbachev’s reforms of the 1980s and thought they confirmed that he had chosen the right path. The collapse of Socialism in 1989 thus came as a great disappointment: ‘I didn’t want the <italic>Wende</italic>’, Groszer admits. Only after 1989 did he begin to rethink some of his positions, when he found that he appreciated the individual freedom that liberal democracy offered more than he had thought possible.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The violent suppression of the Prague Spring is often portrayed as the death knell of all endeavours across the Eastern bloc to change the Socialist regimes from within. In his sweeping survey of post-war Europe, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1750698012463893">Tony Judt (2005)</xref>, for one, offered his definitive account of the outcomes of the 1968 movements in East and West. While the Western 1968 signified the failure of political revolution, in Eastern Europe, he argued, the ‘illusion that Communism was reformable [ … ] was crushed under the tanks of August 21<sup>st</sup> 1968 and it never recovered. [ … ] In the East, the message of the Sixties was that you could no longer work within “the system”’ (p. 447). This was indeed the conclusion that many of those who had supported the ideas of Socialist reform drew from the Warsaw Pact’s intervention and the repression that followed, but others were convinced that the events offered a very different lesson.</p>
<p>As we have seen, those who protested against the intervention in East Germany in 1968 did not follow a single track in its wake. While both groups of individuals examined here sought to distinguish themselves from their Western peers, the ways in which they wrote themselves into history – and the place they accorded to 1968 in their stories – differed profoundly. All six considered this an important moment in their political socialisation, but it led them to pursue diverging paths.</p>
<p>Gerd Poppe, Claudia Wegner and Bernd Eisenfeld portrayed the Warsaw Pact’s invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968 as a powerful symbol of the repressive nature of the socialist regime, and interpreted their youthful opposition to the intervention as part of a long-term and evolving struggle against dictatorship. While the ideas of the Czechoslovak Socialist reformers had caught their imagination in 1968, their memories of this period are shaped first and foremost by their experiences with repression and their total rejection of the system later on. Poppe and Eisenfeld, especially, posited a direct link between their experiences of 1968 and the collapse of the regime in 1989. In doing so, they could draw on widely available cultural codes, for it is this version of 1968 that is on course to becoming a key component of unified Germany’s officially sponsored memory culture.</p>
<p>Burkhard Kleinert, Gert Groszer and Frank Havemann were also highly emotionally invested in the Prague Spring, experimented with forms of communal living, and protested against the intervention. Kleinert and Havemann were imprisoned as a result. Nevertheless, they do not portray themselves as victims of a repressive regime; on the contrary, Frank Havemann, for one, felt emboldened, because he thought that his arrest signified that the authorities took him seriously for the first time. His confrontation with full-fledged opponents of the regime during his incarceration and service in industrial production reaffirmed his Socialist principles and convinced him that it would be more fruitful to engage with the regime on its own terms. Gert Groszer’s service in the East German Army also led him to believe that one could effect change from within state institutions. And for Kleinert, the top-down initiation of the Prague experiment itself offered proof enough that impulses for reform could come from within the party. If the experiment had failed this time, one had to be more pragmatic in the future.</p>
<p>Rather than feeling vindicated when the GDR collapsed, they saw their vision of a reformed socialism defeated in 1989, which makes them more difficult to integrate into a redemptive German–German narrative of what 1968 meant. Their lives do not lend themselves to celebrations of ‘resistance against dictatorship’ that implicitly bolster the acceptance of the form of democracy achieved by the Federal Republic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1750698012463893">Clarke and Wölfel, 2011</xref>). Although their stories are thus stigmatised, particularly those involving Stasi collaboration, and one might expect them to be more difficult to tell than those bolstered by unified Germany’s official memory culture, it is striking how consistent they are. Memories of cooperation and collaboration with the regime, including its repressive apparatus sit quite comfortably with those of personal repression. In part, this reflects the general tendency of oral history interviews to produce relatively coherent narratives: interviewees ‘compose’ life stories that they can live with and that are comprehensible to the interviewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1750698012463893">Summerfield, 2004</xref>). The notion of a long-term quest to improve the system by different means lends itself to creating such biographical coherence. At the same time, a strong desire to ‘correct’ the historical record also gives consistency and shape to these stories. All three sought to provide a counterpart to those accounts that reduce the GDR to an ill-fated experiment in dictatorship and that fail to take seriously the genuine idealism, however flawed or misguided it may seem to us today, that led many to support the Socialist project – even after 1968. Such stories gain their legitimacy from critiques of the liberal capitalist present and the lack of political alternatives available in a post-Cold War world, and from reservations about a unification process that many felt marginalised East German voices, particularly on the left.</p>
<p>Although in many ways a discrete East German story, pitting, as it does, opposition against Stasi collaboration, such myriad pathways out of 1968 are not entirely exceptional. Much as in West Germany and elsewhere in Western Europe, the vortex of 1968, with its attractive mix of cultural upheaval and political rebellion, drew in young activists from different backgrounds and threw them out in varied directions. Gert Groszer transformed himself from a ‘bourgeois oppositionist’ and Western-inspired communard into a committed SED member and Stasi collaborator, while Claudia Wegner, who had once so proudly guarded a Stalin bust, became an ‘enemy of the GDR’ and opted for a life in the West. This reminds us of the contingency of individual biographies. In West Germany, too, the activists of 1968 supported a multitude of causes later on. While some continued their work in one of the manifold social movements of the 1970s and 1980s, others joined one of the radical and tightly knit Maoist or Trotzkyist ‘K Groups’ that made a mockery of the libertarian streak of 1968.</p>
<p>These diverse legacies go some way towards explaining why 1968 remains so heavily contested, for battles over its meaning have raged in nearly all the countries that witnessed protest movements in these years. Attempts to fix the meaning of acts of protest that sought to challenge the political systems of their day in order to promote a version of events that sits comfortably with the present order will inevitably leave out significant parts of the story. Much as the notion of the Western 1968 as a ‘cultural revolution’ strips the Western protests of their political significance (and violent elements) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1750698012463893">Ross, 2002</xref>), narratives that promote the Eastern 1968 as evidence of an East German ‘civic culture’ that foreshadowed the ‘peaceful revolution’ of 1989 isolate those elements that continued to see in 1968 the promise of a more perfect Socialism. Using oral history methodology, this article has thus attempted to recapture a broader range of individual voices and perspectives. While oral history interviews are of course highly subjective accounts of the past, studying East Germany’s 1968 through them allows us to capture and restore some of the multiplicity and contingency of this complex moment.</p>
