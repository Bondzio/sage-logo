<p>India—the country of call centers and palaces, of monsoons and millions, of magnificent wealth and abject poverty—has fascinated travelers for thousands of years. The Greeks came here for the spices, particularly the pepper they needed to preserve food. Columbus searched for India and found the Americas instead. Vasco de Gama traveled twice to the subcontinent. The British East India Company effectively ruled India in the 18th and 19th centuries, and India was the “jewel in the crown” of the old British Empire. India produced Gandhi as well as poets and scientists. Today India, along with China, is emerging as a strong business rival to the United States.</p>
<p>Some readers of <italic>Gifted Child Today</italic> (GCT) may know that I have spent about 6 months during 2011 and 2012 in India as a visiting lecturer as part of the Fulbright-Nehru Program. The late Senator from Arkansas, William Fulbright, initiated this program, and it is generously supported by both the U.S. and Indian governments. In fact, there are more placements of all kinds available in India than in any other country in the world because of the large contribution of the Indian government to support the program. What this means is that more scholars and researchers come to India than to any other country. There are lecturers, researchers, English language teachers (usually recent bachelor’s or master’s graduates), and student researchers scattered all over India as well as other locations in Southeast Asia. Correspondingly, there are many Indian citizens on exchanges in the United States. In addition, Fulbright offers other programs such as “schoolteacher” exchanges. Of course, full details of these are available online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fulbright.state.gov">www.fulbright.state.gov</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Because I have had this privilege, I want to devote this column to some observations and comments about lessons I have learned about education while I have been working here. I was assigned to Ambedkar University, Delhi (AUD), specifically to a new division for graduate teacher education. I had hoped to work specifically in the area of gifted education, but that has been less in the foreground and more in the background during my stay here. Teacher education, both at the preservice, graduate, and in-service levels is a huge need in this country. It is estimated that there are at least 400 million children in India younger than 14 years of age. These millions of children will require far more qualified teachers than are available now. Recently, the Parliament passed the “Right to Education Act” (RTE), which requires that all these children be in school. This may sound simple in American terms, but in India, millions of children from the age of 2 up work to help support their families. Many poor families feel they cannot afford to give up that income; they do not see the potential economic benefits of education. The government has also enacted programs such as the “Noonday Meal Scheme” to try to induce more parents to put their children in school, but there are still many unschooled children in rural and urban India.</p>
<p>If RTE is actually enforced, however, it will exacerbate some of the problems in Indian schools, in the “public”—what Americans call “private”—schools as well as the “government” schools. A note about the public schools, first, is that all public schools are being required to make “reservations” for economically deprived students. This applies to the many schools of every kind, from those of dubious quality to the elite schools that compare with any similar schools in the United States. It is a noble goal to provide education for all—but imagine the problems of finding and placing children appropriately. For example, what about finding the children who might fit into the academically stringent public schools? These schools all have entrance tests, but they will not be able to use these tests to deny placements to qualified children. The catch will be defining “qualified!” The schools will have the problem that gifted programs do—finding and serving the children who can benefit from these experiences.</p>
<p>There are also literally hundreds of tuition-charging schools of very low or questionable quality. These schools appeal to parents who cannot afford the elite schools but who are seeking upward mobility. There is a real concern that many of their tuition dollars are wasted and that, in reality, their children are not receiving good instruction. These children can employ anyone to be a teacher, and although they are supposed to deliver instruction in English, the quality of the English learned is not necessarily high. They are not closely regulated, so it is unclear how RTE will affect their enrollment and instruction.</p>
<p>RTE will also further strain government schools. The classes in these schools (which vary in quality) are very large. A class of 40 is considered normal, and many classes have 50, 60, and 70 students, and some even up to 120 students with one teacher. Technology is often limited to a chalkboard with very cheap and crumbling chalk. To further complicate the situation, the schools are all “English medium,” meaning that all instruction is delivered in English, the language of prestige. The teachers all speak English and Hindi and probably several of the “local” languages. (There are literally hundreds of regional languages, with probably 15 or 20 that are very commonly spoken and/or written.) Imagine the task of a teacher who has 60 students, many of whom do not speak either English or Hindi but only the “mother tongue” they speak at home. While the teacher might know that language, there is no guarantee that she does. This situation means that there are teachers who absolutely cannot understand a significant number of their students, and students for whom instruction is often virtually meaningless. This is ESL “in spades!”</p>

<p>“These teachers and administrators realize that a strong academic program, good as it is, may not be enough for their strongest learners.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>What a task! Gifted education is not a priority in this situation. Teachers are simply trying to do what they can with the children they can reach. They are willing to acknowledge that there are undiscovered gifts in the children in their classrooms, but understandably, they have little time (nor do they have training) for these children. In addition, “inclusion” is the word of the times in Indian education. Remember that the effects of the old British elitist system are still greatly admired yet strongly resented here. All children with special needs are included in classrooms, and there is little if anything done for special needs children; in fact, many of the few schools that had special education programs have lost them recently.</p>
<p>In the elite public schools, there is a strong interest in meeting the needs of all children, although the idea of “special” or “pullout” programs is not looked on favorably. Rather, the teachers want to know how to meet the needs of diverse learners in the classroom. They are hungry for strategies and materials that will help them do this. These teachers and administrators realize that a strong academic program, good as it is, may not be enough for their strongest learners.</p>
<p>All schools, public and government, are strongly influenced by widespread summative assessments, whether exams sponsored by the government; by associations of schools, such as the Central Board of Secondary Examinations (CBSE); the Cambridge examinations; or International Baccalaureate. Exam scores rule! They are paramount in gaining admission to Indian colleges and universities as well as qualifying for many jobs. Of course, this fact influences the mode and spirit of instruction in all schools. Juxtaposed with the examination system is another government edict—that all teachers enact “Comprehensive and Continual Evaluation” (CCE). This rule has teachers who are accustomed almost exclusively to summative evaluation to become very concerned about how to manage ongoing formative evaluation.</p>
<p>Although gifted education is not a priority in India, there are efforts in this direction. There are a few universities with a faculty member or two who are interested in giftedness. These colleagues welcomed me and helped me arrange for teacher workshops. Duke University sponsors an Indian “Talent Search.” There is great interest among the parents with whom I met to learn more about giftedness and how to find and nurture the gifts in their children. There is work for gifted educators of all kinds in India—so “think Fulbright!”</p>
