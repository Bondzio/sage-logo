<p>The field of Internet studies remains in its infancy, yet early scholarship is already vast and complex. <italic>The Handbook of Internet Studies</italic> is a helpful primer for students to situate themselves in the field. The editors attempt to distill the past twenty years of study into one comprehensive, edited text for upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses. The challenge for the book is similar to the challenge of any survey course focused on the Internet: what is and is not central to the field, and what are the most universal theories that help explore the most pressing problems?</p>
<p>The authors make clear that scholars have moved beyond the binary schemas of early research that focused on “offline” versus “online” behaviors, “the real” and the “virtual,” and the utopian versus dystopian views of the virtual world. Some scholars have characterized this early period as the “first age” of Internet studies. A “second wave” of scholarship beginning in the late 1990s emphasized more empirical analyses, and a current “third wave” often focuses on the use of the Internet in everyday life. Much of the important research now explores central questions about the Internet’s ability to help users “achieve higher degrees of emancipation and equity, build capacity, and take control over their lives as individuals and citizens” (p. 4). The conclusions of modern scholars are more nuanced than their earlier peers, recognizing that while the Internet has positively changed users’ lives in many ways, “when people need food, safe drinking water, medicine and shelter, Internet connectively does little to provide for these basic necessities” (p. 208).</p>
<p>The book is divided into three parts. Part I provides a primer on history, methods, and ethics. Barry Wellman breaks down the three waves of Internet research in the past two decades, while Maria Bakardjieva explains how different theoretical and methodological approaches have helped us better understand the Internet in everyday life. Niels Brugger discusses why Internet archiving methods are relevant to scholars and provokes readers to see how research questions and methods are often interrelated to the infrastructure and fleeting nature of Internet activities. Klaus Bruhn Jensen provides a helpful anchoring of Internet research in the context of other media research schema, and Elizabeth Buchanan examines how research ethics are affected by the unique qualities of Internet research. The breadth and quality of these chapters are generally strong and informative.</p>
<p>Parts II and III focus on “Internet and Society” and “Internet and Culture,” respectively. The distinctions here seem forced and unclear at times, and the seventeen chapters cover sometimes narrow and disparate topics. This is a weakness as well as strength. Readers are introduced to areas of study of which they may be unfamiliar. Still, some major topics go unaddressed, such as the effects of the Internet on political campaigning and elections or the Internet’s effects on cognitive behaviors.</p>
<p>Topics under the “Internet and Society” umbrella include impact on language, Internet and legal policy, online political discussions, international empowerment, health communications, religion, indigenous peoples, and gender and sexuality. The chapters provide varying degrees of anchoring in interdisciplinary theory. Some cover very broad terrain, such as Sandra Braman’s discussion of Internet policy, which touches on a variety of international and technical regulatory schemes. Braman notes in brief what she considers the “big four” issues of regulation: access to the Internet, access to content, property rights, and privacy.</p>
<p>Naomi S. Baron’s chapter on language examines how online and mobile devices have affected traditional writing and invites research into whether and how users differentiate their language patterns depending on the technology. And the chapter focusing on gender and sexuality is such a broad treatise on sexuality, gender, identity, and community that at times it struggles to stay focused on the Internet. In contrast, other chapters are more focused in specific case studies, such as Deborah Wheeler’s descriptions of international Internet development projects and their abilities to combat the “digital divide.” And some chapters seem outdated, a common hazard of many textbooks. For example, the chapter on political discussion online draws largely on examples from before 2006 and focuses primarily on how to moderate political discussions that advance participation. It does not address some of the more recent, and revolutionary, effects of electoral politics and campaign strategy.</p>
<p>In Part III, chapters focusing on “Internet and Culture” discuss topics such as children, games, social networks, media industries, pornography, and music. The goal of these chapters, according to the editors, is to examine the online “practices, artifacts, and elements we can celebrate, and that can challenge us” (p. 303). Some of the strongest chapters focus on the psychological and social effects on community and identity that Internet interactions have had, as well as the importance of studying the benefits and risks of individuals replacing the “real” with the “virtual.”</p>
<p>While a few chapters feel outdated and somewhat disparate in depth and breadth, each chapter provides an overview of a specific area of Internet studies, giving readers exposure to a wide variety of theories, foundational scholarly work, research problems, and possible research approaches. The book would be a strong candidate for an introductory course on Internet studies for both undergraduates and graduate students, as it provides accessible entry points into the history, issues, and approaches in the field.</p>
