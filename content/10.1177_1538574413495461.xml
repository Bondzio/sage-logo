<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Complex aortic disease (aneurysm and dissection) can today be treated with endovascular techniques. However, the risk of harming the spinal cord circulation due to coverage of vital arteries with this procedure is enhanced, risking the development of spinal cord ischemia (SCI) and paraplegia.<sup>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>The patients were recruited at a tertiary vascular unit with a primary catchment population of 2.5 million inhabitants (www.scb.se). From the operation planning program (ORBIT), it was found that 658 operations for aortoiliacal aneurysms or dissections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574413495461">Figure 1</xref>) were performed between January 1, 2009 and July 25, 2012. These patients were cross-checked with the local database and the patient registration system, PaSiS, for patients undergoing endovascular repair of aortic disease and postoperatively treated at the intensive care unit (ICU) with CSF drainage. One patient refused to undergo CSF drainage therapy, and 2 patients were chosen to be observed clinically at the ICU instead of CSF drainage therapy to avoid potentially complicated infectious conditions due to the presence of a concomitant ventriculoperitoneal shunt and a septic state, respectively. These 3 patients were excluded from analysis. Documentation was gathered from Region Skåne Melior journal system including scanned charts of the blood pressure measurements during anesthesia, and the data were inserted in a database and analyzed by SPSS (version 17.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois) data program.</p>

<title>Cerebrospinal Fluid Drainage and Prevention of SCI</title>
<p>Recommendations for CSF drainage, when treated with endovascular technique for pathology of the aorta such as dissection and aneurysm, are applied on a selective group of patients. Planned CSF drainage insertion is more likely to be considered if several of the factors stated below are present: more than 20 cm of thoracic aorta is covered with stent grafts, earlier operation on infrarenal aorta, and impaired collateral blood flow to the spinal cord due to coverage of the left subclavian artery or the internal iliacal arteries. In clinical practice, the vascular surgeon decides whether CSF drainage insertion is indicated and the anesthetist performs the insertion of the drain. On-demand CSF drainage insertions are performed when the patient has clinical signs of SCI postoperatively, or there is a suspicion of SCI. The CSF drainage catheters (16-gauge spinal catheter = 1.29 mm in diameter) are inserted after puncture at the L3 to L4 levels and advanced approximately 5 cm in the lumbar subarachnoidal space. Patients with CSF drainages are observed at the ICU with the CSF drainage system (Medex; Smith Medical, Grasbrunn, Germany) on continuous drainage so that the pressure in the spinal canal is held under 11 mm Hg, for 48 hours, and the blood pressure is monitored so that mean arterial pressure (MAP)—the spinal canal pressure should be held over 80 mm Hg. If neurologic deficits appear despite a properly working drainage, perfusion pressure is raised by increasing MAP to over 90 mm Hg.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1538574413495461">
<title>Classification of Severity of SCI</title>
<p>Patients were classified into 6 groups after occurrence of the neurological deficits in relation to start of the endovascular procedure; preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, the deficits presented between 2 and 12 hours, between &gt;12 and 24 hours, between &gt;1 and 3 days, or after &gt;3 days or more. Extent of SCI was based on the extent of neurological , that is, deficit in 1 leg, 2 legs, or 2 legs and the autonomic innervation of the urinary bladder and/or intestines. Neurological deficits were registered at in-hospital discharge as transient or if deficits went in partial or no regression as permanent.</p>

<sec id="section6-1538574413495461">
<title>Electrocardiography</title>
<p>Evidence of preoperative myocardial ischemia (electrocardiogram [ECG] ischemia) were defined as the presence of pathological Q/QS patterns suggestive of previous myocardial infarction, deep or moderate T-wave inversion, ST-segment depression, or complete left bundle branch block.<sup>

<sec id="section7-1538574413495461">
<title>Echocardiography</title>
<p>Preoperative transthoracic echocardiographic examinations were usually carried out with Sonos 2500 or Sonons 5500 (Philips, Eindhoven, the Netherlands). Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was assessed visually.<sup>

<title>Evaluation of Renal Function</title>
<p>In accordance with the Cockroft-Gault formula, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated—comprising serum creatinine, age, weight, and gender.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574413495461">11</xref>
</sup> Stages of chronic kidney disease were determined by GFR levels set by the National Kidney Foundation guidelines<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574413495461">12</xref>
</sup>: stage I was defined as GFR &gt;90 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (normal or increased GFR), stage II as GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (minute decrease in GFR), stage III as GFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (moderate decrease in GFR), stage IV as GFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (substantial decrease in GFR), and stage V as GFR &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (end-stage renal disease in need of dialysis).</p>

<sec id="section9-1538574413495461">
<title>Spirometry</title>
<p>Spirometry was performed in accordance with standards set by the European Respiratory Society.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574413495461">13</xref>
</sup> The majority of the spirometries were performed using the spirometer (Microlab 3000, CareFusion Health, Hoechberg, Germany or EasyOne, NicheMedical, North Sydney, Australia) under the supervision of a physiotherapist (mini-spirometry), measuring forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and forced vital capacity (FVC). The FEV<sub>1</sub>% was defined as FEV<sub>1</sub> in relation to predicted normal FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC% as FVC in relation to predicted normal FVC.<sup>

</sup> The presence and severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were graded in accordance with the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Diseases guidelines.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538574413495461">16</xref>
</sup> The COPD was present if FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &lt; 70% (age &lt; 65) or FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &lt; 65% (age ≥ 65). Stage 1 (mild) was defined as FEV<sub>1</sub> ≥ 80% of predicted value, stage 2 (moderate) as FEV<sub>1</sub> ≥ 50% to &lt; 80%, stage 3 (severe) as FEV<sub>1</sub> ≥ 30% to &lt; 50%, and stage 4 (very severe) as FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt; 30% of predicted value. Preoperative spirometry was performed in 43 (52%) of the 83 patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1538574413495461">
<title>The Endovascular Procedure</title>
<p>Planned operations were performed under general anesthesia, whereas acute or ruptured cases were mainly performed under local anesthesia to avoid a decrease in blood pressure during the induction period of general anesthesia, until deployment of stent graft had occurred. In ruptured cases, permissive hypotension was used pre- and intraoperatively to avoid rebleeding or exacerbation of bleeding. When the aneurysm/dissection had been endovascularly excluded, the systemic blood pressure was often elevated to maintain a stable MAP ≥ 80 mm Hg.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1538574413495461">
<title>Follow-Up</title>
<p>All patients were monitored from the day of EVAR until day of death or June 25, 2012. Median time of follow-up was 15 months (interquartile range [IQR] 6-26). Mortality data were retrieved from the Swedish Population Registry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1538574413495461">
<title>Other Definitions</title>
<p>Paraparesis (partial paralysis) was defined as weakness, whereas paraplegia was defined as total (motor or sensory) paralysis of the lower extremities. Occurrence of intraoperative circulatory instability during anesthesia was defined as a &gt;30 mm Hg fall in systolic blood pressure after the induction period of anesthesia. Hypertension was defined as a patient on antihypertensive medication or a previous diagnosis of hypertension. Cerebrovascular disease was defined as a patient who had stroke (cerebral bleeding or infarction) or transient ischemic attack. In patients with a history of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary angioplasty, ischemic heart disease were noted. Diabetes mellitus was noted if the patients were on any form of antidiabetic treatment (diet, oral hypoglycemic agents, or insulin). Anemia was defined as hemoglobin &lt;134 g/L in men, and &lt;117 g/L in women. Both current and former smokers were classified as smokers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1538574413495461">
<title>Statistical Methods</title>
<p>SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc) was used for data managing and statistical analysis. The investigation was performed on an intention to treat basis. Continuous variables were expressed in median and IQR. Correlations were analyzed by the Spearman rank test and expressed with the Spearman correlation coefficient. Univariable and multivariable binary logistic regression and Cox regression analysis were performed to evaluate the risk factors for SCI and midterm mortality, respectively, and expressed as odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), respectively. <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was considered as significant.</p>

<title>Patient Characteristics</title>
<p>In all, 88 CSF drainage procedures/84 operations/83 patients were identified. One patient was treated with 2 endovascular procedures, and 4 patients had underwent 2 attempts of separate CSF catheter insertions at the same in-hospital stay. Median age of the 83 patients was 69 years (IQR 64-74), and 26% were women. The patients had the following aortic diseases: thoracic dissection, type B (n = 13, 16%), thoracic aortic aneurysm (n = 23, 28%), thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA; n = 38, 46%), juxta-renal aortic aneurysm (n = 6, 7%), and infrarenal aortic aneurysm (n = 2, 2%). One patient was treated for both a thoracic and an infrarenal aortic aneurysm at the same time. The TAAA was classified as type I (n = 5), type II (n = 13), type III (n = 10), and type IV (n = 10) aneurysms. The indications for therapy were aortic aneurysm (76%), dissection (16%), and pseudo-aneurysm (8%). Ten patients had ruptured aorta due to thoracic aneurysm (n = 3), TAAA type I (n = 2), TAAA type II (n = 1), TAAA type III (n = 1), TAAA type IV (n = 1), dissection type B (n = 1), and thoracic aortic pseudoaneurysm (n = 1).

<title>Preoperative Placed CSF Drainage in Relation to SCI</title>
<p>Of 75 patients, 22 developed SCI even though spinal drainage was placed preoperative as planned. Among the preoperatively placed CSF drainage system, 10 of these CSF drainage systems were in need of adjustment, such as flushing of the drainage system, and in 12, the CSF drainage system were nonfunctioning. Four CSF drainage systems were prematurely terminated. Among those 22 patients that had SCI, the CSF drainage systems were found to be functioning, with or without the need of flushing of the system, in 17 patients and nonfunctioning in 5 patients.</p>

<title>Postoperatively Placed CSF Drainage in Relation to SCI</title>
<p>After 9 operations, on-demand insertion of CSF drainage due to onset of neurological deficits in the lower limb after operation, 3 responded with partial regression of neurological symptoms, 1 with nonfunctioning CSF drainage responded with full reg-ression of neurological deficits after a carotid-subclavian artery bypass, and in 1, the deficits went in full regression even though the CSF drainage was noted to be nonfunctioning. In 1 patient with a nonfunctioning CSF drainage, the symptoms went in full regression even though the patient’s symptoms later on were found out to be caused by an epidural hematoma with neurological deficits. Three patient’s paresis did not go in regression, despite an unremarkable function of the CSF drainage system.</p>

<title>Complications After Start of CSF Drainage</title>
<p>In all, 88 attempts of CSF drainage insertions were performed in 83 patients. Bloody CSF in the drain was detected in 18 (20%) patients. Five serious complications, postspinal headache excluded, occurred: meningitis and epidural hematoma requiring laminectomy were found in 1 and 1 patient, respectively. Subdural hematoma was found in 2 patients, 1 requiring neurosurgical operation, and 1 had spontaneous regression of the hematoma. One patient underwent 2 attempts of CSF drainage insertion procedures, complicated by an iatrogenic spinal cord injury at the level of TH IX/X with motor and sensory deficits in the right leg. Postspinal headache was found in 4 patients, lasting for 4 to 5 days in-hospital. One patient was treated with an epidural blood patch with good effect. Subarachnoidal blood was found accidentally on computed tomography (CT) of the brain in 6 patients investigated for confusion (n = 1) and focal neurological deficits that turned out to be caused by peroperative cerebral infarction (n = 2) and spinal ischemia (n = 3), and in 5 of the 6 patients, macroscopic bloody CSF at the catheter exit site was reported.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Attempts of CSF drainage insertion was performed perioperatively in 84 (12.8%) of the 658 operations for aortic disease. Among 29 patients with SCI, 9 patients received CSF drainages postoperatively as a means of therapy for an already developed SCI, whereas 20 received prophylactic CSF drainage preoperatively. Hence, CSF drainage insertion was performed in a highly selected group of patients, and none of the other 574 operations for aortic disease were complicated by SCI. Nevertheless, almost all patients with TAAA underwent a CSF drainage placement procedure during the study period, and the study cohort provides useful insights into the complications after attempts of CSF drainage insertions and the clinical course of those developing SCI, a known devastating complication to reconstructive surgery when dealing with the most complex and extensive aortic diseases such as TAAA, type II.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574413495461">17</xref>
</sup> The occurrence of intraoperative circulatory instability was found to be an even more significant factor for the development of SCI in the present study than endovascular treatment of TAAA, type II. The importance to monitor the systemic blood pressure and dynamics during the perioperative period very carefully has been emphasized.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574413495461">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574413495461">19</xref>
</sup> Apart from CSF drainage and pharmacological elevation of MAP, protection against spinal cord morbidity included carotid subclavian artery bypass to improve blood flow to the spinal arteries through the left vertebral artery, in case of stent graft coverage of the left subclavian artery. The effects of each of these therapies are not possible to measure in the absence of control groups. In addition, the existence of major complications, such as meningitis, epidural, and subdural hematoma, and the relative high frequency of catheter dysfunction were major drawbacks of CSF drainage treatment. The documented high-technical failure rate of CSF drainage treatment was worrisome and might have had an influence on the high rate of SCI. If the rate of technical failure depends on the level of experience or learning curves of the CSF drainage placements among the anesthesiologists or poor documentation of technical failures in previous retrospective studies are uncertain. Hence, close team collaboration between vascular surgeons and anesthesiologists’ seems to be of utmost importance for the management of these challenging patients.</p>
<p>The finding of blood within the subarachnoidal space in the brain was a puzzling finding among the patients that underwent evaluation of the brain with a CT scan. This finding was likely caused by circulation of the bloody CSF from the lumbar puncture site to the subarachnoidal space within the brain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538574413495461">20</xref>
</sup> In none of these patients with detected subarachnoidal blood at CT scan could this bleeding, retrospectively, be explained by the symptoms for which the patient was investigated for in the first place, leaving these findings to be considered as accidental ones. Similarly, the majority of patients with bloody CSF in a large review were found to be asymptomatic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538574413495461">20</xref>
</sup> However, if the CSF was transparent at the start of drainage and then becomes bloody, it may be a sign of subarachnoidal hemorrhage originating from the brain, and it may be wise to stop CSF drainage, stop and reverse any anticoagulation therapy, and perform CT of the brain.</p>
<p>The occurrence of 2 subdural hematomas seemed, on the other hand, to be associated with CSF drainage and possibly facilitated by the anticoagulation treatment that always takes place during these complex endovascular procedures. The rapid evacuation of CSF in a short period of time is a documented risk factor for a subdural hematoma. In the absence of SCI, 10 mL/h CSF drainage has been recommended, whereas a more rapid drainage may be necessary in case of SCI. Drainage of larger amounts of CSF leads to intracranial hypotension,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538574413495461">21</xref>
</sup> caudal displacement of the brain with cerebellar tonsillar sagging, and enlargement of the dural venous sinuses. The caudal brain displacement creates tension on the enlarged venous sinuses and predisposes to tears of bridging dural veins and development of subdural hematoma.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1538574413495461">22</xref>
</sup> Mortality of acute subdural hematoma in patients undergoing thoracic aortic repair have been reported to be high, 40%<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538574413495461">23</xref>
</sup> to 60%<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538574413495461">20</xref>
</sup>. Withdrawal of the CSF drainage, if not already done, and emergent treatment with an epidural blood patch, may be considered as a mini-invasive conservative therapy option alternative to neurosurgical operation, to immediately stop the CSF leakage, increase intracranial pressure, and prevent further expansion of the subdural hematoma.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1538574413495461">24</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The analysis of extensiveness of neurological deficits or eventual regression of symptoms in relation to time after endovascular therapy showed that SCI leading to neurological deficits in only 1 leg was reversible, and all these patients seemed to have recovered completely at discharge. Patients with the most extensive neurological deficit seemed, as expected, to have the worst short-term prognosis. Most neurological deficits due to SCI were noted 1 to 24 hours postoperative. Delayed onset of SCI seems to occur more frequently after endovascular therapy, whereas immediate onset of SCI seems to occur more frequently after open surgery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574413495461">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The likelihood of developing SCI increases if the left subclavian artery is covered and if perioperative hypotension episodes occur.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574413495461">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574413495461">19</xref>
</sup> In a recent report, a risk stratifying model hypothesized that there were 4 independently vascular territories supplying blood to the spinal cord, namely the left subclavian, intercostal, lumbar, and hypogastric arteries and that extensive coverage of only 1 territory, the intercostal arteries, by TEVAR alone, especially without the occurrence of prolonged intraoperative hypotension, not seems to be sufficient enough to induce SCI.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574413495461">19</xref>
</sup> In elective procedures, carotid-left subclavian artery bypass may preferably be performed as a stage 1 procedure, prior to the main endovascular procedure at stage II.</p>
<p>Anemia, chronic kidney disease stage ≥ 3, and COPD ≥ 3 were all associated with increased midterm mortality, a trend for EF &lt; 55%, which emphasis the importance of thorough preoperative examinations with echocardiography and spirometry in elective patients prior to advanced endovascular therapy of aortic disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1538574413495461">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538574413495461"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1538574413495461">27</xref>
</sup> Even though more than half of the operations in the study were classified as acute, 60% of all patients underwent preoperative echocardiography, indicating that a number of the acutely treated patients in fact were asymptomatic, allowing time for the same workup as the elective patients.</p>
<p>The limitations of the study are attributed to the retrospective design and lack of control group without CSF drainage, but prospective study among patients admitted with emergency vascular diseases are notoriously extremely difficult to study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1538574413495461">28</xref>
</sup> It was possible to study intraoperative blood pressure, whereas it would have been necessary to have a prospective protocol to reliably study postoperative variations of blood pressure in relation to the occurrence of SCI. The relatively small sample size makes multivariable testing of more than 2 variables inappropriate.</p>
<p>In conclusion, intraoperative blood pressure should be controlled meticulously to avoid SCI. Patients treated for a TAAA, type II, had a very high risk of SCI, and the occurrence of serious complications and catheter dysfunction after CSF drainage insertions, are limitation factors when considering advanced endovascular therapy. Long-term clinical follow-up studies in patients with SCI are warranted.</p>
