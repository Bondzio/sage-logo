<abstract>
<p>The current study explored a new musical trend, “Tearful Oriental Songs” (TOS), which are associated with social marginality. The participants were 313 high school students who completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory and a survey on their attitudes toward TOS. They then listened to 14 oriental songs and TOS, and were asked to decide whether each song was a TOS or not, to score the song’s familiarity and likeability, and to choose words they associate with the song. Adolescents who were familiar with TOS differentiated between TOS and common oriental songs (OS), reported coming from an oriental ethnic origin and living in development areas, and were more prevalent in earlier grades. Musical analysis demonstrated that TOS have characteristics which resemble Turkish Arabesk songs. Analysis of associations supported this conclusion. Participants reported mood improvement after listening to TOS. No significant difference in depression was found between adolescents who listen and those who do not listen to TOS. TOS can be considered a genre, which reflects Arabic cultural influences on the Israeli culture. It may also be regarded as a musical remedy for adolescents from the lower classes, and can be used as a therapeutic means by music therapists.</p>

<p>Israel is an immigration state for Jews from all over the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0305735611425905">Okun, 1996</xref>). It is a simmering melting pot in which old and new cultures and traditions collide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0305735611425905">Landis &amp; Bhagat, 1996</xref>). Its cultural heritage is influenced by traditions that have developed in Western Europe, as well as in Arabic countries. The variety of cultures in Israel is also reflected in the country’s music. There are genres of Israeli songs written according to the laws of Western music and genres which are reminiscent of Arabic music. A new style of oriental melancholic songs has gained popularity among some Israeli adolescents during the last decade. Most Israelis consider these songs, which are named <italic>tearful oriental songs</italic> (TOS or <italic>Shire Dikaon</italic> in Hebrew, which means depressive songs), to be an extreme version of Israeli oriental music (<italic>Musica Mizrachit</italic> in Hebrew). TOS are becoming more widespread, but are nonetheless not part of the Israeli musical mainstream. Most of them cannot be purchased in regular stores. They can, however, be downloaded illegally from the Internet, or be purchased in shops in central bus stations. The present study will describe this style of songs, characterise it as a genre; portray the sociodemographic profile of its fans, and elaborate on the psychological functions these songs fulfil for adolescents.</p>

<title>Adolescence and music</title>
<p>Music plays an important role in the formation of personal identity, and in strengthening sociocultural ties along the entire life cycle, particularly during adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0305735611425905">Tarrant, North, &amp; Hargreaves, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0305735611425905">Tekman &amp; Hortacsu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0305735611425905">Te’Neil Lloyd, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0305735611425905">Zillman &amp; Gan, 1997</xref>). The number of publications in the music therapy literature which focus on adolescents has been growing during the last four decades, starting with 11 in the 1970s; 25 in the 1980s, 37 in the 1990s, and already 67 in the 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0305735611425905">McFerran, 2010</xref>). The ease by which music can nowadays be available for listening almost everywhere, and at all times, and the ability of adolescents to rapidly adjust to new technologies, make the use of music an integral part of adolescents’ daily activities. Before the invention of the MP3 technology, the typical adolescent dedicated an average of 2–3 hours a day to music (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0305735611425905">Larson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735611425905">North, Hargreaves, &amp; O’Neill, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0305735611425905">Zillman &amp; Gan, 1997</xref>). Nowadays, on average, an American adolescent listens to music 2.34 hr per day, but this does not include the amount of time the adolescent is exposed to music via music videos, games, laptops, and television (an estimation of 10.45 hr a day), and does not consider the fact that 43% of the adolescents listen to music most of the time they are using each medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0305735611425905">Roberts, Foehr, &amp; Rideout, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Music is regarded as fulfilling several psychological functions in adolescence. A meta-analysis of previous literature on the psychological meaning of music for adolescents revealed four categories: identity, agency, interpersonal relationship, and emotional field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0305735611425905">Saarikallio, 2007</xref>). Music was found to reconstruct conceptions of self, to increase experiences of control, competency and self-esteem, to have the power to meet adolescents’ needs for self-actualization, to enhance the development of their individual and cultural identity, to reinforce their sense of social belonging to a peer group, and to regulate their emotions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0305735611425905">Bogt, Mulder, Raaijmakers, &amp; Gabhainn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735611425905">Laiho, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735611425905">North et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0305735611425905">Russell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0305735611425905">Schwartz &amp; Fouts, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0305735611425905">Tarrant et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0305735611425905">Zillman &amp; Gan, 1997</xref>). Songs can regulate mood by means of lyrics and melodic structures, and function as a mood regulator for adolescents prone to mood changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0305735611425905">Bakagiannis &amp; Tarrant, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0305735611425905">Bogt et al., 2011</xref>). For example, many adolescents prefer mourning and depressive love songs in situations of romantic separation, and tend to listen to euphoric love songs when they fall in love (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735611425905">Laiho, 2004</xref>). Many musical preferences enable the psychological processing of contents and values orientation which preoccupy adolescents, such as equality, self-respect, love, relationships/friendships, wealth, and religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0305735611425905">Boer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0305735611425905">North &amp; Hargreaves, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0305735611425905">Selfhout, Branje, Bogt, &amp; Meeus, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0305735611425905">Wells &amp; Hakanen, 1991</xref>). Music was also found to regulate three elements of emotions in adolescents, namely, to improve their mood, to focus them on their inner feelings, and sometimes even to help them to increase their understanding of their thoughts and motives over their experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0305735611425905">Saarikallio, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>There are also several styles of music that adolescents listen to, which has been related to problematic symptoms and behaviours in adolescence. For example, hip-hop, rap, rock, heavy metal, and even pop are sometimes referred to in literature as a form of “problem music,” which is associated with a propensity toward delinquent acts, use of illegal drugs, less parental monitoring, more problems in school (see review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735611425905">North &amp; Hargreaves, 2008</xref>), and increased depression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0305735611425905">Martin, Clarke, &amp; Pearce, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0305735611425905">Miranda &amp; Claes, 2009</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735611425905">North and Hargreaves (2008)</xref> such accusations already appeared during the 1950s and 1960s toward pop and rock singers and bands in the USA (e.g., Dean Martin and Elvis Presley), and in the UK (e.g., The Beatles).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these rebellious musical styles also serve as a lever for social change, and it is possible that while they enable frustrated minorities a social–artistic outlet for social frustration, they also serve as a way for the young generation to support melting-pot processes and shape the cultural taste of future generations by eventually gaining popularity among the institutionalised majority. A support for this argument may be found in the development of hip hop in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0305735611425905">Herbet &amp; Campbell, 2000</xref>), in the new interest expressed in South Africa in what was once considered as music of minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0305735611425905">Folkestad, 2002</xref>), and in the increasing interest of Israeli adolescents in TOS, a style of music considered as the extreme marker of <italic>Musica Mizrachit</italic>.</p>

<sec id="section3-0305735611425905">
<title>Oriental songs and TOS as a periscope for social change</title>
<p>In general, many Israeli-Western songs are based on Western music, and are viewed as representing Western Israelis’ ethnicity (Jews who immigrated to Israel from European and Western countries) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0305735611425905">Amir, 1997</xref>). In contradistinction, Israeli-Oriental songs (<italic>Musica Mizrachit</italic>), a genre that mixes pop and rock instrumentation and influences with East Mediterranean, North African, and Middle Eastern traditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0305735611425905">Regev, 2007</xref>), was viewed as representing the Oriental Israelis’ ethnicity (Jews who immigrated to Israel from Arabic, Asian and North African countries) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735611425905">Regev, 2000</xref>). When Israel was founded, Jews who had immigrated from Europe and Western countries (<italic>Ashkenazim</italic>) treated those who immigrated from Arab and North African countries (<italic>Mizrachim</italic>) only a few years after them with suspicion, neglect and disesteem, and considered themselves to be descendants of superior cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0305735611425905">Lissak, 1999</xref>). This cultural tension was prominent in the attitudes towards <italic>Musica Mizrachit</italic>. Until the late 1970s, <italic>Musica Mizrachit</italic> was regarded as inferior music and was avoided by radio and TV channels. In 1977, the right-wing Likud Party, which was largely elected by working-class Mizrachi Jews, came to power. This event empowered them politically for the first time since the mass immigration of the 1950s. Since then, public attention was directed to <italic>Musica Mizrachit</italic>, and oriental Jews began to express their ethnicity with pride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735611425905">Regev &amp; Seroussi, 2004</xref>). This genre of music was labeled “Mediterranean music,” in order to differentiate it from Arab music. This new label enabled the founders of this genre to avoid the tendency of Western Israelis to confuse them with Arabs, and preserve their recognition as Israelis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735611425905">Regev &amp; Seroussi, 2004</xref>). The genre was initially influenced by Greek, Arabic, or Turkish popular music, but later (during the 1990s) combined diverse forms of rock and mainstream popular music, and was no longer associated with oriental Israelis. This, however, is not yet the case with TOS.</p>
<p>TOS evolved as a variation of <italic>Musica Mizrachit</italic>. In Arabic it is termed <italic>Eebcshi</italic>, which means “tearful.” This style of music is considered as the extreme marker of <italic>Musica Mizrachit</italic>. It cannot be found in institutionalised music stores and has to date been examined in only one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735611425905">Horesh, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735611425905">Horesh (2006)</xref> describes this type of music as one of four types of music (i.e., heavy rock, hip hop, techno, and TOS) which drug addicts reportedly listen to when consuming drugs. She notes that TOS were specifically associated with a depressive mood, evoked identification with the lyrics of the songs, triggered emotions of self-pity and raised memories connected to the absence of self-esteem.</p>
<p>TOS are an integral part of their singers’ biographical movies. These singers grew up in neighbourhoods of low socioeconomic level and were exposed to poverty and crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735611425905">Banai, 2004</xref>). The movies tell the story of the singers, and the songs which accompany the developing plot always touch dramatic, sentimental, and tragic contents such as death, crime, drugs, romantic relations, and broken hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735611425905">Banai, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The type of songs that TOS represent can be identified with an Arabic identity, since they are characterised by many Arabic elements (mainly Turkish) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735611425905">Regev &amp; Seroussi, 2004</xref>). Since these songs are connected to the oriental origin of many of their listeners (Arabic), they may support their cultural identity. However, being identified as a TOS admirer today reconstructs the equation of the 1970s (being identified as a <italic>Musica Mizrachit</italic> admirer equals having an Arabic and not Jewish identity). Therefore, while being a TOS admirer can support the oriental cultural identity of many Jewish adolescents, it can also cause them social embarrassment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0305735611425905">
<title>The current study</title>
<p>As noted previously, TOS were reported as one kind of music among others, which are listened to under conditions of drug injection and drug sniffing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735611425905">Horesh, 2006</xref>), but have never been taken seriously enough to be studied as a particular musical genre favoured by healthy adolescents. This lack of knowledge justifies the current exploratory study. The present study has four objectives: (a) to examine whether TOS can be defined as a specific musical genre, (b) to find out whether there are distinctive sociodemographic characteristics of adolescents who listen to these songs, (c) to understand the social and psychological functions that TOS fulfil for adolescents, (d) to examine the regulatory impact of TOS on adolescents who listen to these songs and to find out whether TOS listeners are more depressive than adolescents who do not listen to them.</p>
<p>Semiopen interviews with four experts on TOS (two adolescents who adherently listen to TOS, and two female music therapists who use TOS in their psychotherapeutic interventions) were conducted in order to examine whether TOS can be defined as a specific musical genre. The experts provided a list of 14 <italic>Mizrachi</italic> songs: seven TOS and seven non-TOS. A sample of 313 adolescents from three high schools listened to the 14 songs and were asked to decide whether each song was a TOS or a non-TOS. A comparative musical analysis was then conducted on the songs and on the associations raised by these songs. The second objective, that is, understanding the main sociodemographic characteristics of adolescents who listen to TOS, was attained by collecting participants’ sociodemographic data. In order to achieve the third aim of the study, which was to identify the social and psychological functions that TOS fulfil for adolescents, the participants completed a survey on their attitudes toward TOS, and answered several questions pertaining to the associations and emotions they experience while listening to these songs (the survey was formulated according to the information derived from the semistructured interviews with the four experts). Finally, the participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0305735611425905">Beck et al., 1961</xref>) and were asked about their mood before and after listening to TOS in order to study the connection between depression and listening to TOS and to discover the regulatory functions of TOS on their fans.</p>

<p>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0305735611425905">Beck et al., 1961</xref>) was used to compare depression scores of adolescents who listen and do not listen to TOS. The BDI contains 21 items that refer to emotional, cognitive, behavioural, and physical symptoms consistent with depression. Answers were mapped on a scale from 0 = nonexistent to 3 = very serious. Some typical items are “I do not feel like a failure”; “I feel I have failed more than the average person”; “I feel I have accomplished very little that is worthwhile or that means anything”; “As I look back on my life, all I can see is a lot of failures”; “I feel I am a complete failure as a person.” The Hebrew version of the questionnaire has a Cronbach’s α reliability coefficient of 0.76 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0305735611425905">Landau &amp; York, 2004</xref>).

It consisted of one item which identified TOS fans (i.e., “I listen to TOS”), several items which examined social and cultural connotations raised by TOS (e.g., “TOS are linked with social protest,” “TOS are connected to oriental pride,” “I am familiar with Avi Bitter’s<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0305735611425905">1</xref></sup> movies”), a few items which referred to buying and listening habits (e.g., “I download TOS from the Internet,” “I prefer listening to TOS when I’m alone”), items which describe attitudes towards lyrics and music in TOS (e.g., “While listening to TOS I mainly listen to the lyrics”), and items about the attitudes of the adolescents’ family members towards TOS (e.g., “My parents do not like it when I listen to TOS”). The participants’ responses were rated according to the extent to which they agree with each statement.</p>

<title>Song excerpts</title>
<p>A musical track containing seven typical TOS and seven typical non-TOS Oriental Songs (OS) was edited for the present study. About 1 min of each song was sampled. It included the instrumental introduction of the songs, the songs’ first verse, and at least the first part of the songs’ chorus. The track included a total of 14 min of songs and 5 seconds of breaks between songs, arranged in three randomised orders.</p>

<title>Suggested Associations Form (SAF)</title>
<p>A list of 13 words and expressions was presented to the respondents. Participants were asked to indicate the extent to which each of the words was associated with TOS. This method and other variations of this method were used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0305735611425905">Bodner &amp; Gilboa, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735611425905">Gilboa &amp; Bodner, 2009</xref>). Responses were given on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = no association at all to 7 = very strong association). The 13 themes included: separation, despair, pain, disappointed love, disappointment, drugs, jail, hope, assistance from a friend, encouragement, and love. These contents were mentioned by the four experts who were interviewed during the preliminary phase of the study.</p>
<p>The SAF was presented to the participants while they listened to each of the 14 songs. The participants were asked to circle associations that each song evoked. In this case we simplified the measurement method (i.e., used a forced-choice measurement), and excluded two items, in order to make the SAF less demanding.</p>

<title>Familiarity and their liking scales</title>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The experiment was approved by the institutional review board of the Israeli Ministry of Education, and was carried out in three different high schools in the centre and northern part of Israel. The experiment was conducted in 10 classes, in groups of 25–35 participants. All the parents signed a consent form for their children’s participation in the experiment. The first phase of the study lasted 40 min, during which the participants completed the BDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0305735611425905">Beck et al., 1961</xref>), the attitudes survey toward TOS, the open questionnaire (on their mood before and after listening to these songs), and the sociodemographic questionnaire. The questionnaires were collected by the experimenter. The second phase of the study, which lasted 20 min, then took place without any pause. The experimenter explained to the participants that several songs would be played aloud and that they should decide whether each song is a TOS or a non-TOS, score the familiarity and their liking of each song on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much), and choose words which are relevant to each song from a list of words. They were asked to do so while the song was being played. The CD was then played without interruption. TOS samples were played in mixed order with non-TOS tracks. After returning the forms, the participants received an explanation of the purpose of the experiment and the experimenter answered their questions.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735611425905">Table 2</xref> it can be seen that eight songs (the bold figures in the third column) were identified by the participants as TOS, and five (the bold figures in the fourth column) as non-TOS. One song (“Alone”) which was considered by the four interviewees as non-TOS, was categorized by TOS listeners as a TOS, and one song (“Inta Omri”) was considered by almost half of TOS listeners as TOS and by a similar percentage as a non-TOS. As expected, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735611425905">Table 2</xref> also shows a very high rate of categorical agreement between the participants regarding the decision (TOS and non-TOS), and goodness of fit was therefore not confirmed for all the songs. The fact that the listeners significantly distinguished between TOS and OS in 13 out of the 14 songs, and that these evaluations were repeated across the three sequential orders, supports the argument that TOS can be regarded as a specific musical genre.</p>
<p>An explanatory factor analysis with varimax rotation was conducted on the SAF (i.e., the Suggested Association Form in which participants were asked to indicate the extent to which each expression was associated with TOS). This factor analysis yielded four factors that explained 79.84% of the variance. The findings of this analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0305735611425905">Table 3</xref>.</p>

<p>The first factor (four items) represented negative criminal aspects (pain, despair, drugs, jail) and was labelled antisocial (α = 0.90). Items which associated with the second factor (four items) represent interpersonal support (hope, help from a friend, enhancement, love). This factor was labelled support (α = 0.83). Items which associated with the third factor (four items) represent distress and suffering (separation, disappointment, broken heart, despair). This factor was labelled agony (α = 0.93). Items which associated with the fourth factor (two items) represent ethno-musical aspects (Arabic music, Turkish music). This factor was labelled ethno-music (α = 0.87). The SAF thus yielded four separate scores which were grouped by the explanatory factor analysis according to the themes described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735611425905">Horesh, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The musical analysis of the songs focused on four musical characteristics: (a) the composer; (b) the instrumental introduction (prolonged or short), (c) the musical scales: minor, major, Makam-Kurdi (a kind of Turkish Makam), (d) and the speed of the beat (slow, fast). As can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0305735611425905">Table 4</xref>, the tune of three TOS songs and only one OS has a folk Turkish origin. This may allude to the connection between Turkish music and TOS. It can also be seen that most songs (except no. 3) categorised as TOS and almost none of the OS (except no. 5) begin with a prolonged instrumental opening. In contradistinction, the voice of the singers appears immediately when the song starts in almost all the OS (excluding no. 5). Moreover, the musical scale of all the TOS is Makam-Kurdi, and the scale in all most OS is minor (no. 5 remains an exception). Furthermore, none of the TOS use key instruments (whereas two of the OS do), all used synthesisers, and four used string instruments. We can conclude that TOS is a different musical genre based on: (a) the clear distinction and the high rate of agreement between TOS listeners on the decision of which of the songs is a TOS or an OS (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735611425905">Table 2</xref>); (b) the coherent structure of four factors yielded by the factor analysis (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0305735611425905">Table 3</xref>); (c) the common musical features which distinctively characterise TOS (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0305735611425905">Table 4</xref>). Its ethno-musical routes will be discussed in the discussion section.</p>

<title>Sociodemographic characteristics of adolescents who listen to TOS</title>
<p>We grouped the participants who agreed with the statement “I listen to TOS” (<italic>n</italic> = 56) and compared them to the other participants (those who disagreed or partially agreed with this statement, <italic>n</italic> = 257). A <italic>t</italic> test for independent samples compared between their reports on the average time span (hours per day) they listen to music, and the reports provided by the other participants in order to validate the former categorization as “TOS listeners.” Both groups reported a very high average time of listening to music. However, “TOS listeners” reported a higher average time than the other participants (<italic>M</italic> = 9.60 vs. <italic>M</italic> = 4.80). A MANOVA that compared the means of familiarity and likability of the eight TOS songs between “TOS listeners” and the other participants revealed main effects for both measures (<italic>F</italic>(7, 194) = 5.73, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, ηp<sup>2</sup>= 0.17, and <italic>F</italic>(7, 182) = 7.97, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, ηp<sup>2</sup>= 0.24, respectively), and simple main effect tests showed that “TOS listeners” reported significantly higher familiarity and likability means than the other participants (<italic>ps</italic> &lt; 0.001). It can therefore be concluded that participants who agreed with the statement “I listen to TOS” provided valid answers and can be regarded as “TOS listeners.” A comparison was then conducted on the main sociodemographic characteristics of adolescents who adherently listen to TOS and other adolescents. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0305735611425905">Table 5</xref> presents the results of the statistical analyses.</p>

<p>As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0305735611425905">Table 5</xref>, no significant differences were found between adolescents who adherently listen to TOS and other adolescents on the measures gender, religiosity, and parents’ education level. However, significant differences were found on the measures of origin, habitation, and grade. That is, most of the adolescents chose between <italic>Mizrachi</italic> and <italic>Ashkenazi</italic> origin, and only about 6% used Israeli. Most of the adolescents who adherently listen to TOS (82.9%) defined themselves as coming from Mizrachi origin, whereas almost half of the adolescents that do not listen to TOS (41.8%) defined themselves as coming from an Ashkenazi origin. Most of the adolescents who adherently listen to TOS live in development towns (71.4%), whereas about half (49.4%) of the adolescents who do not listen to TOS live in main cities (e.g., Jerusalem, Haifa) or villages (23.8%). Finally, most of the “TOS listeners” are in seventh, eighth, and ninth grade (60.4%), whereas most of those who do not listen to TOS are in tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade. In conclusion, this sociodemographic analysis demonstrates that TOS fans have typical sociodemographic characteristics. Unlike those who are not fond of listening to TOS, these adolescents define themselves as coming from a Mizrachi origin, live in development areas, and are in the earlier years of their adolescence period.</p>

<p>It can be seen that most of these adolescents (67.9%) download the songs from the Internet (Item 4), most of them (60%) were exposed to these songs in their families (Item 6), although most of them (66.7%) pay equal attention to both lyrics and melody (Item 12), more reported listening mainly to the lyrics (Item 11) than to the melody (Item 10, 66.7% vs. 37.7%, respectively), and most love the lyrics of these songs (Item 13) more than the music (Item 14, 58.2% vs. 38.5%). Half (50.9%) agreed that the voice of the singers was weepy (Item 15) and 52.9% that there is no link between TOS and the culture they believe in (Item 20), and more than half partially agreed that TOS are associated with separations (58.5%) and despair (52.9%). The respondents were familiar with most of the biographical movies of the TOS singers: 57.6% are familiar with Avi Bitter’s movies (Item 25), and 65.4% with Tamir Gal’s movies (Item 23), and many (64.0%) love the movies of Tamir Gal (Item 26). Most TOS listeners (73.6%) do not agree with the statement (“there are few adolescents who listen to TOS,” Item 29), but at the same time admit that many adolescents regard TOS as inferior songs (53.0%, Item 30). Most of the respondents (61.5%) report that they ignore what others think about TOS (Item 31). Finally, more than half (54.9%) agree that mostly adolescents listen to TOS. In conclusion, the survey shows that TOS are distributed through the Internet and that youngsters are exposed to them in their families, that they interest adolescents, are associated with the movies made on their singers’ lives which are known to the respondents, and that TOS fans are aware of the inferior social status of this music, but seem not to care about it.</p>
<p>Participants were asked to indicate the associations that crossed their mind when they listened to the songs during the second phase of the study from a list of 11 associations. A repeated measures analysis of variance that compared between the number of times an association was indicated in response to listening to TOS and to OS revealed a Type x Association interaction, <italic>F</italic>(10, 440) = 22.92, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, ηp<sup>2</sup>= 0.34, and paired samples tests revealed significant differences for all associations (excluding “help from a friend”). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0305735611425905">Table 7</xref> presents means, standard deviations, and results for each comparison, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0305735611425905">Figure 1</xref> presents the means for each comparison.</p>

This finding justifies the fourth objective of the study, which was to find out how TOS affect the mood of adolescents who listen to them, and to inquire whether there is any connection between listening to TOS and self-reported depression.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0305735611425905">
<title>The impact of TOS on mood and their relation to depression</title>
<p>The participants were asked to openly complete the following two sentences: (a) “The best time for me to listen to TOS is when I feel…” and (b) “When I listen to TOS it makes me feel…” in order to examine the effect of listening to TOS on their mood. The answers of participants who responded to these two items (<italic>n</italic> = 51) were sorted by two independent judges into the following three categories: mood improvement, mood decrement, and no change in mood. Mood improvement was noticed when the completion of the first statement was a negative mood (e.g., painful, sad, lonely, upset) and the completion of the second statement was a positive mood (happy, good, fun, calm). Mood decrement was determined when the completion of the first statement was a positive mood and the second a negative mood. No change in mood was concluded when similar moods were written in completion of both statements. Interrater reliability was 100%. Mood improvement was found for 62.75% of the participants, mood decrement was demonstrated in 21.57%, and no change in mood in 15.68%. In contradistinction to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735611425905">Horesh (2006)</xref> who found that listening to TOS is associated with a depressive mood and low self-esteem among those addicted to drugs, the goodness-of-fit test revealed a significant difference, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 20.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, so that more participants reported mood elevation than mood decrement or no change in mood.</p>
<p>A <italic>t</italic> test for independent samples between the BDI score of TOS listeners and non-TOS listeners was performed in order to elucidate the relation between clinical depression and TOS. Participants in both groups received very low scores (3.90 and 5.34), which are much below 19, the BDI’s cut-off point for moderate clinical depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0305735611425905">Beck et al., 1961</xref>), and no significant difference was found between the two groups (<italic>t</italic> &lt; 1). Moreover, a Pearson correlation test for the relation between the number of hours that TOS listeners listen to music and their BDI score yielded an insignificant correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0.06, <italic>p</italic> = 0.18).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The first question of the present study was whether TOS can be regarded as a unique musical genre. Our findings reveal that TOS form a specific genre. A clear distinction between the two types of songs (TOS and OS) was made by participants who listened to the songs, and the participants confirmed most of the judgments made by the four expert interviewees. The ratings of TOS listeners regarding the relevance of the SAF items for TOS could be grouped into a coherent structure consisting of four factors that explain most of the variance. These factors (antisocial, support, agony, and ethno-music) are obviously connected to the main characteristics of TOS as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735611425905">Horesh (2006)</xref>. Moreover, these songs seem to have similar content to the Turkish Arabesk genre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0305735611425905">Stokes, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0305735611425905">1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0305735611425905">2003</xref>). Finally, the comparative musical analyses of TOS and OS yielded four musical elements which clearly differentiated the two types. Unlike OS, some of the TOS were based on a folk Turkish tune, almost all began with a prolonged instrumental opening, and were written according to the musical laws of Makam-Kurdi scales, which have a sad character, and a melodic drop that expresses tears, very deep sorrow, and sadness (A. Gabai, personal communication, August 11, 2008). Moreover, no use of key instruments was evident in TOS, but only of synthesizers or string instruments (such as ouds and violins). These musical characteristics are also reminiscent of the Turkish Arabesk genre. Moreover, the use of acoustic instruments, violins, and baglama which is evident in TOS is also commonly used in the Arabesk genre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0305735611425905">Stokes, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The second research question examined whether adolescents who listen to TOS have particular sociodemographic characteristics. It was found that adolescents who listen to TOS define themselves as coming from a Mizrachi origin. Considering the fact that these youngsters were born in Israel, this may imply that they connect between their social identity and the cultural origin of their ancestors. This finding is in accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0305735611425905">Tanner, Asbridge and Wortley’s study (2008)</xref> who found that musical preference is highly correlated with a specific cultural origin. Most TOS listeners also live in development cities in Israel. This may imply that they come from lower socioeconomic classes, and from poor neighbourhoods which are prone to deficiency in services and crime. This sociodemographic profile resembles the one described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735611425905">North and Hargreaves (2008)</xref> in regard to “problem music.” According to their review, adolescents who listen to “problem music” (rap and heavy metal music in particular) tend to be members of an undervalued ethnic/social group, to have less parental monitoring, more problems in school, and more relation to delinquency behaviours. In addition, we found that adolescents who listen to TOS are mostly in the early stage of their adolescence period. This can allude to the important function of TOS as a means for organizing elements of social identity during the early stages of adolescence.</p>
<p>The third question of the study was aimed to discover social and psychological functions that TOS fulfil for adolescents. The results of our survey support most of the descriptions which were provided by the four expert interviewees. Most of the adolescents who listen to these songs download them from the Internet, associate them with the movies which describe the lives of the singers, and love these movies. TOS are distributed illegally, and are associated with social heroes whose biography is characterized by many antisocial elements (e.g., use of heavy drugs, alcoholism, jail, suicide attempts, etc.). These social elements are similar to the Turkish Arabesk genre, which has an anti-institutional social character and is associated with the margins of society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0305735611425905">Stokes, 1992</xref>). Nevertheless, many of the adolescents who listen to these songs admit that TOS are considered inferior. The perception of these songs as inferior in Israel is in agreement with the perception of Arabesk songs in Turkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0305735611425905">Stokes, 1992</xref>). Israel and Turkey are countries which are impacted by Eastern and Western cultures. Similarly to the Turkish Arabesk genre, TOS sound like Arabic music. The repulsion for TOS in Israel, a country surrounded by seven Arab countries, may reflect a deep fear of losing the Hebrew social identity and becoming Arabs. The repulsion for TOS can also be explained by the social illegitimacy of a man crying. Many adolescents acknowledged the weepy sound of the singers, and hearing men weeping and crying may be regarded negatively in Israel, as it is also not welcome in Turkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0305735611425905">Stokes, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The respondents also admitted that they pay attention to the words of these songs. As in the Arabesk songs, the lyrics of TOS complain and rebel against the tragic and unjust destiny of ordinary people. This complaining is not in accordance with Turkish and Israeli cultures. According to the Islamic religious view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0305735611425905">Stokes, 1992</xref>), our future reflects our goodness. Therefore, if we are innocent we will not suffer, and if we suffer we are not innocent. In Israel, the secular Western social view of the “just world” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0305735611425905">Lerner, 1982</xref>) basically presents a similar prediction. That is, as grown up people we should understand that we deserve what we got, be prepared to pay for our faults, be responsible for our mistakes, and correct them. If we suffer, it is because we have made mistakes. If we want to eliminate our suffering, we should not weep and moan how miserable we are and how bad is our destiny. Instead, we should take our destiny in our own hands and change it. Therefore, people in both cultures may find it difficult to identify with the complaining attitude which characterises the Arabesk and the TOS. Nevertheless, although TOS listeners acknowledge the inferior social status of these songs (which stems from their dramatic contents that may sound pathetic to the Western ear and from their association to an Arabic and not to a Jewish identity), most of them report that this does not matter to them. It seems that they identify with the complaining attitude of these songs even at the cost of being less appreciated by their friends.</p>
<p>The fourth question of this study was aimed at elucidating the impact of TOS on mood and their relation to clinical depression. The comparison of associations that listening to TOS and OS aroused clearly showed that TOS triggered more negative associations and less positive ones. In what way can these negative and tragic contents affect the mood of the listeners? In the original Arabesk genre, the music fulfilled the psychological needs of Turkish farmers who immigrated from the south-eastern villages to the big city. These immigrants wrote songs that reminded them of their lost childhood and their parents. The Arabesk songs expressed their longing for the life they had left behind, and channelled the frustration which stemmed from their low socioeconomic status into an artistic expression. Israeli adolescents from a Mizrachi origin can identify with such contents that express social inferiority. Most of these adolescents come from development towns and poor neighbourhoods. As adolescents they can also easily identify with the contents of a broken heart and disappointments in love (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0305735611425905">Zillman &amp; Gan, 1997</xref>) which characterise these songs. This explanation can be supported by the finding that the majority of the listeners (58.2%) completely agree with the statement: “I mostly love the lyrics in TOS.” The songs may thus regulate their mood by helping them air their social frustrations through identification with these contents.</p>
<p>The findings show that the participants reported more changes in mood than no mood change after hearing TOS, and more positive than negative mood changes. The mood changes that the songs create are in accordance with previous evidence that songs can regulate mood by means of lyrics and melodic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0305735611425905">Bakagiannis &amp; Tarrant, 2006</xref>). As explained before, the elevated mood which is reported after listening to TOS may result from psychological processing of these contents which preoccupy adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0305735611425905">Boer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0305735611425905">Noth &amp; Hargreaves, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0305735611425905">Selfhout et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0305735611425905">Wells &amp; Hakanen, 1991</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0305735611425905">Lehtonen (2002)</xref>, exposure to music can connect people to their feelings and at the same time temporarily distance them from their pain.</p>
<p>However, it is important to keep in mind that unlike emotions which are aroused in everyday situations, emotions induced by aesthetic sources (music in this case), do not involve a goal-relevant appraisal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0305735611425905">Scherer, 2004</xref>), and that although fiction acts as a safe environment which enables the experience of negative emotions, such as anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0305735611425905">Goldstein, 2009</xref>), listening to TOS is still only an aesthetic experience. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the positive mood changes after hearing TOS are lasting and stable. In addition, our findings do not provide accurate information about the specific social contexts in which adolescents prefer to listen to these songs. Such information would refine our knowledge about the curative effect of these songs, as we know that preference for sad-sounding music varies with the listening context (see, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0305735611425905">Schellenberg, Peretz, &amp; Vieillard, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Why do adolescents like sad-sounding music as TOS? Previous studies have shown that music in general and songs in particular function as a mood regulator for adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0305735611425905">Saarikallio &amp; Erkkila, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0305735611425905">Hunter and Schellenberg (2010)</xref> compared liking ratings for happy- and sad-sounding music after happy, sad, and neutral mood inductions. They found that when sad mood was induced, happy- and sad-sounding pieces were liked equally, and concluded that sad moods increased the appeal of sad music. They therefore deduced that sad-sounding music may help listeners remain in contact with their sad emotions, and that staying in touch with negative feelings may allow these feelings to dissipate. A similar explanation for the ability of sad-sounding music to increase happiness and well-being was suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0305735611425905">Saarikallio and Erkkila (2007)</xref>. These researchers argued that although reflecting on a sad experience while listening to sad-sounding music may increase depressive feelings in the short run, it may improve the mood in the long run, by helping the listeners to improve their understanding of the sad experience. These findings may provide some explanations for the attraction of adolescents to TOS.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is evidence that songs function as a mood regulator especially for adolescents prone to mood changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0305735611425905">Bakagiannis &amp; Tarrant, 2006</xref>), and that “problem music” (such as rap and heavy metal music) which also contains antisocial messages is associated with self-harming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735611425905">North &amp; Hargreaves, 2008</xref>). We therefore, examined the relations between TOS and depression. TOS listeners’ scores on the BDI were much lower than the cut-off point of the BDI for depression and did not significantly differ from the scores of adolescents who do not listen to these songs. Moreover, no correlation was found between the amount of time that TOS listeners spend listening to music and their depression score.</p>
<p>The idea that listening to TOS can be harmful for the listeners is based on the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735611425905">Horesh (2006)</xref>. According to Horesh, in the case of drug addiction, the music becomes a conditioned stimulus which is associated with a conditioned response of heroin injection or smoking marijuana. Horesh also warns against the tendency of many drug addicts to overidentify with the depressive contents of TOS which makes them escape from these depressive contents into the drug experience. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735611425905">Horesh (2006)</xref> explains that it is not the music per se which is harmful, but the social context which is associated with the music. More specifically, and in line with the mechanism of “evaluative conditioning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735611425905">Juslin, Liljeström, Västfjäll, &amp; Lundqvist, 2010</xref>), the drug addict may even be induced by listening to TOS to use the drug simply because this music has often been paired with the act of heroin injection. For healthy adolescents, TOS are not associated with such a specific behaviour. Therefore, the mechanisms which underline their attraction to this genre of music are not in any way similar to those of drug addicts.</p>
<p>From the findings of the present study it can be concluded that adolescents who listen to TOS are not prone to depression more than adolescents who do not listen to these songs, and that listening to TOS is not harmful for them. This is in line with the conclusion that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735611425905">North and Hargreaves (2008)</xref> derived from their literature review on “problem music”: “However, the especially contentious nature of rap and rock relative to other musical styles is not always as apparent as the stereotypes of these might suggest.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735611425905">2008</xref>, p. 165). In line with this conclusion, North and Hargreaves compared between 148 British fans and 288 nonfans of “problem music” on five self-injurious measures. Although they found that liking for “problem music” was associated with four of the five measures, they demonstrated that listening to “problem music” did not precede self-injurious thoughts, and cannot be considered as a causal factor of self-injurious behaviour but is actually mediated by other psychological and social factors (self-esteem in particular).</p>
<p>The present study suffers from several methodological limitations. Although participants were recruited from three different schools and from different regions of the country, the sampling method was not proportional or random. It is therefore recommended that future studies in this area use alternative sampling methods (e.g., stratified sampling) in order to allow for the generalisability of the findings. In addition, as the sample included only adolescents one cannot generalise from its results to the study of adults. Moreover, the study which was not conducted individually but in groups tried to provide answers to four research questions. As a result, the procedure was demanding, took about 1 hour and included many questionnaires. This could decrease the reliability of the study. In addition, mood changes associated with listening to TOS could be measured with better measurement tools (such as the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule [PANAS]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0305735611425905">Watson, Clark, Tellegen, 1988</xref>), and could be compared to mood changes associated with listening to non-TOS. Such methodological improvements can be carried out in future studies. Nevertheless, this is the first study on tearful oriental songs and normative adolescents. The study presents comprehensive analyses of these songs and their meaning for adolescents according to social, psychological, and musical perspectives. This study also provides a better understanding for musicologists and music therapists of what appears to be a specific musical genre which gained popularity among Israeli adolescents. Nevertheless, the overall impact of TOS music on adolescents’ lives is awaiting further inquiry. Future longitudinal studies can explore changes in the attraction to TOS along the adolescence period. Further studies can also compare the attitudes of both Israeli and Turkish adolescents to both genres: tearful oriental songs and Arabesk songs. It may be also attractive for further studies to focus on the social tendency of people from both countries to disfavour these songs and be critical toward people who like them. Finally, we find it is also important to follow the change in social attitudes toward these songs, which seems to resemble the change toward <italic>Musica Mizrachit</italic> that began during the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735611425905">Regev &amp; Seroussi, 2004</xref>). In a country which is surrounded by seven Arab countries, a better understanding of this musical genre may contribute to better communication between the next generations of people from both cultures.</p>
