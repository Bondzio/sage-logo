<title>Background</title>
<p>A major challenge for determining the effectiveness of community-based continence promotion campaigns is recruitment of a representative sample of incontinent participants who have not previously sought care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1740774512460144">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>To evaluate the efficiency of engaging community organisations as catalysts for recruitment of community-dwelling older women with incontinence to the ‘Continence across Continents’ randomised controlled trial.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1740774512460144">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Seniors’ and women’s community-based organisations throughout the United Kingdom were solicited by telephone or email to assist recruitment for an open-label cluster randomised controlled trial testing three experimental continence promotion interventions and a control intervention for incontinent older women. Women aged 60 years and older who experienced at least weekly urinary incontinence and who had never sought treatment were eligible to participate. The response rate of the organisations and enrolment rate of eligible participants attending the continence promotion workshops were recorded. Differences in recruitment efficiency by intervention group were ascertained using analysis of variance statistics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1740774512460144">
<title>Results</title>
<p>We contacted 408 community organisations over a 1-year period. Seventy organisations (17%) agreed to host a workshop, 249 (61%) did not provide a response, and 89 (22%) refused. Workshops were administered in a group format to 61 organisations (15%); 667 women attended, 583 (87%) submitted the screening questionnaire, and 437 (66%) met eligibility criteria for inclusion. A total of 192 women consented to participate in the trial, yielding a 44% recruitment efficiency among workshop attendees known to be eligible, with no significant difference in enrolment rates between groups. However, the mean participant recruitment rate per number of attendees at each workshop was only 29%, varying substantially between groups from 19% to 37%, with the lowest rate observed for the control group. The mean annual recruitment rate expressed as the number of enrolled participants per community organisation contacted was 0.5.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1740774512460144">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Reasons for women’s non-response were not collected. The findings may be country specific.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1740774512460144">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The recruitment rate for a continence promotion trial among older women known to be eligible and attending workshops hosted by local community organisations was high (44%). Strategies are needed to bolster community organisations’ involvement in health promotion trials in general and for continence issues in particular.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Urinary incontinence (UI) has been estimated conservatively to affect one in three community-dwelling women aged 65 years or older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512460144">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774512460144"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512460144">3</xref>]. UI increases with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512460144">3</xref>], can severely affect quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512460144">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512460144">4</xref>], and has been estimated to incur annual costs to the individual and the health-care system in excess of 178 and 233 million British pounds, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774512460144">5</xref>]. Despite these figures, less than 34% of older incontinent women ever seek help for their symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512460144">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512460144">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774512460144">6</xref>]. Lack of help-seeking has been attributed to misconceptions about incontinence and potential treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774512460144">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774512460144">4</xref>]. Continence promotion associations strive worldwide to educate people that evidence-based therapeutic options exist and that improvements and cures can be achieved at all ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774512460144">7</xref>]. Although many continence awareness campaigns have been launched to reduce the stigma and negative beliefs associated with incontinence, only a handful have evaluated the effectiveness of different strategies for improving help-seeking and reducing symptoms among untreated incontinent individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774512460144">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774512460144"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774512460144"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1740774512460144"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774512460144"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740774512460144"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774512460144"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774512460144">15</xref>].</p>
<p>A major challenge facing researchers who wish to determine the effectiveness of continence promotion programmes is securing a representative sample of potential participants with incontinence who have not previously sought care. Ipso facto, potential recruits are incontinent individuals who are uninterested or unmotivated to seek care for various reasons. One approach for finding and recruiting these individuals is via advertisements in newspapers, on the radio or Internet, or through purchased lists or mass mailings. The efficiency of recruitment through local advertising is difficult to quantify, as the number of persons exposed to the ads remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774512460144">15</xref>]. Furthermore, people who respond to advertisements may be different from the general population, incurring a recruitment bias that threatens the external validity of the findings. The efficiency through mass mailings targeting incontinent women aged 65 years and older for dissemination of continence promotion materials has been estimated at 18%, when non-response and ineligibility are accounted for [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1740774512460144">16</xref>]. To our knowledge, the success of the latter strategy for recruitment into a randomised controlled trial has never been evaluated.</p>
<p>More than half of all randomised controlled trials either fail to meet their recruitment target or require an extended recruitment period, reducing the power of studies to detect significant intervention effects and substantially increasing costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1740774512460144">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774512460144"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1740774512460144">19</xref>]. Incontinence trials are no exception, with difficulties in recruitment leading to study cessation due to lack of enrolment even when large clinical trial networks are involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1740774512460144">20</xref>]. Evidence-based strategies to facilitate recruitment include increasing people’s awareness of the health problem being studied, attendance at an education session, addition of a health questionnaire to be completed at the time of recruitment, and monetary incentives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1740774512460144">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1740774512460144">21</xref>]. Community organisation involvement in health research also has been identified as a possible solution to the recruitment challenges experienced by public health and clinical researchers mounting community-based randomised controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1740774512460144">22</xref>]. In Canada, collaborative recruitment strategies that partnered with community organisations exceeded recruitment rates obtained through local newspaper advertising directed at individuals to attend a community-based continence promotion workshop, although the exact efficiency rates of the two strategies were not reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774512460144">14</xref>]. An important caveat reported from the Canadian study was that community partners expressed reticence about restricting attendance at the continence education session to eligible incontinent individuals. They argued that this restriction seemed unfair to continent individuals who wished to partake for educational purposes, and also singled out and potentially stigmatised individuals with symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774512460144">14</xref>].</p>
<p>With these lessons learned, a randomised controlled trial was launched in the United Kingdom in November 2010 to compare the impact of different continence promotion strategies for improving self-management and help-seeking for senior women with untreated incontinence. The ‘Continence across Continents’ trial is a jointly funded initiative by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Economic and Social Research Council of the United Kingdom as part of the New Dynamics of Ageing Programme (ClinicalTrials.gov ID number NCT01239836). The initiative seeks to exchange applied research knowledge on healthy ageing between Canada and the United Kingdom. As part of the trial, continence promotion interventions showing preliminary efficacy in Canada were culturally adapted and transported to the United Kingdom for widespread implementation and testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774512460144">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774512460144">15</xref>]. We report our experience targeting community organisations as catalysts to enhance recruitment to the trial during the first year of the study.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section9-1740774512460144">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>The ongoing ‘Continence across Continents’ trial is an open-label cluster randomised controlled trial comparing three different continence promotion strategies and one control intervention. The cluster is the community organisation from whence participants are recruited. Randomisation of the intervention to each community organisation is achieved by computer-generated random digits generated at a distant study site, with randomisation balanced innon-stratified block groups of four. Although allocation of the intervention is blinded, the trial is open-label because both the research facilitator who delivers the interventions and the study participants who receive it are aware of which intervention is being delivered.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1740774512460144">
<title>Interventions</title>
<p>Each of the four interventions is a 60-min interactive ‘workshop’ delivered in group format to 8–16 participants by the same trained continence nurse advisor in a venue of the organisation’s choosing. The four interventions are an interactive continence promotion workshop, a self-management workshop with distribution of an individualised incontinence self-management programme, a combined interactive workshop on incontinence and self-management, and a sham control group lecture on other health issues of older women. The content of the continence promotion workshop incorporates elements of constructivist learning that challenge older adults’ erroneous beliefs about accepting incontinence as a normal part of ageing. Different reasons and risk factors that precipitate urine loss are reviewed, and the availability and effectiveness of non-pharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical treatment options for different types of incontinence are discussed. The self-management intervention reviews self-management theory, including problem identification, goal-setting, self-monitoring, and the importance of a feasible action plan. The content of the combined intervention condenses elements from the continence promotion workshop along with self-management theory but omits many of the case examples due to time constraints. After the self-management and combined interactive sessions, attendees interested in participating in the trial are invited to enter their risk factors for incontinence into a computer program in order to receive a customised self-management programme for risk factor modification for incontinence. The content of the sham workshop addresses other non-bladder-related aspects of older women’s health, such as memory problems, polypharmacy, osteoporosis, nutrition, physical fitness, and vision impairment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1740774512460144">
<title>Study population</title>
<p>Eligible participants are women aged 60 years or older who experience at least weekly UI and who have not previously sought care from a health provider for their urinary symptoms. UI is defined as any involuntary leakage of urine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1740774512460144">23</xref>]. All women wishing to take part in the study are required to have capacity and ability to consent to participate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1740774512460144">
<title>Recruitment of community organisations</title>
<p>The recruitment process and trial flow are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740774512460144">Figure 1</xref>. First, community organisations are contacted and invited to aid in recruitment for a collaborative UK–Canada research study. For the purposes of this study, a community organisation is loosely defined as any not-for-profit group of individuals with a shared interest. Each organisation is invited to host a women’s health workshop for members of their group. The goal of the study is described as the evaluation of the health promotion workshop. The organisations are then informed that one of four workshops on various topics, such as bladder health, memory problems, or medication side effects, will be offered but that it is impossible to specify the content in advance as this is part of the randomisation process. Any female member of the organisation can attend without committing to participate in the study. Consent to participate in the study is obtained from attendees only after the workshop has been delivered, and only women who consent to participate in the trial are contacted for follow-up. Community organisations are not required to sign institutional consent forms for hosting a workshop.</p>

</fig>
<p>The organisations are selected strategically by convenience sampling and word of mouth/referral to target older women. A conscious effort is being made to approach culturally and socio-economically diverse groups of women throughout the United Kingdom. A number of approaches for contacting organisations have been employed to date, depending on the organisation. The most common approach is for a member of the research team to telephone personally or email representatives from community organisations whose members may have an interest in attending a continence education session. Messages are left on voicemails when there is no answer by telephone. Large national organisations with central administrative offices (e.g., the Women’s Health Institute) have been asked to publicise the study in their newsletter to local chapters of the organisations with a contact number provided to reach the study coordinator. Reasons for refusal to host a workshop are documented.</p>
<p>Once organisations accept the invitation to host a workshop, implementation involves choosing a date for the local event and advertising the workshop to members of their organisation to attend. Telephone calls, word of mouth, letters, or bulletins featured online or in paper newsletters printed by the local organisations invite members of the organisation to attend. To provide an intimate environment, the workshops are delivered to groups of 8–16 women, free of cost to the participants and organising institution. In the majority of cases, rooms at the community centres have been available to host the group sessions. In other instances, women have volunteered their homes or room rentals are provided for by the research team.</p>
<p>For reasons of confidentiality and similar to the Canadian experience, local community organisers do not wish to screen women for eligibility prior to the continence promotion activity. The protocol therefore stipulates that any member of the hosting organisation may attend, regardless of age or continence status. At the onset of the workshop, attendees are given an information sheet about the study and are informed that the workshop is part of a research study; a consent form and screening questionnaire are distributed. The baseline screening questionnaire queries socio-demographic and continence information. All attendees are encouraged to complete the screening questionnaire prior to delivery of the workshop, but neither the questionnaires nor the consent forms are collected at that time. Instead, attendees are advised to wait until after the workshop to assess whether they foresee benefit in participating in the trial. After the workshop, the women who wish to participate in the trial are requested to sign the consent form and provide their contact information for follow-up. Women who do not wish to enrol in the trial are also invited to submit the baseline questionnaires anonymously (no name or contact information), but the questionnaire is completely optional for these women. Women who did not submit the baseline assessment are excluded from this analysis as their data are unknown.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1740774512460144">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>For the purposes of this analysis, the primary outcome was recruitment efficiency among known eligible participants to the workshops, defined as the number of enrolled participants among attendees who submitted the baseline screening questionnaire and who met eligibility criteria. Community organisations’ willingness to host a women’s health workshop in the United Kingdom is defined as the percent uptake among the contacted organisations. Overall recruitment efficiency has been calculated as the number of participants who were recruited per number of attendees at each session. The mean annual recruitment rate achieved for continence promotion activities through partnership with community organisations is estimated as the number of enrolled participants per community organisation approached to enhance public participation. Differential recruitment efficiency by type of intervention delivered was ascertained using analysis of variance, with statistical significance demarcated at the p &lt; 0.05 level. The study was approved by the Brunel University Research Ethics Committee.</p>

<sec id="section14-1740774512460144" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>We contacted 408 different community groups throughout the United Kingdom over a 1-year period. Although 70 organisations agreed to host a women’s health workshop, only 61 groups (15%) succeeded in implementing the event, yielding an average of five workshops per month. Eighty-nine groups (22%) frankly refused; 249 (61%) failed to give any response although most of them had been followed up and had received extra information on the project. The response rate per type of group contacted is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774512460144">Table 1</xref>. The organisations with a focus on health care (e.g., nurses’ associations, assisted living organisations, carer associations) generally were more favourable to hosting a workshop than recreational or sports-based groups.</p>

<p>When the initial contact was by email, 34 out of 193 contacts (18%) generated a workshop. This approach was most successful with women’s organisations (13 out of 24, 54%) and least successful with lady golf associations (0 out of 56). When the initial approach was by telephone, 24 out of 177 contacts (14%) generated a workshop. Telephone calls were most effective where a connection already existed between the researchers and the group (e.g., Queen’s nurses) or when interested parties initiated contact with the research team after having read about the study in a newsletter. Telephone calls were least effective with community groups who had no prior knowledge of the study (4 workshops from 125 contacts (3%)).</p>
<p>Of 667 women who attended the workshops, 583 (87%) submitted the baseline screening questionnaire. Of these, 437 (75%, or 66% of the total number of attendees) reported that they experienced incontinence at least weekly and were eligible to participate in the trial; 192 women (44% of known eligible participants who submitted the screening questionnaire) enrolled. The recruitment efficiency among known eligible participants did not differ by group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1740774512460144">Table 2</xref>). However, the mean overall recruitment efficiency per number of attendees at each workshop was only 29%, and varied substantially between 19% and 37% by group. The lowest recruitment rate was among women who attended the sham control workshops; the highest rate was among women who attended the self-management workshops. The latter finding is explained in part by the fact that there were significantly fewer women in the control group who met eligibility criteria for the study among those who submitted the screening questionnaire, even though equal numbers of women submitted their screening questionnaires in each group. The mean annual recruitment rate, expressed as the number of enrolled participants per community organisation contacted, was 0.5 recruits per contact. The mean (standard deviation (SD)) age of the enrolled participants was 71 years (7 years), similar to the mean (SD) age of 72 years (8 years) of women who were eligible but declined participation.</p>

<title>Reasons for refusal</title>
<p>Where workshops were refused, researchers were informed most frequently by the key contact that the yearly activity schedule for their organisation was developed already, or that the topic was considered irrelevant to their membership. Many expressed reluctance to engage in health education regarding ‘sensitive’ bladder issues. Others did not want to subject their members to filling out questionnaires. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1740774512460144">Table 3</xref> lists the barriers to hosting a workshop that were identified and the corresponding solutions employed by the research team to facilitate acceptance of the workshops by the community organisations, attendance at the event and recruitment of eligible participants. Implementation of the solutions resulted in increased attendance at the workshops towards the end of the year, but did not improve overall recruitment efficiency.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Enlisting community organisations to aid in the recruitment of community-dwelling older women to continence promotion research was judged to be successful, with 44% of eligible attendees who attended the workshops consenting to enrol in the trial. However, only 17% of contacted organisations were willing to partner with the researchers, and only 15% hosted a workshop. Delivery of the workshops afforded no cost to the organisation, was completely without risk, and showed promising results in Canada for increasing knowledge about incontinence and improving bothersome urinary symptoms through self-management. By refusing to host a workshop, many community organisations deprived their members of the opportunity to benefit from health promotion in general and continence education in particular.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that recruitment through community organisations introduced selection bias into the study, as a number of approaches were used and recruiting organisations represented a wide socio-economic and educational base. In no instance did the community contact derive secondary benefit from hosting a workshop. However, the open-label nature of the trial and the fact that the workshops were delivered prior to obtaining informed consent seems to have influenced overall recruitment efficiency differentially for the three experimental versus the sham control group, as fewer women from the control group who submitted their screening questionnaire met eligibility criteria. Incontinent women who received the control intervention did not receive education about incontinence and may have had less incentive to submit the screening questionnaire. Screening and enrolling participants for the trial before delivering the workshops may have equalised recruitment rates, but organisations in the United Kingdom could not divulge to the research team the names or contact details of the members who signed up to attend the workshop, leaving no way to contact and enrol participants in advance. Nor did the organisations wish only to restrict attendance at the health promotion workshops to members wishing to participate in the trial. In retrospect, an alternative solution would have been to collect the screening questionnaires and consent prior to delivering the workshops, but this approach could have lowered overall recruitment efficiency. Although the type of workshop was concealed from the participants in advance and neither affected attendance nor recruitment efficiency among known eligible participants, the study design did result in fewer numbers of women enrolling in the control group, and this should be taken into consideration by other researchers using this approach in the future, or for similar studies on sensitive topics.</p>
<p>To date, no trial has evaluated which strategies are most successful in enlisting community organisations to aid in participant recruitment to research studies. Community organisations intuitively hold appeal as collaborative partners for augmenting recruitment rates for community-based health promotion trials, particularly when the intervention aims to be delivered in small-group format, and the target population comprises individuals who have not accessed the health-care system. The low recruitment efficiency of 0.5 recruits per organisation contacted in our trial suggests that incentives to increase community organisation involvement in health promotion trials should be considered. Financial incentives from the research team, government subsidies, or public recognition by listing the organisation’s name on an accredited list of community organisations committed to improving health promotion are but a few ideas that warrant investigation. Inviting representatives of community organisations to serve as stakeholder members of the advisory board to the trial also may increase community involvement. Seeking advice from community groups on how to identify the most appropriate group member to approach, and how that approach should be made, may increase the likelihood of groups engaging with the researchers.</p>
<p>A number of additional barriers need to be overcome if community organisations are to be used as catalysts to recruitment. One difficulty encountered when approaching large community organisations was navigation through the cumbersome layers of administration that characterise many of these entities. In-person meetings and an effort to channel invitations to smaller, local chapters of the organisation whenever possible seemed to improve results. This perception is consistent with the experience of other researchers who have attempted to collaborate with community organisations to recruit equally difficult-to-reach populations such as persons with intellectual disabilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1740774512460144">24</xref>]. Even when specific contact persons at the organisation are convinced of the benefits of participating in the trial, approval by individual internal committees often is required. As committees meet only once per month or less frequently, and as drafting and distribution of newsletters to advertise the event to members of the organisation add further delays, the time between an initial contact and the successful booking of a continence promotion event often exceeded 2–3 months. Partnering with a local coordinator was found to be most effective when the coordinator in question had a positive outlook on health promotion or had a personal experience with incontinence. Building trusting relationships with the local coordinators also reduced the time needed by the research coordinator to set up and host a workshop.</p>
<p>Another barrier for hosting a health promotion activity to help enrolment into a clinical trial related to confidentiality and privacy issues of the organisation’s members. Incontinence continues to be thought of as a taboo or stigmatised condition by many older adults. While several organisations expressed readiness to consider health education workshops, there was a reluctance to engage with bladder health specifically. Unmasking members with incontinence was thought of as an invasion of personal privacy. For this reason, many local coordinators were reluctant to invest the time to organise a workshop because of fear of lack of interest or clientele/membership disapproval. Most concerns were addressed by providing adequate information about the study and permitting attendance regardless of continence status with no formal commitment to participate.</p>
<p>This study was not designed to test recruitment strategies for involving community organisations in public health research. Our experience may not represent the experiences of other public health research groups, and may specifically reflect the stigma associated with incontinence. Over 50% of organisations contacted did not respond to our invitation. It may be that persistence over time would have yielded improved results. It also may be that the response is specific to community organisations in the United Kingdom. Previous recruitment experiences with community organisations in Canada revealed similar recruitment barriers including scheduling difficulties and high rates of non-response among the community organisations contacted.A direct comparison of recruitment efficiency between the Canadian and UK experiences with community organisations is not possible because in Canada, the community group organisers that accepted to host a workshop felt comfortable screening for eligibility prior to the workshop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774512460144">14</xref>]. As a result, eligible participants signed consent prior to delivery of the workshop, and a much higher recruitment efficiency (approximately 80%) was obtained.</p>
<p>In summary, enlisting community organisations to aid with recruitment to a community-based continence promotion trial was successful for enrolling 44% of the eligible participants attending the community education sessions. A future challenge is bolstering the willingness of community organisations to partner with publicly funded academic researchers to participate in health promotion activities. Earlier engagement with large organisations focused on health or the offer of financial incentives may assist with endorsement of the research agenda via their organisational network and communication systems. Recognition of the challenges to recruitment for continence promotion trials should not be underestimated.</p>
