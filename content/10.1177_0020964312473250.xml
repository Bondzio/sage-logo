<p>The cries of Lamentations are desperate, wailing up from the darkest side of human existence. They will not be silenced. Lament harasses those who oppress and calls all to justice—even God.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Lamentations is a reality show set among the carnage of a burned-out city. There is no sugar-coating, no holding back—and no happy ending. The grotesqueness of human suffering on display in the scroll’s five laments rivals the blood and gore of any blockbuster disaster movie, and places it outside the boundaries of general church audiences. Lamentations is adult-only material and way beyond the comfort zone of worshipers seeking breathing space from the tragedy of their own lives. Today, a rarity would be a church pew of people without one or more trying to reconcile life’s downturn with her or his faith. Lost work, foreclosed homes, denial of insurance, and maxed-out credit flies in the face of religion that promises God’s blessings. Even if personally untouched, many of us know family members or friends who have seen their lives fall apart. In economically challenging times when the church food pantry becomes a place of pilgrimage for its own members, hearing the desperate cries of long-ago suffering can be too much. People are on overload—too many boarded-up houses and too many towns struggling to rebuild after fires and hurricanes. Too many still live in tents after the earthquake in Haiti. Too many bloody bodies fill the streets of Syria and a theater in Aurora, Colorado. Other violence will surely come. There may be truth in the words, “be grateful that it isn’t worse,” but little comfort.</p>
<p>Reminding those who find their way to church of the <italic>tears of the world</italic>, as Kathleen O’Connor describes Lamentations, is risky business in good times.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0020964312473250">1</xref></sup> Naming God as the enemy or even worse, preaching the silence of God in the face of unthinkable suffering borders on religious suicide. No wonder, besides the standard Holy Saturday readings (Lam 3:1–9, 19–24), only six verses of the scroll (Lam 1:1–6 coupled with Lam 3:19–26) find their way into the lectionary readings for Year C, with the more positive tones of Lam 3:22–33 included in Year B. To deal honestly with the scroll of Lamentations is to admit to people searching for a word of hope in their lives that God may in fact not be there for them. When the sentiment of the day is God’s love and blessings, how will we talk of God’s absence? How can we tell them that Shug, the preacher’s daughter in <italic>The Color Purple</italic>, might have it right? Shug asks Celie, another abused woman: “. . . have you ever found God in church? I never did. I just found a bunch of folks hoping for him to show.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0020964312473250">2</xref></sup> Rather than love and blessings, God is strangely absent.</p>

<title>The Cry</title>
<p>Imagine two characters on a dimly-lit stage. An anonymous narrator stands at the edge of the stage apart from a solitary feminine form. She is City Woman, a weeping female brutally transformed from a fertile and noble position to an empty figure of mockery and self-loathing. The narrator’s voice is distant, detached from the suffering and grief he describes. Although seemingly disparate, word images that bespeak disgust pile one after another upon the female victim who absorbs her attackers’ thrusts. No one voices comfort—neither friend, nor foe, nor God.</p>
<p>A long guttural cry, <italic>’êkāh</italic>, is emitted from the narrator’s throat. A <italic>how(l)</italic> so shattering that no translation can capture its horror. It is the “how(l)?” of “how(l) could this have happened?” “How(l) can it be?” Expressing shock and despair, <italic>’êkāh</italic> opens the poems of Lamentations 1, 2 (v. 1) and 4 (vv. 1, 2). <italic>How(l)</italic> is the “<italic>ahhhh!”</italic> that escapes from deep within and expels out into empty silence when there are no words to say. Too bad the narrator did not stop there. Sometimes a cry is enough, indeed better than words, for the words that follow are accusatory and work from a worldview of presumptive guilt.</p>

<title>The Blame Game: You did it. She did it. God did it</title>
<p>For those with the advantage of years, memories often come by decades. Parents and grandparents in the United States speak of the want of the 1930s, the sacrifice of the 1940s, the can-do attitude of the 1950s, and the question-the-establishment 1960s. Innocence was lost in the 1970s along with virginity, John Wayne’s swagger, and the belief that presidents would not tell a lie. In the 1980s, war was turned into a fashion statement, and in the 1990s—what did happen in the 90s? Anyone who has had children, spent a decade in college and graduate study, started a business, or trained for a sport know what it is like to be fuzzy about a decade. Certainly none, however, are unclear about the turn of the millennium. In the first decade of the 21st century, the world changed forever when the towers came crashing down in New York City. The United States went to war against anyone thought to be a threat to the American way of life, real and unreal enemies. In this century’s second decade, an Arab Spring turned into an Occupy Wall Street Fall as Tea Partiers emerged, scaring the heebie-jeebies out of everyone. <italic>The Blame Game</italic> has become the most popular game in town. Blame the government, blame big business, blame the poor, blame the schools, blame the police—blame the doctors and lawyers. Blame the young for not wanting to work and blame the old for staying in their jobs too long. There is so much casting blame that the country has come to a standstill. Nothing gets done in Congress. Banks will not lend and businesses will not hire. Fingers are wagging everywhere.</p>
<p>Of course, there is really nothing new about this. Human life survives by having someone else to blame. Impugning others has become the basis for how politics, business, sports, and religion are done. Somewhere along the line, civil discourse gave way to diatribe in an anything goes, no holds barred, attack on all judged to think/believe/act/be different. Even when history shows the effects of such naming, it still happens. Remember the cold war, the McCarthy era, the threat of the domino principle and fear of communists being on the doorstep of the U.S.? The U.S. supplied guns to guerrillas in one Latin American country and to the government to fight against the guerrillas in another. The Big Red Scare made us duplicitous in thousands and thousands of deaths in El Salvador and Nicaragua in the 1970s and 1980s in the same way the threat of weapons of mass destruction did in the last few years. <italic>Only don’t blame us, we had just cause. Someone else made us do it!</italic> The Blame Game—it has been going on since “in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” We could say it started with a garden, two trees, and a snake. All was going well until the serpent got into a conversation with the garden’s mistress and she helped herself to a piece of fruit and gave some to her husband. Wow . . . did that change everything! Suddenly the man and woman are scurrying around like the mice in Cinderella trying to whip up a pair of trousers and a housedress out of fig leaves and to hide, only to have God show up.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>But the Lord God called to the man and said to him, “Where are you?” He said, “I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.” YHWH said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?” The man said, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate.” Then the Lord God said to the woman, “What is this that you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent tricked me, and I ate.” (Gen 3:9–13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Great stuff! A God talks and walks and a serpent that really is a snake —a slick-talking salesman if we ever heard one—until we try to make it history or science or worse, a faith test. “Do you believe that Adam and Eve were actually the first two people on earth?” Answer “yes,” and you get to run for President. Answer “no,” and be labeled “liberal”—the badge of all things wrong with us today, or so some would say.</p>
<p>Man blames woman and God. Woman blames the serpent. And the poor old serpent has no one to blame! This is not rocket science, but it is a truth of human history. You did it. She did it. What child with a sibling has not been caught telling Mom that her sister was the one who ate all the candy while her own mouth is covered in chocolate? Or what brother has not told Dad that someone else in the family is responsible for running out all the gas in the family car? The Blame Game—we have all played it. When caught, we would rather pass the buck than admit our own responsibility. As the CEO of a major bank said when faced with public outcries over new fees and high bonuses, “We have a right to make a profit.” In other words, whatever you are upset about, do not blame us.</p>
<p>Blame—if we are not blaming others, someone else is blaming us. It is everywhere we turn and the worst is to be blamed for something you did not do. Remember the story of Job, the man who was “blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil” (Job 1:1). He is the one who got caught up in a wager between the <italic>satan</italic> and God over whether he would praise God if there was nothing in it for him. Job lost his herds—his oxen, donkeys, sheep, and camels. He lost his servants and all his children were killed. Still, he blessed the name of the Lord. He was inflicted with sores over all his body and his wife encouraged him to curse God and die. Yet Job stood firm. Everyone thought Job was to blame for his circumstances. Suffering was seen as punishment from God, and his wife and a circle of friends all assumed that Job must have done something wrong. Still, he proclaimed his innocence, and he demanded that God answer to him. Job wanted God to explain why he was suffering unjustly. If Job was innocent as he proclaimed, then God must be to blame. You did it. She did it. God did it.</p>
<p>In a 1995 film entitled <italic>The American President</italic>, Michael Douglas plays Andrew Shephard, the President of the United States, and Annette Bening plays his lobbyist girlfriend, Sydney Ellen Wade. Shephard is up for reelection, and right-wing conservative Bob Rumson is out to get him. Rumson begins a character attack and the President refuses to respond. Shephard’s numbers tank as does the relationship between the President and his girlfriend, until it looks like everything is about to implode. Then Michael Douglas as the President walks into a news briefing and takes control.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>… Whatever your particular problem is, I promise you, Bob Rumson is not the least bit interested in solving it. He is interested in two things and two things only: making you afraid of it and telling you who’s to blame for it. That, ladies and gentlemen, is how you win elections. You gather a group of middle-aged, middle-class, middle-income voters who remember with longing an easier time, and you talk to them about family and American values and character. And wave an old photo of the President’s girlfriend and you scream about patriotism and you tell them she’s to blame for their lot in life, and you go on television and you call her a whore.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0020964312473250">3</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is the woman. It has to be the woman. That is the answer of Genesis and an answer among others that Lamentations gives. Five poems offered in lament try to come to terms with extreme suffering. Overrun by an enemy, humiliated, and left to starve, the nation of Israel seeks an explanation for what in the world happened to them. If you believe suffering is the punishment of God, then someone must have done something wrong. Guess who gets blamed? The woman does.The city of Jerusalem is personified as a woman and blame is laid in her lap.</p>

<title>When Life Turns Bitter</title>
<p>If there is one thing the people of God know, it is the bitter side of life. In the story of Ruth, a family from Bethlehem journeys to the country of Moab to escape famine in their homeland. While there, all the men die and Naomi, the family matriarch, returns to Bethlehem with Ruth, one of her Moabite daughters-in-law. Having lost husband and sons, Naomi declares herself “empty,” made so by the hand of YHWH (Ruth 1:21). As a widow without hope of ever being a wife or mother again, she renames herself Mara. She is “Bitter,” and that is how she will be known (Ruth 1:20). The same fate falls upon the City Woman in Lamentations 1:4:
<disp-quote>
<p>The roads of Zion (are) mourning . . . from lack of those coming in to the feasts;</p>
<p>All her gates (are) desolate . . . her priests (are) groaning</p>
<p>Her virgins (are) grieving, and <italic>she is bitter</italic> (author’s translation).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There is something fitting that the death of a family and birth of a nation, as the ending of Ruth unfolds, and the lamenting of a city’s ruin are told as female experiences. In ancient times, women fulfilled the role of professional mourners (cf. Jer 9:17–20); the feminine voice was appropriate for the wailing that accompanies a lament or dirge. Female mourners passed the art of lament to their daughters the way a warrior might train his son in battlement. Spoken lament gives voice to pain and loss through structured words that call on God to pay attention to the suffering of God’s people.</p>
<p>These are the prayers offered by an individual or by a community that need life to be better than it is and believe that God is the one who can effect change in their lives. Lament fills the Scriptures from the Psalter to Jeremiah and consumes the scroll of Lamentations. In the biblical text, lament goes beyond words to enactment. When David was told that Absalom had killed all his sons, he and his servants ripped their clothes and David lay on the ground (2 Sam 13:30–31). Rather than the food committees that jump into action when death strikes today, fasting signaled lament as did the clothes of grief. The widow’s garb, as sackcloth and ashes, spoke to otherness as the normal rhythm of life took on the crippling beat of <italic>qînâ</italic> 3:2, 3:2. So did silence.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The elders of Daughter Zion sit on the ground in silence.</p>
<p>They throw dust upon their heads; they put on sackcloth.</p>
<p>The virgins of Jerusalem hang their heads to the ground. (Lam 2:10; author’s translation)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lamentations teaches that lament is personal. Grief hangs as the wasted skin of the afflicted in Lam 3:4 or as the sores on Job’s back (Job 2:7–8) and demands respect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0020964312473250">
<title>Give Grief a Chance</title>
<p>Today, many of life’s experiences have moved outside the boundaries of the church. Beyond our early years, which traditionally include baptism, first communion, and confirmation, the church struggles for a place in the remaining stages of life. Weddings are destinations on cruise ships, a beach at sunset, or the backyard. Funeral homes with pre-recorded music and slide shows have captured the business of laying loved ones to rest. Lament has moved from the ecclesial to the public sphere. Families and friends pay their respect by a round of golf and the government lowers the flag.</p>
<p>What is missing in the face of great sorrow is silence. When Job’s three friends hear of his trouble, they journey together to comfort him. So grotesque was Job’s appearance that they do not recognize him, and they cry aloud. What they lack in bedside manners, gasping and screeching in the face of another’s disfigurement, bad form then and now, they make up for by their presence . . . in silence: “They sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him …” (Job 2:13). Grief needs time to work itself out. In our hurried-up world of fast-everything, there is little time for mourning. Students are expected to dry their eyes and get back to class. Workers must be quick about their grief. Even the best jobs limit paid personal leave for mourning to a few days and to close family members.</p>
<p>When Jacob died in the land of Egypt, his son Joseph made good on his vow to bury his father in the place of his family. Out of Egypt and back in the land, Joseph “observed a time of mourning for his father seven days” (Gen 50:10). Within Judaism, sitting Shiva honors the seven- day tradition of mourning. Sitting Shiva creates a break in time and space as mourners withdraw from ordinary routine. Those who grieve are isolated but not abandoned. Visitors are welcome to share memories of the dead or to sit in silence, as the grieving require. As Job’s friends who sit afar off yet keep watch, lament needs the watchers. The female voice of Lamentations 1 cries out for the watchers, for God—for someone—for anyone to see her suffering. She is the victim, doubly so, for the indignity of her suffering brings not honor but shame. Zion is shunned and the silence she hears is deafening. No comfort comes her way. Lament needs silence, but it must be the silence of presence. There is no comfort in the words, “Well, I started to stop by but I didn’t know what to say.” Being there is what counts—showing up. Grief needs its silent watchers. Lament needs silence. It also needs order.</p>
<p>One can easily see in English texts that the whole of Lamentations is poetry. What is not visible in translations is the preciseness of poetic features and literary structure that crosses the entirety of the book. The first poem comprises 22 verses with three lines each (except for v. 7, which has four lines), and makes use of an alphabetic acrostic in which the first word in v. 1 begins with <italic>‘alep</italic>, the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Verse 2 begins with <italic>bêt</italic>, the second letter of the alphabet. Verses 3–22 follow suit, each beginning with a successive letter until the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, <italic>‘alep</italic> through <italic>tāw</italic>, are exhausted by the poem’s verses. Chapter 2 follows the same pattern of 22 verses, three lines to each, again with the first word of each verse a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet. The 66 lines of poetry in chapters 1 and 2 are paralleled in chapter 3 by the same number of lines, although in this poem the lines compose 66 one-line verses. The alphabetic acrostic continues but is intensified as three verses open with the same letter, again moving through the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet (3:1–3 <italic>‘alep, ‘alep, ‘alep;</italic> 3:4–6 <italic>bêt, bêt, bêt</italic>, etc.). Chapter 4 returns to the acrostic pattern of chapters 1–2 but reduces the number of lines per verse to two lines each (= 44 lines), while chapter 5 both deviates from the acrostic pattern and reduces the verses to one line each but maintains 22 verses of poetry. The totality of loss thus stretches from <italic>‘alep</italic> to <italic>tāw</italic>, or in English, from A to Z.</p>
<p>Read against the teachings of Qoheleth, life is a matter of time and chance, thus the only real control human beings have is how they will respond. “No one can anticipate the time of disaster. Like fish taken in a cruel net, and like birds caught in a snare, so mortals are snared at a time of calamity, when it suddenly falls upon them” (Eccl 9:12). There is thus no order to the madness of life that drops the virgins of Jerusalem to their knees or crumples the City Woman of Lamentations into a weeping mass of self-loathing: “Even she groans . . . and she turns backwards (away)” (Lam 1:8c; author’s translation). When life spins out of control, those crushed by its harshness have one hope—the power that comes in lament.</p>
<p>The Jewish observance of <italic>Tishah B’Av</italic> commemorates the destruction of the temple, twice. It would have been sorrow enough had the temple, the symbol of God in the midst of God’s people, been destroyed once, as it was by the Babylonians in 586 B.C.E. Yet twice it fell, the Second Temple destroyed in 70 C.E. by the Romans. Both destructions resulted in exile and both occurred on the ninth day of the month of Av. Jewish sorrow over the loss of the temple and their homeland led to <italic>Tishah B’Av</italic> becoming a day of national mourning. During the nearly 2,000 years of the Diaspora, Jews gather on the Ninth of Av for a full fast, to consume neither food nor water to mourn their loss, to remember Israel and Jerusalem, and to recite prayers for restoration and for return to the land. Centered in the particular events of the destructions of the Temple, the Ninth of Av provided Jews who suffered their own disasters throughout the centuries, including the Holocaust, a specific time to identify with the laments of their ancestors. The preparation for <italic>Tishah B’Av</italic> starts three weeks prior as a time to cease all celebrations and show traditional signs of mourning. Some neither shave nor cut their hair. The eating of meat and drinking of wine ceases at the beginning of the month of Av, which falls mid-summer, until the full display of mourning starts at sundown on the Ninth of Av. In the synagogue observance, people sit on the floor or low stools. Lighting is low and the chanting of the Book of Lamentations is followed by medieval liturgical poems that lament the temples’ destruction. The Sabbath that follows <italic>Tishah B’Av</italic> is called the “Sabbath of Comfort.” The words of Second Isaiah, the anonymous prophet of the exile, are heard on that day: “Comfort, O comfort my people, says your God” (Isa 40:1). The establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 means that for some Jews, <italic>Tishah B’Av</italic> should no longer be a time for mourning but one of remembrance and quiet celebration. Jewish history knows both tears and laughter, and it is out of the memories of the past that the destiny of a hopeful future emerges.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0020964312473250">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Creating an order for remembered suffering allows for the past to be honored without giving in to its chaos. The enemy may have prevailed in the past and may threaten in the present, but the future is unwritten, and the future, which takes control of the past, will provide its own dignity and hope. Such was the case on the celebration in New York of the 10th anniversary of 9/11, when four moments of silence marked the time when each plane hit and each tower fell. The reading of the victims’ names, often by children of the deceased, was particularly powerful. On that horrific day of terror, lives had been lost but life had not. Each year during the observances of Holy Week, the readings from Lamentations lead worshipers to the same reality. The voice of the afflicted heard in the reading of Lam 3:1–9 on Holy Saturday joined with the refusal to live life without hope in 3:19–24 call on tomb watchers to look beyond the events of Good Friday to the joy of Easter morning.</p>

<title>Getting Past the Pain</title>
<p>Depictions of the horror and aftermath of war are deeply troubling, whether viewed through the eyes of a 6th-century poet or a foreign correspondent on the nightly news. For most, such violence will never touch the skin. Atrocities happen to other people in other places in other times. Yet, they feel so personal. Why do people respond with credit card in hand to websites set up for victims of natural disasters, illness, mass murders, or taunting by teenagers on a school bus? Perhaps it is because few people totally escape pain. On the first day of class, all college students appear pretty much the same. There might be more women than men, a factual gap that needs addressing, and more students of a particular race or ethnicity than others, but everyone seems, for lack of a better description, okay. Then the emails start coming in or a student asks to talk to you after class, the way a parishioner lingers by the last pew while everyone else rushes out the church doors. Real life problems come tumbling out, and the best any of us can do initially is listen. For some, the pain of their lives is immediate, what they are going through in the moment. Tuition is due and financial aid has not come in. Parents wait until their youngest child went off to college to call it splits. A night of drinking leads to unsafe behavior, and now the authorities are involved. For others, the past haunts present reality—a high school friend’s death, sexual activity too young.</p>
<p>Past pain, present suffering—the words of Lamentations know both. To read these laments is to hear the pain of an age gone by, and at first, we must simply listen. To jump quickly to a resolution or a “well, it all worked out in the end,” is its own form of abuse. Victims must be heard. All who struggle with oppression want to know that someone hears their cries. That is the first step to getting past the pain. The second is to believe that whatever put them in harm’s way will not happen again. If one knows that something will not happen again, one can move it to the past. The source of pain, if not lanced, festers like a boil. To create healing, wounds must be attended to properly. Part of post-traumatic stress is the fear that what causes us to break out in sweat, to shake in our boots, could happen again. A real problem of modern warfare is that we keep sending the same men and women back to the “front.” They may be more experienced than green troops, but returning to Iraq or Afghanistan means the danger and fears of the past cannot be let go. No wonder fatal auto accidents are the leading cause of death among servicemen and women upon returning to the U.S. Taught to drive 100% aggressively “over there,” they find it difficult to change their ways of driving in a non-threatening environment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0020964312473250">5</xref></sup> Putting a family back together after years of verbal abuse or a church after years of bickering can only happen if all parties involved know that the hateful, destructive words will never be spoken again. To get past the pain, one has to know that the pain will not come back.</p>

<title>Fighting Back—Do Not Take the Blame!</title>
<p>In <italic>The Color Purple</italic>, Shug says, “Any God I ever felt in church I brought in with me. And I think all the other folks did too. They come to church to <italic>share</italic> God, not find God.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0020964312473250">6</xref></sup> Okay—I am over it. I am over blaming women. Do not tell me that the women raped in war—whether in ancient Israel 2,500 years ago or in the Sudan last night—are to blame for what happened to them. Do not tell me that they deserve to be ostracized by their families, their friends, and their nations. There is real suffering in this world, real problems, and the blame game merely casts blame. It does nothing to eradicate the suffering in our world. A quote making its way around Facebook is: “When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0020964312473250">7</xref></sup> Why? It is all about blame. You did it. She did it. God did it.

<p>A God who rapes and maims is not a God to hold onto. While we fight against naming the devil (some anthropomorphic boogey-man who stops us from going to church, causes us to say mean things, and removes human culpability from the equation), we must fight against naming God, too. A man who shot and killed an unarmed teen was asked if he regretted having a gun that night. His response, “No sir, it was all part of God’s plan,” places human action in God’s lap. It is like saying that the defilement of a woman (Lam 1:9) when an enemy spreads his hands over her inward parts (Lam 1:10) was her plan. Explanations that blame Daughter Zion, blame a <italic>satan</italic>, or name God as the abuser, let human beings off the hook. In the wretched situation of oppression, no one is blameless, not humans, and not God.</p>
<p>The power of oppression comes from unchecked dishonesty. False blame—attributed to the victim, to someone else, or to God —allows the oppressor to triumph. A truth of another biblical story that relies on female action, the scroll of Esther, is that power comes with naming the enemy at the right time in the right place. Facing Jewish annihilation, Esther points the finger of truth at Haman, the originator of the plot to destroy the Jews (Esth 7:3–6). There is no mention of God in Esther, yet the Jew Mordecai can coax Queen Esther into action, and good triumphs over evil. In Lamentations, God is mentioned—invoked—harassed and accused, but God is conspicuously absent and silent, and we want to know why. A waitress in a local restaurant laments that her son, having just learned that his girlfriend was pregnant, is to report to basic training in two weeks. The mom cried for two weeks, then stopped: “God doesn’t make mistakes,” she said.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0020964312473250">8</xref></sup> Okay, but what of human beings?</p>
<p>There is a powerful movie that chronicles Oscar Romero’s transformation from an apolitical priest to Archbishop in El Salvador during the 1970s. Initially blind to the oppressive political system around him and silent in the face of its atrocities, Archbishop Romero opens his eyes to the sufferings of the Salvadoran people and becomes a voice for social justice. In one horrifying scene, the screams of a fellow priest, who was arrested with Romero and was being tortured, drive the Archbishop to his knees. “We’re human beings,” Romero cries out. “We are human beings.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0020964312473250">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>That is the cry of Lamentations—we are human beings. It is the cry heard during the dark days of slavery. Frederick Douglass observed “that the more religious the slave owners, the more cruel they were, and vice versa.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0020964312473250">10</xref></sup> This among other experiences led Douglass to the position that the oppressed cannot wait for the oppressor to set him or her free, but must seek freedom through the persistent agitation of the oppressor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0020964312473250">11</xref></sup> If God is the oppressor in Lamentations, then Lamentations models the harassment of God. Douglass saw the need for a critical analysis of the oppressor. An oppressed people cannot move toward their own liberation without knowing who they are and who their oppressors are. Being able to name the enemy is the only way to gain power over oppression and injustice. Malcolm X knew this, and he died for it. Martin Luther King, Jr. knew this, and he died for it. Archbishop Romero came to the same conclusion, and he died for it. They each challenged oppression with the abiding hope that when the oppressor is named correctly, the oppression can be overcome. In the words of Paulo Freire,
<disp-quote>
<p>The oppressors, who oppress, exploit, and rape by virtue of their power, cannot find in their power the strength to liberate either the oppressed or themselves. Only power that springs from the weakness of the oppressed will be sufficiently strong to free both.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0020964312473250">12</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There is nothing easy about teaching and preaching Lamentations. There never is when the context is suffering and the cause is thought to be God. The voices of Lamentations call God out. If God is falsely accused, then God deserves a witness. God needs a way out, and if God chooses to remain silent . . . can God get a witness?</p>

<p>See Kathleen M.

I find O’Connor’s use of the term “City Woman” compelling and use it in my references to the personified city of Lamentations.</p>
