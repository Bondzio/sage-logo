<abstract>
<p>Many species of marine bacteria elicit a weak immune response. In this study, the aim was to assess the immunomodulatory properties of Gram-negative <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains compared with other marine Gram-negative bacteria and to identify the molecular cause of the immunomodulation. Using murine bone-marrow derived dendritic cells (DCs), it was found that <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains induced low cytokine production and modest up-regulation of surface markers CD40 and CD86 compared with other marine bacteria and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> LPS<italic>.</italic> Two strains, <italic>Ps. luteoviolacea</italic> and <italic>Ps. ruthenica</italic>, were further investigated with respect to their immunomodulatory properties in DCs. Both inhibited IL-12 and increased IL-10 production induced by <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS. LPS isolated from the two <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains had characteristic lipid A bands in SDS-PAGE. Stimulation of HEK293 TLR4/MD2 cells with the isolated LPS confirmed the involvement of LPS and TLR4 and established <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> LPS as TLR4 antagonists. The isolated LPS was active in the endotoxin limulus amoebocyte lysate assay and capable of inducing increased endocytosis in DCs. This study highlights that antagonistic LPS from <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains has potential as a new candidate of therapeutic agent capable of modulating immune responses.</p>

<p>Marine bacteria and other marine microorganisms offer a rich source of useful biomolecules, such as membrane lipids, proteins, complex polysaccharides, pigments, nucleic acids and a range of bioactive secondary metabolites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425912455208">1</xref></sup> These bioactive molecules hold potential for pharmaceutical and biotechnical applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425912455208">1</xref></sup> The genus <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> comprises Gram-negative marine bacteria belonging to the γ-proteobacteria and is present globally in marine waters, constituting 0.5–6% of the total bacterial plankton.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753425912455208">2</xref></sup> Marine bacteria produce extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) and various low molecular mass (LMM) compounds as a strategy for growth, adhesion to solid surfaces and survival in adverse conditions, for example by biofilm formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753425912455208">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425912455208">4</xref></sup> In most Gram-negative bacteria, LPS is a very potent virulence factor that activates innate immune cells primarily through TLR4.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425912455208">5</xref></sup> Upon CD14 binding of LPS, LPS is transferred to MD2, which then forms complexes with TLR4 leading to TLR4 dimerization and initiation of the MyD88- or TRIF-dependent pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425912455208">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425912455208">7</xref></sup> Lipid A is the active component of the LPS that stimulates the TLR4 receptor complex. Lipid A structures exhibit considerable variability between bacterial species, but have little intra-genus variability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425912455208">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425912455208">8</xref></sup> The structural differences, in particular the degree of acylation, can influence their pro-inflammatory capacity. In general, highly acylated (hexaacylated) lipid A, for example from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> constitute potent inflammatory stimulators, whereas less acylated lipid A is less stimulatory or even displays antagonistic properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753425912455208">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425912455208">9</xref></sup> As an example, the tetra-acylated lipid A from <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> is a weak immunostimulator in human macrophage U937 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425912455208">10</xref></sup> Likewise, LPS from Gram-negative marine bacteria often elicits a weak immune response only.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425912455208">1</xref></sup> Lipid A from Gram-negative marine bacteria may, instead, act as putative antagonists of LPS from <italic>E. coli</italic> and thereby represent potential candidates in the development of drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753425912455208">11</xref></sup> So far, LPSs from five different <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains have been characterized and they have all been found to be pentaacylated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425912455208">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425912455208"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425912455208"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1753425912455208"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425912455208">16</xref></sup> LPS is composed of a hydrophilic heteropolysaccharide (formed by core oligosaccharide and an O-chain polysaccharide moiety) linked covalently to the lipophilic lipid A domain. The polysaccharide (PS) moiety is linked to the lipid A part by 3-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-<italic>manno</italic>-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo), which is cleaved upon mild acidic hydrolysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753425912455208">17</xref></sup> When present, the PS moiety confers a smooth appearance to the colony on agar plates and, in this case, LPS is called smooth (S)-form LPS. The Gram-negative bacteria with LPSs devoid of the O-chain are termed rough-type LPS (R-LPS) or lipooligosaccharide (LOS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425912455208">18</xref></sup> <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains, for example <italic>Ps. luteoviolacea</italic> and <italic>Ps. ruthenica</italic>, grow as smooth colonies on marine broth agar plates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425912455208">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425912455208">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dendritic cells (DCs) represent a group of innate immune cells centrally involved in the initiation of both innate and adaptive immunity for immediate and long-term protection respectively. Pattern recognizing receptors (PRRs) expressed on DCs and other immune cells contribute to the specific recognition of pathogens and microbial ligands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425912455208">5</xref></sup> Recognition of an antigen by DCs involves receptor–ligand interaction, mediating intracellular signalling cascades leading to DC maturation, including production and release of cytokines, which initiates recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells and determine the resulting T cell repertoire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425912455208">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1753425912455208">21</xref></sup> Hitherto, the immunostimulatory effects of <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> and other Gram-negative marine bacteria have not been studied in DCs.</p>
<p>The immunostimulatory potential of LPS is dependent on the structure of the lipid A part. In the monocytic THP-1 cell line tetra- and pentacylated LPS were weak immune stimulators with antagonistic properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425912455208">22</xref></sup> Hexa-acylated lipid A from marine <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, a known human pathogen, was able to induce TLR4 activity in HEK293 cells transfected with TLR4/MD-2 and co-receptor CD14. This study also found that loss of hexa-acylation reduced TLR4 activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1753425912455208">23</xref></sup> Moreover, it has been demonstrated that LPS may act as an antagonist through competition for the TLR4/MD-2 receptor complex in human monocyte-derived DCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1753425912455208">24</xref></sup> Recently, a study by Carillo et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425912455208">16</xref></sup> characterized the structure of lipid A from <italic>Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis</italic> TAB 23. They found that this penta-acylated lipid A was able to inhibit <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS-induced production of TNF-α and IL-6 in human monocytic THP-1 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425912455208">16</xref></sup> As all LPSs so far isolated from <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> are penta-acylated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425912455208">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425912455208"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425912455208">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425912455208">16</xref></sup> we hypothesized that most, if not all, <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains are low immunostimulators with TLR4 antagonist potential.</p>
<p>In this study, we therefore aimed to assess the immunostimulatory properties of several <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains compared with other marine Gram-negative bacteria and to identify molecules involved in the observed weak stimulation.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1753425912455208"><title>Generation and stimulation of bone marrow-derived DCs</title>
<p>Bone marrow cells were isolated and cultured as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1753425912455208">25</xref></sup> Briefly, femurs and tibias were removed from C57BL/6 mice and stripped of muscles and tendons, and the marrow was flushed. The resulting cell suspension was washed and cells were re-suspended in RPMI 1640 (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) supplemented with 4 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium), 15 ng/ml murine GM-CSF [3% (v/v) culture supernatant harvested from a GM-CSF-transfected Ag8.653 myeloma cell line] at 3 × 10<sup>5</sup>/ml. Cells were seeded at 10 ml/100-mm Petri dish, and incubated for 8 d at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Fresh medium containing 15 ng/ml GM-CSF was added on d 3 and d 6. On d 8, immature DCs were harvested and found to be above 90% CD11c-positive. Cells were stimulated and analysed by either macropinocytosis assay or flow cytometry, and supernatants were harvested for cytokine analysis. For flow cytometry and cytokine analysis, the cells were reseeded in 48-well tissue culture plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/500 µl/well in culture medium. Bacteria or LPS O26:B6 from <italic>E. coli</italic> (product number: L2654, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) were added in 100 µl/well at final concentrations as indicated, and cells were incubated for 20 h at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> humidified atmosphere.</p>
<p>In experiments involving stimulation of DCs with spent medium (SM) from bacterial cultures, a fixed volume of SM was added. We estimated that when stimulating with SM (dry mass around 38–39 mg/ml) diluted 1:36, this would equal approximately 1 mg/ml.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1753425912455208"><title>Bacterial cultures</title>
<p>Bacterial strains S2604, S2753, S2052, 234.10, 1926, 3655, S3258, S4054, S1189 and S4498 were collected during the Galathea 3 marine research expedition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425912455208">Figure 1C</xref>) and grown in 50 ml marine broth (MB) 2216 solution (37.4 g/l; Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) and on marine agar (MA) 2216 (55.1 g/l; Difco). Alternatively, strains were also grown in autoclaved sea salt solution (SSS) (Sigma S9883; 30 g/1) to which 4 g/l mannose (Fluka), and 0.3 g/l casamino acids (223050; Difco) were added from sterile, filtered stock solutions at 20% v/w. If necessary, the substrate was supplemented with a 1.0% Bacto agar (BDAA503-957; Becton Dickinson, Franklin lakes, NJ, USA). Cultures were grown with agitation for 2 d at 25°C and centrifuged at 10,000 <italic>g</italic>. Bacterial pellets were washed twice with ice cold sterile PBS (Lonza) and re-suspended in 10 ml PBS. Bacteria were irradiated in a laboratory reactor (CL-1000 UV crosslinker; UCP, Cambridge, UK) at 25,000 μJoule/cm<sup>2</sup> for 2 × 6 s at a monochromatic wavelength of 254 nm. Viability was checked by plating onto MA plates. The suspensions were aliquoted into sterile Eppendorf tubes and stored at −80°C until use.

<p>The supernatant or SM from 2-day-old bacterial cultures was collected, aliqouted and stored at −80°C. Selected SM samples were processed for size separation using PD-10 columns (GE Healtcare, Uppsala, Sweden) giving rise to a high molecular mass (HMM) fraction (&gt;5000 u). Briefly, PD-10 columns were washed with phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and 2.5 ml SM from bacterial cultures were added to the columns. The macromolecular fraction was collected by adding 3.5 ml of elution buffer and collecting the flow-through. The suspension of macromolecules from SM was diluted by a factor of 1.4.</p>

<p>Stimulated mature DCs were harvested and re-suspended in ice-cold PBS containing 1% (v/v) FBS and 0.15% (w/v) sodium azide (PBSAz). Cells were incubated with anti-mouse FcγRII/III for 10 min (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) to block non-specific binding of Ab reagents. The cells were stained with the following Abs for 45 min: Allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD86, phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-mouse CD40, (both from eBioscience, San Diego, CA) FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD11c (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA). Non-specific binding was evaluated by including matched isotype controls for all the Abs used.

<p>It has been reported previously that many marine bacteria show low immunostimulatory capacity. Thus, to establish the immunostimulatory capacity of the <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> genus, five strains of <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> (<italic>Ps. spongiae, Ps. ruthenica</italic>, <italic>Ps. luteoviolacea</italic>, <italic>Ps. phenolica</italic>, and <italic>Ps. piscicida</italic>) were added to bone marrow-derived DCs. To establish their relative capacity to mature DCs, we included five other marine bacteria representing four genera and LPS from <italic>E. coli</italic> in the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425912455208">Figure 1A</xref>). The production of IL-10, IL-12, IL-6 and TNF-α in DCs was measured after 20 h of exposure to the bacteria at different concentrations. Compared with the other marine bacteria, all <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains only induced weak IL-12, IL-10 and TNF-α responses, while the IL-6 response was comparable to that induced by the other bacteria. When compared with LPS from <italic>E. coli</italic> the IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α response to <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains was comparable to that induced by LPS (1 µg/ml). The IL-12-induced response did not reach more than 100 pg/ml compared with the 240 pg/ml induced by <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS. Most of the other bacteria were capable of inducing an IL-12 level comparable to that induced by <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS. For most bacteria, including the <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains, the level of IL-12 peaked at 1 or 10 µg/ml and then decreased again at higher bacterial concentrations. LPS from <italic>E. coli</italic> was included in 1 µg/ml. This was based on a titration study showing a slight increase in the induced IL-12 production in the range 1–30 µg/ml (data not shown).</p>
<p>In order to further analyse the maturation pattern of DCs exposed to different Gram-negative marine bacteria, the expression of CD86 and CD40 was measured by flow cytometry upon stimulation with two different <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains (<italic>Ps. ruthenica</italic> S3258 and <italic>Ps. luteoviolacea</italic> S4054) representing low cytokine stimulatory bacteria and <italic>R. mobilis</italic> representing high cytokine stimulatory bacteria respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425912455208">Figure 1B</xref>). While CD40 was only up-regulated in the presence of bacteria, even addition of MB (the bacterial growth medium) gave rise to up-regulation of CD86. LPS and <italic>R. mobilis</italic> were most potent stimulators of CD86 up-regulation, but <italic>Ps. ruthenica</italic> also stimulated a significant up-regulation, while, upon stimulation with <italic>Ps. luteoviolacea</italic>, the level corresponded to that induced by addition of MB. <italic>Ps. ruthenica</italic> and <italic>R. mobilis</italic> were the most potent inducers of CD40 and induced a level comparable to that induced by LPS from <italic>E. coli</italic>, while <italic>Ps. luteoviolacea</italic> induced a lower CD40 level, though it was still higher than in unstimulated DCs. The expression of CD86 was up-regulated further upon stimulation with a higher dosage of <italic>Ps. luteoviolacea</italic> (10 µg/ml) (data not shown) to levels similar to that of 1 µg/ml <italic>Ps. ruthenica.</italic></p>
<p>These data show that all the five <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains are weak inducers of IL-12, IL-10 and TNF-α, but induce IL-6 to similar levels of <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS-stimulated DCs and up-regulated the co-stimulatory markers CD40 and CD86.</p>

<sec id="sec14-1753425912455208"><title><italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> inhibits IL-12 while increasing IL-10 production induced by LPS from <italic>E. coli</italic></title>
<p>The poor IL-12-inducing capacity of the <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains might be a result of <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> LPS acting as a TLR4 antagonist, binding to TLR4 but only weakly stimulating the DCs. Alternatively, the presence of other microbial ligands might act contra-active and thus, indirectly, inhibit TLR4 signalling in DCs. To address a possible inhibitory effect, we added increasing concentrations of three strains of <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> together with LPS from <italic>E. coli</italic> (1 µg/ml) to DCs. <italic>Ps. luteoviolacea, Ps. ruthenica</italic> and <italic>Ps. spongiae</italic> inhibited the LPS induced IL-12 production, while slightly enhancing the LPS induced IL-10 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425912455208">Figure 2A and B</xref>). In contrast, none of the three strains were able to significantly alter the LPS induced IL-6 or TNF-α cytokine production (data not shown). To rule out that the effect on IL-12 production was not caused by LPS desensitization, we stimulated DCs with two consecutive exposures of 1 µg/ml LPS <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753425912455208">Figure 2C</xref>)<italic>.</italic> In contrast to DCs exposed to <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> prior to stimulation with LPS from <italic>E. coli,</italic> these DCs showed no reduction in IL-12 production<italic>.</italic> Furthermore, application of <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> (10 µg/ml) after <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS stimulation did not result in a reduction in the IL-12 response.

As the growth medium contains yeast extract, which may hold similar immunomodulatory effects, we included fresh medium diluted in the SM as a control. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425912455208">Figure 3A</xref>, fresh medium <italic>per se</italic> exhibited a dose-dependent down-regulation of the LPS-induced IL-12, but did not induce any cytokines when added to the cells alone. In contrast, the SM induced IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-α production by itself, but not IL-12 production. However, when added together with LPS, SM inhibited IL-12 (85% and 92% for the 108 - and 36-fold dilution) markedly more than fresh medium (a 38% and 70% inhibition for the 108 - and 36-fold dilution respectively). SM from <italic>Ps. luteoviolacea</italic> up-regulated IL-10 production, presumably owing to an additive effect of LPS and the immunomodulating compound(s) in the SM. An inhibitory effect on LPS-induced IL-6 production from both fresh medium and SM was also seen. Here, the inhibition was slightly stronger for the fresh medium than for SM (down to approximately 50 ng/ml and 60 ng/ml respectively). In contrast to the slight TNF-α down-regulation of the fresh medium, the SM from cultured <italic>Ps. luteoviolacea</italic> did not change the LPS-induced production of TNF-α.

<p>To exclude that the inhibiting effect was caused by LMM molecules, we separated compounds of a molecular mass of less than 5 ku from the rest of the constituents in the SM from the bacterium <italic>Ps. luteoviolacea</italic> S4054 and marine broth by size-exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753425912455208">Figure 3B</xref>).

Taken together these results show not only that the studied strains of <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> are poor stimulators of DC cytokine production and inhibitors of IL-12 production, but also that shed or secreted HMM components in the SM hold such properties.</p>

As for the intact bacteria, the isolated LPS did not give rise to any IL-12 production. Incubation of the LPS from <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic>, together with the <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS, revealed that despite no IL-12 inducing capacity <italic>per se</italic>, the LPS isolated from <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> were potent IL-12 inhibitors, decreasing the IL-12 production significantly even when added at a 10-fold lower concentration than the <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753425912455208">Figure 4B</xref>).

The fresh medium did not show any detectable endotoxin activity. These endotoxic activities corresponded well with the observed inhibitory activities seen in the TLR4 HEK293 cells. Although fresh MB and SM from <italic>Ps. ruthenica</italic> did not show any remarkable endotoxin activities <italic>per se</italic>, they were able to decrease the <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS-induced response in HEK293 cells.

<p>Finally, we separated the lipid A part from LPS by a mild acidification and obtained PS with very low endotoxic activity (&lt;100 EU/ml) for both strains, indicating a pure PS fraction. When tested in the TLR4 HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1753425912455208">Figure 6B</xref>) they did not induce TLR4 activity nor did they show any significant ability to decrease <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS-induced activation. The various purified fractions in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1753425912455208">Table 1</xref> were run on a SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (data not shown). As found previously, we observed that LPS from both <italic>Ps. luteoviolacea</italic> and <italic>Ps. ruthenica</italic> had a characteristic lipid A band at the bottom of the gel. This characteristic lipid A band was also found for SM from <italic>Ps. luteoviolcea</italic> (data not shown) confirming the data from the LAL assay. In accordance with the data from the LAL-assay, SM from <italic>Ps. ruthenica,</italic> MB and the two PS fractions did not show any lipid A like-bands (data not shown).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results demonstrate the presence of lipid A in the SM of <italic>Ps. luteoviolacea</italic>, as the cause of the antagonistic effect on TLR4 activation and the IL-12 inhibitory effect in <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS-stimulated DCs.</p>

<p>Marine microorganisms represent a novel source of bioactive molecules that may be exploited for pharmaceutical purposes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753425912455208">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1753425912455208">34</xref></sup> With this in mind, in the present study we studied the immunomodulatory properties of the marine bacteria genus <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> in murine bone marrow-derived DCs. In comparison with a selection of other bacteria of marine origin, such as <italic>Vibrio</italic> and <italic>Ruegeria,</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived LPS, the <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains exhibited poor immunostimulatory activity. This could be ascribed to their LPS, which, apart from the poor immunostimulatory capacity, acted as antagonists of <italic>E. coli</italic>-derived LPS. The LPS was, however, still capable of inducing increased endocytosis in the DCs and activating the proteases in the LAL assay<italic>.</italic></p>
<p>The poor immune stimulating properties of the intact bacteria studied here were evident as they only induced a weak production of the IL-12, IL-10 and TNF-α and, additionally, a weak induction of the surface markers CD40 and CD86, involved in T-cell activation. IL-6 production, however, was induced to the same level as in DCs stimulated with <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS or the other marine bacteria tested. The lack of immune stimulation coincided with a potent inhibition of <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS-induced IL-12, indicating that microbial compounds present on the bacteria were able to directly or indirectly abrogate the activation of the DCs by <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS. Some pathogenic bacteria have been shown to be able to escape the immune recognition by repression of the immune response through the binding of carbohydrate moieties to receptors, typically of the C-type lectin class, thus inducing a response counteracting the immune-stimulating effect of LPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1753425912455208">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1753425912455208">36</xref></sup> Moreover, it has been shown that LPS from some Gram-negative species are poor immune stimulators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425912455208">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1753425912455208">37</xref></sup> When testing the immune-modulating activity of the medium harvested upon growth of <italic>Ps. luteoviolacea</italic>, is was evident that the fresh medium contained compounds with immune suppressing activity, but without immune stimulatory capacity, while the SM held immune-suppressing, as well as activating, activity. It is well established that yeast extract present in the growth medium contains β-glucans and we have previously shown that yeast β-glucan is capable of inhibiting the <italic>E. coli</italic>-induced IL-12 but unable to stimulate DC activation <italic>per se.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1753425912455208">38</xref></sup> Of note, in the SM, however, compounds capable of slightly stimulating IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-α production were present. These were HMM compounds and exhibited IL-12 inhibiting activity, greatly exceeding that of fresh medium.</p>
<p>LPS is known to be shed from Gram-negative bacteria into the media and LPS is most often the main ligand in the recognition of Gram-negative bacteria by immune cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1753425912455208">17</xref></sup> By isolating LPS from both the whole bacteria of two <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains, <italic>Ps. luteoviolacea and Ps. ruthenica</italic>, we established LPS as the cause of inhibition of the <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS-induced IL-12. This was further substantiated by the use of the TLR4 transfected HEK cells, where the involvement of other PRRs could be ruled out and the role of LPS confirmed. The TLR4 binding lipid A part of LPS is a highly diverse molecule, with variations in both the number and the length of fatty-acid side chains, and in terminal phosphate residues;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1753425912455208">39</xref></sup> these variations are critical for TLR4 signalling. The hexa-acylated lipid A from <italic>E. coli</italic> with side chains of 12–14 carbon atoms seems to be optimal for stimulation, while tetra- and penta-acylated lipid A are often poorly recognized by the MD2-TLR4-complex and do not lead to TLR4 dimerization, which is central for the induction of down-stream processes in the cell leading to DC maturation and cytokine production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425912455208">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1753425912455208">22</xref></sup> We did not characterize the structures of the LPS or lipid A molecules from the <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains tested in this study; however, the available structures of LPS molecules from five other <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains, <italic>Ps. haloplanktis</italic> TAC 125, <italic>Ps. haloplanktis</italic> ATCC 14393, <italic>Ps. nigrifaciens</italic> IAM 13010<italic>, Ps. tetraodonis</italic> and <italic>Ps. haloplanktis</italic> TAB 23, show that they all contain penta-acylated lipid A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425912455208">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753425912455208"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753425912455208">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425912455208">16</xref></sup> Additionally, a recent study showed that LOS from <italic>Ps. haloplanktis</italic> TAB 23 is penta-acylated and exhibits antagonistic activity towards the <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS-stimulated human monocytic cell line, THP-1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1753425912455208">16</xref></sup> Thus, it is likely that the LPS from the <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> strains investigated in the present study are penta-acylated and that this renders them low stimulators and antagonists. Strikingly, we did not find that LPS from <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> inhibited induction of TNF-α upon stimulation with <italic>E. coli</italic> in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that either other components in <italic>E. coli</italic> induce the majority of the TNF-α production or that LPS induces the TNF-α production through other pathways. We have obtained very similar results by stimulation of DCs with <italic>E. coli</italic> and LPS from <italic>E. coli</italic> (data not shown) and, moreover, as we show in TLR4-transformed HEK cells, that TLR4 ligation by <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS is antagonized by the <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> LPS, we find it likely that <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS may induce TNF-α production in DCs through other pathways than through TLR4.</p>
<p>Despite the very similar antagonistic nature of the purified LPS from <italic>Ps. luteoviolaceae</italic> and <italic>Ps. ruthenica</italic>, respectively, the molecular mass patterns revealed by SDS-PAGE were highly distinct. While the <italic>Ps. luteoviolacea</italic> LPS exhibited a marked band around 30 ku, indicative of a high molecular mass O-antigen moiety, the <italic>Ps. ruthenica</italic> LPS showed lower MM bands, but only two as compared with a high number in <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS. However, both <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> LPS showed marked lipid A bands of comparable size and concentration that were markedly different from that of <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS. This indicates that the type of carbohydrate of the O-antigen, and possibly also the core carbohydrate, is of minor, or any, significance for the immune stimulating and antagonistic properties.</p>
<p>Remarkably, despite the lack of immune stimulating activity, the isolated <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> LPS was as potent as <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS in inducing increased endocytosis in the DC. It was shown recently that the binding of LPS to CD14 is required for induction of endocytosis and, hence, uptake of dextran particles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1753425912455208">40</xref></sup> The lipid A part is recognized by CD14, which directs the further binding of the LPS molecule to MD2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1753425912455208">41</xref></sup> To this end it is also worth noticing that all <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> stains exhibited smooth colony morphology when grown on agar plates. It has previously been shown that rough LPS of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> may bind to TLR4/MD2 and activate TLR4 dimerizaton without the assistance of CD14, while CD14 is indispensable in the induction of a TLR4-mediated response to smooth LPS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1753425912455208">42</xref></sup> Thus, even though the <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> LPS is not able to bind to MD2/TLR4 in a way that leads to TLR4 dimerization, it may still bind to CD14 and thus induce endocytosis and the transfer of LPS to the MD2 protein.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that the <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> LPS was able to activate the enzymatic process in the LAL assay. The endotoxin activity determined by the LAL assay corresponded nicely to the antagonistic capacity of the same samples, for example compared with SM from <italic>Ps. luteoviolaceae</italic>. <italic>Ps. ruthenica</italic> SM exhibited a substantially weaker antagonistic activity both in DC and in the HEK cells. This corresponds well with the much lower concentration of LPS in the <italic>Ps. ruthenica</italic> SM. The activation of the serine protease factor C is dependent on the lipid A moiety in LPS;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1753425912455208">43</xref></sup> hence, it must do so in a way that does not differentiate between structural differences, for example differences in acylation, of the lipid A moiety.</p>
<p>We used DCs to investigate the stimulatory and antagonistic properties of <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> LPS. By ligation of innate receptors, DCs become activated and link the innate and adaptive immunity, Although DCs are likely to play only a minor role in septic shock and upon LPS stimulation display a cytokine profile distinct from that of LPS stimulated monocytes or neutrophils, we believe that all endocytosing cells expressing TLR4 may be equally valuable in assessing putative TLR4 antagonists.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have shown that two strains of <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> isolated from marine habitats owing to the structure of the LPS are poor immunostimulators with antagonistic properties. The LPS is still capable of inducing endocytosis in DCs and in activating the LAL endotoxin assay. LPS molecules from <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> might, by their antagonistic activity, find use as inhibitors of LPS induced sepsis. However, in order to establish such potential, studies of the effects on human phagocytes, in particular of neutrophils, as well as <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of the <italic>Pseudoalteromonas</italic> LPS, need to be done.</p>
