<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the first introduction of laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) in 2007,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612436567">1</xref></sup> LESS has gained wide interest among laparoendoscopists. LESS allows passage of multiple laparoscopic instruments at the same time through commercial or homemade single-port device. The major advantages of LESS lied in better aesthetics, diminished number of port-site skin incisions, fewer port site–related complications, possibly rapid recovery, and less postoperative pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612436567">2</xref></sup> As such, many efforts have been made to develop related techniques and widen the applications of LESS. Till date, LESS has been applied in a variety of urological procedures, including nephrectomy, renal cyst unroofing, adrenalectomy, varicocelectomy, and herniorrhaphy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612436567">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612436567"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612436567">4</xref></sup> However, reports on the feasibility and safety of performing more than 2 procedures with single-site incision remain scarce. Therefore, we reported our preliminary experience with a case of left renal tumor and bilateral inguinal hernia undergoing LESS totally extraperitoneal herniorrhaphy (TEP) and transperitoneal radical nephrectomy through a transumbilical homemade single-port device at the same time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1553350612436567" sec-type="subjects">
<title>Patient</title>
<p>A 56-year-old man presented with incidental left renal mass demonstrated on abdominal ultrasound at health examination. Computed tomography of the abdomen confirmed the presence of a solitary heterogeneous mass measuring 5 cm across in left kidney. The tumor was located adjacent to renal hilum without evidence of local invasion and showed enhancement following intravenous contrast medium. Under the tentative diagnosis of stage I renal cell carcinoma, laparoscopic radical nephrectomy was recommended. However, the patient also had a concomitantly diagnosed bilateral inguinal hernia, and preferred receiving radical nephrectomy and bilateral herniorrhaphy in a single treatment session. As we had previously performed LESS radical nephrectomy and LESS TEP with homemade single-port, respectively, on some patients, a back-to-back LESS operation through transumbilical port was attempted on the patient with the intent of reducing the number of port site incisions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1553350612436567">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>Under endotracheal general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a supine position. A 1.5-cm subumbilical incision was made. The wound was deepened into posterior rectus sheath and the preperitoneal space was created with the assistance of finger dissection followed by balloon dilators. We deployed an extra-small Alexis wound retractor (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA) over the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612436567">Figure 1A</xref>). Two sterile surgical gloves, with upper halves, including finger part truncated, were secured onto the retractor. Three standard trocars (one 10 mm and two 5 mm) were inserted through the gloves and secured by purse-string sutures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612436567">Figure 1B</xref>). A 10-mm 30° rigid telescope and standard laparoscopic instruments were employed for dissections and manipulations. The preperitoneal pressure was set at 12 mm Hg. Bilateral indirect herniac sacs were ligated with intracorporeal ties using 1-0 silk, and then transected. Two pieces of polypropylene mesh measuring 10 × 15 cm were used for tension free repair of posterior wall. Fixation of the mesh at the Coopers ligament and iliopubic tract was performed with titanium spiral tacks (ProTack, AutoSuture, Covidien, Mansfield, MA). Preperitoneal space was later deflated and a 3M Opsite was applied on the wound for aseptic reason.</p>

</fig>
<p>For subsequent radical nephrectomy, the position of patient was changed to a 60° flank position. After prepping and draping, the wound in subumbilicus was extended upward, measuring 4.5 cm, and deepened into the peritoneal space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612436567">Figure 2A</xref>). A small-size Alexis wound retractor (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA) was applied over the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350612436567">Figure 3A</xref>). Three standard trocars (two 10 mm and one 5 mm) were inserted through a double-layered sterile surgical glove and secured by purse-string sutures as described previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350612436567">Figure 3B</xref>). A 10-mm 30° rigid telescope and traditional laparoscopic instruments were employed. Facilitated with Harmonic Scalpel (Ethicon, Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical SPA, Somerville, NJ), the kidney along with Gerota’s fascia was circumferentially dissected away from surrounding tissue, sparing only the renal hilum. Following exposure of the great vessels, the renal artery and vein were ligated separately with Hem-o-Lok clips (Weck Closure Systems, Research Triangle Park, NC) and then transected. The specimen was entrapped with a retrieval bag and pulled out of the abdomen through the wound retractor. Later, the wound was closed in layers.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The operation time was 80 minutes for herniorrhaphy and 190 minutes for radical nephrectomy each without perioperative complications, including conversion to standard laparoscopic or open surgery. The estimated blood loss was minimal (100) mL for TEP and radical nephrectomy. The specimen measured 12 × 7 × 6 cm with the tumor at one pole. Pathology confirmed the diagnosis of low-grade stage I renal cell carcinoma of the left kidney. During convalescence, the patient resumed oral intake on the second postoperative day and recovered rapidly. With cosmetically satisfactory outcome of the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350612436567">Figure 2B</xref>), the patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day. At 6 months follow-up, the patient has been without any recurrent episode of hernia, local recurrence, or tumor.</p>

<sec id="section5-1553350612436567" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In comparison with standard laparoscopic surgery, the major advantages of LESS lie in diminished number of trocar site incisions and the ability to complete operation with standard laparoscopic instruments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612436567">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612436567">5</xref></sup> Despite the fact that LESS had been successfully carried out in a variety of urological procedures, reports on multiple procedures through LESS technique remain sparse. Our preliminary experience demonstrated technical feasibility of performing 2 LESS procedures within 1 incisional wound. Extraperitoneal surgery for hernia did not compromise the feasibility of subsequent LESS transperitoneal radical nephrectomy. The novel LESS technique greatly reduced the number of the port site wounds as compared with standard laparscopic radical nephrectomy and TEP, which require more number of ports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612436567">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612436567">7</xref></sup> Additionally, we used homemade single-port devices deployed on extra-small and small Alex wound retractors that were not only inexpensive but also durable throughout the operation sparing the use of extraumbilical port.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612436567">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The learning curve for a laparoscopist to master LESS could be steep by virtue of the technical disadvantages of LESS pertaining to loss of triangulation, collision of instruments, and in-line vision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612436567">5</xref></sup> Before embarking on LESS through transumbilical port, we had experienced with more than 10 procedures of LESS TEP and 3 LESS transperitoneal radical nephrectomy. The operative time in this patient was rational when compared with that in other series,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612436567">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612436567">9</xref></sup> which was 80 and 190 minutes for LESS TEP and LESS radical nephrectomy, respectively. No related intraoperative complications occurred during the operation. Two procedures with LESS not only rendered better cosmetic results but also reduced the potential port site–related complications. Besides, wound adhesions could make subsequent procedure difficult in establishing transumbilical port if 2 procedures were carried out separately at different points in time.</p>
<p>Several types of commercial single-port devices have been introduced to the market,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612436567">5</xref></sup> which are not yet available in Taiwan. The ideal platform remains undetermined by the expert opinions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612436567">5</xref></sup> We employed the homemade single-port devices developed by Tai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612436567">10</xref></sup> The technique has been shown to be applicable in various kinds of procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612436567">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612436567">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612436567">11</xref></sup> For LESS TEP and LESS radical nephrectomy, the technique for establishing homemade single-port setting was analogous with the exception of the larger size of the Alex wound retractor for LESS nephrectomy. While establishing the homemade single-port setting, the finger part of the surgical gloves applied on the wound retractors required truncation since intraperitoneal operative space was quite large. We felt comfortable using the homemade single-port device for operation.</p>
<p>We chose the umbilicus as the salient site of access because both the LESS TEP and LESS nephrectomy can be performed via this access. The surgery started with LESS TEP and the incision that was made at the subumbilical area measured 1.5 cm. Following completion of LESS TEP, the wound was extended upward for subsequent LESS nephrectomy. The final hook-shaped incision might pose the risk of compromising blood supply of the umbilicus despite the satisfactory result of the wound healing in this patient. Accordingly, we recommend that the initial wound for LESS TEP be positioned more laterally in back-to-back operation requiring extension of the wound.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report on performing 2 procedures satisfactorily with single-site incision that greatly diminished the number of port site incisions with obvious economic advantage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1553350612436567" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We report on the preliminary experience with simultaneous TEP and transperitoneal radical nephrectomy for reduced risk of invasion and good aesthetics. In our opinion, a patient eligible for laparoscopic approach may be a candidate for the novel LESS with 2 or more procedures carried out simultaneously. Further studies on 2 procedures with LESS are warranted to widen the applications.</p>
