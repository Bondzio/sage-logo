<p>Until a scholarly relationship between Pareto and Benito Mussolini, which never occurred, was claimed by the dictator in his 1928 autobiography, then embroidered upon during the Second World War when a false link was posited between Pareto’s “circulation of elites” and the bombastic historical claims of fascist propaganda, Pareto was a social scientist whom all educated people were supposed to know about, and to admire. He was lionized at Harvard by Lawrence Henderson, both in his famous weekly seminar and in <italic>Pareto’s General Sociology: A Physiologist’s Interpretation</italic> (1935), appreciatively scrutinized by George Homans in his first monograph (1934), and analyzed in detail by Parsons in his <italic>Structure of Social Action</italic> (1937). More astonishingly, in 1933 Pareto was introduced by Vincent Canby in the <italic>Saturday Review of Literature</italic> and by Bernard DeVoto in <italic>Harper’s</italic> to an earnest middle-class readership, who wanted to learn about “non-logical action” and the “irrational” roots of the global socio-economic crisis they were enduring. At that time most readers surely did not understood that he had invented modern econometrics (“Pareto ophelimity” or “optimality”), that he had developed a full-fledged theory and critique of socialism, and that at one point he wrote hundreds of political essays in a vigorous effort to be elected to the Italian parliament. But they did want to know about his sociology, translated from the 1912/16 Italian original and retitled for the anglophone audience as <italic>Mind and Society: A Treatise on General Sociology</italic> (4 volumes; Harcourt, Brace, and Co., 1935), and were willing pay a lot to read it. For a time, Pareto was much more than a footnote in basic economics textbooks, and was considered essential to political sociology, economic sociology, and social psychology.</p>
<p>The editors of this new volume want to reinstate Pareto into the pantheon, and in a big way: “This volume explores Pareto’s astonishingly varied intellectual contribution from a range of disciplinary perspectives, the main intention being to show why it remains relevant and should not simply be consigned to the history of ideas. Pareto was an almost obsessive polymath, whose refusal to recognise disciplinary boundaries has few parallels. It might even be ventured that he deserves the categorisation of universal genius, commonly reserved for such as Leonardo da Vinci, owing to the sheer breadth and diversity of his talent and enduring insight” (p. 1). Naturally, this sort of rapturous claim invites chuckles from non-believers, yet the editors’ sentiments become less improbable as one goes through the nine chapters (by scholars from the United States, Australia, Britain, Iceland, and France) treating Pareto’s theories of elites, stratification, social systems, political theory, risk, elite cycles, collective beliefs, his rhetoric, and his heretofore unknown 1921 manuscript on money (most of which is composed of equations).</p>
<p>I would urge prospective students of Pareto—which this book might well cause to increase—to begin their study with Giorgio Baruchello’s chapter on Pareto’s rhetoric, there being nothing else like it in English. Pareto was a great polemicist, and until his special use of language is appreciated, the full weight of his achievement cannot be comprehended or enjoyed to the extent it should be. American scholars will find refreshingly instructive the chapters by their countrymen, François Neilsen (on stratification research), Charles Power (on social systems), and John Higley (elite cycles), since so little reference is made to Pareto nowadays in sociology. Given the high quality of their work, and that of others in this densely constructed book, this avoidance of Pareto’s obvious genius seems increasingly irresponsible—whether or not he rises to the level of Leonardo.</p>
