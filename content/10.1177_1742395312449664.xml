<abstract>
<p>The home-based care programme in Botswana was initiated partly to augment hospital or clinical care by reducing the healthcare costs associated with chronic illnesses such as HIV/AIDS. A number of studies have pointed to the psyco-social impacts of home based care, however there has been few attempts to quantify the direct and indirect costs associated with home based care. This study was carried out in the North West District of Botswana, which is noted for a relatively larger proportion of households with critically ill persons. The objectives of the study were to identify the characteristics of the caregivers and their patients; to estimate the direct and indirect costs of home-based care; and to estimate caregivers’ willingness to pay for care services. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire addressed to 120 primary caregivers and analyzed using SPSS. The economic cost of caregiving was estimated using the replacement cost method. The annual value per caregiver was estimated at P31 320 (US$4818.46). The study also revealed that more often than not, women are involved in caregiving activities.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1742395312449664" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The HIV/AIDS pandemic and other terminal diseases continue to cause widespread infections and deaths worldwide. Many countries including those in sub saharan Africa continue to divert their meager financial resources to the management of these diseases. For instance, in South Africa, government’s expenditure on managing HIV/AIDS increased substantially from R30 million in 1994 to R3 billion in 2005.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742395312449664">1</xref></sup> In Botswana, the Central Statistics Office<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395312449664">2</xref></sup> estimated the national HIV/AIDS incidence rate at 2.9% (3.5% and 2.3% for females and males, respectively). A majority of continuously ill persons in Botswana has AIDS-related conditions, and up to 49% of all households are likely to have at least one member infected by the HIV virus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742395312449664">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742395312449664"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742395312449664">5</xref></sup> The economic and health challenges of this situation are the continually rising costs of hospital admissions, recruitment of physicians, drugs, and other professional services in hospitals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742395312449664">6</xref></sup> The government is therefore faced with a great challenge of reducing the escalating healthcare costs of these diseases. The establishment of home-based care (HBC) programmes throughout the country has been one of the options wielded by the Government.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742395312449664">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Extensive research has been carried out on the psyco-social impact of care provided at home. One of the reported impacts is a worsening health condition when the caregiver contracts the disease from the patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742395312449664">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742395312449664">9</xref></sup> Akintola<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742395312449664">10</xref></sup> found that elderly women who were caring for their children had chronic diseases such arthritis and diabetes and were reporting deteriorating health. The deterioration of the health condition of the caregiver has been attributed to the fact that the strained or emotionally affected caregiver pays less attention to her own health when providing care to a family member.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742395312449664">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395312449664">12</xref></sup> While the need to carry out research on the psyco-social impact of HBC remains important, there is dearth of information on the economic costs borne by the caregivers. This situation is to a large extent purported by the fact that resource allocation decisions on HBC are based on the total estimated visible costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742395312449664">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395312449664">14</xref></sup> The time spent in providing care cannot go beyond that of direct medical expenditure simply because the time costs of HBC are socially and politically invisible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742395312449664">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742395312449664"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395312449664"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742395312449664">18</xref></sup> The lack of such information implies that little is known about the extent to which chronic and terminal diseases such as HIV/AIDS impact on those providing care, and second, that there is high likelihood of misallocation of heath care resources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742395312449664">11</xref></sup> The questions of what constitute the characteristics of caregivers and their patients in the North West District; the direct and indirect costs of HBC; and how much caregivers are willing to pay for care services, therefore, arise. These and others will be addressed in the paper.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1742395312449664"><title>The concept of HBC</title>
<p>HBC programme is all about the provision of healthcare to any ill persons in their homes by family members<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395312449664">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742395312449664">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742395312449664"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742395312449664"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742395312449664">22</xref></sup> or non-family members supported by skilled non-medical professionals such as social welfare officers and community volunteers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742395312449664">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742395312449664"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742395312449664">25</xref></sup> In the context of Botswana, an HBC patient is a person who has been medically diagnosed as terminally or chronically ill, including HIV/AIDS-related diseases, and who after an evaluation of his/her socio-economic status is found to be in need of material assistance on medical grounds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742395312449664">26</xref></sup> Non-clinical care provided by caregivers also includes custodial care (cooking, cleaning, feeding, helping with toiletry, administration of remedies and treatment, nuanced elements of love and healing). Most studies have found the role of caregiving to be more often associated with women than men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742395312449664">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742395312449664">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742395312449664">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742395312449664">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742395312449664">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the operation of HBC may differ from country to country, it is a widely embraced concept.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742395312449664">29</xref></sup> Different HBC programmes have been implemented in most countries including Rwanda,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742395312449664">30</xref></sup> Uganda,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742395312449664">31</xref></sup> South Africa,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742395312449664">32</xref></sup> and Japan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742395312449664">33</xref></sup> In Rwanda, HBC services are provided or delivered through volunteer networks in the community with Non-Governmental Organizations programme staff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742395312449664">30</xref></sup> The benefit of the programme to caregivers and patients include psycho-social support to the affected families, emphasising the importance of reducing stigma, income-generating activities, and assisting with school fees for people living with HIV/AIDS and their children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742395312449664">30</xref></sup> In Uganda, caregivers benefit significantly from monthly support group meetings that are organised by programme counsellors and social workers where pertinent issues (such as health education, education about HIV and its prevention, nutritional advice, and providing nutritional support for a child with inter-current infection) are discussed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742395312449664">31</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1742395312449664"><title>Direct costs of HBC</title>
<p>Direct costs associated with HBC fall under the general categories of public (government) cost and costs incurred by a caregiver as a result of meeting the patient’s different needs. These costs vary from country to country and from situation to situation and include recurrent costs, capital costs, and training costs for programme management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742395312449664">30</xref></sup> In Rwanda, formal facility-based care (FBC) has been found to have higher estimated costs per client than community-based care, with costs per client ranging from US$31.20 to US$36.01 per month, while the estimated costs of community-based care ranged from US$12.75 to US$24.53 per month.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742395312449664">30</xref></sup> In Zimbabwe, Hasen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742395312449664">6</xref></sup> found that the costs per home visit in an FBC outreach programme ranged from Z$518 to Z$735 in two urban HBC schemes and ranged from Z$1 256 to Z$1 377 in two rural programmes. In Botswana, the recurrent public costs of HBC include those of supplying food baskets, medical check-up, school uniform for needy students, and payment for volunteer services. The government provides food baskets for six categories of patients: (1) relatively healthy patients, (2) terminally ill patients who are not on tube feeding, (3) terminally ill patients on tube feeding, (4) children aged 4 months to 2 years who are not on tube feeding, (5) children aged 4 months to 2 years who are on tube feeding, and (6) needy diabetic patients.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1742395312449664"><title>Indirect costs of HBC</title>
<p>It is generally thought that informal care is provided for free. However, the time spent in providing informal care has an opportunity cost (it cannot be used for other paid work in other productive activities).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395312449664">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742395312449664">34</xref></sup> Several economic valuation techniques have been used in estimating the value of time used in informal caregiving. These include the opportunity cost method, replacement cost method (also called the proxy good method), contingent valuation method, and the wellbeing valuation method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1742395312449664">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742395312449664"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1742395312449664">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>The opportunity cost method measures the income forgone by a caregiver who spends time providing care rather than undertaking paid work.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742395312449664">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742395312449664">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742395312449664">34</xref></sup> The method is based on the assumption that if caregivers were not engaged in caring activities, they would be employed at the same hourly wage rate as members of the general population of the same age and gender.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742395312449664">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742395312449664">34</xref></sup> Thus, the hours spent on caring for the sick person are valued at a–would–be-wage rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742395312449664">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>The replacement cost method estimates the value of informal care at the price of the market substitute.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742395312449664">38</xref></sup> The technique estimates the cost of buying the number of hours of informal care provided from the formal care sector.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742395312449664">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742395312449664">34</xref></sup> According to Langa et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742395312449664">11</xref></sup> the replacement cost method asks or provides an answer to the following question: “how much would it cost an entity such as a government’ to pay a professional or a formally employed caregiver such as a nurse in a hospital, for using the same number of hours as those used by an informal caregiver at home?” The method therefore values hours of informal care at the wage rate of a professional caregiver and consequently assumes that professional care and informal care are perfect substitutes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742395312449664">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>Contingent valuation method, a direct economic valuation technique, ascertains individual valuations of hypothetical scenarios when market data are not available.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1742395312449664">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742395312449664">39</xref></sup> In this method, the valuation of non-priced good such as time is solicited through the willingness to pay (WTP) or willingness to accept (WTA). For instance, among patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and their caregivers, Van den Berg et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1742395312449664">35</xref></sup> investigated care recipients’ WTP for an additional hour of informal care per week and their WTA for a reduction by 1 hour in the amount of caregiving they received, while informal caregivers were asked about their WTP to reduce the amount of informal care they provided by 1 hour per week and WTA to provide an additional hour of informal care per week.</p>
<p>The wellbeing valuation method is based on the indirect cost of providing informal care in terms of loss of the wellbeing suffered by the caregiver.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742395312449664">36</xref></sup> The individual wellbeing of the caregiver, such as the level of happiness, is measured by means of a self-reported wellbeing question where the individual is asked to indicate the level of happiness by numerical values chosen from a given scale such 0–10.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742395312449664">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>Most studies use recall method or diary method to estimate the amount of time used in caregiving. The diary method requires respondents to record activities that they perform in caregiving and the time spent on each activity, while the recall method requires respondents to remember the time spent in caregiving-related activities a day or a week earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395312449664">17</xref></sup> One limitation of the diary method is that it is time consuming and requires that the caregiver is literate or has access to someone who could help in taking the records, while the limitation for the recall method is that subjects may not remember exactly what they did a day or a week earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395312449664">17</xref></sup></p>

<p>This study was undertaken in the North West District in Botswana during the months of February to April in 2009. The North West District was chosen because of its relatively larger proportion of households with critically ill persons. According to Central Statistics Office,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742395312449664">40</xref></sup> 12.9% of the households in the North West District had critically ill persons. The HIV/AIDS prevalence and incidence in the district is also high, especially in the south of the district which has a prevalence rate of 19.8% (16.4% and 22.6% for males and females, respectively) and an incidence of 4.8% for both sexes, while the prevalence in the north of the district is estimated slightly lower at 16.5% (10.9% and 21.0% for males and females, respectively) and incidence at 3.89%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742395312449664">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The specific sites for the study were Maun and Gumare villages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1742395312449664">Figure 1</xref>). Maun is the largest village in the district with an extensive regional catchment that extends to even further than the district boundaries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1742395312449664">41</xref></sup> The population of Maun was estimated at 55,784.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742395312449664">40</xref></sup> Being the largest village in the district, it is the administrative centre, the tribal capital, and regional service centre for the district. Gumare village is located in the North West edge of the Okavango Delta and falls within the administrative area of North West District whose administrative centre is Maun.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1742395312449664">42</xref></sup> It is a sub-district centre for the Okavango sub-district. The population of Gumare is estimated at 7827.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742395312449664">40</xref></sup> The choice of Gumare village was based on the fact that it is rapidly developing, making the direct and indirect costs associated with HBC more visible than in other villages.

<sec id="sec8-1742395312449664"><title>Data collection</title>
<p>A structured questionnaire was developed, pre-tested among 10 HBC primary caregivers in Toteng (a small village situated about 60 kilometres south west of Maun), and then modified accordingly. A list of names of 120 home-based primary caregivers and 140 registered patients was obtained from the Social and Community Development Office in Maun and Gumare. More than half of these caregivers (78%) were from Maun and the remaining were from Gumare. All of the 120 caregivers were intervied. Caregivers were assured that their responses would be kept confidential. And because of the sensitivity and stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, they were not obliged to disclose information about the illnesses of their patients. Secondary data, including government expenditure related to HBC programme, were obtained from published and unpublished sources. Informal discussions that contributed to the general knowledge of HBC were held with social welfare officers.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1742395312449664"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The direct costs estimated included government expenditure on administering the HBC programme for the period 2008–2009, and the cost incurred by the caregiver at home during 2009. The government-incurred costs included the cost of supplying food baskets, medical check-up, HBC volunteer services, and costs related to conducting HBC workshops. These data were obtained from the Social and Community Development Office in Maun but were not available in Gumare.</p>
<p>The direct private costs incurred by the caregiver at home related to purchase of items such as supplementary food and transportation of the caregiver when visiting the hospitalised patient. It is not uncommon for critically ill HBC patients to be hospitalised. Data on these private costs were obtained by interviewing caregivers.</p>
<p>Transportation costs were estimated by assuming that a caregiver used local public transport (<italic>kombis</italic>) to visit a hospitalised patient twice a day (morning and evening):

<p>The indirect cost estimate was done with respect to time spent in caregiving during 2009. However, the number of hours dedicated to caregiving was not estimated directly because caregivers could not separate hours spent in caregiving activities and those used for normal day-to-day activities in the household. To estimate the cost of time in caregiving, the replacement cost method was used. It was assumed that HBC activities are similar to those performed at FBC (e.g. feeding and changing bed sheets) by hospital orderlies or nurse assistants. In addition, most of the caregivers in this study had similar level of education and skills as hospital orderlies, and therefore if they were to be paid a wage, they would be paid the same minimum daily rate as the hospital orderlies. The prevailing minimum daily rate for the hospital orderlies used was BWP86.75 (1USA$ = 6.50BWP).</p>
<p>Based on this information, the annual expenditure in the form of salaries for all the caregivers in this study has been calculated from:

<p>Caregivers had varied sources of income and these included formal employments, self-employment, farming, and working in the drought-relief programme. Many of caregivers’ households (79%) did not have any cash income (Figure 2). Only 1% of the households had three members with some cash income.

<p>Since inception of the HBC programme in 1996 and the subsequent introduction of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment, a number of patients enrolled in these programmes. While some patients have survived, others succumbed to the illness. A majority of caregivers (72%) reported that in the past 5 years they provided care to one chronically ill patient, 16% provided care to two chronically ill patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1742395312449664">Figure 3</xref>).

<p>Using the minimum daily rate for the hospital orderlies of BWP86.75, the annual expenditure in the form of salary equivalence for all the caregivers has been calculated to be BWP3,758,400. On an annual basis, each caregiver would cost the government BWP31,320 in the form of a wage.</p>
<p>The need for providing care to home-based patients has impacted negatively on caregivers who gave up jobs to provide this service. Some of the caregivers (11%) stated that they gave up jobs in order to care for their patients. Of those who reported to have given up jobs, 8% belonged to households without cash income. The forgone income as a result of giving up jobs ranged from BWP18 to BWP1000/month. On the average, the caregivers had forgone a monthly income of BWP247.31 (SD = 153.8) or BWP2967.72 per annum in 2009.</p>
<p>For 32% of the 140 patients, caregivers were willing to pay for care services provided by someone other than themselves. The maximum stated WTP for care services ranged from BWP150 to BWP1500/month. The monthly average wage was BWP424.44 (SD = 228.0) or P14.15 per day, which is six times less than the minimum daily rate for hospital orderlies. For the rest of the patients, primary caregivers were not willing to pay for the provision of this service, mostly stating that the service provider would not provide good care as themselves.</p>

<sec id="sec15-1742395312449664"><title>Characteristics of caregiving</title>
<p>This study has revealed that females, as compared to males, were mostly involved in caregiving activities. This finding is consistent with that of other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742395312449664">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395312449664">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742395312449664">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742395312449664">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742395312449664">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742395312449664">28</xref></sup> According to Asia-Pacific Economic Corporation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1742395312449664">44</xref></sup> women in most countries perform the bulk of unpaid work, of which caregiving is a part. Providing care to a chronically ill person on a full-time basis, or for more than one patient simultaneously, and the undertaking of other unpaid work such as household maintenance, cooking, cleaning, clothing, and water collection is overwhelming to women. While males have other roles to play at household level, Elsen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1742395312449664">45</xref></sup> argues that the problem why women are overburdened with work is due to a phenomenon called ‘male bias,’ ‘a bias that operates in favour of men as a gender, and against women as a gender, not that all men are biased against women’. Thus, in the context of this study, caregiving is a gendered task and seen as a woman’s work. Our informal discussion also revealed that men generally perceived HBC to be the role of women in society.</p>
<p>This study also revealed that parents, spouses, daughters, sons, sisters, and brothers of patients provide most of the care at home. Elsewhere, other studies have also buttressed this.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742395312449664">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742395312449664">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742395312449664">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742395312449664">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742395312449664">34</xref></sup> In terms of home-based support, the relatives are better placed to provide the much needed love and immediate healthcare to patients at all times. In this study, more often than not for a majority of patients, the primary caregiver was the parent. It is not surprising, therefore, that a parent would care for more than one patient (who happen to be his sons or daughters) at the same time. A majority of the primary caregivers in this study were from households or families without cash income. Without cash income, caregivers may not adequately provide even the most basic need such as food for the patient. This can be burdensome on caregivers especially those caring for patients with critical condition (e.g. terminally ill patients).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1742395312449664"><title>The cost of caregiving</title>
<p>Among the different components of public costs, the highest proportion (93%) of costs was that of food ration probably because the government commits a lot of resources to provide adequate and special diet for improved health of patients, especially the terminally ill and children. According to NuLife–Food and Nutrition Interventions for Uganda and USAID Health Care Improvement Project,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1742395312449664">46</xref></sup> nutritional status is an important determinant of HIV disease progression and is associated with mortality even in patients on ARV therapy. Clearly, the direct public costs constitute a small proportion of the costs of caring for a patient at FBC such as a hospital as some of the costs are borne by the caregiver.</p>
<p>The replacement value for caregiving for the 120 caregivers was estimated to be BWP3,758,400 or BWP26845.7/patient. This is essentially a hidden cost of care provided at home. Assuming that government was to transfer all HBC patients to FBC, it would incur this cost in the form of recruiting additional hospital orderlies. Furthermore, this is only a conservative estimate of the costs because under such a scenario, the government would also incur the cost of recruiting more medical doctors to provide a service commensurate with increased patients.</p>
<p>The lost cash income due to jobs given up by some of the caregivers amounted to wages of up to BWP1000 per month. This can be regarded as an opportunity cost of a decision to provide care. These phenomena are not only peculiar to Botswana. Other studies have also found that caregivers gave up both leisure and work-related activities to provide care to patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742395312449664">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742395312449664">22</xref></sup> The National Alliance for Caregiving (1997) in USA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742395312449664">16</xref></sup> found in a national survey of dementia caregivers that 26% of the respondents did not have free time because of their commitment to caregiving, 6% turned down a promotion, while 10% had to retire early to provide caregiving. The Australian Bureau of Statistics Study (2005)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742395312449664">34</xref></sup> found that about 36% of the caregivers in 2003 that were unemployed or not in the labour force expressed the desire to return to work, especially on a part-time basis. In the current study, all primary caregivers who gave up a job indicated they would still be working had it not been for their commitment to caregiving.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1742395312449664"><title>WTP for caregiving services</title>
<p>The maximum WTP for providing caregiving services as revealed by this study ranged from BWP150 and BWP1000 (US$23-US$154) per month. On a daily basis, this was calculated to be BWP14.15. This figure can be regarded as the value of time attached to providing care at home. The figure was six times lower than the minimum daily rate of hospital orderly performing almost similar activities in a health FBC. Caregivers stated a lower figure for WTP possibly because they regarded their care-providing services to be inferior or of lower quality than those offered at the FBC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742395312449664">11</xref></sup> Secondly, primary caregivers consider their home-caring service to be cultural and inherently unpaid work and therefore unethical to place any monetary value on it. Unlike this study, a telephone survey of family caregivers of dementia patient in Taiwan had a much higher maximum WTP to receive a nursing home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1742395312449664">8</xref></sup> They found that 89% of the respondents were willing to pay for a nursing home replacement and that 37.5% of the respondents were willing to pay at least 50% of their income for receiving such as service. The study found that the WTP to receive these services ranged from US$185–US$2407 per month, which was 8–13 times the stated WTP for caregiving services probably because of the differences in the levels of incomes of caregivers.</p>

<sec id="sec18-1742395312449664"><title>Conclusions and policy implications</title>
<p>Women are the main caregivers in northern Botswana, providing care mostly to their sick relatives. Care provided to patients, which involves activities such as cooking, bathing patients, taking patients to health facilities, and administration of medicine, is burdened by caring for terminally ill patients, caring for patients on full-time basis, and caring for more than one patient simultaneously. Out-of-pocket costs, giving up jobs for the sake of providing care, and being without cash income all add to the burden of caregiving. As unpaid work, HBC has hidden or indirect costs.</p>
<p>The government should intensify home-based education and extend it to males so that the responsibility of caring for patients at home can be shared by men and women. This will inevitably change the perception among men that HBC is a ‘woman’s role’.</p>
<p>While the Government of Botswana cannot provide direct payment or care allowance for primary caregivers, the burden of caregiving can be reduced by increasing the budget for volunteers who assist caregivers with most of the caregiving activities at home.</p>
