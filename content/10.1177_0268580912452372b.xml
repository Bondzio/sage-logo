<p>Over the last two decades, the map of collective action theory and social movements has transformed rapidly. What was a relatively limited field since the 1960s (with the institutionalizing of the debate in academic, geographic and epistemic terms) became a much more dynamic field, open to new disciplines, places, areas of study, types of research, methodologies and worldviews, although much more fragmented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0268580912452372">Klandermans and Roggeband, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0268580912452372">McAdam et al., 2001</xref>). Although there has been no radical rupture with the previous debate, recent elements take into account some of the classic theoretical formulations and ask for a new sociological imagination that would be capable of capturing both the new practices by social actors and the emerging sociopolitical and global scenario.</p>
<p>One of the biggest contemporary challenges is to create analytic perspectives that go beyond methodological nationalism and the nation-state as a given analytic unit. Transnational networks and flows, campaigns, protests and supranational events have reaffirmed internationalism in the past decades, at the same time that alter-globalization has become one of the central global actors. However, despite its importance in renewing contemporary political activism and an incipient global civil society, there are very few thorough, systematic and holistic analyses about the alter-globalization movement as an actor. Because of this, the book <italic>Alter-Globalization: Becoming Actors in the Global Age</italic> by Geoffrey Pleyers is welcomed to the field and beyond, complementing and shifting the focus of both the more militant reports (whether it be grassroots activists or the more well-known intellectuals of the World Social Forum) and the academic literature on transnational activism more centred on the impacts, advocacy, organization and the interactive dynamics between the actors and the action (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0268580912452372">Keck and Sikkink, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0268580912452372">Tarrow, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Beginning with his fieldwork, which took more than 10 years and brought him to several countries, Pleyers projects a complex view of the alter-globalization movement, alternating narratives and perspectives within the movement and a rigorous analysis that captures the movement’s potentials, contradictions and creative tensions. His aim is to analyse the alter-globalization movement as a historical actor, cohesive in meaning, developing an analytic perspective on the logic of its actions. To do this, Pleyers reconstructs the ‘grammar’ of the movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0268580912452372">McDonald, 2006</xref>) beyond the habitual dichotomies of reform/revolution, action/structure, unity/heterogeneity, and instead seeks to value the diversity of the movement through the social meanings shared by the actors that compose the alter-globalization movement in its struggle against neoliberal ideology. In particular, he examines the convergence of two trends: one focused on subjectivity, the other on rationality, and their respective logic, values, forms of organization and, principally, visions of social change.</p>
<p>The book is divided into four parts. First, the author reconstructs four different phases of the movement, from its creation until its current reorganization in times of global crises. At the same time, he presents some of its founding myths (like the Seattle protests in 1999), constitutive dimensions (identity, model of convergence, relation with adversaries and models of social alternatives) and levels of articulations (from the local to the global, without overlooking national contexts).</p>
<p>The second part of the book is dedicated to the way of subjectivity. Analysing the cases of the Zapatista movement, the Belgian cultural centre ‘Barricade’ and young ‘alter-activists’, Pleyers describes the specificities of each case and links their convergences and similarities in terms of visions of social change understood as a process that begins with the behaviour of individuals and society and political engagement based on experience. The construction of autonomous spaces and of anti-powers, the valuing of diversity, horizontality, social relationships, direct action and creativity are the central resources for this process of social transformation where the coherence between practices and defined values becomes a fundamental horizon. Potentials and limitations are carefully noted by the author, who calls attention to the structures and power present in alter-globalization spaces and networks. Unlike some communitarian and contemporary postcolonialist readings that make claim to absolute spaces of exteriority, Pleyers reminds us that the absence of a formal hierarchy cannot be confused with the total absence of hierarchy and that the desire for horizontal social relations constructed in opposition to capitalism, racism and patriarchy does not mean that these experimental spaces are free from all vestiges of our oppressive system.</p>
<p>In a parallel form to the previous section, the third part of the book narrates the way of reason. Instead of emotion and experience, the focus here is the objective, quantitative and technical content, mobilized by expertise in diverse areas (from law to political economy) and thematic axes (from agricultural to the migrations passing through education). In the space of expertise, groups of activists/specialists demonstrate their domain of a specific object that allows them to legitimize themselves in the movement and the public sphere. They analyse politics and specific debates, look to build alternative theories and politics ‘rationally’, stir up outrage and focus on creating public policies. From this perspective, Pleyers analyses the cases of ATTAC and the International Council of the World Social Forum (where specialists and intellectuals are the centrepieces) and the contradictions between the theories of ‘another world is possible’ and the practices of expertise. Unlike the previous path, the notions of conflict and social change acquire here a more theoretical dimension ingrained in abstract proposals, a prioritization of the global scale, a more institutionalized vision and a focus on political advocacy that aims to construct counter-powers that dislocate the current architecture of power and foment active citizen participation. The inherent tension in the alter-globalization movement between the previous profile of activists and this type of ‘elite activists’ is examined in detail by the author from a dialectic perspective that, instead falling into oversimplifications, paints with precision a picture of the principal dilemmas of social change in contemporary activism.</p>
<p>One of the Pleyers’ biggest contributions comes in the final part of the book: the delineation of a tenuous border between tension and collaboration of the two paths that constitute the alter-globalization movement. Pleyers hunches over this theme, examining three ideal-types to manage the tension between subjectivity and reason: dichotomization, absorption and cross-fertilization. Tensions and polarizations coexist both in the constructions of hegemonies inside the movement that absorb and silence the plurality of voices, as well as in creative combinations and complementarities that bring out constructive criticism and collaborations. These various possibilities of articulation are analysed through the different actors and activist profiles, events, spaces and some of the principal debates, such as the emphasis on the local and the global and the interaction between the two; the internal organization of the movement and its more horizontal or vertical dimensions; or on the non-teleological narratives of social change.</p>
<p>The eruption of the 2007/2008 global crises of capitalism reveals a paradoxical inflection point for the alter-globalization movement and Pleyers’ analysis: if the alter-globalization movement came into being as a response to the negative effects of neoliberal ideology, which it surely intends to do, it remains paradoxical that, today, after having unmasked the social, economic and environmental consequences of neoliberalism (a success not discussed in these struggles), the movement is unable to articulate a convincing response in the face of a system that has been marked by multidimensional global crises that have been denounced since their beginning. However, Pleyers goes beyond those who announce a death-knell to the movement and states that the post-Washington Consensus era has brought with it a reconfiguration through more decentralized networks, new geographies of action and a focus on more concrete alternatives. Rather than speculation, the challenges of the historical potential of the alter-globalization movement will only be revealed through new in-depth studies on the alter-globalization militants and their initiatives, new social practices that are focused on the local without being strictly localist, the continuities and ruptures of their dynamics in current movements like the Indignados or Occupy Wall Street, grassroots rural social movements, the Arab Spring and the diverse networks. Several theoretical and methodological issues, such as the social construction of scales, multireferential identities, the construction of knowledge within grassroots social movements and not only by experts and intellectuals, and the similarities and differences of political cultures between activists of different origins are still pending in social movement studies in the global era. All these analyses are welcome and will have as an essential reference Pleyers’ outstanding global ethnography of social actors.</p>
