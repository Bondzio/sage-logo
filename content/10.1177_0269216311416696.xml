<title>Background:</title>
<p>The ability to provide good palliative care to patients is increasingly recognised as a core clinical skill that all doctors should possess. Few junior doctors, however, feel competent in breaking bad news, pain relief and the care of dying patients by the time they are fully registered to practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216311416696">
<title>Aim:</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore doctors’ experiences in foundation year 1 (F1) palliative medicine posts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216311416696">
<title>Design:</title>
<p>Participants underwent semi-structured interviews and interview transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216311416696">
<title>Setting/participants:</title>
<p>The study involved a purposive sample of six F1 doctors matched in 2005-2006 to rotations incorporating palliative medicine posts at two acute hospital National Health Service (NHS) Trusts and one NHS hospice in the UK.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216311416696">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>F1 doctors were satisfied with the learning opportunities provided by the posts, which achieved the right balance between supported and autonomous working. They described learning through their day-to-day interactions with staff, including specialist nurses, and by practising their skills on the job. Some struggled, however, to make the transition to a more independent learning style in the clinical environment. Trainees felt the post helped them to develop generic skills, such as symptom control, diagnosing dying and breaking bad news.

<sec id="section6-0269216311416696">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>F1 posts in palliative medicine in the UK have positive influences on perceived generic skills development and practice. These findings might encourage the development of more rotations incorporating palliative medicine in the future.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In 1997, in ‘The New Doctor’, the General Medical Council (GMC) recommended that training in the pre-registration year should cover breaking bad news, pain relief and the care of dying patients, and this was reiterated a decade later.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311416696">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311416696">2</xref></sup> However, in one study only three out of 57 junior doctors interviewed felt the pre-registration year had helped them develop competencies in these areas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311416696">3</xref></sup> Whilst there are studies in the United States of interns’ knowledge, skills and attitudes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311416696">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311416696"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311416696">6</xref></sup> research evaluating palliative care teaching remains limited in the UK, with most to date having focussed on undergraduate and general practitioner (GP) training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311416696">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311416696">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2005 postgraduate medical education in the UK underwent a modernization process with the introduction of two-year foundation programmes incorporating the pre-registration house officer (PRHO) year as Foundation Year 1 (F1).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311416696">9</xref></sup> Whilst the first year of the foundation programme is still intended to be the final year of medical education producing doctors with generic professional skills, fresh learning opportunities have emerged with F1 rotations incorporating specialties such as palliative medicine.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the educational experience gained from F1 rotations incorporating palliative medicine posts using a formal qualitative method. Qualitative methods are well suited to evaluate the sometimes complex learning outcomes in palliative care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311416696">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311416696">11</xref></sup> The information gathered should be of value to foundation programme directors of existing rotations and act as a useful resource for those considering developing rotations involving palliative medicine in the future.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section9-0269216311416696">
<title>Participants and research settings</title>
<p>Three F1 rotations incorporating stand-alone posts in palliative medicine or palliative medicine posts in combination with oncology within the South West and Wales Deaneries were studied. The settings for these three and four-month posts were one National Health Service (NHS) hospice and two acute hospital NHS Trusts with advisory palliative care teams. Ten junior doctors matched to these rotations, who were not receiving supervision of their training from CM, were invited to participate in the study by the Associate Postgraduate Deans in a letter from the respective Deaneries. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from Huntingdon Local Research Ethics Committee.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269216311416696">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>Phenomenology is a philosophical system of thought used by researchers to ‘get inside’ someone else’s experience on the basis of their description. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) is a version of phenomenology that accepts the ‘analysis produced by the researcher is always an <italic>interpretation</italic> of the participant’s experience’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311416696">12</xref></sup> We considered IPA to be an appropriate qualitative method to explore junior doctors’ experiences in a palliative medicine post.</p>
<p>In IPA it is important that the influence of the primary researcher on the analytical process is acknowledged at the outset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311416696">13</xref></sup> CM is a specialty doctor who provides palliative medicine advice to healthcare professionals in an acute NHS hospital Trust. Her participation in a pilot at the hospital of a new educational initiative incorporating palliative care between 2004 and 2005 generated the idea to evaluate similar foundation programmes, and participants were made aware of this in the information sheet.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269216311416696">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Following informed consent, each doctor was interviewed by CM at the beginning of their F1 rotation and at the end of the palliative medicine post in an office at the hospital or hospice where they worked. The semi-structured interviews (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0269216311416696">Appendix</xref>) lasted approximately 1 hour and were audiotaped, anonymized and transcribed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269216311416696">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The content of the first transcripts was analysed by CM to detect themes, which were tabulated in Microsoft Excel and used in the analysis of subsequent transcripts. Any new themes identified during the process were added to the table and similarly tested against earlier transcripts. The resulting master theme table was independently verified by KF and the Primary Care Research and Development Coordinator in the Gloucestershire Research and Development Support Unit.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0269216311416696" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Seven doctors, two male and five female, were recruited to the study. They were aged 23–25 years. Three were doing stand-alone posts and four had posts combined with oncology. One doctor spent their time working solely in oncology, so data from their follow up interview were not analysed. Six master themes, related to the learning opportunities provided by the post and the junior doctors’ professional development, are presented.</p>
<sec id="section14-0269216311416696">
<title>Satisfaction with the post in palliative medicine</title>
<p>The doctors were generally satisfied with the learning opportunities provided by the F1 post and would recommend palliative care experience to others:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’d definitely say that experience in palliative care is a really important one … for junior doctors … because it’s one that they all take with them, back to whatever other job they do. (Participant 3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>They felt well supported in the posts, often working alongside more experienced colleagues, but also seeing palliative care patients on their own as responsibility in the post grew:
<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t feel that I’m left on my own at all, [I’ve] always got someone to back me up but at the same time I’m encouraged to go and do things on my own and work independently. (Participant 7)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Autonomous working was popular because it encouraged F1 doctors to think for themselves:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have had the opportunity [to see patients alone] which I think is good because it’s made me start to think about making plans … rather than just, you know, writing down what I’ve been told, so its been good from that point of view. (Participant 2)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0269216311416696">
<title>People as the main resource</title>
<p>The F1 doctors sought advice regularly from senior doctors on the palliative management of clinical scenarios:
<disp-quote>
<p>there was somebody with … subacute bowel obstruction who was on a surgical ward and … refusing any further surgical intervention and … really at that stage I wasn’t sure … [what] I should be doing at all … but I was able to just call back to the office and … ask the [registrar] … and go through things with her and say … ‘what … should I be doing?’. (Participant 7)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The junior doctors also learned from experienced palliative care nurses, who were consulted mainly for their skills in recognizing dying but also for their advice on more ‘medical’ issues, such as drug prescribing:
<disp-quote>
<p>things like whether it’s time to start someone on the [end of life] pathway or, you know, perhaps it’s time to give them a syringe driver to help control their symptoms … and that kind of thing. (Participant 4)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The multidisciplinary palliative care team also acted as a support network for several of the trainees. One doctor compared this to the lack of support they had experienced caring for dying patients in other posts:
<disp-quote>
<p>it’s nice to have someone who’s actually asking, because that rarely … happens when you’re in [the] acute medical setting, I mean, [in] the last job, there was a lot of palliative care in it … and I found that really difficult … I think I could have done with something then but I just didn’t know where to go to look for help. (Participant 5)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0269216311416696">
<title>Taking responsibility for learning</title>
<p>Some doctors struggled with the transition to a more independent learning style and would have preferred more formal teaching:
<disp-quote>
<p>we had a session on analgesia … and it’s very much on a ‘what would you like to know?’ kind of thing rather than a formal teaching session … we had nothing written … so quite often I found that I was forgetting because … it wasn’t really appropriate to take notes. (Participant 5)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Others felt the more informal sessions were effective precisely because the learning was driven by them:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have … a regular [palliative care teaching] session with [the consultant] on a Monday lunchtime where we can discuss … sort of anything I’ve asked to bring up … so that’s sort of a half hour session which is one on one, [and] is excellent. (Participant 7)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0269216311416696">
<title>Valuable on the job learning</title>
<p>Trainees recognized that learning had also taken place through their day-to-day experience of working in palliative care, such as skills in judging prognosis:
<disp-quote>
<p>when I admit patients now, I sort of get more of a feeling immediately as to whether they’re likely to be just coming in for symptom control or whether they might be more terminal care … you can’t really describe how, but … you see people come in with similar things that you know maybe in the past how someone else has got on. (Participant 2)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Trainees observed other team members to acquire skills, such as communication:
<disp-quote>
<p>[the] neurology consultant … was requesting that a hospital post mortem took place … and this was something that we felt we should raise with the family before  … the patient passed away … [so] I sat in with … the [registrar] and … observed that sort of interaction [with] … the mother of the patient and I found that very useful, the way she sort of … approached it and discussed it. (Participant 2)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Senior staff were also seen to ‘think aloud’, particularly when making treatment decisions:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think [the patient] had … [chronic lymphoid leukaemia] but she also had bronchiectasis and she came in with a … nasty pneumonia but we decided at that stage it wasn’t appropriate to … do anything further which before [the post] I think I would have found hard to …  know how we make that decision but I think just from … observing other people make those decisions its been useful. (Participant 2)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0269216311416696">
<title>Not wanting to miss out on learning opportunities</title>
<p>Trainees felt that on-call rotas disrupted their learning in palliative medicine and oncology:
<disp-quote>
<p>[I] have two weeks of nights [on-call] in four months [of the post] which has meant sort of six days where I’ve not been here [in palliative medicine] … obviously the nights … [are] an important part of learning and things but … you miss out on a huge chunk of … time here and what goes on. (Participant 2)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>At the same time on-call rotas were valued for offering opportunities to learn additional F1 skills:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m also away doing on-calls and weekends … so it’s good variety and I’m glad I’ve had the general medical experience because I wouldn’t have wanted to do four months [in palliative medicine] without it and then had to go on to a post … that I was at a disadvantage relative to other[s]. (Participant 7)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Acute medical experience in ‘supernumerary’ posts was also important to allay junior doctors’ fears of falling behind their peers:
<disp-quote>
<p>I think … I’d feel … quite a lot of stress to be starting [the next job] … potentially having forgotten a lot of the general medicine that you knew [at finals] but still nevertheless … being seen as a house officer [by other staff], ‘you’ve been a house officer for X months, why can’t you do this? Why don’t you know that?’. (Participant 7)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>When the working week was split between oncology and palliative medicine, trainees felt unable to follow patients through an admission:
<disp-quote>
<p>obviously [in] oncology there’s lots of good general medicine … but … I’m only up there when I’m not on-call, so it’s less than half the time essentially … and actually … being on a ward for less than half the time you don’t really get the chance to follow people through. (Participant 7)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0269216311416696">
<title>Professional development</title>
<p>Junior doctors felt the F1 post in palliative medicine helped them to develop a range of generic competencies, such as symptom control:
<disp-quote>
<p>dealing with nausea and vomiting [was] something I didn’t feel particularly confident about being able to do before I started [palliative medicine] and … by a combination of … a session with the registrar … and then … actual experience of … seeing it in practice, that’s helped me … be more confident, in being able to treat that, both in the palliative care setting and then also when I’m doing on-calls in general medicine. (Participant 7)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Doctors also reported their palliative care experience helped them to make professional judgements, for example when it was no longer appropriate to intervene:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’d … be called to a ward, a patient needed to have a [cannula] put in … because … they couldn’t swallow anymore and they needed more fluids, and I remember thinking … I know who this is … their stent’s failed … I knew it meant that things had come to a real … sort of crossroads … [the patient is] ultimately saying … ‘I don’t want any more surgery … I’ve had enough’ … I remember walking away thinking, I wouldn’t have done that if I’d not done palliative care and I think it felt like such a good string to my bow … to know when to go ‘no, we don’t need to do that now, that’s not appropriate’. (Participant 6)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In addition, many trainees left the post feeling they had the knowledge and skills to diagnose when patients were dying:
<disp-quote>
<p>I now know … what clinical indicators to use [in judging someone is dying], just in terms of ascitic taps, how often they’re … re-accumulating … and looking at people’s albumin and haemoglobin and things like that, as well as how they look. (Participant 3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Working in palliative care meant that trainees felt more confident communicating bad news to patients and their families:
<disp-quote>
<p>before [the job] I think I would have avoided talking to families ‘cos you don’t want to give bad news … but now … I’m not scared by speaking to the family any more and I think that’s something you can take with you with whatever you do. (Participant 5)</p>
<p>you need to be quite empathic [when breaking bad news] … listening and judging on how the other person … is finding the consultation going … and sort of just letting them guide you really how much … to tell them … rather than going in with a set idea about what you’re going to say. (Participant 2)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section21-0269216311416696">
<title>The findings and current literature</title>
<p>This is the first study to have evaluated F1 rotations incorporating palliative medicine in the UK. F1 doctors were satisfied with the learning opportunities provided by the palliative medicine posts. They felt well supported and had opportunities for independent working and taking responsibility for patients. This is important given that surveys report junior doctors are often working unsupervised, and ‘learning from their mistakes’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311416696">14</xref></sup> Other pre-registration posts have struggled to achieve this balance between supportive and autonomous working, leaving junior doctors feeling like medical students again.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311416696">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Trainees acknowledged that specialist nurses were a valuable resource, because their experience in palliative and terminal care far outweighed that of the junior doctors’. Whilst it is well established that nursing staff generally support junior doctors’ training, this is the first report in the UK of nurses guiding trainees specifically in the area of palliative care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311416696">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311416696">17</xref></sup> A pilot study in Australia involving fifth-year medical students working with experienced palliative care nurses produced similar findings, with students reporting increased confidence when confronted with a range of situations relating to death and dying.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311416696">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Palliative care staff also acted as a support network. This is in contrast to other studies, such as the survey by Paice et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311416696">14</xref></sup> which revealed pre-registration doctors having to come to terms with death and disease on their own.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311416696">19</xref></sup> In a study of hospice posts, Lloyd-Williams<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311416696">20</xref></sup> reported senior house officers felt isolated from their peers. This was not a concern raised by our F1 doctors, probably because they were all involved in acute on-call rotas within their Trusts.</p>
<p>The F1 doctors interviewed reported differing degrees of willingness to take responsibility for their learning. Trainees are known to need help adapting to the independent learning style required by the clinical environment, so staff in palliative medicine, and indeed other F1 posts, need to be responsive to trainees’ differing levels of comfort with self-directed learning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311416696">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The F1 doctors described learning palliative care skills ‘on the job’. Some of these techniques are already described in the literature, such as learning communication skills by watching senior staff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311416696">20</xref></sup> Others are new, such as trainees using experiential learning to acquire skills in prognostication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311416696">22</xref></sup> No research has reported how doctors learn clinically to estimate survival, but we are not the first authors to suggest that exposure to specialist palliative care may be a factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311416696">23</xref></sup> Spencer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216311416696">24</xref></sup> suggests clinicians ‘model’ professional thinking in order to provide trainees with insight into decision making, which is otherwise difficult to articulate. The trainees we interviewed described learning about treatment decisions in palliative medicine by observing senior staff ‘thinking aloud’ when making complex judgements.</p>
<p>All of the posts in this study incorporated on-call commitments that the doctors valued, but at the same time felt detracted from their palliative care learning. Junior doctor dissatisfaction with shift systems is well documented, but it was interesting to find that fear of not meeting staff expectations in remaining foundation programme posts was partly what motivated them to acquire acute skills during the palliative medicine post.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311416696">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216311416696">25</xref></sup> Trainees commencing their pre-registration year in general practice were similarly concerned about falling behind their peers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311416696">15</xref></sup> When posts were split between oncology and palliative medicine, trainees felt unable to follow patients up and find out what had happened to them. In one study, where junior doctors spent 2.5 days a week in general practice and the rest in hospital, the authors also found trainees were concerned about what they were missing in the other specialty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216311416696">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a study by Tiernan et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216311416696">27</xref></sup> 30 junior doctors completed a multiple choice questionnaire six months into the pre-registration year. This revealed poor knowledge in pain and symptom control, with 63% scoring less than 50%. In contrast with this study and other literature, which suggests junior doctors do not develop competencies in this area during the pre-registration year,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311416696">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311416696">3</xref></sup> the trainees interviewed reported their knowledge of symptom control increased whilst working in palliative medicine.</p>
<p>Palliative care experience had helped trainees judge when it was no longer appropriate to treat a patient and increased their confidence in diagnosing dying. These are important skills for junior doctors to acquire if patients are to receive good symptom control and avoid unnecessary interventions. However, knowing when treatments are futile only benefits patients if doctors then enter into discussions about end-of-life care. In their questionnaire study of 41 junior hospital doctors, Morgan and Westmoreland<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269216311416696">28</xref></sup> found that where junior doctors were left to make treatment decisions, 58% found it difficult to discuss cardiopulmonary resuscitation with patients. The F1 doctors in our study felt they had developed the ability to communicate difficult news and entered into important conversations surrounding the end of life as a result. They described confidence in areas that pre-registration doctors have previously struggled with, such as handling uncertainty and judging how much information patients wanted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216311416696">29</xref></sup></p>

<title>Implications for practice</title>
<p>The finding that palliative medicine posts develop generic skills in symptom control and breaking bad news means that junior doctors rotating through them are likely to satisfy GMC requirements in this area of their training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311416696">2</xref></sup> More F1 posts in palliative medicine across the UK, or similar posts in other countries, would allow more junior doctors to acquire these skills. The resource implications of this are significant, but more posts could be set up within advisory hospital palliative care teams as these increase in number. The study suggests that splitting junior posts between palliative medicine and other specialities is another option, particularly if trainees can spend a fixed amount of time in one area before moving on to the other. Alternatively, palliative care clinical nurse specialists could be involved in teaching junior doctors rather than such teaching being delivered only by medical staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0269216311416696">
<title>Directions for future research</title>
<p>It is known that trainees’ self-reported abilities can differ from their tutor’s assessments, so future studies of palliative medicine posts should triangulate doctors’ perceived learning with supervisors’ views and objective measures of F1 competencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216311416696">30</xref></sup> This would better inform programme directors as to the specialities required in combination with palliative medicine for F1 doctors to acquire all the necessary competencies by the end of their first year of practice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-0269216311416696">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Only one geographical area was sampled in our study, and the sample size of six was small but the doctors interviewed were working in a range of settings where palliative care is commonly provided. The predominantly positive feedback about the posts raises the possibility that trainees were unable to disclose negative concerns to a palliative medicine interviewer in spite of prompts within the interview schedule to consider how the post might be improved. Reported rather than observed behaviour was recorded, although the clinical examples the participants discussed were felt to be credible. The sampling process assumed that junior doctors doing a palliative medicine post were experiencing something different from their peers; every attempt was therefore made to use the existing literature on the first year of practice to highlight when the learning opportunities provided by the palliative medicine post were new or different.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>F1 posts in palliative medicine in the UK have positive influences on perceived generic skills development and practice. These findings might encourage the development of more rotations incorporating palliative medicine in the future, so that a greater number of junior doctors could benefit from the available learning opportunities. The resource implications of this are significant but are not insurmountable. We believe these findings are applicable to healthcare systems outside the UK, since the skills the junior doctors gained are universally applicable.</p>
