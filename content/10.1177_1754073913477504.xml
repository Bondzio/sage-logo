<abstract>
<p>Approach and avoidance motivation may represent important explanatory constructs in understanding how individuals differ. Such constructs have primarily been assessed in self-reported terms, but there are limitations to self-reports of motivation. Accordingly, the present review concentrates on the potential utility of implicit cognitive-behavioral probes of approach and avoidance motivation in modeling and understanding individual differences. The review summarizes multiple lines of research that have documented the utility of such probes to the personality-processing interface. Although multiple gaps in our knowledge exist, and are acknowledged, the value of such implicit cognitive-behavioral assessments is emphasized both in modeling multiple subcomponents of approach and avoidance motivation and in showing that such tendencies matter in ways that transcend momentary experiences or manipulations.</p>

<p>We conceptualize approach and avoidance, much as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1754073913477504">Lewin (1936)</xref> did, in terms of movements toward or away from stimuli in the environment. Such movements, however, are often inhibited by human beings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1754073913477504">Lang, Bradley, &amp; Cuthbert, 1997</xref>). Accordingly, it is useful to understand approach and avoidance in terms of operations of underlying systems. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1754073913477504">Gray (1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754073913477504">1982)</xref> theorized a behavioral activation system (BAS) that is sensitive to potential rewards and motivated to seek them, and a behavioral inhibition system (BIS) that is sensitive to potential threats and motivated to avoid them. Such systems are understood in terms of real-time interactions with the environment, yet consist of multiple subcomponents and tendencies. Individual differences in BAS, for example, should bias perceptions of appetitive stimuli, trigger other approach-related thoughts, and influence both the direction and intensity of movements.</p>
<p>If BAS and BIS are important, then they should prove to have widespread predictive value as <italic>individual differences</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1754073913477504">Underwood, 1975</xref>). The largest relevant body of work has assessed BAS and BIS with self-report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1754073913477504">Carver &amp; White, 1994</xref>). Self-reports of motivation can be suspect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1754073913477504">McClelland, 1987</xref>) and, perhaps more to the point, do not assess <italic>operations</italic> of these systems in terms of real-time interactions with the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754073913477504">Gray, 1982</xref>). In our review, we therefore concentrate on strategies for assessing operations of the BAS and the BIS in objective or implicit cognitive-behavioral terms, with a particular focus on individual differences.</p>
<p>The review is broadly organized in terms of different subcomponents (e.g., perceptual, cognitive, motoric) of BAS and BIS. Research from our own laboratory is primarily reviewed because it has been somewhat unique in bridging this personality-processing interface. To foreshadow, some significant progress has been made in modeling different subcomponents of BAS and BIS and these performance-based measures have demonstrated value in understanding individual differences. Some gaps in our knowledge exist, however, and future directions of research will therefore be advocated.</p>

<title>BAS as Incentive Salience</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754073913477504">Gray (1982)</xref> suggested that the BAS is closely linked to a reactive dopamine neurotransmitter system. In support of this point, it has been established, among other relevant findings, that animals bred to lack the ability to synthesize dopamine exhibit pronounced inactivity and anemic reward-pursuit (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1754073913477504">Robinson, Sotak, During, &amp; Palmiter, 2006</xref>). On the basis of an extensive subsequent analysis of this literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754073913477504">Berridge (2007)</xref> concluded that dopamine release, in animal models, seems to serve the goal of boosting the signal of potentially rewarding stimuli, a process termed <italic>incentive salience</italic>.</p>
<p>The incentive salience idea can be translated to mean that rewarding stimuli should receive a perceptual “boost” relative to threatening or neutral stimuli. Just such a pattern was evident in four word-processing studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1754073913477504">Ode, Winters, and Robinson (2012)</xref>. The font size of rewarding words was overestimated relative to threatening and neutral words (Study 1) and the duration of rewarding words was also overestimated (Study 4).</p>
<p>If perceptual estimates in such paradigms are valid indicators of BAS motivation, then individual differences in them should predict outcomes thought to be marked by particularly high levels of BAS motivation. This point was confirmed in a set of studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1754073913477504">Robinson, Ode, Palder, and Fetterman (2012)</xref>. Individuals displaying such reward-primed size overestimates to a greater extent were higher in interpersonal arrogance, particularly when they were also extraverted. Although more preliminary at the present time, we have also shown that individuals displaying such perceptual biases to a greater extent are angrier in their daily lives, results consistent with approach-related theories of anger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754073913477504">Carver &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section2-1754073913477504">
<title>BAS as Behavioral Facilitation</title>
<p>Also building on dopamine-related animal models, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1754073913477504">Depue and Collins (1999)</xref> suggested a different marker of BAS functioning. Specifically, individuals higher in BAS motivation may be characterized by higher levels of what we term behavioral facilitation—a tendency toward more vigorous goal-directed efforts over time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1754073913477504">Robinson, Meier, Tamir, Wilkowski, and Ode (2009)</xref> sought to model this process in choice reaction-time tasks. In such tasks, an individual first encounters a goal—namely, to categorize stimuli as quickly as possible. To the extent that an individual “locks on” to this goal, his/her reaction times should exhibit greater speed as the task progresses. Just such a measure of behavioral facilitation was quantified, specifically by the creation of residual scores contrasting individuals whose processing speed increased or decreased relative to their earlier task performance.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1754073913477504">Depue and Collins (1999)</xref> suggested that behavioral facilitation is a marker of BAS functioning. If so, the residual scores computed in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1754073913477504">Robinson et al. (2009)</xref> studies should possess value in understanding outcomes theoretically linked to BAS functioning. Three studies supported such ideas. For example, Study 1 found that higher levels of behavioral facilitation were predictive of greater optimism, Study 2 found that higher levels of behavioral facilitation were predictive of observer reports of positive affect, and Study 3 found that higher levels of behavioral facilitation were predictive of having a higher frequency of approach goals in daily life. It would seem important to extend these results to nonaffective domains. For example, higher levels of behavioral facilitation may predict greater goal persistence and achievement, variables often emphasized in the goal literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1754073913477504">Elliot &amp; Fryer, 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1754073913477504">
<title>BAS-Related Theories of Extraversion</title>
<p>Higher levels of the personality trait of extraversion are marked by assertiveness, positive emotionality, and more frequent social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1754073913477504">McCrae &amp; Costa, 1999</xref>). The correlates of extraversion are well established, but the processes responsible for such individual differences are not. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1754073913477504">Gray (1981)</xref> suggested that BAS-related processes are involved, a suggestion that has not been the focus of a great deal of personality-processing work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1754073913477504">Matthews &amp; Gilliland, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>According to animal models of BAS motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754073913477504">Berridge, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1754073913477504">Depue &amp; Collins, 1999</xref>), higher levels of it should predict the extent to which a rewarding stimulus triggers other thoughts of a rewarding type. This view of BAS motivation might be profitably examined in affective priming paradigms, which seek to assess spreading activation from one affective thought to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1754073913477504">Fazio, 2001</xref>). However, in doing so, it is important to examine affective priming effects for negative and positive targets separately, as only the latter type of priming effect would be consistent with a BAS-related mechanism.</p>
<p>Across four studies using affective words as well as pictures, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1754073913477504">Robinson, Moeller, and Ode (2010)</xref> found a systematic relationship between extraversion levels and positive affective priming effects, but not negative affective priming effects. For example, in Study 3, personality differences in extraversion were a strong predictor of the extent to which positive target evaluations were faster following positive primes, <italic>r</italic> = .54, but a nonsignificant predictor of the extent to which negative target evaluations were faster following negative primes, <italic>r</italic> = −.23. Such results are not only novel, but support theories of extraversion linking it to BAS operations. Of course, it would be useful to extend these results to other implicit probes of BAS motivation, an ongoing focus of research in our lab.</p>

<title>BIS-Related Theories of Neuroticism</title>
<p>Operations of the BIS are thought to underlie individual differences in neuroticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1754073913477504">Elliot &amp; Thrash, 2002</xref>), though implicit evidence for this point has been sparse until recently. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1754073913477504">Robinson, Ode, Moeller, and Goetz (2007)</xref> found that neuroticism predicted negative, but not positive, affective priming effects, a spreading activation among negative thoughts consistent with BIS’s proposed negativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1754073913477504">Gray, 1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754073913477504">1982</xref>). Higher levels of BIS should also result in greater reactivity to error feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1754073913477504">Gray &amp; McNaughton, 2000</xref>). Such processes were modeled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1754073913477504">Moeller and Robinson (2010)</xref>. In Study 2 of that article participants were told that their choice predictions (whether the letter <italic>q</italic> or <italic>p</italic> would appear) were either correct or in error. Reactivity to error feedback was quantified in terms of a greater frequency of switched predictions following error than correct feedback. Individuals high, but not low, in neuroticism exhibited this form of reactivity to error feedback.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073913477504">Carver, Sutton, and Scheier (2000)</xref> highlighted another potential feature of BIS motivation. From a self-regulation perspective, BIS motivation may be associated with maximizing the distance between the self and objects in the environment (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1754073913477504">Lewin, 1936</xref>). As stated previously, such tendencies would be unlikely to result in overt escape behaviors in laboratory tasks involving human participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1754073913477504">Lang et al., 1997</xref>). On the other hand, such distancing dynamics might be evident in perceptual terms. Specifically, higher levels of neuroticism might be predictive of perceptions consistent with greater distancing. Such hypotheses were examined by Liu, Ode, Moeller, and Robinson (in press).</p>
<p>In Studies 1 and 2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1754073913477504">Liu et al. (in press)</xref>, participants were asked to determine whether ambiguous temporal phrases (e.g., “moved forward”) suggested that an impending event was more proximal or more distal in time. Neurotic (but not stable) individuals inferred that such events were further in the future. In Study 3, participants were asked to estimate the font size of presented words (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1754073913477504">Ode et al., 2012</xref>). Individuals higher in neuroticism estimated the words as smaller, consistent with the fact that moving away from objects reduces their retinal image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1754073913477504">Gibson, 1966</xref>). In Study 4, word stimuli grew (toward the self) or shrank (away from the self) and participants estimated these rates of change. Participants high, but not low, in neuroticism perceived stimuli to be shrinking faster than they were growing, even when this was not the case. We have yet to show that extraversion predicts distance-reducing perceptions or that perceptual distancing predicts other theoretical correlates of BIS motivation, though such research directions can be encouraged on the basis of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1754073913477504">Liu et al. (in press)</xref> findings.</p>

<title>BAS Dominance in a Movement Paradigm</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754073913477504">Gray (1982)</xref> suggested that BAS and BIS should support distinct movement directions, either toward rewards (BAS) or away from threats (BIS). In an influential set of studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1754073913477504">Chen and Bargh (1999)</xref> instructed participants to move a joystick forward or backward and found that forward movements were initiated faster in the context of negative stimuli, consistent with pushing such stimuli away, whereas backward joystick movements were initiated faster in the context of positive stimuli, consistent with pulling such stimuli toward the self. Since then, it has become apparent that there is no hard-wired tendency to move forward in the case of undesirable stimuli; in fact, this Chen and Bargh effect can be reversed in some task conditions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1754073913477504">Markman &amp; Brendl, 2005</xref>). It therefore might be more informative, at least for some purposes, to ask people to move toward desirable stimuli and move away from undesirable stimuli. Such instructions essentially render a task suited to examine a distance-regulating account of approach and avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1754073913477504">Carver et al., 2000</xref>), as outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1754073913477504">Eder and Rothermund (2008)</xref>.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754073913477504">Boyd &amp; Robinson, 2013</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1754073913477504">De Houwer, Crombez, Baeyens, &amp; Hermans, 2001</xref>) asked individuals to move a joystick cursor toward desirable stimuli and away from undesirable stimuli, which were presented up or down on the computer screen. We used the single words “reward” and “threat” as stimuli because they are equal in their number of letters, admirably simple, and readily understood. Many trials involved correct answers. For example, upward movements should be made when the word “reward” is presented toward the top of the computer screen and when the word “threat” is presented toward the bottom of the computer screen. Interspersed with such trials were critical trials in which the words “reward” and “threat” were placed in the same location—either high or low. This condition represents a classic approach–avoidance conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1754073913477504">Miller, 1944</xref>). To the extent that BAS/BIS predominates, movements should occur toward/away from the conflicted area.</p>
<p>The same individuals in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754073913477504">Boyd and Robinson (2013)</xref> study subsequently completed a 14-day experience-sampling protocol. The focus was on anger experiences because anger is viewed as an approach-related affect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754073913477504">Carver &amp; Harmon-Jones, 2009</xref>). As hypothesized, BAS-dominant individuals—that is, those who more often moved toward rather than away from such conflict locations—experienced greater anger on days associated with higher levels of frustration or criticism (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1754073913477504">Figure 1</xref>). These results should be extended to the prediction of other outcomes—such as impulsiveness, addictive behaviors, or psychopathy—often thought to result from a BAS that is strong in relation to a BIS that is weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1754073913477504">Corr, 2010</xref>). In any case, we emphasize the utility of this movement-related probe in assessing individual differences in BAS dominance.</p>

<title>The Potential Importance of Classes of Incentives</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1754073913477504">Gray (1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754073913477504">1982)</xref> suggested that some individuals are higher in BAS than others. This may well be true in general, but individuals almost certainly <italic>also</italic> differ in which sorts of incentives trigger BAS-related processes. In particular, there is general agreement that power and affiliation are two fundamental social motives, but motives that almost certainly differ in strength between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1754073913477504">McClelland, 1987</xref>). If so, power-oriented individuals might be expected to a respond in a BAS-related manner, particularly when power incentives are involved.</p>
<p>As a test of these ideas, we (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1754073913477504">Fetterman, Robinson, &amp; Ode, 2013</xref>) assessed individual differences in interpersonal arrogance, with high arrogance reflective of behaviors (and possible motivations) favoring power over affiliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1754073913477504">Wiggins &amp; Broughton, 1991</xref>). We hypothesized that people higher in interpersonal arrogance would exhibit BAS-related implicit tendencies, particularly when power incentive stimuli (words like “status”) relative to affiliation incentive stimuli (words like “love”) were involved. Such interactive predictions were supported. Study 1 found that arrogant individuals, but not low arrogant individuals, categorized power words faster than affiliation words. Study 2 found that arrogant individuals, but not low arrogant individuals, overestimated the font size of power words relative to affiliation words. Study 3 asked individuals to move a joystick cursor toward or away from power or affiliation words. It was found that movement times favored approaching power stimuli and disfavored avoiding power stimuli, relative to affiliation stimuli, only at high levels of interpersonal arrogance.</p>
<p>On the basis of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1754073913477504">Fetterman et al. (2013)</xref> findings, the approach–avoidance literature might be served by contrasting different rewards to be approached or punishments to be avoided. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1754073913477504">Wentura, Rothermund, and Bak (2000)</xref>, too, made this point by showing that equally positive or negative words captured attention to a greater extent when such words suggested greater consequences for the self as an interaction partner. In addition, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1754073913477504">Fetterman et al. (2013)</xref> findings suggest some future directions of research of an individual differences type. For example, we might expect drinkers relative to nondrinkers to display strong BAS-related tendencies, particularly when exposed to alcohol cues relative to more generic reward stimuli.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Future Directions</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1754073913477504">Gray (1981)</xref> made an invaluable contribution to the personality literature by suggesting that BAS and BIS may underlie several important trait-related tendencies. It is clear, however, that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754073913477504">Gray (1982)</xref> thought of BAS and BIS in terms of real-time interactions with the environment and his analysis also highlighted multiple subcomponents of BAS and BIS—for example, perceptual, cognitive, and motoric. Implicit or performance-based assessments, we believe, are flexible in modeling such processes and perhaps ideally suited to doing so.</p>
<p>Our review summarizes a number of findings in relation to a number of distinct measures and the reader is likely to desire more general conclusions. Our results, we think, suggest two bottom-line conclusions. First, if theories concerning operations of BAS and BIS (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1754073913477504">Gray, 1982</xref>) are important, then cognitive-behavioral assessments of these operations should prove to have utility in understanding individual differences. Our review documents multiple successes along such lines. Second, although it is common to suggest that personality traits can be understood in terms of underlying cognitive-behavioral processes, it is remarkable how rare relevant sources of evidence are presented. The research reviewed is thus important in part because we were able to point to evidence in favor of processing contributions to several traits.</p>
<p>Reliable assessments are important in understanding individual differences, and we have found that many of the cognitive-behavioral assessments reviewed possess good levels of internal reliability (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1754073913477504">Liu et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1754073913477504">Robinson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1754073913477504">Robinson et al., 2012</xref>). There are gaps in our current knowledge, however. For example, we have yet to show that higher levels of extraversion are predictive of distance-reducing perceptual dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1754073913477504">Liu et al., in press</xref>). In addition, we have yet to examine whether the different cognitive-behavioral measures reviewed covary with each other or interact with each other in predicting relevant traits or outcomes. Additionally, it seems probable that different assessments of BAS may predict different facets of extraversion. For example, behavioral facilitation might better predict assertive behavior, whereas positive affective priming might better predict positive emotional experiences.</p>
<p>Three additional directions for future research can be advocated. Our general focus has been on individual differences, but state-related manipulations might be valuable as well. For example, it is intuitive to suggest that manipulations of anxiety might influence whether people approach or avoid conflicted stimulus locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754073913477504">Boyd &amp; Robinson, 2013</xref>). Further, a focus on pathological outcomes—for example, depression, social phobia, addictive behaviors, etc.—seems important in extending the present work. Finally, process-oriented measures of BAS and BIS should, in principle, be trainable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1754073913477504">MacLeod, Koster, &amp; Fox, 2009</xref>). If so, manipulations of the processes highlighted in our review can be advocated in understanding their causal status as predictors of emotions and behaviors thought to result from variations in BAS and BIS.</p>
