<abstract>
<p>This study examined how student learning can be enhanced through a multidisciplinary collaborative project in the apparel merchandising and interior design curriculum. It investigated the relationships among students' perceptions (the importance of collaboration in the industry, course connections across disciplines, and cultural understanding), learning outcomes (social, cognitive, and emotional), attitude toward the collaborative project, and intent to register for future collaborative courses in pre- (N=56) and post-tests (N=52). The data was collected from students who enrolled in Global Retailing, Visual Merchandising, or Interior Design. In both tests, perceived importance of collaboration significantly influenced social/cognitive and emotional learning outcomes and attitude. Learning outcomes significantly affected attitude. Compared to social/cognitive learning outcomes, emotional learning outcomes was a stronger predictor of attitude in both tests, showing a pivotal role of emotional learning in creating positive attitudes toward the collaborative project. Attitude significantly increased intent to register for future collaborative courses in both tests.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In higher education, integrative educational efforts are encouraged not only to promote academic performance but also to better prepare students for their future careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12453646">Kim, LaFleur, &amp; Schaeffer, 2008</xref>). Collaborative learning refers to “an instruction method in which students at various performance levels work together in small groups toward a common goal” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12453646">Gokhale 1995</xref>, p. 22). It encompasses a variety of techniques adopted to encourage students to work cooperatively, searching for solutions or creating a product by making joint intellectual efforts and social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0887302X12453646">Delucchi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12453646">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). The importance of collaboration among multiple courses and/or across different majors has been acknowledged as an effective way to enhance student learning by providing students with an opportunity to learn how professionals in diverse areas work together within the industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12453646">Kim et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Today, the business world is becoming increasingly multidisciplinary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887302X12453646">Kimmons &amp; Spruiell, 2005</xref>). In the creative industry, which encompasses various creative fields such as fashion retailing, interior design, and visual merchandising, professionals are often involved in team projects and collaborate with professionals in multiple disciplines. According to our own investigation of academic curriculums in the United States and Canada, there are over 56 universities where these majors coexist within the same department. However, despite the importance of collaboration across disciplines related to the creative industry, most pedagogical approaches have focused on a single course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12453646">Kim et al., 2008</xref>) and few collaborative efforts have been made among fashion retailing, interior design, and visual merchandising courses.</p>
<p>Moreover, the social learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887302X12453646">Bandura, 1977</xref>) suggests that social learning occurs within a social context and collaborative learning can foster social and cognitive learning through the development of critical thinking, interpersonal relations, and social support. Although the theory did not include emotional learning as one of the learning outcomes, a growing body of the literature suggests that emotional learning within a social group is integral in promoting interactions and motivation for collaborative learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887302X12453646">Järvelä, Volet, &amp; Järvenoja, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887302X12453646">Thompson &amp; Fine, 1999</xref>). However, previous studies have mainly focused on cognitive and/or social learning outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12453646">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X12453646">Ma &amp; Pendergast, 2010</xref>) and emotional learning as a dimension of collaborative learning outcomes has been overlooked and underresearched. Therefore, this study proposed that collaborative learning outcomes are multidimensional, encompassing cognitive, social, and emotional learning outcomes.</p>
<p>To fill the aforementioned gaps in the literature, this study aimed to examine the antecedents and consequences of student learning outcomes through a multicourse collaborative project within the apparel merchandising and interior design curriculum. Specifically, we investigated how multidimensional learning outcomes are influenced by students’ perceptions of the importance of collaboration in the industry, course connections across disciplines, and cultural understanding, and how these variables further influence attitude toward the collaborative project and intent to register future collaborative courses. In addition, by testing the proposed model in the pretests and posttests, we examined how the hypothesized relationships would differ before and after the collaborative project. To achieve these research goals, a multicourse collaborative project was developed within a global setting. We created a hypothetical scenario that took place in the emerging country of India and introduced the challenge of four global brands’ successful expansion into the country. Through this project students were expected to learn the importance of cultural understanding to build competitive advantages for multinational corporations who compete in the global economy.</p>

<title>Multidimensionality of Collaborative Learning Outcomes</title>
<sec id="section4-0887302X12453646">
<title>Social learning outcomes</title>
<p>Social learning outcomes are determined by the dynamic interaction within a group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887302X12453646">Bandura, 1977</xref>) and the quality of the interpersonal communication among team members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887302X12453646">Winter, Waner, &amp; Neal-Mansfield, 2008</xref>). Research has found that team-based projects increase student engagement and improve social communication skills, which are critical components of social learning outcomes. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12453646">Kim et al. (2008)</xref> found that team-based projects facilitate the development of social skills to maintain harmony among team members and help them to achieve a level of quality in their work that is expected in the professional world. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12453646">Gokhale (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0887302X12453646">Totten, Sills, Digby, and Russ (1991)</xref> found that team-based projects help students develop interpersonal communication skills and facilitate student engagement and interaction. Particularly, when students were teamed up with related majors, they tended to share ideas more freely and develop friendships more easily than those from dissimilar majors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887302X12453646">Winter et al., 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12453646">Kim et al. (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0887302X12453646">Totten et al. (1991)</xref> also argued that similar interests, active engagement, and team interaction enhance learning by motivating students to take responsibility for their own learning and enhancing their commitment to the group project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0887302X12453646">
<title>Cognitive learning outcomes</title>
<p>Cognitive learning outcomes are determined by cognitive aspects of learning such as knowledge acquisition and the development of critical thinking skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X12453646">Ma &amp; Pendergast, 2010</xref>) and are facilitated within social relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887302X12453646">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0887302X12453646">Sandahl, 2010</xref>). Research has found that team-based projects foster cognitive learning by allowing students to learn with and from peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X12453646">Ma &amp; Pendergast, 2010</xref>). Additionally, students who participated in collaborative learning tend to understand the subject matter better (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12453646">Gokhale, 1995</xref>) and retain the information longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887302X12453646">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1986</xref>) compared to students who worked individually. Particularly, when students work with members from multiple disciplines, diversity within a group in terms of scholarship and experience facilitate the learning process through shared insights and expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12453646">Gokhale, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The process of actively exchanging ideas and insights positively contributes to the development of critical-thinking skills, which is identified as one of the most important learning outcomes of a collaborative project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12453646">Gokhale, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12453646">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). A collaborative learning environment encourages students to become critical thinkers by allowing them to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate ideas cooperatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887302X12453646">Thompson &amp; Ku, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0887302X12453646">Totten et al., 1991</xref>). Research has shown that students who have participated in a collaborative project tend to seek a higher level of thinking and become more critical than students working individually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887302X12453646">Johnson &amp; Johnson, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0887302X12453646">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12453646">Gokhale (1995)</xref> also found that students who participated in collaborative learning showed significantly higher scores on critical-thinking tests than students who studied individually.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0887302X12453646">
<title>Emotional learning outcomes</title>
<p>While social and cognitive learning have received considerable attention in educational literature, emotional aspects of learning in the collaborative environment have not been widely studied. However, previous studies have found that emotional experiences are the foundation of the learning process and are integral to the promotion of interpersonal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0887302X12453646">Titsworth, Quinlan, &amp; Mazer, 2010</xref>). Therefore, emotional learning is a critical component of collaborative learning outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887302X12453646">Järvelä et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887302X12453646">Thompson &amp; Fine, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Emotion is a driving force that leads to an action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0887302X12453646">Greenberg &amp; Paivio, 1997</xref>). Emotion affects students’ performance substantially and plays a more critical role in students’ decision making than cognitive reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887302X12453646">Gläser-Zikuda, Fuss, Laukenmann, Metz, &amp; Randler, 2005</xref>). Emotional response theory suggests that students develop emotional valence (i.e., positive or negative emotional reactions) toward learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887302X12453646">Mottet, Frymier, &amp; Beebe, 2006</xref>). Collaboration can create positive emotions that energize and evoke motivation within a team dynamic; yet, it can also create negative emotions that result in conflict and prohibit mobilization of ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887302X12453646">Järvelä et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, successful collaboration may be dependent on team members’ level of emotional engagement in collaborative learning.</p>

<title>Impact of Perceived Importance on Learning Outcomes and Attitude</title>
<p>In this study, students’ perception of the importance of collaboration in the industry, course connection across disciplines, and cultural understanding are proposed as the antecedents of the multidimensional learning outcomes as well as attitude toward the collaborative project.</p>
<sec id="section8-0887302X12453646">
<title>Importance of collaboration in the industry</title>
<p>Multicourse collaborative projects reinforce how learning is applied in practice, thus better preparing students for the professional world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12453646">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). However, in the current pedagogical approach, students are given limited opportunities to acquire knowledge on the daily operations of retail firms and the firms’ response to the changing retail environment (Carpenter &amp; Fairhurst, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887302X12453646">2005</xref>). The experience in multicourse collaboration simulates an industry environment where collaborated efforts are often employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12453646">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). For instance, visual merchandisers closely work with designers, buyers, and advertisers to better understand merchandise and the preferences of the company’s target consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887302X12453646">Pegler, 2007</xref>). Among other factors, retail lighting plays a critical role in creating a positive store image and a unique retail atmosphere, further affecting consumer product search and purchase behavior in a store (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887302X12453646">Custers, de Kort, Ijsselsteijn, &amp; de Kruiff, 2010</xref>). Due to the importance of lighting in retail stores, particularly for high-end brands, visual merchandisers often work closely or consult with interior designers and lighting specialists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887302X12453646">Pegler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887302X12453646">Russell, 2008</xref>). For global brands, retail store design and in-store merchandising decisions should be based on the understanding of the target market in that specific culture and should be consistent with the firm’s managerial philosophy, brand positioning, and global strategic orientations across cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887302X12453646">Pegler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0887302X12453646">Solomon &amp; Rabolt, 2009</xref>). Thus, within the retail industry, a wide range of expertise and disciplines collaborate together to create a successful retail business.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12453646">Kim et al. (2008)</xref> found that students who realize the importance of collaboration in the industry tend to have a more positive attitude toward the subject matter and overall evaluation of the multicourse project. Thus, it is expected that students who realize the importance of collaboration in the creative industry are likely to actively interact with team members by sharing and seeking ideas and expertise, therefore experiencing positive learning outcomes and attitude toward the collaborative project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0887302X12453646">
<title>Importance of course connection</title>
<p>The above discussion on the importance of collaboration in the creative industry provides a further rationale for the importance of course connection across different majors and disciplines. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12453646">Kim et al. (2008)</xref> argues that among other educational methods of collaborative learning, a multicourse collaborative project provides a unique learning opportunity by broadening the students’ perspective on the interconnectedness of the various courses in diverse disciplines and their further integration to promote student learning. As discussed earlier, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887302X12453646">Winter et al. (2008)</xref> found that students tend to actively engage in the project when they collaborate with related majors. Therefore, it is likely that perceived importance of the course connection across disciplines will positively affect learning outcomes and attitude toward the collaborative project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0887302X12453646">
<title>Importance of cultural understanding</title>
<p>It is essential for retailers and professionals in the creative industry to obtain a deep understanding of their consumers, particularly when global brands expand their businesses to foreign cultures. The importance of localization and cultural adaptation has been increasingly acknowledged even for global luxury brands which target a homogenous market segment (i.e., high-end consumers who exhibit similar tastes and preferences worldwide). Cultural understanding aids the global brand to cater to local consumers by fine-tuning their promotional and marketing efforts more effectively, while maintaining the consistent brand image across countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887302X12453646">Keegan &amp; Green, 2011</xref>). India has a unique cultural background and the preferences of Indian consumers are as diverse geographically as they are demographically (Manveer &amp; Byun, 2011), requiring in-depth research about the culture and the consumers. Thus, it is likely that appreciating the importance of cultural understanding will play as a critical motivator, thus bringing in positive learning outcomes and attitude toward the project.</p>
<p>The above discussions lead to the following hypotheses:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Perceived importance of collaboration in the industry (Hypothesis 1a), perceived importance of course connection (Hypothesis 1b), and perceived importance of cultural understanding (Hypothesis 1c) will positively affect social learning outcomes.</p>

<title>Attitude and Future Registration Intent</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887302X12453646">Fishbein and Ajzen (1975)</xref>, in their theory of reasoned action (TRA), suggested that individuals’ attitudes and behavioral intentions are formed according to their beliefs about and evaluation of the outcomes of performing a specific behavior. A substantial body of literature empirically supported the relationships that link beliefs, attitude, and intentions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887302X12453646">Bagozzi, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0887302X12453646">Davis, Bagozzi, &amp; Warshaw, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X12453646">Kolekofski &amp; Heminger, 2003</xref>). Drawing from literature, it is expected that students who develop strong beliefs about social, cognitive, and emotional learning outcomes will form positive attitudes toward the collaborative project, which in turn affect their intent to participate in future collaborative courses. Therefore, the following hypotheses are proposed:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>
<italic>Hypothesis 5</italic>: Social (Hypothesis 5a), cognitive (Hypothesis 5b), and emotional (Hypothesis 5c) learning outcomes will positively affect attitude toward the collaborative project.</p>

<title>Sample and Procedure</title>
<p>Diversity in a group creates a dynamic learning environment by providing students with opportunities to learn from and teach each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12453646">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). In order to take advantages of various perspectives and knowledge levels in a group, three different courses, including upper- and lower-level courses, were selected. Students enrolled in the three different classes (lighting [a junior-level interior design course; <italic>N</italic> = 25], visual merchandising [a lower level apparel design/merchandising course; <italic>N</italic> = 25], and global retailing [an upper-level apparel merchandising course, <italic>N</italic> = 9]) were used to collect data in the pretests and posttests. Students completed the questionnaire in the class before and after the collaborative project; the pretest was administered in the beginning of the semester right after the instructors explained the expectation of the project, and the posttest was conducted at the end of the semester after students submitted their final projects.</p>
<p>The shared goal of the collaborative project was to successfully establish a retail store in New Delhi, India, for an assigned global luxury brand. India was chosen because of its rapid population growth and cultural diversity. Additionally, India has a unique retail environment, posing challenges for foreign brands in market entry and expansion (Manveer &amp; Byun, 2011). Students were given a hypothetical scenario in which groups of students in each class role-played as a business consultant (global retailing students), a lighting specialist (interior design students), or a visual merchandiser (visual merchandising students) working for a global luxury brand. Each class formed four groups working on different global luxury brands (Chanel, Hermes, Gucci, and Louis Vuitton). Students who worked on the same brand collaborated across courses. Students were required to attend the presentations prepared by each course unless there was a time conflict with other classes. For those who could not attend the class, the student presentations were video recorded and posted on the class Blackboard (the online learning management system). The videos were shared in class or reviewed individually, so that students were kept up to date on the information about the group activities.</p>
<p>The global retailing students were responsible for conducting the in-depth market analyses, including characteristics of Indian culture and retail environment, consumer preferences, and shopping patterns. Their research findings were shared with the interior design and visual merchandising students through PowerPoint presentations. Additionally, in order to provide more market-specific information about the brands assigned to each group, the global retailing students held a consultation meeting outside the classroom with their team members in interior design. The global retailing students provided information about the assigned brand’s global strategies such as the management philosophy, brand positioning, global operations, and entry/expansion strategies in other cultures, especially in Asia. The interior design students shared their initial store design sketches and the global retailing students consulted on issues concerning brand standardization or localization regarding retail store design for Indian consumers based on their in-depth market and brand research. The students concluded the meeting by highlighting the opportunities and challenges that should be considered when designing a retail store for the assigned brands in India.</p>
<p>The interior design students were mainly responsible for creating the design of the retail interior, including color selections, furnishing selections, lighting specification, and space planning, while considering the market research information from the global retailing students. The interior space was located within an existing site in New Delhi where high-end luxury brands currently exist. The interior design students were given a standard floor plan and required to generate the necessary drawings and renderings of the space, while maintaining the original brand identity as well as being culturally appealing to the Indian market. To successfully complete the tasks, the interior design students conducted research on the cultural, demographic, and geographical aspects of the location and held a business meeting with the global retailing students to discuss their findings. The interior design students also collaborated with the visual merchandising students for effective retail space design and lighting in window displays by (a) sharing the information presented by the visual merchandising students about the assigned brands’ window displays used in other cultures and (b) working together in teams to provide lighting recommendations and install lighting devices in the window cases. These activities helped the interior design students better understand the importance of cultural understanding in designing retail spaces and window displays in foreign markets.</p>
<p>The visual merchandising students were responsible for creating a window display concept as well as the physical installation of the final product. Based on market research information provided by the Global Retailing students, the window display designs were created to appeal to the Indian consumers. After attending the Global Retailing students’ presentations, the visual merchandising students were required to conduct their own research about the assigned brand, which in turn was shared with the interior design students through a PowerPoint presentation. The presentation included (a) the company background and brand positioning, (b) trend analyses of the brand’s advertisements and window displays in the domestic and international markets, and (c) window display ideas and considerations for Indian consumers. Each group in Visual Merchandising submitted three window design concepts using Photoshop. The three faculty members involved in the collaborative project evaluated 12 window display designs and selected the best design for each brand for installation in the four window cases housed in the college building. The visual merchandising students received lighting recommendations and installation help from the interior design students. Finally, the final project of each group was presented in the collaborative presentation involving all students from the three courses.</p>

<p>The measurement items for each variable are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0887302X12453646">Table 1</xref>. Most of the items used in this study were adapted from existing scales. Perceived importance of collaboration in the industry was measured by 3 items; 2 items were from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12453646">Kim et al. (2008)</xref> and 1 item, “By participating in a collaborative project, I can gain an understanding of how specific parts of a company in the creative field function,” was developed in this study. Perceived importance of course connections across disciplines was measured using 2 items developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12453646">Kim et al. (2008)</xref>. The reported reliability of the original scale was higher than .80. Perceived importance of cultural understanding was measured using 3 items developed in this study. To measure cognitive learning outcomes, 6 items were used, including 3 items borrowed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12453646">Gokhale (1995)</xref> and 3 items from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887302X12453646">Thompson and Ku (2006)</xref>. Gokhale reported the reliability of the measure to be higher than .80. Social learning outcomes were assessed using 3 items; 2 items were borrowed from Polland, Miers, and Gilchrist (2004) and 1 item was from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887302X12453646">Thompson and Ku (2006)</xref>. Four items were used to measure emotional learning outcomes. Attitude toward the collaborative project was measured by 7 items borrowed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887302X12453646">Madden, Ellen, and Ajzen (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0887302X12453646">Holbrook and Batra (1987)</xref>. Two items, worthless–worthwhile, and not valuable–valuable, were added for this study. The measure used a 5-point Semantic Differential scale and higher scores indicated positive attitudes. Although we used the TRA generally to support the rationale that attitudes affect intent, we did not assess attitudes as outlined in the TRA. Intent to register for future collaborative courses was measured using 4 items which included 3 items from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12453646">Kim et al. (2008)</xref> and 1 item from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887302X12453646">Pollard, Miers, and Gilchrist (2004)</xref>.</p>

<p>Additionally, in order to examine the level of knowledge attainment as part of the cognitive aspect of the learning outcomes, we measured both subjective and objective knowledge about India prior to and following the collaborative project. Subjective knowledge regarding Indian culture was measured by 3 items; 2 items were borrowed and modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0887302X12453646">Flynn and Goldsmith (1999)</xref> and 1 item, “I feel pretty confident in my understanding of Indian culture,” was developed for this study. Objective knowledge about India, including 12 items and using a nominal scale (<italic>yes, no, I don’t know</italic>), developed for this study to measure students’ overall knowledge about Indian culture, economy, and the retail business sector. In addition, project satisfaction, which was used only in the posttest, was measured by 5 items; 4 items were developed for this study and one, “Overall, the collaborative learning was a positive learning experience for me,” was borrowed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887302X12453646">Pollard, Miers, and Gilchrist (2004)</xref>. Finally, respondents’ demographic characteristics (age and major [open-ended], gender and ethnicity [close-ended]) were asked. All measures used in this study, except attitude and objective knowledge about India, utilized a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> and 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 56 and 52 responses<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0887302X12453646">1</xref>
</sup> were collected from the pretests and posttests, respectively, resulting in 95% response rate for the pretest and 88% for the posttest. In both tests, the mean of the respondents’ age was 21 years old with a range of 19–26, and all respondents, except 1, were female.

<title>Preliminary Analysis</title>
<p>Multi-item variables were subjected to principle component analyses (PCA) with varimax rotation and Cronbach’s α reliability tests. PCAs were performed separately for pretest and posttest data to examine consistency in dimensionality of the variables across data sets. The PCA results were consistent in the dimensionality with the same items loading on each factor across the two data sets. Most factor loadings were above .80 with several exceptions (.66 ~ .79). For each factor, eigenvalues were greater than 1 and Cronbach’s α coefficients of all the measures exceeded the desired level of .80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0887302X12453646">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0887302X12453646">Table 1</xref>). Because item correlations between social learning and cognitive learning outcomes were relatively high (<italic>r</italic> = .76 ~ .79), another PCA was performed on the combined set of 9 items. Results revealed that these two variables were unidimensional. Therefore, the items for social and cognitive learning outcomes were combined for a composite score of the social/cognitive learning outcomes (S/CLO). The variable score was computed by averaging scores from all items of each variable. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0887302X12453646">Table 1</xref> reports the final items used in this study, mean (<italic>M</italic>) and standard deviation (<italic>SD</italic>) of each item and variable score, and reliability of each measure in the pretests and posttests.</p>

<title>Descriptive Statistics</title>
<p>Scores for objective knowledge about India were recoded; for each question, the correct answer was coded as 1 and other choices (i.e., incorrect answers and <italic>I do not know</italic> responses) were coded as 0. The scores of 13 items were summed and averaged to represent respondents’ score for the overall objective knowledge about Indian culture. The mean scores of five variables, including perceived importance of course connections across disciplines, perceived importance of cultural understanding, intent to register future collaborative courses, and subjective and objective knowledge about Indian culture, were higher in the posttest than in the pretest.<sup>

<sec id="section18-0887302X12453646">
<title>Regression Analyses</title>
<p>To test the hypotheses, stepwise multiple and simple regression analyzes were conducted. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0887302X12453646">Tabachnick and Fidell (2007)</xref>, stepwise multiple regression is designed “to develop a subset of independent variables that is useful in predicting the dependent variable, and to eliminate those independent variables that do not provide additional prediction to the independent variables already in the equation” (p. 140). Because the purpose of this study is to identify the most significant, parsimonious predictors of the dependent variable, the use of stepwise multiple regression can be justified for hypotheses testing. These analyses were performed using the pretest and posttest data, separately, to examine differences in the significance of the proposed relationships. Because social and cognitive learning outcomes were combined into one dimension, we combined Hypotheses 1 and 2 (i.e., Hypotheses 1/2), Hypotheses 5a and 5b (i.e., Hypotheses 5a/b), and Hypotheses 6a and 6b (i.e., Hypotheses 6a/b) in the tests.

<title>Conclusion and Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated how student learning can be enhanced through the incorporation of a multidisciplinary collaborative project within the apparel merchandising and interior design curriculum. We developed and tested a model which delineates relationships among students’ perceived importance of collaboration, course connections, and cultural understanding, multidimensional learning outcomes, attitude toward the collaborative project, and intent to register for future collaborative courses in the pretests and posttests.</p>
<p>In this model, we originally proposed that collaborative learning outcomes have three distinct dimensions, which encompass social, cognitive, and emotional outcomes of learning. However, our results showed that social and cognitive learning outcomes are one dimension. In this regard, prior research suggests that learning is a social process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0887302X12453646">Vygotsky, 1978</xref>), involving activities among teachers, peers, and learning tools, which lead to students’ cognitive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887302X12453646">Kim &amp; Baylor, 2006</xref>). As a result, social and cognitive learning outcomes are closely interrelated and the impact of each dimension can be rather circular and complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887302X12453646">Perret-Clermont, Perret, &amp; Bell, 1991</xref>), possibly making these two dimensions hardly distinct from each other. Therefore, in this study, multidimensional learning outcomes included two dimensions: social/cognitive learning and emotional learning.</p>
<p>The following sections cover the discussion and implications of each finding, the limitations of this study, and suggestions for future collaborative projects.</p>
<sec id="section22-0887302X12453646">
<title>The Role of Perceived Importance in Multidimensional Learning Outcomes</title>
<p>This study found a critical role of students’ perceived importance of collaboration in the industry in generating social/cognitive and emotional learning outcomes. In both the pretests and posttests, students who believed that the collaborative project would allow them to gain an understanding of the collaboration that is required in the creative industry tended to perceive a higher level of S/CLO (i.e., learning more from gaining new perspectives, stimulated thinking, and improved intercommunication skills) and emotional learning outcomes (i.e., collaborating with other classes is fun, exciting, enjoyable, and pleasurable). By understanding the collaborative processes adopted by professionals within the retail industry and dynamically interacting with peers in other majors, students might be able to develop their social and cognitive skills. These findings suggest that when developing a collaborative project involving related majors, it is important for instructors to help students understand the importance of the amount and types of collaboration required by professionals in the industry. The project should be designed to emphasize the various roles of and collaboration process among the professionals in the industry to stimulate positive learning outcomes.</p>
<p>This study also showed the differences between the pretests and posttest (i.e., before and after the project) in terms of the predictors of the learning outcomes. In the pretest, in addition to perceived importance of collaboration, perceived importance of course connections across disciplines was a significant driver of S/CLO, whereas in the posttest, perceived importance of cultural understanding was another significant driver of these learning outcomes. This result may indicate that before students were involved in the project, their initial awareness of the important role of cultural understanding in accomplishing the project goal was low. However, after completing the project, students appeared to acknowledge the importance of possessing a cultural understanding for global brands as they expand their businesses into other cultures, thus resulting in positive S/CLO. Nevertheless, while perceived importance of course connection was a significant predictor of S/CLO in the pretest, it was not strong enough to affect any learning outcomes in the posttest. Among the three importance variables, only perceived importance of collaboration in the industry contributed to enhancing emotional learning outcomes in both tests. This finding emphasizes the importance of students’ understanding of collaboration to increase their emotional engagement in a collaborative project.</p>

<sec id="section23-0887302X12453646">
<title>Antecedents of Attitude Toward the Project and Intent to Register for Future Collaborative Courses</title>
<p>The findings of this study showed that in the pretest, both perceived importance of collaboration in the industry and course connection across disciplines influenced attitude toward the collaborative project. However, in the posttest, only perceived importance of collaboration in the industry significantly affected attitude. This finding highlights the importance of collaboration in the industry in a collaborative project as not only a predictor of different learning outcomes but also a predictor of attitude toward the collaborative project. Therefore, it is critical for instructors to help students realize how professionals in related areas collaborate with each other to achieve common goals.</p>
<p>When reviewing the impact of learning outcomes, all dimensions of learning outcomes had significant positive impacts on attitude toward the collaborative project in both tests, indicating that both emotional and social/cognitive learning experiences are integral for the development of a positive attitude, which, in turn, leads to intent to register for future collaborative courses. Notably, compared to S/CLO, emotional learning outcomes had a stronger impact on attitude in both tests, highlighting the importance of emotional engagement in creating positive attitudes in collaborative projects. Students who are emotionally engaged in the project with an expectation of a fun and enjoyable learning experience tended to have positive attitudes toward the project. A learning process involves affective experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887302X12453646">Forgas, 2001</xref>), which indicates that students experience various emotional states (e.g., interest, excitement, and frustration) in a learning process (Kort, Reily, &amp; Picard, 2001) and all of these emotions affect students’ learning and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887302X12453646">Kim &amp; Baylor, 2006</xref>). As such, in this study, students who developed beliefs about positive emotional outcomes (i.e., those who described the project as fun, enjoyable, exciting, and pleasurable) were likely to be more motivated and involved in the project, thus leading to favorable attitudes toward the project.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while emotional learning outcome was a predictor of the intent to register for future collaborative courses in the pretest, S/CLO was a significant driver leading to future registration intent in the posttest. This finding may indicate that before students were involved in the collaborative project, they tended to put more value on emotional or experiential learning outcomes in shaping their future registration intent. However, after completing the project, students tended to appreciate S/CLO (e.g., knowledge attainment, critical thinking and intercommunication skills, and increased interactions within/across the groups), which are more practical and directly applicable to other courses and projects, in determining future registration intent. Finally, in this study, students’ attitude toward the collaborative project was associated with their intent to register for future collaborative courses.</p>

<title>Limitation of the Study and Directions for Future Collaborative Projects</title>
<p>Although this study contributes to the literature by identifying antecedents and consequences of multidimensional learning outcomes in the context of the multicourse collaborative project for fashion retailing and interior design majors, some caveats and directions for future research deserve discussion. First, although this study revealed social and cognitive learning outcomes to be one-dimensional due to the high correlation between the variables, previous studies have suggested that they are distinct dimensions; social learning outcomes were evaluated by the levels of student engagement and interactions for information/knowledge sharing and the development of interpersonal communication skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887302X12453646">Bandura, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887302X12453646">Winter et al., 2008</xref>), whereas cognitive learning outcomes were measured by the level of critical thinking development and knowledge acquisition through the collaborative work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12453646">Gokhale, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12453646">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X12453646">Ma &amp; Pendergast, 2010</xref>). Together with emotional learning outcomes, each of these learning outcomes may play distinct roles in motivating students and developing attitudes and behavioral intentions. Therefore, future studies may refine the measurements to distinguish each dimension more clearly and to be used as a more powerful evaluation tool to assess multiple learning outcomes of a collaborative project. Moreover, along with the refined measurements, the proposed model in this study could be further tested in various collaborative learning environments and disciplines to improve the validity of the findings.</p>
<p>Second, it is widely documented in the literature that among the issues and challenges surrounding group dynamics and social systems, individual student motivation is found to be a main limitation in most collaborative projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887302X12453646">Järvelä et al., 2010</xref>). In our study, the interior design students were more accustomed to working individually and tend to believe that individual performance is more essential for their overall grade than group work, possibly affecting the motivation level at the beginning of the project. Considering our findings where students’ perceived importance of collaboration in the industry significantly enhance social/cognitive and emotional learning outcomes and attitude toward the collaborative project both in the pretests and in the posttests, instructors may highlight the importance of this belief throughout the implementation stages to maintain students’ motivation and enhance student learning throughout the duration of the collaborative project. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X12453646">Ma and Pendergast (2010)</xref> also suggest that instructors should play the role of a facilitator, supporter, and motivator in order to promote students’ active participation in a collaborative project and to strengthen team morale among groups. Their suggestion highlights the management of students’ motivation as a critical component in the students’ social/cognitive and emotional learning outcomes, and the importance of motivating student learning by creating and facilitating a more positive learning environment.</p>
<p>Finally, scheduling among students in different classes has been a common challenge for a multicourse collaborative project because it is difficult to find related classes during the same class times. In this study, we tried to minimize the problems by posting the related information on the class Blackboard and encouraging students to provide additional helps outside of class. For better outcomes, several considerations should be made in the future to prevent issues and challenges from occurring in order to promote the interconnection of social systems and learning. In response to this challenge, future multicourse collaborative projects may fully utilize recent technology through online discussion groups and calendars (e.g., Facebook, Link In, Doodler, etc.) to promote better communication and interconnection across courses and students. Most importantly, course instructors should take the responsibility to promote social interaction and facilitate class interaction. The instructors’ active participation in the collaborative project may allow for fewer problems in communication and potentially can improve group interaction, which ultimately creates a positive learning environment.</p>
