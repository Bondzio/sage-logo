<p>Slavoj Žižek’s latest book, <italic>First As Tragedy, Then As Farce</italic>, is the most accessible book that has come from his pen thus far. It will certainly find a wide readership, also outside academia, especially among the international left, or ‘our side’ as Žižek puts it, which ‘no longer has to go on apologizing; while the other side’—the side responsible for a financial meltdown of historic proportions and for cynic or enthusiastic support of late capitalism—‘had better start [apologizing] soon’ (p. 8).</p>
<p>Surely, many of the readers who count themselves to this Our Side will resist Žižek’s fierce defence for ‘The communist hypothesis’, an expression of Alain Badiou chosen by Žižek as the title of the second and last chapter. With this controversial pamphlet, is not the philosopher, <italic>cum</italic> political seducer of the youth, himself setting the stage for a repetition of history as a farce? Žižek’s answer is a resounding No ‘Try again. Fail again. Fail better’, he quotes from Samuel Becket’s prose piece <italic>Worstward Ho</italic> and lashes out against the mushrooming of gated communities from Shanghai to São Paolo (p. 4f) and today’s wave of enclosures around physical and virtual commons, where the extracting of rent is becoming more and more important as a source of profit for capital (p. 145). Faced with what amounts to a crisis in a civilization, we should make a radical return ‘to the starting point’, even positioning ourselves before ‘the Jacobin climax of the French revolution’; repeat the beginning, ‘from the zero-point’: ‘One should reject any sense of continuity with what the Left meant over the last two centuries’ (p. 86f), whilst keeping ‘the precise reference to a set of actual social antagonisms which generates the need for communism’ (p. 87f).</p>
<p>What the title of the book alludes to, by quoting from Marx’ <italic>Eighteenth Brumaire</italic>, is instead two presidential addresses by George Bush. One was held after 9/11 and one after the financial collapse. In both speeches, Žižek argues, Bush ‘evoked the threat to the American way of life’ and the need to act fast and decisive, also by ‘the partial suspension of American values’ (p. 1). In the first case inviolable freedoms of the individual were suspended and in the second the supremacy of market capitalism. Žižek’s inspired account for the latter suspension by means of massive and ‘socialist’ state intervention to save the financial system remains an important reference point throughout the book. It is this account and Žižek’s explanation in the first chapter, of the different forms that ideology can take, that is of primary interest to all those who study finance in general and the mundane enigma of money in particular.</p>
<p>That chapter is entitled ‘It’s Ideology, Stupid!’, but Žižek makes clear that <italic>ideology</italic> functions in two modes: in the <italic>symptomal</italic> mode, which we have become used to expose, and in a <italic>fetishistic</italic> mode, which enable ideology to appear as ‘non-ideology’. When the symptoms, the ‘cracks in the fabric of ideological lie’ that protects a system, become too ubiquitous—as is the case for the present day financial system, one may add—there remains always the resource of the fetish. This is ‘the embodiment of the Lie which enables us to sustain the unbearable truth’ (p. 65), for example when holding on to an item that once belonged to a loved one who is now dead. Money, what Finance is all about, is the cardinal example of a fetish that makes us ‘able to accept the way things are’. To bring his argument into the realm of morality and ethics: I can be perfectly aware of shocking economic injustice prevailing around me in a deeply unequal society. I can honestly renounce this state of affairs, as well as label in contempt all apologetic explanations surrounding the dire situation as ‘ideology’. My very possession of a sizeable amount of money—paradoxically enough also the <italic>symptom</italic> of something being very wrong in the society as a whole—nevertheless enables me to endure eating my five course dinner, be it also from golden plates. What I have to do, with Žižek, in order not to have a break down, is to clinch with whitened knuckles, harder and harder, to my money fetish. One of Žižek’s great achievements, which he in this book makes even more accessible to a broad audience, is the way in which he—supported by his particular brand of Lacanian Marxism—sheds light on the difficult, or ‘enigmatic’, fourth section in the first chapter of Marx’ <italic>Capital</italic> that deals with commodity fetishism, the absolute centrality of this idea to Marx’ analysis of the capitalist system.</p>
<p>‘I pretend to be a rational, utilitarian subject, well aware how things truly stand, but I embody my disavowed belief in the money-fetish’, Žižek explains (ibid.). Lies here not one of the secrets of professional finance taking so called ‘excessive risk’, up until the very brink of disaster, also when disaster appears unavoidable to ‘the rational agents’? Analysing Alan Greenspan’s appearance before the US Congress—when Greenspan displayed his ‘shocked disbelief’ in how carelessly, speaking in commonsensical terms, the financial companies managed their risks—Žižek points to ‘the financial speculators’ quite rational expectation that the risks would be worth taking, since, in the event of a financial collapse, they could count on the state to cover their losses’ (p. 30). It is however simply hard to believe that the top managers of banks and other profit maximizing financial institution and certainly not the individual financial trader, had this in mind already before these institutions crashed. Were they not simply making more money, up until the point when … they didn’t do so any longer? Doesn’t the notion of rationality in the short run combined with Žižek’s own evocation later in the same chapter of the role of the money-fetish provide better tools for understanding the socio-psychological aspects of the financial melt down?</p>
<p>It is an adventure to read a text written by Slavoj Žižek. This time he starts out from the financial crisis and its ideologues. He deals with citizenship and exclusion, Obama’s presidency, the class politics of the Talibans, Stalinism, anti-Semitism, liberalism, Christianity, Islam, climate change, food crisis, war and poverty or the adverts of Starbucks. He uses both the most commonplace and abstruse examples to make us <italic>see</italic> the precarious times we are living in. He quotes both Marx and the Marx brothers to make his eye-opening points about burning global issues, arguing that what ‘we are allowed to observe prevents us from <italic>knowing what it is that we see</italic>’ (p. 8).</p>
<p>In the spirit of Enlightment, Žižek is not afraid. He argues for ‘reinventing [communism] on a new basis’ (p. 156). Žižek shows that it is possible to be both a learned and a daring academic, putting oneself at risk. This book is highly recommended.</p>
