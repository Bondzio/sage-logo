<abstract>
<p>Open reduction and internal fixation of a distal radius fracture can leave a volar plate in close proximity or touching the tendons of the wrist. This cadaveric study examines the how volar plate position changes contact pressure and force against the flexor pollicis longus (FPL) tendon in multiple wrist extension positions. This study suggests that moving the plate from an ideal position (distal edge at the watershed line) to a malposition (5 mm distal to the watershed line) significantly increased the force by 72.7% and contact pressure by 33.5% on the FPL. Multiple clinical case reports have described rupture of the flexor tendons associated with distally positioned plates or protruding screw heads, creating prominent or sharp edges. This study illustrates that in order to minimize contact pressure on the flexor tendons, plating distal to the watershed line should be avoided when possible.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Open reduction and internal fixation is an effective treatment for displaced distal radius fractures. Many surgeons use locked volar plating as it provides a stable construct with good subchondral bone support, even for comminuted fractures or patients with poor bone density. This allows for earlier mobilization postoperatively, better functional outcomes, and fewer complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412453436">Berglund and Messer, 2009</xref>). An additional advantage of volar plating is the increased distance between tendons and the volar cortex in comparison to the extensor surface, avoiding close contact between the plate and flexor tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1753193412453436">Vasenius, 2008</xref>). The possible complications of volar plating have not been researched as extensively as those associated with dorsal plating. They include flexor and extensor tendon irritation, median nerve damage, hardware failure, and loss of reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412453436">Berglund and Messer, 2009</xref>). Although predictive factors for flexor tendon damage post-volar plating include previous tendon damage and long-term steroid use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412453436">Bell et al., 1998</xref>), most of the evidence for flexor tendon damage has come from clinical case reports describing incorrect positioning of plates or screw heads leading to prominent sharp edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412453436">Klug et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412453436">Rampoldi and Marsico, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412453436">Valbuena et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The placement of a volar plate distal to the watershed line of the distal radius is a proposed cause of flexor pollicis longus (FPL) injury. The transverse ridge of the plate, when placed too distally, has the potential to impinge on the traversing flexor tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412453436">Bell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412453436">Cross and Schmidt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412453436">Rampoldi and Marsico, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412453436">Valbuena et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, elevation of the plate off the volar surface may also disturb the crossing tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412453436">Cross and Schmidt, 2008</xref>). However, to our knowledge, no previous biomechanical study has quantified the extent of contact pressure or tendon force modification that may be caused by distal radius volar plate insertion.</p>
<p>The purpose of this cadaveric study was to examine how volar plate position and plate elevation affect force and contact pressure on the FPL in multiple wrist extension positions.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1753193412453436">
<title>Specimen preparation</title>
<p>Seven fresh frozen cadaveric forearms were plated using a standard commercial plate on the distal radius, the Variax Narrow Anatomical Volar DR Plate (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA). Five of the specimens were from males and two from females. Specimens were from patients between age 50 and 95 years. Median donor age was 87 years and average age was 78.6 years. All specimens were donated to the University of California at San Francisco willed body program in 2008 or 2009. Average volar tilt was 13.3° (SD 2.8°) and average radial inclination was 26.8° (SD 2.9°); however, radial inclination and volar tilt were only measured on four of the seven specimens. None of the forearms had a known fracture in the past and all were anatomically normal.</p>
<p>The surgical approach followed the surgical instructions provided by the plate manufacturer. This included an incision over the flexor carpi radialis tendon. Ulnar traction of the tendon then revealed the pronator quadratus underneath. The pronator quadratus was released at its distal and radial margins from the radius and elevated as an ulnarly based flap. This revealed the pronator fossa, where we placed our plates to the distal radius. Because the plate was repositioned multiple times on each cadaver wrist, the plate was secured using a single screw in the oval gliding hole of the plate. Antereopostereor and lateral fluoroscopic images were taken before each measurement and reviewed by an attending surgeon to confirm that the desired plate position was achieved for each test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412453436">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The pronator quadratus was left reflected. It has been recommended that, when possible, the pronator quadratus be reattached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412453436">Bell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412453436">Smith and Henry, 2005</xref>); however, attempts are frequently inefficacious, especially in patients with muscle atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193412453436">Douthit, 2005</xref>), leading to a significant portion of surgical patients with the pronator quadratus left reflected. Additionally, the problem of tendon rupture persists even when the pronator quadratus is returned to place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412453436">Brown and Lifchez, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>A braided line was tied to the FPL at the muscular attachment. Tension on this line transferred tension onto the tendons, which caused flexion of the thumb. In order to approximate the direction of pull of the tendon, the braided line was drawn through an aluminum tube that tunneled through the forearm. The tube for the FPL was introduced at the volar incision site and exited at the medial epicondyle. An incision was made on the distal dorsal forearm over the course of the extensor pollicis longus (EPL) tendon and a braided line was tied to the EPL. This line was also tied at the muscular attachment and drawn through an aluminum tube. This tube was introduced at the dorsal incision site and exited at the lateral epicondyle. Tension on this braided line caused extension of the thumb. The tubes were inserted distally and pushed blindly through the forearm toward the epicondyles. When the tubes were advanced far enough proximally that the skin was elevated, incisions were made at the elevated skin and the tubes were pulled proximally. The tubes were pulled until their distal ends were proximal to the attachment of the braded lines, with the thumb in both flexion and extension.</p>

<sec id="section4-1753193412453436">
<title>Specimen positioning</title>
<p>The arms were suspended on a custom jig, allowing the changing tensions of the tendons to cause full flexion and extension of the thumb. The EPL tendon was subjected to a constant passive tension of 9.8 N, pulling the thumb and wrist into extension. A force of 9.8 N was chosen because we experimentally found it to sufficiently extend the thumb. We could not find any literature describing in vivo measurements of EPL forces.</p>
<p>The FPL tendon was subjected to 21 N of cyclic loading, overcoming the extensor force and moving the thumb into full flexion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412453436">Figure 2a</xref>). These force values were estimated from previous in vivo measurements of flexor tendon forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193412453436">Schuind et al., 1992</xref>). Movement of the thumb caused the dorsal surface of the FPL tendon to slide along the plate. During the cyclical movement we measured the contact pressure between the plate and tendon with a thin film (0.15 mm thick) real-time pressure measurement system (F-Scan System with #4201 sensor pads; Tekscan, South Boston, Massachusetts, USA). The thin-film sensors were glued to the surface of the plate with cyanoacrylate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412453436">Figure 2b</xref>), and a consistent region of interest (ROI) for the study was selected corresponding to the area of contact between the FPL and the prominent edge of the plate. All contact pressure measurements were made using this ROI.</p>

</fig>
<p>We regarded 25° of wrist extension as the normal anatomical position, with 60° as an extreme working angle of the hand. Therefore, we tested contact pressure on the FPL tendon in these two positions. In each of these wrist angles we varied the plate position, making measurements with the plate in the ideal position with its distal edge at the watershed line compared against the same plate moved 5 mm distally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412453436">Figure 3</xref>). In each wrist angle and plate position, we varied the height of the plate to three different heights, creating a total of 12 individual test combinations.</p>

</fig>
<p>Wrist angle was achieved by placing a wooden dowel in the palm of the specimen. The wrist angle was measured using a goniometer; later, the angle between the metacarpals and radius was measured on fluoroscopic images using a goniometer. Initial plate positioning was carried out based on the manufacturer’s recommendations, except it was only fastened by a single screw in the oval glide hole. The distal placement was achieved by loosening the screw, sliding the plate 5 mm distally, then tightening the screw. Elevation was achieved using lead shims and approximated plate lift-off. Heights were flush to the bone surface, elevated 1 mm, and elevated 2 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193412453436">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p><italic>Test order</italic>: Measurements were taken with the plate in optimal then distal placement at 25° wrist extension, then at 60°. These positions were repeated with the plate elevated 1 mm, and then repeated with the plate elevated 2 mm.</p>
<p>In each test combination, the tendon-plate contact profile was characterized using two outcome measures: maximum contact force and peak contact pressure upon the distal edge of the plate. Specimens were subjected to seven cycles through unconstrained flexion and extension. The maximum contact force and peak contact pressure measurements were averaged over the fourth to seventh full cycle of each test session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753193412453436">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study illustrate biomechanically that a volar plate positioned distal to the watershed line of the distal radius increases the contact pressure on the FPL tendon and is therefore more likely to cause flexor tendon damage. Whilst previous sonographic studies have demonstrated extensor surface screw impingement to cause extensor tendon damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412453436">Bianchi et al., 2008</xref>), to our knowledge this is the first biomechanical study to demonstrate that volar plate position directly affects contact pressure on the flexor tendons. Moving the plate to a distal malposition, 5 mm distal to the ideal placement, has a large and significant increase in both force (72.7%) and contact pressure (33.5%). Our biomechanical findings are in concert with previous clinical literature illustrating that distal plate positioning beyond the watershed line is more likely to damage the FPL tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412453436">Bell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412453436">Cross and Schmidt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193412453436">Rampoldi and Marsico, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412453436">Valbuena et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The thought is that a body in contact with a tendon can cause tendon rupture. It can be caused by the trauma of the fracture itself, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193412453436">Roberts et al., 1990</xref>) bony prominences causing mechanical irritation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412453436">Klug et al., 2007</xref>), or hardware. Unlike the extensor tendons, flexor tendons are not intimately associated with bone at the metadiaphyseal junction, making them less likely to be damaged by the fracture itself or by the hardware on the volar surface of the bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753193412453436">Smith and Henry, 2005</xref>). The combination of normal volar lip prominence and recession of the pronator fossa creates a protective distance between the bone and flexor tendons; this concavity also houses the pronator quadratus. These factors protect the tendon from interference from a volar plate. However, the pronator fossa ends distally at the watershed line, which is a bony prominence that is not covered by the muscle belly of the pronator quadratus. Plating in a distal position creates a protruding distal plate edge. Also, plating distally causes the plate to be on bone that is in closer proximity to the transversing flexor tendons and also lacks coverage from the pronator quadrates. It has been described that plating distal to the epiphyseal line is more likely to be associated with tendon irritation as there is a more intimate association with the flexor tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193412453436">Klug et al., 2007</xref>). Our results corroborate this assertion by showing an increase in force and contact pressure between the plate and tendon with the plate in a distal position.</p>
<p>Our results also demonstrate that raising the plate off the volar surface decreases the force and contact pressure on the FPL. These results were unexpected, as previous clinical cases suggest that low profile plates reduce the risk of tendon injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1753193412453436">Valbuena et al., 2010</xref>) and that plate lift-off is associated with tendon injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412453436">Cross and Schmidt, 2008</xref>). Our result may be due to sensor fatigue possible with the type of real-time pressure measurement film used in this study. There was an increase in force (20.1%, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) and contact pressure (6.9%, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) exerted on the tendon when the wrist was placed in 60° of extension compared with 25°, which was expected but did not reach significance. In pronounced extension of the wrist, the flexor tendons are more taught and their distance from the volar cortex decreases allowing greater contact with the plate with a greater force.</p>
<p>This study had several strengths. The cadaveric specimens tested in this experiment created a reliable and controlled model. All results were normalized to the ideal plate position when the plate edge was just proximal to the watershed line (ideal) and 0 mm proud off the volar surface. Moreover, many different variables in the same specimen were measured, which is not possible in clinical studies or individual clinical cases. Furthermore, the use of fluoroscopy enabled the surgeon to judge the plate position accurately before each test was carried out.</p>
<p>The limitations of this study also need to be addressed. It is important to note that cadaveric specimens do not simulate the exact conditions found in the patient’s forearm due to physiological differences, such as compartmental pressures and ligament laxity. A further limitation of this study was the sensitivity of measurements of the ultrathin pressure sensors. These sensors have previously been shown to have a range of sensitivity with varying loads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193412453436">Niosi et al., 2008</xref>). Although we took care to minimize the shape effects of the plate on the sensors, the complex curved surface of the volar plate may have led to wrinkling and progressive loss of sensitivity, and the experimenter noted a progressive loss of sensor sensitivity throughout testing .The normal to distal plate measurements were taken in succession to each other before the sensors had lost appreciable sensitivity, making them more reliable. In contrast, many cycles of measurements were performed between each profile measurement, allowing more time for decay in the sensor’s sensitivity and leading to more force and contact pressure inaccuracies.</p>
<p>Other limitations of this study arise from variance from what one would see in vivo. This included how the plate was fastened; tensioning the tendons would not have accurately recreated the direction of pull that the muscle would have done, and the mechanism of plate elevation was different than what you would find in a patient.</p>
<p>The plate was fastened using only the oval glide hole. This was done in order to facilitate ease of repositioning the plate, as the plate had to be repositioned six times for each specimen. The problem with the single point of fixation is reduced stability. There could have been micro movements that would have altered measurement values. There could have also been macro movements and rotations of the entire plate around the fixation point. This would lead to measurements being recorded for an erroneous position; though at no point during the study did we notice any micro or macro movements of the plate. We did not re-measure the plate placement after the experiment, nor did we do any intra-observer variability measurements for plate position.</p>
<p>During our experiment we made measurements with the plate at three different levels of elevation. A goal of this was to replicate a thicker plate or situations of plate lift-off. This approximation of a thicker plate can not be generalized because a thicker plate would have a different stiffness, shape, and elasticity, and likely different values for force and contact pressure. This study also does not duplicate the conditions of plate lift-off found in vivo. In vivo plate lift-off can occur after loosening of the fasteners, followed by elevation of the plate away from the bone. Our plate was elevated on shims and likely would not have performed the same as a loosened plate. Another situation in which you may see plate elevation from the cortical bone is after collapse of a fracture, when the bone actually collapses away from a stationary plate. In this situation, you can have significant structural abnormalities in the wrist, for which this experiment would not be a good model.</p>
<p>This study would have also benefited from a greater number of specimens. We did not show significance for a number of outcomes. We suspect that, with a flush plate, moving from an ideal position 5 mm distal will increase contact pressure and force between the tendon and plate; however, the difference we observed was not statistically significant. We were only able to show a significant difference when we compiled the all measurements.</p>
<p>In summary, in this study we observed a possible mechanism of tendon injury: malpositioning of a volar plate in the treatment of distal radius fractures may increase contact pressure and force exerted on the FPL tendon. Many papers have observed a correlation between malplacement of a volar plate with flexor tendon rupture, and plate coverage by pronator quadratus muscle may or may not prevent tendon damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412453436">Bell et al., 1998</xref>). We agree with the prior literature and suggest close follow up in patients with predisposing factors for tendon rupture and that appropriate placement of a volar plate should be determined by the fracture pattern, plate design, and manufacturer recommendations, with close attention to the fact that a plate placed at the volar rim on a lateral radiograph is likely to be distal to the watershed line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193412453436">Cross and Schmidt, 2008</xref>). How this paper differs from others is that tried to identify a potential cause. This biomechanical study identified increased contact pressure and force against the tendon, and quantified the change seen with malpositioning.</p>
