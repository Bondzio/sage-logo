<title>Acute and Delayed Hypersensitivity Reactions</title>
<p>A 61-year-old female patient developed severe malaise, dyspnea, precordial chest pain, tachycardia, urticaria, and nausea after receiving 9 infusions of infliximab (5 mg/kg) for Crohn’s disease. Prior treatment had included high-dose hydrocortisone, and the patient was not a candidate for azathioprine due to liver disease. The patient had initially responded well to infliximab after induction treatments (weeks 0, 2, and 6) and for the subsequent 5 infusions administered every 8 weeks. Prior to infusions 7 and 8, the patient experienced symptom recurrence and blood samples were drawn prior to infusions 8 and 9 to assess immunogenicity. Prior to infusions 8 and 9, circulating anti-infliximab IgG antibody was high (100 units/mL) and serum drug concentration was undetectable (&lt;0.01 µg/mL), although anti-infliximab IgE antibodies were negative. After receiving infusion 9, the patient developed the anaphylactic symptoms previously described. Infliximab was discontinued and the patient was treated with intravenous antihistamine. Symptom resolution was noted within 1 hour. Due to the patient’s recurrent Crohn’s symptoms, adalimumab was initiated 1 week after the infliximab adverse reaction. Twelve days after receiving adalimumab (80 mg), the patient presented with whole body urticaria, headache, and fatigue. She was diagnosed with delayed hypersensitivity reaction to adalimumab and was treated with a 3-day course of high-dose hydrocortisone and antihistamine. Nineteen days after the second drug reaction, anti-adalimumab IgG antibodies were high (45 units/mL), anti-adalimumab IgE antibodies were negative, drug concentration was 0.39 µg/mL, and anti-infliximab IgG antibodies were still present (100 units/mL). Blood testing of samples obtained prior to adalimumab administration revealed that high levels of anti-infliximab antibodies did not react in vivo with binding between adalimumab and anti-adalimumab antibodies. Although the patient had not received further biologic therapy or blood transfusions, anti-infliximab IgG antibody level remained high (81 units/mL) approximately 1 year after the initial reaction, whereas anti-adalimumab IgG antibodies were undetectable (&lt;10 units/mL).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient experienced a severe anaphylactoid reaction to infliximab, which was apparently not mediated by IgE antibodies. The authors note that the symptoms may be related to cytokine release syndrome, and the subsequent reaction to adalimumab was likely caused by newly induced drug-specific antibodies rather than cross-reactivity of previously formed antibodies.</p>

<title>Febrile Illness, Nephrotoxicity</title>
<p>A 36-year-old female developed malaise, fever, headache, and abdominal pain 14 days after initiating treatment with clozaril (12.5 mg daily titrated to 450 mg daily in divided doses). The patient had been admitted 3 months prior for schizophrenia exacerbation. Concurrent medications on admission included quetiapine and sodium valproate. Lithium was added after 4 weeks of hospitalization without symptom improvement. After 12 weeks of hospitalization, clozapine was also added for symptom control, at which time the previously mentioned symptoms developed. She was treated with empiric antibiotics; however, blood and urine cultures were negative for infection. The patient continued to experience fevers, and clozapine was discontinued at this time. The patient’s lithium concentrations were noted to be low to normal (0.2-0.6 mmol/L; reference = 0.5-0.8 mmol/L). The patient required transfer to the intensive care unit for persistent fever, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, and symptoms consistent with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. After transfer, all antipsychotic medications were discontinued. Despite treatment with fluid resuscitation and noradrenaline, the patient progressed to oliguric acute renal failure. Renal replacement therapy was initiated 4 days after transfer to the intensive care unit. C-reactive protein was also elevated; however, procalcitonin level was normal (&lt;2 ng), as were other relevant laboratory parameters and diagnostic tests. In total, the patient spent 18 days in the intensive care unit and had persistent temperature elevations for 21 days. After resolution of fever, the patient’s renal function also returned to normal.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient experienced persistent febrile illness after initiation of clozapine therapy. The patient’s acute renal failure was likely due to clozapine-associated interstitial nephritis, although an exact mechanism was not proposed. The authors recommend consideration of severe toxicities associated with antipsychotics when performing patient evaluations.</p>

<title>Elevated Myeloid Cell Counts</title>
<p>A 24-year-old female patient developed myeloid cell elevations 29 months after her first use of subcutaneous omalizumab (300 mg every 4weeks) for severe asthma. Concurrent medications included albuterol inhaler (90 µg per puff), fluticasone propionate metered dose inhaler (250 µg), fluticasone propionate/salmeterol metered dose inhaler (250 µg/25 µg), ipratropium bromide metered dose inhaler (20 µg), mometasone furoate nasal spray (50 µg), immune globulin (160 mg/L 5 times weekly), alendronate (70 mg), cetirizine hydrochloride (20 mg daily), omeprazole (20 mg daily), ranitidine (150 mg), citalopram (20 mg daily), calcium carbonate (500 mg daily), multivitamin, and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1000 IU daily). Myeloid cell counts after 29 months of omalizumab were 0.8 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L and remained elevated until after discontinuation of omalizumab. Omalizumab therapy was discontinued 42 months after treatment was initiated. After 3 months, the patient’s myeloid cell count was within normal limits.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the temporal association between the changes in myeloid cell counts and omalizumab discontinuation suggest that the use of the drug may have had a contributing role in the development of the blood abnormality. The authors suggest a need for cautious use of omalizumab and close monitoring of patients.</p>

<title>Anaphylactic Shock</title>
<p>Two case reports of hyaluronidase-associated anaphylaxis were described.</p>
<p>
<italic>Patient 1</italic>. A 46-year-old female patient developed symptoms of anaphylactic shock immediately after fluoroscopy-guided epidural administration of hyaluronidase (1500 IU). Levobupivicaine (3 mL of 0.18%) and triamcinolone (20 mg) were administered concomitantly by epidural. The patient had no history of allergies. Immediately after the procedure the patient developed nausea, skin flare, generalized urticaria, respiratory distress, and hypotension (70/30 mm Hg). A skin prick test was negative for hyaluronidase and contrast media, but an intradermal test was positive to hyaluronidase 15 IU/mL (1:100) with a wheal and flare at 8 mm and negative to contrast media. Total IgE level was normal at 86 IU/mL (0-183 IU/mL). The same regimen was administered 3 months prior with no signs of an allergic response. Symptoms resolved immediately after intravenous administration of Ringer’s lactate solution, epinephrine (5 mg), dexamethasone (5 mg), and chlorpheniramine malate (4 mg).</p>
<p>
<italic>Patient 2</italic>. A 35-year-old male patient experienced symptoms of anaphylactic shock immediately after fluoroscopy-guided epidural administration of hyaluronidase (1500 IU). Levobupivicaine (3 mL of 0.18%) and triamcinolone (20 mg) were administered concomitantly by epidural. The patient previously had several bee venom injections as a form of treatment at an oriental medical clinic but no history of allergies. Immediately after the procedure the patient developed nausea, skin flare, generalized urticaria, respiratory distress, and hypotension (75/35 mm Hg). A skin prick test was positive for hyaluronidase at 1500 IU/mL (1:1) with a 10 mm diameter wheal and flare and at 150 IU/mL (1:10) with a 4 mm diameter wheal and flare. Both skin prick and intradermal tests were negative to contrast media. Total IgE level was elevated at 213 IU/mL (0-183 IU/mL). Symptoms resolved immediately after intravenous administration of Ringer’s lactate solution, epinephrine (5 mg), dexamethasone (5 mg), and chlorpheniramine malate (4 mg).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that these patients experienced anaphylactic shock related to hyaluronidase. Patient 1 reacted after being exposed to hyaluronidase 3 months earlier. Patient 2 may also have been previously exposed as bee venom contains various protein allergens, including hyaluronidase.</p>

<title>Severe Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions in Asians</title>
<p>A retrospective study of 154 Asian subjects was conducted to assess the incidence of Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrosis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome–toxic epidermal necrosis overlap, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms caused by antiepileptic drugs. Subjects were identified over a 6-year period from medical records at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Each case was evaluated with the Naranjo algorithm and the algorithm of drug causality assessment for Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrosis to determine causality of the suspected adverse reaction. A total of 115 cases of Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrosis and 39 cases of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms were identified during the study period. The majority of cases of Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrosis were caused by carbamazepine (n = 78, 67.8%) or phenytoin (n = 20, 17.4%). Other causative agents included lamotrigine (n = 12, 10.4%), oxcarbazepine (n = 4, 3.5%), and phenobarbital (n = 1, 0.9%). Among the observed cases of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, the primary causative agents were phenytoin (n = 17, 43.6%), carbamazepine (n = 12, 30.8%), and lamotrigine (n = 6, 15.4%). The majority of subjects were treated with corticosteroids (84.4%) or supportive care only (14.9%). The overall mortality rate was 6.49%, with higher mortality observed in toxic epidermal necrosis (50%) and Stevens–Johnson syndrome–toxic epidermal necrosis (20%) versus Stevens–Johnson syndrome (1%) or drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (7.7%). Phenytoin was associated with 8 of 10 deaths observed. Exposure durations or doses of the individual antiepileptic drugs did not appear to be related to symptom development. The liver was the most frequently involved internal organ in antiepileptic drugs–drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, whereas ocular complications were more commonly seen in antiepileptic drugs–Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrosis. Hepatitis was involved in a larger number of cases of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (69.23%) than Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrosis (30.43%), whereas acute kidney injury was more commonly associated with Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrosis (3.48%) than drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (0.08%). Lung injuries such as pneumonitis, pneumonia, or bronchiolotis obliterans were more common with drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (25.64%) than Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrosis (10.43%). The observed cases of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms were also more commonly associated with eosinophilia (30.77%), leukocytosis (48.72%), atypical lymphocytosis (53.85%), and anemia (58.97%). Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrosis was more often associated with corneal ulcer or symblepharon (29.57%), sepsis (13.91%), and urinary tract infection (16.52%). The monitoring of alternative antiepileptic drug usage of patients after antiepileptic drug–severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions episodes revealed that most patients were tolerant of nonaromatic antiepileptic drugs. One patient who initially developed Stevens–Johnson syndrome after oxcarbazepine exposure also developed drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms after lamotrigine exposure; however, all other subjects were prescribed alternative anticonvulsants without further reported incidence of cutaneous reactions.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the nonaromatic antiepileptic drugs valproic acid and topiramate may be safer alternatives for patients who previously experienced a cutaneous adverse drug reaction during treatment with an aromatic antiepileptic agent. They also noted that mortality of phenytoin-related severe cutaneous adverse drug reaction was higher than carbamazepine-related severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions and likely due to complicated comorbidity in patients. The authors recommended monitoring for at least 1 month after starting treatment with these agents to aid in the early detection of Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrosis or drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms.</p>

<title>Stress Cardiomyopathy (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477012439688">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 63-year-old female presented with chest pain 1 week after initiating treatment with phenylephrine (10 mg twice daily). Past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and former tobacco use. No concurrent medications were reported. Abnormal laboratory results included ST-segment elevations and elevated troponin I levels. The patient was acutely treated with aspirin, heparin, and tenecteplase. She subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed normal coronary arteries; left ventriculography showed reduced ejection fraction (40%). The patient had undergone evaluation for chest pain 4 years prior, also after taking phenylephrine at the same dose. During the previous evaluation, the patient had biphasic T-wave changes and elevated troponin I levels; however, diagnosis at that time was stress cardiomyopathy secondary to psychological stress. After the current treatment course, phenylephrine was discontinued and the patient was prescribed metoprolol and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Metoprolol was later changed to carvedilol, and at 8 week follow-up, normal left ventricular systolic function was restored.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient experienced recurrent stress cardiomyopathy after administration of phenylephrine. This reaction may be due to increased levels of circulating catecholamines secondary to stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Excess catecholamines may be directly cardiotoxic to myocardial cells or cause vasospasm of the coronary arteries or microvasculature. The authors recommend consideration of drug-induced causes of stress cardiomyopathy in the absence of emotional triggers.</p>

<title>Severe Neutropenia</title>
<p>A 78-year-old female patient developed severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count = 37 cells/µL) and hypocellular bone marrow with absence of myeloid elements 8 weeks after discontinuation of a 3-week treatment course of vancomycin (750 mg every 12 hours). Concurrent chronic medications included prednisone (5 mg daily), lisinopril (40 mg daily), aspirin (81 mg daily), simvastatin (20 mg daily), and glipizide (5 mg twice daily). On hospital day 1, the patient was started on filgrastim (400 µg daily) for severe neutropenia as well as vancomycin (750 mg every 12 hours) and aztreonam (1 g every 8 hours) for septic thrombophlebitis. The patient’s absolute neutrophil count decreased to 100 cells/µL within 3 days of starting vancomycin. Methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg daily) was started for a suspected autoimmune process. All antibiotics were discontinued on the fifth day of hospitalization. Within 48 hours the patient’s neutrophil count showed recovery (white blood cell count = 500 cells/µL; 10% neutrophils); after 5 days the white blood cell increased to 1200 cells/µL with an absolute neutrophil count of 520 cells/µL. The steroids were then tapered to discontinuation over 3 weeks.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that vancomycin rechallenge during a possible drug-induced neutropenia should be considered with extreme caution. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale identified a “probable” relationship between vancomycin and the adverse reaction. The Naranjo scale suggested that aztreonam and amikacin had “doubtful” involvement in the adverse reaction. The authors noted that the mechanism of vancomycin-induced neutropenia is not clearly defined and is likely multifactorial.</p>

<title>Deep Vein Thrombosis (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477012439688">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 63-year-old male presented with right lower extremity edema and erythema 1 week after receiving subcutaneous romiplostim (1 µg/kg). Concurrent medications at presentation included metoprolol tartrate (25 mg twice daily), isosorbide mononitrate (30 mg daily), digoxin (250 µg daily), and sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg as needed). The patient also had a history of mantle cell lymphoma, which had previously been treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, vincristine, methotrexate, and prednisone for 6 cycles 2 years prior. During chemotherapy treatment, the patient developed a pulmonary embolism, which was treated with enoxaparin (1 mg/kg twice daily). He subsequently underwent bone marrow transplantation and was treated with plerixafor, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide prior to the procedure. More than 1 year later, the patient remained in remission but was noted to have developed severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L). At this time, concurrent medications included acyclovir (400 mg twice daily), sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim (800/160 mg twice daily on weekends), esomeprazole (40 mg daily), oxycodone (5 mg every 4 hours as needed), and fluconazole (400 mg daily). Bone marrow biopsy suggested idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, and he was treated with oral prednisone (1 mg/kg daily) and intravenous rituximab (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) for 4 weeks. Prednisone was eventually tapered and danazole added to regimen (100 mg twice daily increased to 200 mg twice daily). Despite these treatments, platelet count remained low (&lt;50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L). The patient was given 1 dose of subcutaneous romiplostim. Other laboratory parameters at this time were normal with the exception of elevated lactate dehydrogenase (956 IU/L), serum creatinine (1.63 mg/dL), and total protein (5.9 g/dL). One week later, deep vein thrombosis was confirmed in the lower right extremity by Doppler study. The patient was treated with enoxaparin (1 mg/kg twice daily) for 6 months and continued on danazol without further thromboembolic events. Platelet counts remained above 50 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L and lymphoma remained in remission during subsequent follow-up.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this patient experienced deep vein thrombosis after 1 dose of romiplostim. Application of the Naranjo algorithm produced a score of 4, indicating a probable drug-related adverse event. Thromboembolic events are a known adverse reaction associated with romiplostim, occurring at a rate of approximately 0.08 to 0.1 events per 100 patient-weeks; however, these have previously been reported to occur after many weeks of treatment with romiplostim. The authors note that clinicians should be aware that such events may occur at any point during therapy and in patients with a wide range of platelet counts.</p>

<title>Risk of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>–Associated Disease</title>
<p>A retrospective case–control study of more than 14 000 adult patients was conducted to assess the association between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and development of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>–associated diarrhea. Subjects were identified from the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database based on diagnosis codes or receipt of a prescription of oral vancomycin between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 2005. Cases and controls were matched based on age and medical practice. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use was defined as receiving a prescription for any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug in the 90-day period prior to the initial occurrence of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>–associated diarrhea. Case subjects were more likely to have comorbid medical conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, cancer, and renal failure. Additionally, cases were more likely to have received antibiotics, H2 receptor antagonists, oral corticosteroids, or proton pump inhibitors in the 90 days prior to the index date. The most commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in both the case and control groups were acetylsalicylic acid and diclofenac. Among nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, only diclofenac was associated with a significantly increased risk of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>–associated diarrhea (adjusted relative risk = 1.35; 95% confidence interval = 1.10-1.67). Case subjects were found to be at increased risk regardless of the number of prescriptions dispensed for diclofenac. Results were similar when statistical analyses were restricted to patients who had not been hospitalized in the year prior to the <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>–associated diarrhea index date.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that in this population-based analysis, diclofenac was the only nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that was significantly associated with an increased risk for development of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>–associated diarrhea. A mechanism for this effect was not proposed. The authors recommend further study to assess this observed association.</p>

<title>Bleeding During Hospital Stay</title>
<p>A retrospective chart review of 190 adult patients with reduced renal function who received incorrect doses of eptifibatide or bivalirudin during percutaneous coronary intervention was conducted over a 32-month period to assess the incidence of bleeding during their hospital stay. Patients who received incorrectly dosed eptifibatide (64% of patients) experienced more bleeding (64% vs 35%, <italic>P</italic> = .04), a greater extent of bleeding based on criteria from the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction trial and Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries trial (<italic>P</italic> = .03 and <italic>P</italic> = .009, respectively), and more thrombolysis in myocardial infarction major bleeding. Patients who received incorrectly dosed bivaliruidin (28% of patients) experienced a greater extent of bleeding based on the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries criteria (<italic>P</italic> = .01). There was no significant difference between the incidence of bleeding, extent of bleeding based on Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction criteria, or incidence of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction major bleeding.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that patients who received incorrectly dosed eptifibatide and bivalirudin had an increased risk of developing adverse bleeding events.

<title>Thyroid Dysfunction</title>
<p>A nested case–control study evaluated the effect of iodinated contrast media exposure on incident thyroid dysfunction. A total of 178 patients with hyperthyroid and 213 patients with hypothyroid were compared with 655 and 213 euthryoid controls, respectively, using the Partners HealthCare Research Patient Data Registry, which represents 4.5 million patients receiving care at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and at Massachusetts General Hospital. Patients were included in the study if they had a normal thyrotropin level between January 1, 1990, and June 30, 2010; no prior laboratory evidence of abnormal thyroid function; no prior diagnosis of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism; no past or concurrent use of thyroid hormone supplementation or thyroid suppressive medication; no radioactive iodine ablation or surgical thyroidectomy; and a subsequent thyrotropin measurement within 2 weeks to 2 years. Iodinated contrast media exposure was associated with incident hyperthyroidism (odds ratio = 1.98; 95% confidence interval = 1.08-3.60) but not incident hypothyroidism (odds ratio = 1.58; 95% confidence interval = 0.95-2.62). In a secondary analysis, iodinated contrast media was associated with incident overt hyperthyroidism (odds ratio = 2.50; 95% confidence interval = 1.06-5.93) and incident overt hypothyroidism (odds ratio = 3.05; 95% confidence interval = 1.07-8.72).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that iodinated contrast media exposure is associated with development of incident hyperthyroidism and incident overt hypothyroidism. The authors believed this is the first large controlled study of the association between iodinated contrast media exposure and incident thyroid functional disease.</p>

<title>Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone</title>
<p>A 66-year-old Caucasian woman with stage II chronic obstructive pulmonary disease developed syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone after use of moxifloxacin (400 mg daily) for 5 days. Concurrent medications included prednisone (40 mg daily), aspirin (325 mg daily), carvedilol (12.5 mg twice daily), fosinopril sodium (20 mg daily), simvastatin (80 mg daily), and fixed-combination albuterol sulfate and ipratropium bromide oral inhalation (up to 4 times daily as needed). On presentation to the emergency department the woman’s serum sodium concentration was found to be 110 mEq/L (normal range = 135-145 mEq/L), serum osmolality of 240 mOsm/kg (normal range = 270-310 mOsm/kg), urine osmolality of 348 mOsm/kg (normal range = 200-1200 mOsm/kg), and urine sodium concentration of 27 mEq/L. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit. The patient’s diuretics were then discontinued, fluid restriction was limited to 1 L per day, and a workup for causes of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone was performed. Moxifloxacin and prednisone were continued for treatment of recent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation. After 1 day of fluid restriction, the patient’s serum sodium concentration increased to 122 mEq/L and stayed near 119 to 122 mEq/L on days 2 and 3. On day 3 moxifloxacin and fosinopril were discontinued. One day after discontinuation of these medications the patient’s serum sodium concentration increased to 124 mEq/L and eventually increased to 131 mEq/L after 2 days. The patient was then discharged. Four days after discharge, the patient’s serum sodium concentration returned to 134 mEq/L and after 1 month was 139 mEq/L.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the stimulation of γ-aminobutyric acid and <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors in the central nervous system may have resulted in the development of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone in the patient. According to the Naranjo causality scale, this adverse drug reaction was rated as a possible causality with moxifloxacin use.</p>
