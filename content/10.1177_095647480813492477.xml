<p>Just as I've always believed that the Profumo affair wouldn't have gone down in history half so hard had the Secretary of State for War been called Pratt, surely being an English hack wouldn't be nearly so iconic if the original newspaper by-way had had its by-line as the Balls Bond Road. There is something about the fastness and profligacy – the fleet's in! – of the sheer sound of F Street that makes it so pungent; “<italic>Diaries of a Wharf Canary</italic>” would not sound anywhere near as full of sex-and-power-type promise.</p>
<p>Fleet Street Fox is a terrific blogger – her recent pieces on MPs voting themselves a pay rise and the Queen's illness were quite brilliant – so I really was sure I'd love this book. Reader, I hated it. I was expecting something like Liz Taylor at her tempestuous, bitchy best – and got Liz Jones at her wittering, woe-is-me worst.</p>
<p>It starts off along the irritatingly familiar <italic>Babylon</italic> line of recent years; hack Googles every gossip column story of the past decade featuring hotels/fashion/restaurants, invests in a big pair of scissors and a giant pot of paste, and fillets something resembling a book out of it – albeit an Unbook, as vampires are the undead. The first few chapters could be the latest addition, <italic>Divorce Babylon –</italic> angry heroine uses errant husband's toothbrush to clean toilet and then stuffs prawns inside the hollow metal rails of a favourite chair (a spark of originality here – it's generally a curtain rail) but anger soon leaves the building and tears take over.</p>
<p><italic>FSF</italic> refers frequently to Bridget Jones, as if mocking her enough will prevent the reader from thinking: “Gosh, this book really is quite a lot like the Bridget Jones tosh!” But on me it had the opposite effect – why is the author taking the rise out of a franchise which she has been so flagrantly positioned to fill the gap left by? There's not even the odd bit of knowing humour on the war between the sexes which made the Bridget Jones books bearable. <italic>FSF</italic> does what several of my friends do, which is to call the ex by a silly name all the time; “Twatface” in this case, which makes you want to curl up and cry for her, as she's 30.</p>
<p>I'm not advocating that we should all be sweetness and light to our exes – I, for example, have two former husbands whom I despise both as human beings and, more importantly, as writers – but I've never felt the need to call them by anything but their proper names. And if there were a legal issue, then surely just a initial would do?</p>
<p>The constant hysterical railing against the adulterous ex is matched only by the extraordinarily hypocritical outbursts on the evils of drugs while seemingly advocating non-stop alcoholic intoxication as a reasonable reaction to unpleasant life events. The moaning never stops. She has a crippling mortgage. She hates fat women (her husband ran off with one, which admittedly made me smirk – the skinny can be so smug re sex). Going by her blogs, I reckoned <italic>FSF</italic> would be a throwback to those gloriously brittle and witty girl reporters of the Hollywood Golden Age, but she displays all the perspective and lightness of touch of a self-help junkie after a crate of Lambrini – “A soldier home from the wars with no one left to fight” is her eye-crossingly melodramatic description of getting her decree absolute, whereas surely the right reaction is to see it as being given a Get Out Of Jail Free card.</p>
<p>It's like being stuck in a lift with the office bore. Then, every so often she seems to realise how drearily humdrum things are getting, and flings in a joke in such vile taste that surely only Frankie Boyle's mother could love it: “Maybe he's got Maddie McCann in his freezer” – “Their combined perfumes strong enough to gas the Kurds”. One imagines that the cast of ethnic characters – Nick the Wop, the Welsh friend who says “Izzeht!” at the end of every sentence, the comedy Glaswegian – are also intended to provide light relief, whereas they merely make one rejoice that the TV sit-com <italic>Mind Your Language</italic> no longer exists. By the way, I was interested and somewhat puzzled to see that her paper has only a “token” Jew – in my experience of the British press, going back to the 80s, Jews are everywhere in English newspapers, which is partly what has always made them so shamelessly sexy and intellectually lively.</p>
<p><italic>Diaries of a Fleet Street Fox</italic> has a great cover; a slim silhouette of a girl at a laptop – black and white and red all over. But if ever I've seen a flagrant case for complaint about the lack of honesty in journalism, this is it, because the slop inside would be far more realistically represented by a pastel-coloured background featuring a cupcake and a kitten-heel rampant. This book, I fear, is only for the fainthearted; make your excuses and leave.</p>
