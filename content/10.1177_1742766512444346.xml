<p>Daniela Berghahn and Claudia Sternberg’s exciting new collection aims to explore and help define an emerging field in media studies: migrant and diasporic film in contemporary Europe. The editors work from the premise that film is a crucial practice for the (self-)representation of migrants, and that this practice has significant implications for the conception of European identity.</p>
<p>The book comprises 12 essays from across European film studies. And perhaps because it comes from a Research Network funded by strategic initiatives within the British academy (notably the Arts and Humanities Research Council), the collection demonstrates remarkable theoretical cohesiveness, while the essays usefully refer to and build on each other throughout the volume. Contributors include some prominent names within the field of transnational European cinema (Deniz Göktürk, Dina Iordanova, Sarita Malik) and the scholars whose conceptual frameworks have influenced the contributions (Arjun Appadurai, Homi Bhabha, Hamid Naficy, Ella Shohat and Robert Stam) will be familiar to anyone interested in global media studies more broadly.</p>
<p>Although the book is not formally divided into sections, the authors identify two parts: the first three essays map the field of investigation, and are followed by nine essays whose close readings of migrant and diasporic films take up questions and issues that fall within this field. Berghahn and Sternberg’s joint contribution sets an admirable tone for the chapters that follow, grounding ambitious theoretical claims in solid historical analysis, while also recognizing the limitations and pitfalls inherent in a project that sets out to challenge existing research parameters, but seems to uphold a traditional conception of Europe. Providing concise but informative definitions of laden terms such as ‘migration’ and ‘diaspora’, they close with a convincing outline of what constitutes migrant and diasporic cinema, proposing what looks almost like a new genre of European cinema. This interest in taxonomy and categorization reappears throughout the book and points to the newness and rich possibilities of a field that cries out for further exploration.</p>
<p>Dina Iordanova’s thoughtful chapter addresses the subject from a post-Soviet perspective, noting the usefulness of postcolonial frameworks for studying post-Soviet cinema and migration. Iordanova suggests at the outset that the very concept of migrant and diasporic cinema is rapidly becoming outdated as filmmakers cross borders on a project basis, suggesting instead the term, ‘transnationally mobile filmmakers’, as the pace of global migration accelerates and its directionality disperses (p. 65). Building on Berghahn’s and Sternberg’s work, Iordanova identifies a new genre, ‘cinema of the metropolitan multicultural margin’ (p. 51). Anne Jäckel follows with an overview of state and other funding for migrant and diasporic cinema, which rounds out the book’s informal first part. This empirical study of funding agencies remains grounded in industrial analysis, while also investigating some theoretical implications of existing structures, providing an informative context for the two essays that precede it and for those that follow.</p>
<p>The essays that follow cover a wide range of topics and areas related to migration and diaspora, but certain themes bind multiple chapters together. Contributions by Isabel Santaolalla and Encarnación Gutiérrez Rodríguez both take up how migration has changed in Southern European nations such as Greece, Italy and Spain, which, after the end of the Cold War, went from being outmigration countries to receiving ones. These dovetail nicely with Iordanova’s aforementioned essay and Birgit Beumers’ chapter on the subject position of the post-Soviet, Central Asian migrant in European cinema, which differs significantly from earlier waves of postcolonial or 1950s–1970s labour migrations (though, as Beumers notes, one of the major changes in migration from the former USSR is that it has gone from being mainly political to mainly economic in motivation since the Cold War ended).</p>
<p>Rodríguez and Iordanova also share an interest in gender, particularly women who migrate to wealthier lands and become sex workers. Carrie Tarr also takes up gender, specifically the subject of the female migrant, but from a different perspective: her exemplary survey of films made by female migrant or diasporic filmmakers finds that while the concern with sex traffic is certainly important, it tends to be the province of liberal, male, non-diasporic filmmakers. Among migrant female filmmakers, Tarr finds much more interest in ‘the importance of female independence through work’ and the need for homosocial support networks (p. 193). Her look at queer tendencies in migrant filmmaking leads strongly into James S Williams’ more specialized analysis of queer migration as depicted in films from France, Italy and Germany. Williams illustrates convincing connections between ethnic or national differences and formations of gender and sexuality, connections that rest on a shared investment in borders, public and private space, and dislocation.</p>
<p>I would like to place special emphasis on Sarita Malik’s chapter on Black and British Asian cinema in the UK. Malik’s concern that migrant groups are being divided and assigned to certain genres and styles according to an ‘ethnicist’ logic comprises the ‘dark side of hybridity’, as migrant filmmakers are still forced to conform to Western conceptions of identity and aesthetic if they want to receive funding or financial success. The anxiety that Western audiences will pigeonhole migrant and diasporic communities, fixing them according to essentialist notions of identity, reappears in several chapters, notably in Berghahn’s genre-based analysis of the migrant and diasporic youth film. As in the introduction, Berghahn outlines a new genre of European cinema, one that explicitly deals with the intersection between national identity formation and the more universal coming-of-age experience. Berghahn notes the gender bias that haunts these films and underlines the importance of recognizing and avoiding the stereotypes that threaten to undermine the power of hybridity, which she and Göktürk both recognize as residing in an ability to shift between different cultural codes and affiliations at will.</p>
<p>Sternberg’s examination of meta-cinematic reflections in migrant and diasporic cinema, which insists on a special relationship between migrants and filmmaking, sets up the book’s final chapter, in which filmmaker and PhD candidate Gareth Jones discusses industrial realities for migrant and diasporic film practice. This return to the practical questions of production recalls Jäckel’s earlier survey of funding opportunities and helps to locate the book firmly in the context of contemporary conditions of filmmaking beyond the academic sphere. Doing so both raises the stakes and extends the relevance of the volume as a whole.</p>
<p>Across this broad range of topics and areas, all the essays share a commitment to a transnational perspective that questions the continued usefulness of strictly national frameworks (as distinct from the existence of the nation-state as a political entity). In doing so, every author places special emphasis on approaching European film studies with an interest in destabilizing the Eurocentric margin–centre binary that informs traditional European scholarship. This helps to allay the volume’s central limitation, that little attention is paid to film practice outside the larger nations of Western Europe, which threatens to reinforce, rather than upset, the existing hierarchies. That said, this is a volume of unusual strength across all contributions, from scholars who do due diligence in recognizing the pitfalls and class hierarchies that complicate the discourses of transnationalism, migration and cosmopolitanism in the 21st century. For anyone interested in the burgeoning field of migrant and diasporic film studies, or in the changing shape of European film studies, <italic>European Cinema in Motion</italic> is an exciting and essential addition to the literature.</p>
