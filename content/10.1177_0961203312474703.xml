<p>Classification of the wide variety of autoimmune diseases that can occur before or after <italic>the onset</italic> of Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) is currently debated within the conventional SS criteria or as primary SS (<italic>p</italic>SS) developing autoimmune disease or as ‘associated-overlap’ with other systemic autoimmune diseases. There is also debate on whether or not to consider annular polycyclic subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) and annular erythema associated with Sjögren's syndrome (AESS) as a spectrum linked to Ro-SSA and/or La-SSB auto-antibodies (SSA/SSB auto-ab). We present the case of a 55-year-old female patient, with <italic>p</italic>SS positive for SSA and SSB auto-ab, who developed chronic relapsing polymyositis and atypical annular non-polycyclic SCLE lesions resembling AESS, which seemed to suggest a common spectrum. While a chronic-progressive polymyositis may be generally accepted as a relatively rare myositis complicating <italic>p</italic>SS, interpretation of annular lesions of non-systemic SCLE in SS patients might actually be underestimated as <italic>p</italic>SS skin manifestation likely related to SSA/SSB auto-ab.</p>

<p>Although being a relatively benign condition, Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) is a complex systemic autoimmune disease (SAD), the onset of which can be preceded or followed by a wide variety of autoimmune diseases (ADs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312474703">1</xref></sup> and other SADs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312474703">2</xref></sup> According to the current classification criteria,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203312474703">3</xref></sup> SS is defined as <italic>primary</italic> when it appears alone and as s<italic>econdary</italic> in the presence of another concomitant well-defined SAD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312474703">4</xref></sup> Yet, to provide a more appropriate evaluation of the impact of SS, some authors suggest to improve existing classification and further classify primary SS (<italic>p</italic>SS) or as developing additional ADs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312474703">1</xref></sup> or as ‘<italic>associated-overlap</italic>’ with other SADs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312474703">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Here we highlight these issues, discussing the relationship between polymyositis (PM) and non-systemic subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) resembling annular erythema associated with Sjögren's syndrome (AESS) developed in a 55-year-old female patient previously classified as <italic>p</italic>SS. Focusing mainly on the interpretation of the skin manifestations, we also evaluated the ongoing debate of whether to consider annular polycyclic SCLE and AESS as unrelated skin AD annular lesions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312474703">5</xref></sup> or rather as having a common pathogenic origin, mainly linked to the presence of SSA/SSB auto-ab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312474703">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312474703">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312474703">6</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec2-0961203312474703" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>A 55-year-old female was referred to our clinic in 1997 because of the presence of Raynaud’s phenomenon, xerostomia, xerophthalmia and arthralgias. The presence of rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibodies in a speckled pattern, SSA and SSB auto-ab, a score of 4 on the biopsy of minor salivary glands and a positive Rose Bengala test all led to the diagnosis of <italic>p</italic>SS. Other auto-ab to Dna, ENA (U1-RNP, Scl-70, Jo-1, Ku, PCNA), ACA, C1q were negative. No visceral involvement was found and complement (C3 and C4) levels were normal. Hepatitis C and B infections were absent. Cloroquine therapy (200 mg/day) was started. In January 2001, the patient developed an autoimmune thyroiditis with hypothyroidism, and thyroxin supplementation was prescribed. In the fall of 2001, a reddish macular annular erythematous eruption appeared on the patient’s shoulders and upper back, which eventually healed spontaneously. In September 2002, skin manifestations persistently recurred, and analyses revealed an asymptomatic, moderate increase in muscular enzymes creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (from 500 to 700 U/l) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (from 300 to 600 U/l). A skin biopsy revealed aspecific features of chronic dermatitis (<italic>epidermal parakeratosis, atrophy and exocytose; scant lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermo–epidermal interface and perivascularly in addition to a dermal marked elastosis</italic>). Cloroquine therapy was interrupted and oral administration of low levels of steroid 6-methyl prednisolone (6MP, 8–4 mg/day) was started, decreasing, however, only enzyme levels. Because steroid creams (betamethasone) proved ineffective, the patient was given tacrolimus 0.1% ointment, which caused a rapid remission of skin lesions. Two years later, the annular erythematous lesions and moderate increase in muscular enzymes reappeared – this time accompanied by progressive dysphagia and mild–moderate symmetric proximal muscle weaknesses on the lower and upper limbs. X-rays showed gastro-oesophageal reflux and oesophageal manometry documented a spasm at the superior oesophageal sphincter. Electromyography revealed a myopathic pattern of the deltoid. Muscle biopsy showed T-cell infiltrates with a CD8+ or CD4+ phenotype (plus few CD20+ and CD68+ cells). A diagnosis of PM according to Bohan criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203312474703">7</xref></sup> was made, tacrolimus 0.1% (once a day for four weeks) and 6MP pulse was started (250 mg/day for three consecutive days), followed by a rapid tapering of oral steroids down to a maintenance dose of 4 mg/day. Muscle symptoms partially improved whereas skin symptoms completely remitted, though returning in the following two years with a chronic relapsing trend with alternating episodes (lasting 2–4 months each) of either moderate PM or skin eruptions progressively spreading on the upper back, despite ongoing oral steroids (6MP 4–8 mg/day) and topic treatments (betamethasone; tacrolimus 0.1%) as above. Skin lesions were macular non-polycyclic and non-scaling, showing a central resolution without scarring, hypopigmentation or atrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0961203312474703">Figure 1</xref>), itchy and not always related to sun exposure. A second skin biopsy revealed a lymphocytic interface dermatitis with focal vacuolar degeneration of the basal cell layer of epidermis suggesting cutaneous lupus erythematosus (LE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0961203312474703">Figure 2</xref>). Direct immunofluorescence assay, immunostaining for CD20 and mucin staining (alcian blue) proved negative. HLA haplotype was A1-B8-DR3. Overall, a diagnosis of SCLE lesions was made.

</fig></p>
<p>In 2006 dysphagia and muscular symptoms suddenly worsened, with a rapid increase in levels of CPK (1072 U/l) and LDH (770 U/l). Pulse steroid therapy was reintroduced and was followed by a pulse therapy of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) (1 g/kg per day for two consecutive days every month for six months) to control dysphagia. This, however, improved dysphagia only transiently, while achieving mild PM. Oral cyclosporine A (CyA, 3 mg/kg per day) as sparing steroids and 6MP (4 mg/day) were then started, achieving an overall satisfactory clinical remission. In 2008, due to the appearance of hypertrichosis, CyA was interrupted. Micophenolate mofetil (500 mg × 2) was introduced successfully, but was then rapidly interrupted due to an ensuing epigastralgia and tachycardia. Annular lesions reappeared, while dysphagia was severe and muscle impairment was mild. Therefore both pulse steroids and IVIg were reintroduced with 0.1% tacrolimus (as above), achieving a complete remission of relapsing skin and muscle manifestations, to date maintained with a low dose of oral steroid (4 mg/day). In addition, a pulse therapy of IVIg monthly has been continued, due to the mild–severe oesophageal impairment.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0961203312474703" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>So far, the uncommon association of SCLE and myositis has been described only in isolated case reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203312474703">8</xref></sup> and never (to the best of our knowledge) in a patient previously classified as <italic>p</italic>SS. This unusual clinical triad of ADs presented highlights the challenging issue of characterization within current SS classification criteria and other alternative <italic>p</italic>SS classifications suggested in literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203312474703">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312474703">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>PM is considered a clinical subtype of myositis and is currently accepted as a relatively rare complication of <italic>p</italic>SS found in 1.8% to 14% of SS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203312474703">4</xref></sup> Aoki et al. describe PM as being the most frequent subtype (5.6%) of myositis (Jo1 negative) in a group of Japanese primary SS patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312474703">9</xref></sup> with chronic-progressive relatively severe favourable course, unremarkable laboratory data and good response to oral steroid (4–40 mg/day). These findings have been recently confirmed as well-established in a case of myositis SSA and SSB+, presented as <italic>p</italic>SS complication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203312474703">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>These cases taken together seemed to further support our findings, despite that the dysphagia and the additional immunosuppressive therapy needed in our case could be indicative of the rare association of more severe PM and SS as separate SADs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312474703">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203312474703">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, SCLE lesions were more difficult to interpret in the context of this case. Although the association of SCLE and SS has previously been documented,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312474703">11</xref></sup> there are no reports from large SCLE cohorts about the prevalence of SS. Patients with SCLE show a higher prevalence of xerophthalmia compared with patients with discoid LE,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312474703">12</xref></sup> and the well-known laboratory features shared by SCLE and SS (HLA haplotype A1-B8-DR3 (Caucasian SS), SSA/SSB auto-ab, positivity RF 30%) must be noted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203312474703">11</xref></sup> In consideration of these overlapping features and our observations, we were able to exclude the main open issue of associated-overlapping ‘<italic>primary</italic>’ SS with SCLE, as well as SCLE being a separate SAD, since American Rheumatism Association (ARA) criteria for SLE were not fulfilled.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312474703">2</xref></sup> Ramos-Casals suggested the interpretation of Ro-SSA annular polycyclic SCLE not fulfilling SLE criteria in SS white patients as likely related to Ro-SSA auto-ab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312474703">2</xref></sup> Therefore, in our SS case annular non-polycyclic SCLE lesions should be interpreted both as <italic>p</italic>SS manifestation likely related to SSA and SSB auto-ab or classified as a separate AD. Moreover, we detected in a <italic>p</italic>SS patient annular non-polycyclic lesions of SCLE with non-subacute course atypically resembling AESS, which is a skin manifestation almost exclusively of Japanese SS patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312474703">5</xref></sup> and very rare in Caucasian SS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203312474703">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203312474703">14</xref></sup> Annular-polycyclic SCLE and AESS are autoimmune annular non-scarring lesions, which various authors suggest considering as a disease spectrum related to common aetiopathogenic factors, mainly the presence of SSA (without Ro-SSA specificity) and/or SSB auto-ab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0961203312474703">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312474703">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312474703">6</xref></sup> Typically, AESS lesions are separate without confluent polycyclic configuration, showing more elevated and non-scaling borders in respect to SCLE. Regarding sun exposure, AESS is independently chronic-persistent, while SCLE presents a dependant subacute course throughout spring and summer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312474703">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203312474703">13</xref></sup> As to diagnosis, in AESS the lymphocytic dermal infiltration, which is deeper and admixed (<italic>plasma cells</italic>, <italic>neutrophils</italic>), is non-specific, because of the lack of vacuolar degeneration of the basal keratinocyte layer that (even if focal) is consistent with cutaneous LE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312474703">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312474703">6</xref></sup> Such clinical–histological differences are probably HLA related, the DR3 haplotype being absent in the Japanese population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312474703">6</xref></sup> Therefore, we classified the lesions as annular SCLE mainly because of the suggestive histologic findings (and HLA-DR3 haplotype).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312474703">5</xref></sup> ‘Transitional’ (resembling AESS) SCLE cases and, intriguingly, AESS-like SCLE lesions are described in Oriental populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203312474703">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203312474703">6</xref></sup> This, in addition to our case, seems to suggest annular polycyclic SCLE and AESS as a spectrum of disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203312474703" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, our unusual case underlines the broad clinical presentation of SS with other ADs and SADs.</p>
<p>Classification of our case represented a challenge, mainly because of the skin manifestations, and it leaves an open debate as to whether to consider the triad of ADs as several separate diseases or as a single <italic>p</italic>SS model.</p>
<p>A chronic progressive mild–severe but favourable in the long-term PM may be generally accepted as a relatively rare myositis complicating <italic>p</italic>SS. We believe that the suggested interpretation for annular lesions of non-systemic SCLE in SS patients as <italic>p</italic>SS skin manifestations related to SSA/SSB auto-ab might actually be an erroneous underestimation – especially when atypical or persistent lesions are present – perhaps confirming a common spectrum with AESS.</p>
<p>Hence, it is hoped that our case will serve as further stimulus to improve existing SS classifications, particularly those of autoimmune skin manifestations.</p>
