<p>The women of Tlaucingo, a small community in the Mexican state of Puebla, have organized to pursue food security in response to the proletarianization produced by neoliberalism. Interviews with women members of the organization reveal that their participation has brought them not only better diets, health, education, and housing but also benefits in terms of women’s rights.</p>

<p>The implementation of neoliberal agricultural policies in Tlaucingo, a small community in the municipality of Teotlalco in the state of Puebla, Mexico, has brought new precariousness to life and work, producing a profound proletarianization that affects households’ food security. In response, the women of the community have developed various strategies of resistance. These strategies, although they are not articulated organically or expressed as a social movement, can be linked to discourses concerned with the breakdown of the hegemonic neoliberal agricultural model.</p>
<p>Neoliberal capitalism in Tlaucingo excludes campesinos unless investing in them is profitable, either treating them as cheap labor or forcing them to move into the labor markets of California, New York, and Chicago, mainly as cleaners and construction, factory, and landscaping workers. In the course of this proletarianization, the women who remain in town have increasingly been incorporated into regional agricultural production. In response to their situation, they have organized to develop collective strategies for survival and political and educational action. Their work has gone beyond the practical requirements for survival to serve what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094582X13496387">Maxine Molyneux (1985)</xref> identifies as strategic gender interests, nourishing new identities and expanding women’s participation in community decision making.</p>
<sec id="section1-0094582X13496387">
<title>The Community</title>
<p>Tlaucingo is located in southwestern Puebla, near the borders of Morelos and Guerrero, in what is known as the Mixteca Baja Poblana. It has an arid landscape and traditional crops: corn, squash, chiles, peanuts, and seasonal fruits such as plums and mangoes. Production is mostly family-based and for self-consumption (manual labor may be hired for these activities).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094582X13496387">1</xref></sup> Some people complement this with the breeding of cattle, swine, poultry, goats, and sheep. Irrigation is only temporary, and erosion is widespread. The community has a long history of migration, dating back to the inception of the 1942–1964 Bracero Program (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X13496387">Durand, 2007</xref>), and migration increased in the 1970s and 1980s in pursuit of the food security and well-being of domestic groups.</p>
<p>My study in Tlaucingo focused on the everyday life of five domestic groups<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0094582X13496387">2</xref></sup> selected arbitrarily, four of them farming collectively owned land and one property-owning (a category that represents 20 percent of the population).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0094582X13496387">3</xref></sup> Of the four communal groups, two had members in the United States at the time and another contained recently returned migrants. Although most of the community’s domestic groups are headed by women, only one of the five study groups fell into this category. However, in all of the communal groups the decisions were made mainly by women. In contrast, in the property-owning group the man conventionally made decisions unilaterally. The women of all of the communal groups belonged to the women’s organization; those of the property-owning group, like others in this category, did not. Data collection involved numerous visits to the community between October 2009 and August 2010 to conduct in-depth interviews with the women of these groups.</p>

<sec id="section2-0094582X13496387">
<title>The Right to Eat</title>
<p>Food security—the right to eat—is the central axis of the collective action of Tlaucingo women in a context of capitalist impoverishment and transnational proletarianization and the international framework of human rights. Jean Ziegler, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X13496387">IIDH, 2008</xref>: 190), says that this right</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>is exercised when every man, woman, and child . . . has physical and economic access at all times to adequate food or means for its procurement. . . . [It is] the right to have regular, permanent and unrestricted access . . . to quantitatively and qualitatively adequate and sufficient food . . . which ensures a physical and mental, individual and collective, fulfilling and dignified life free from fear.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Because neoliberalism interferes with the meeting of people’s most basic needs, the ways in which people articulate their relationship to the state in the daily act of survival contribute to resistance and social mobilization that transcend the local and are linked to broader popular processes. Women’s organizing in Tlaucingo is not just a strategy for obtaining food; it has become a popular social and political movement, enabling the reorientation of social processes, relationships with the state and with other communities, and other types of social expression in the direction of collective resistance.</p>
<p>The concept of “food sovereignty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X13496387">Foro Mundial por la Soberanía Alimentaria, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X13496387">Rosset, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X13496387">Via Campesina, 2004</xref>) implies the participation of the state, through its agricultural policy, in creating a system of equitable exchange that does not favor the market. Food sovereignty as so defined is at risk under what David Harvey has called the accumulation-by-dispossession model and in the context of struggle between citizens and government that is reshaping the local political scene. Tlaucingo, for example, is dependent on several state or federal government programs. Among them are a health clinic, which is not just a medical service but a conveyor of government policies such as fertility and sexuality programs; a program that assists farmers in the purchase of seeds and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X13496387">Pérez, 2007</xref>); and a program that provides support to mothers of children enrolled in elementary school (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oportunidades.gob.mx/Portal/">http://www.oportunidades.gob.mx/Portal/</ext-link>). However, when these programs are creatively resignified by the community in terms of its own needs and collective interests, resistance to government control may eventually emerge. Whereas the idea of food sovereignty asserts people’s right to make decisions about their own food production and to produce nutritious and culturally appropriate foods in a sustainable fashion, the possibility of doing so is dependent on state intervention because it is the state that is currently responsible for distributing the seed (mostly genetically modified) and managing agricultural production. Consequently, I focus here on food security rather than sovereignty and examine the efforts of Tlaucingo women to achieve it.</p>

<title>The Struggle for Food Security</title>
<p>The people of Tlaucingo pursue food security by the production of staple crops, animal husbandry, poaching, fishing, harvesting the products of the nearby hills, and fish farming. However, the economic crisis has made wage work precarious. When the owner of a quarry can decide to reduce the work week from five to three days or, alternatively, require a work day of 8–12 hours in times of high demand, people who seek employment there must forgo working the land. This makes individually performed activities insufficient to guarantee enough food to eat and forces people to depend on familial networks in the community or in nearby ones. The existence of these networks allows for the sharing of certain types of harvested crops and for joint food preparation. At the same time, the women of Tlaucingo have organized to face the challenges of achieving food security. Their organization provides mutual support and calls for responsibility, participation, and decision making in various community projects. This collective activity is small-scale, but it is important as a counter to the neoliberal model. Another world is indeed possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0094582X13496387">Figures 1</xref>

<p>Inocente, a 52-year-old woman who has worked all her life, described the beginnings of the Tlaucingo women’s organization (in 1985) as follows (interview, November 2009):<disp-quote>
<p>The men had some projects that they could not accomplish, so we women realized that if we got organized we could do the things our husbands had failed to do. We decided to come together because we saw that we Tlaucingo women had many problems; our men went north, and some sent us money, but it was not enough. I used the money my husband sent for my son Guillermo, who got very ill when he was 10. What he sent was not enough to buy food, just to cover medicines and doctors. . . . So we women saw we had the same problems—poverty and hopelessness—until we decided to change our situation. We started with a small corn mill and then decided to revive the fish farming project that our husbands had left undone. We realized that we were able to do things right. We at least had something to eat. Then we started producing more and more fish, we learned to be better fish breeders. We can feed our families but also those of other women who are poor like us.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Inocente reported that participating in the organization had allowed her to explore her capabilities as a woman, an organizer, and a decision maker. She was not merely concerned with the productive and economic aspects of this; what interested her most was recognizing her potential for transforming her reality and that of other women:<disp-quote>
<p>We have productive projects that allow us to live a little better—for example, making traditional medicines allows us to use the wisdom of our ancestors to take care of our health, because we don’t have health services. But the most important thing about our organization is that we women have learned about our rights. Before, our husbands scolded us for participating in the organization, as if we were just gossipy biddies. Mine said that people would talk; he said that they would say that he didn’t provide for me. So our first fight was with our men, to show them that our participation was worthwhile, that we had the right to do things for our benefit. And, of course, our family also benefits. Little by little the men saw that our meetings were profitable. . . . Another problem was the government; when you don’t vote for them it’s always a problem. The politicians come and promise to support us, but just because they want our votes. They have come to us as an organization; they know that we have people who support us and ask us to introduce them to other communities—but we do not sell our dignity. We already know that politicians are all the same; they make promises in their campaigns and then forget about the campesinos. We women don’t buy their promises. It is better for us to stick together and solve our problems. . . . I always invite other women. I say, “It’s worth organizing. We can’t expect the government to solve anything because [the politicians] are only interested in our votes. After that they don’t care if we die of hunger, so we are the ones who must come up with our own solutions.” . . . Once we decided to vote for someone as an organization, but it was to remove the PRI [Partido Revolucionario Institucional], so we voted for the PRD [Partido de la Revolución Democrática]. It turned out that the winner had always been part of the PRI, so he did not make any changes. So now we say that people united pull ahead without a party.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>María, a 50-year-old woman, also spoke of the benefits of participation in the Tlaucingo women’s organization (interview, November 2009):<disp-quote>
<p>Since we women organized, we have stopped the beatings our spouses wanted to give us. Well, my husband has never hit me, but I have friends who were beaten. Now we don’t let this happen. We know that we have rights, that we want to live better, and living better is not about getting sent some dollars—we want respect. From the authorities, too. I have four children, three of them boys, and I tell them that, as men, they have to support women. Only two are married, and I see that this does make a difference in their marriages; their families live with more respect. . . . We women have seen that if we can change our families, we can also change the village and the government, which is always disrespectful. The government thinks that we campesinos are fools. It makes promises and doesn’t fulfill them. We in our organization analyze reality; we learned this from advisers from the Christian base communities. It’s about reflecting how things are, how politics are going, how the nation’s economy is doing, and how this affects us at home. Whenever we see on the news that prices are not meant to go up we prepare well, because this is a sign that everything will go up in price. As organized women we solve our common problems. Before, they led us on with speeches, but now we don’t buy them so easily. On the contrary, now we demand that our rights be respected. And we are still living in poverty! Just imagine if we had not set up our organization! They’d have us eating out of their hands. But now we know we have rights, and so do our sons and daughters, our families. The people are the ones who should organize to change the bad plans the government has prepared, because the government just wants to sell us to the gringos. Now we don’t we die of hunger, and we have learned to live better as a community.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some of the material results of women’s organizing in Tlaucingo are apparent in the experiences reported by members of the five study groups. While they still depend heavily on remittances, the women who were members of the organization all reported improvements in their material conditions—better food and health, more education for their children, greater ability to contribute to patron saint celebrations, and better housing. Housing improvements included the construction of tanks for water storage and the acquisition of stoves that reduce wood use and produce less smoke. It was food, however, that had driven the women to participate in the organization, with its communal food supply programs. Tlaucingo residents have to travel to Axochiapan, Morelos (the closest city to the village), to stock up on food supplies. The trip takes at least 45 minutes each way and costs 32 pesos on public transit or as much as 100 pesos by cab. The women still visit Axochiapan, but now it is partly to sell their surplus fish. They have also managed to establish a community space in which to buy and sell basic products cheaper than in Axochiapan stores. The production of fish, poultry, and dairy products has contributed to an improvement in the whole community’s diet, benefiting nonmember domestic groups by making these products available at prices lower than those elsewhere in the region.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of equality in the performance of domestic tasks, many organized women reported that, while participation doubled or tripled their workloads, they received new support from their partners or other members of the domestic group (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X13496387">Motta, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X13496387">Olivera, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X13496387">González de la Rocha, 2001</xref>). Of this benefit Inocente said (interview, March 2010),<disp-quote>
<p>Before, it was difficult for a man to warm up his tortillas or cook for himself. Now the husbands know that we sometimes have other commitments involving the organization, so they warm their own tortillas if they’re hungry. Sometimes Tomás even fed everyone; he was the one who warmed up the tortillas and served them. He went from beating me up for not having the food ready to helping in the kitchen, doing the dishes, and even sweeping when I had to leave because of organization activities. He knew that it was for the benefit of the family, so he understood that he had to help me. This is the case of many of the husbands of the women in the organization. But I see that other families are still having problems. They do not recognize the women, do not let them participate, and still feel that their hands will drop off if they take a tortilla and place it on the stove.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This testimony shows that in addition to the material conditions of domestic groups the women’s organization impacted gender interests.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094582X13496387">Molyneux (1985)</xref> distinguishes practical and strategic gender needs, the former having to do with the basic requirements for survival and the latter with the transformation of the unequal relations between women and men. Meeting only women’s practical needs would simply reproduce the traditional roles of women as caregivers, cooks, and housewives. Pursuing their strategic needs empowers them in other areas of social and political participation, collective and personal decision making, and the free and consensual exercise of their sexuality and biological reproduction. Some of the strategic benefits of participation in the women’s organization reported include landholding, serving on community committees, participating in assemblies of communal property holders, performing jobs formerly restricted to men such as bus driving, mining, and factory work, making independent decisions about their incomes, modifying personal conditions of domestic violence, and exercising a number of the rights included in Article 14 of the UN Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0094582X13496387">4</xref></sup> Being part of the organization helped create networks of support and solidarity among women, and their work not only improved their families’ economies but brought them recognition of their skills in decision making both at home and in the community. In contrast, nonmember women reproduced more conservative gender schemes; they were exclusively responsible for domestic activities, education, and child care and the care of elders. Their daily activities reproduced women’s subordinate condition in the domestic arena and their diminished or nonexistent participation in community decision making.</p>
<p>Participation in the organization also provided women with an opportunity for ongoing training, support, and solidarity and the discussion of common problems such as poverty, domestic violence, unemployment, and emigration. The organization’s links with other groups in the region permitted coordination of strategies and planning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X13496387">Scott (1976</xref>: 5) has pointed to the historical importance of the moral economy, which “acts as a traditional security network that guarantees minimal well-being to the most vulnerable sectors, while facilitating the implementation of strategies for coping with crises and disasters, and contributes to relieve and even occasionally avoid their impact.”</p>
<p>The reports of the women interviewed make it clear that the household and community-based strategies developed foster self-esteem and acknowledgment of the capacity to transform relations across life areas, domestic groups, and communities. The global economic crisis has subordinated poor women, making them dependent on remittances and government funding. Women’s organizations not only help them to develop strategies for survival but allow them to begin to articulate social, cultural, economic, and political proposals for greater gender equality at home and in the larger social environment.</p>

<sec id="section4-0094582X13496387">
<title>Testimonies of the Struggle</title>
<p>The experiences of the women of four of my study groups—Inocente, Getulia, María, and Emelia—illustrate what participation in the women’s organization has done.</p>
<p>Inocente has six sons and a daughter. Four of her children are in the United States (only one of them legally), and two others have recently returned. (One of the latter has been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver.) The youngest son has never left the village and says that he is not interested in emigrating. Community tradition expects the youngest son or daughter to take care of the mother, and therefore he and his wife and daughters live in his mother’s house. She has put up a wall to create some privacy, but their everyday lives are lived together. The household’s economy is relatively stable because of the remittances it receives and the participation of the women (Inocente and her granddaughter and daughters-in-law) in the women’s organization.</p>
<p>As we have seen, Inocente has managed to earn acknowledgment as a decision maker. She described the change as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>Before, the women stayed in the house all the time, caring for the children, cooking, and cleaning; now we produce, we earn our money, and we decide what to spend it on. Now we have enough to buy our stuff, and it’s not that we spend it all on ourselves; we always think about the family. Men don’t. They may go and get drunk before thinking of whether their children have food. Now men have had to learn to respect us. They no longer call us gossips for participating in the organization. My children, although they send me money, tell me, “Mom, you decide what to spend it on, decide what is needed.” Only when they want something for themselves or the land they have here they tell me what to spend it on, but they have learned to respect me a lot—not only as their mother but as a woman, and I see they also do that with their wives. They [the sons] know that a woman has dreams and needs she might want to address—not just having and taking care of children.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Getulia and two of her daughters-in-law gather in an outdoor kitchen to cook for everyone; sometimes they all eat together and sometimes each one takes the food home. The daughters-in-law, Azucena and Elena, give her a weekly amount of money so that she can buy the food that is needed. A third daughter-in-law, Inarme, purchases her food separately but also occasionally participates in the collective cooking:<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t give my mother-in-law money to go shopping on Sunday. I also go to the Axochiapan market, and during the week I sometimes cook something at home and bring it for everyone here—or, when they cook, they call me so that I don’t cook. We support each other this way. Sometimes I put in something, sometimes they put in something. At other times I cook at home just for my husband and daughter. Teacher Concha (the wife of Getulia’s eldest son) never eats with us. She always cooks at home for her and her family—who knows why? She says that she doesn’t have time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>María and her husband, Gabriel (who is president of the ejido and a municipal official), have four children, and three of them, along with Gabriel’s mother and a daughter-in-law, share the house. Their son Javier has recently brought his girlfriend to live with them, and they are choosing a date for the wedding. Their eldest son has been in California for the past eight years. Their house is one of the few in the village that has a bathroom with running water. However, since the village does not have sewerage, the drain goes directly into the latrine and the bathroom works in the same way as in other houses with latrines.</p>
<p>Gabriel told me that he owed everything he had to María:<disp-quote>
<p>If she hadn’t been so organized and demanding, maybe when I was a migrant I would have let myself be carried away by alcohol. She was the one who always reminded me that I was there for our children. She has always been the one who guides me on what we must do together at home, with the children and with the money we have. She administers it very well. I think that other women can’t make decisions. I always thank María, who always helps me see clearly what we have to do to live better.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Few campesinos will publicly recognize their collaborative relationships with their partners. Gabriel’s acknowledgment has allowed this couple to work together to improve the family’s material conditions and, in the long term, their political and social ones. María is secretary of the women’s organization. She has also been its treasurer, and colleagues express their trust in her. She is recognized for her contributions to the economy, community engagement, participation in assemblies, and other social and political activities.</p>
<p>Emelia is a 62-year-old survivor of uterine cancer, a person of strong moral fiber and the main financial support for her family. Her husband, Ricardo, occasionally works as a laborer but is primarily devoted to the care of their home. In addition to generating strategies for survival, Emelia cooks and takes care of the grandchildren who live with her. She has 10 children, and most of them are in California. However, the precariousness of her domestic group ranks it as the poorest in the village. When her house was consumed by fire, she was able to rebuild it with the support of the women’s organization. On Saturday evenings, Emelia, with Ricardo’s help, sells food prepared in a stall in the village square that is lent to her by the women’s organization.</p>
<p>In these domestic groups it is the women who generate the income that helps ensure social reproduction. As Getulia explained (interview, November 2, 2009),<disp-quote>
<p>Before, we women depended on our husbands’ letting us do things—participate, speak our minds. There are still some who are annoyed that we participate in town assemblies. They say that we can listen but not speak. But our group of women has made them respect us more and more and also listen to our opinion at meetings. Sometimes it is our vote that decides the final arrangements. It’s the older men who don’t want to recognize our participation, but the younger ones are respecting us more and more. We speak for ourselves and for our children, because husbands don’t always know what the household problems are.</p>

<title>Final Thoughts</title>
<p>Participation in the Tlaucingo women’s organization has produced significant changes in women’s material and symbolic conditions; they have been empowered to fight for a dignified life and know whether they are succeeding. The women’s organization has allowed its members to view themselves as capable, skilled, knowledgeable makers of their own history with the ability to change relations of domination into more equitable ones. The resolution of practical needs has led them to recognize and fight for strategic ones. Their daily personal and collective struggle has produced proposals for social transformation and resistance against predatory neoliberal practices. Organized Tlaucingo women have established creative ways of relating to the rest of the community, opening up significant prospects for a free, just, dignified, and happy society.</p>
