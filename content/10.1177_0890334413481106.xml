<title>Background:</title>
<p>The beneficial effects of breastfeeding for mothers and babies are well recognized. When maternal breast milk is not available in sufficient quantity, donor breast milk is recommended as an alternate source of nutrition, particularly in preterm and other high-risk infants.

<sec id="section3-0890334413481106">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>In-depth semistructured interviews were conducted with 12 mothers who were breastfeeding and/or had preterm or sick babies.

<title>Results:</title>
<p>Breastfeeding mothers, as potential donors, unanimously supported donating their breast milk to a human milk bank, provided it would be easy (especially if required to drop off milk) and not overly time consuming.

<title>Background</title>
<p>The beneficial effects of breastfeeding for mothers and babies are well recognized. When maternal breast milk is not available in sufficient quantity, donor breast milk is recommended as an alternate source of nutrition. In preterm and other high-risk infants in particular, feeding with donor milk is an effective strategy for the prevention of infectious diseases, enhanced feeding tolerance, improved neurocognitive function, and other long-term health benefits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0890334413481106">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0890334413481106"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334413481106"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0890334413481106"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0890334413481106">5</xref></sup> Research suggests that using donor milk is cost-effective, with considerable cost savings to individuals, families, and health systems by reducing the number of necrotizing enterocolitis cases, late onset sepsis, food intolerance in infants, and length of hospital stay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0890334413481106">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0890334413481106">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0890334413481106"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0890334413481106">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In many countries, donor milk banking has been incorporated into child health policy and regulation and is protected, promoted, and supported as an extension of national breastfeeding policies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334413481106">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334413481106"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334413481106"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334413481106">12</xref></sup> Associations of nonprofit milk banks are now established in the Americas, Europe, and many other countries worldwide. Currently, there are 13 established and 2 developing human milk banks in North America providing human donor milk to high-risk babies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334413481106">13</xref></sup> In Europe, there are now 186 active and 13 planned milk banks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0890334413481106">14</xref></sup> Brazil is an international leader with 212 human milk banks and 113 collection centers distributed throughout the country in 2012.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0890334413481106">15</xref></sup> Expressing excess breast milk for use in the hospital was a common practice in Australia in the 1940s and postwar period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0890334413481106">16</xref></sup> Extensive marketing of baby formula from the mid-1960s, the emergence of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and concerns about transmission of the HIV virus through breast milk, along with the lack of political commitment and national policies on breastfeeding promotion, led to a decline in sharing breast milk in Australia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334413481106">17</xref></sup> Australia now lags behind the rest of the developed world with regard to establishing and promoting human milk banks, with only 4 established milk banks in 4 state capital cities providing donated milk to high-risk infants living in those states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334413481106">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite growing evidence on the benefits of donor milk for child health and nutrition, international studies and limited Australian evidence suggest a number of barriers to the establishment of human milk banks, including the costs and logistics of establishment and operation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0890334413481106">17</xref></sup> mothers’ concerns about the safety of donor milk,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334413481106">19</xref></sup> the lack of support from neonatologists and pediatricians,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334413481106">20</xref></sup> and certain cultural and religious beliefs and practices, for instance, milk kinship that occurs after milk donation; Islamic law prohibits marriage between the donor’s offspring and the recipient of donor milk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0890334413481106">21</xref></sup> The establishment of a human milk bank in a hospital setting also requires commitment and support from staff and families.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0890334413481106">22</xref></sup> The majority of studies focus on the technical aspects of milk bank processing and experts’ perspectives,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334413481106">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334413481106">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0890334413481106">18</xref></sup> with only a few investigating factors affecting mothers’ decisions to donate breast milk or to use donor milk for their babies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0890334413481106">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0890334413481106">24</xref></sup> Understanding this perspective is particularly important within Australia’s multicultural context in order to overcome barriers, to increase supply of and demand for donor milk, and to move toward better practice in milk banking in Australia.</p>
<p>This article presents the findings of a study that investigated the knowledge and attitudes of mothers from both supply and demand sides about human milk banking and factors that facilitate or constrain successful implementation, maintenance, and expansion of human milk banks in Australia. The findings can help inform the development of human milk banking policies and guidelines that address Australian mothers’ concerns, thereby increasing the acceptability and utility of human milk banks and their related health, financial, and social benefits.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section10-0890334413481106">
<title>Sampling</title>
<p>We used in-depth interviews to explore mothers’ perceptions of donating to or using donor milk from a human milk bank. We included 2 groups: (a) mothers breastfeeding at the time of data collection (potential donors of breast milk) and (b) mothers of preterm or sick babies who, for any reason, have not breastfed (potential recipients of donated milk). As there are no human milk banks in South Australia, we expected that none of the participants would have experience of using a milk bank but that they may wish to explore whether they would use one, should one be established in this state.</p>
<p>We recruited mothers through contacts in the Australian Breastfeeding Association–South Australian/Northern Territory Branch (SANT ABA), the Preterm Infants Parents’ Association (PIPA), and Miracle Babies Foundation. We e-mailed study information to these organizations, including an invitation to mothers who wanted more information or wished to participate to contact the researchers by either telephone or e-mail. The SANT ABA Branch e-mailed their South Australian volunteer counselors, community educators, and trainees, asking that they forward study information to group members. The Preterm Infants Parents’ Association posted the study information on their Facebook site. The Miracle Babies contact e-mailed the study information to regular participants in a neonatal intensive care unit mothers’ group. Snowballing also led to recruitment of mothers using a Facebook milk-sharing site, Human Milk for Human Babies (HM4HB). The HM4HB Facebook site administrator contacted the research team to advise that one member had posted the study information on their site and to seek further study information. All mothers who participated in the study contacted the research team to volunteer to participate in either an interview or a focus group.</p>
<p>To facilitate participation, we offered one-to-one interviews either face-to-face or by telephone. The first author conducted all individual interviews, which ranged from 45 minutes to 2 hours, with most being about 1 hour.</p>
<p>We achieved data saturation with regard to knowledge of and attitudes toward milk banking of potential donors and recipients after interviewing 12 mothers, as no new themes emerged relating to the research questions. We had achieved interviews with women from the broadest available range of demographic backgrounds among the women who responded as per our selection criteria.</p>
<p>Following up questions raised during interviews, 2 focus groups were conducted with 9 more mothers (who had not participated in an individual interview) from each of the 2 groups described above. One focus group comprised 5 breastfeeding mothers and the other consisted of 4 mothers of preterm or sick babies. The first and second authors facilitated both focus groups, which lasted 1.5 hours, with an additional half hour of introductions.</p>
<p>Data collection occurred between November 2011 and May 2012. We provided Aus$30.00 gift vouchers to thank all participants and contribute to costs of child care and travel.</p>
<p>We designed semistructured interview and focus group guides so that questions were open-ended and conversational to capture the complexity of participants’ experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0890334413481106">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0890334413481106">26</xref></sup> The guides elicited mothers’ accounts of their infant-feeding experience and their perceptions of donating or using donated breast milk, including approaches to promotion and practicalities that would influence the use of a human milk bank. The focus groups included additional questions designed to explore in more depth the themes that emerged from interviews, for example, women’s views about appropriate timing for promoting human milk banks to mothers and their perceptions of how health professionals could support human milk banking. Data were recorded and transcribed in full. To maintain confidentiality, interview quotations are noted with pseudonyms, coded as breastfeeding (BF), premature/sick (PS), informal breast milk donor (D), and/or informal breast milk recipient (R), where this was the case. Focus group quotations are noted as codes (breastfeeding focus group, BFFG; and preterm/sick infant focus group, PSFG).</p>

<sec id="section11-0890334413481106">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>We analyzed our data using framework analysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0890334413481106">27</xref></sup> comprising 5 overlapping and iterative stages: familiarization, identifying a thematic framework, indexing, charting, and mapping and interpretation. All 3 of the research team members read all of the transcripts to achieve familiarization and double-coded 4 transcripts to enhance rigor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0890334413481106">28</xref></sup> Inconsistencies were addressed by discussing differences in coding during research meetings and amending coding practice until coding was consistent. We applied specific techniques for qualitative research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0890334413481106">28</xref></sup> to ensure rigor, including theoretical rigor, methodological rigor, interpretive rigor, and triangulation. To achieve theoretical rigor, we ensured that the study methods were integrated with the research goals. Although this study was exploratory and descriptive, theoretical rigor also relates to the ways in which analysis is supported by evidence from this study and the literature.</p>
<p>We addressed interpretive rigor by explaining clearly how we analyzed the interviews and by including direct quotes from the broadest range of interviews possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0890334413481106">28</xref></sup> Second, we applied interpretive rigor as part of the research process, by checking interpretation at regular research team meetings throughout the data collection and analysis, which also ensured triangulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0890334413481106">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>We developed a thematic framework, informed by the interview transcripts and by the project’s a priori aims and focus. We used NVivo software for analysis and coded transcripts according to our thematic framework.</p>
<p>We obtained Flinders University Social and Behavioural Ethics Committee approval and gained written consent from participants at the time of the interview or focus group.</p>

<title>Sample Description</title>
<p>For this small pilot study, we aimed to collect qualitative data on mothers’ perceptions of milk banking, in a state where there is no human milk bank. We conducted 12 in-depth interviews (5 face-to-face and 7 by telephone), 1 focus group with 5 breastfeeding mothers, and 1 focus group comprising 4 mothers of preterm/sick babies. Twenty mothers lived in South Australia and 1 in Northern Territory when their babies were born. Mothers were ages 26 to 39 and had 1 to 3 children. Twelve mothers reported that they had exclusively breastfed their babies, including 3 of the 10 mothers of preterm/sick babies. Nine mothers struggled to produce sufficient breast milk and so fed their babies formula after breast milk feeds. Of these 9 women, in the absence of a human milk bank in South Australia, 4 also fed their babies informally donated breast milk, 2 of whom were mothers of preterm/sick babies. Three mothers had informally donated expressed breast milk; 2 of these had also been recipients of informally donated milk (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0890334413481106">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Knowledge of Human Milk Banking</title>
<p>Some participants had never heard of human milk banking or knew only that banks exist and that there are none in South Australia. Participants were unclear of the practicalities of milk bank management, for example, transporting milk to milk banks and to recipients. Those with some knowledge believed that screening processes were similar to blood donation and treatment processes were similar to cow’s milk: “It gets rid of all the nasties out of it . . . so they don’t have to give premmie babies or sick babies in hospital formula if the mum can’t breastfeed or have enough milk” (Bernadette BF). Mothers reported several sources of information including social and family networks, the ABA, social media, and midwives. Typically, they sought information because they had excess milk and had explored potential donation: “I just asked them at the hospital while she was in the neonatal unit because I had so much milk and I thought if someone didn’t have milk. . . . They said not here, in Melbourne and Perth” (BFFG).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0890334413481106">
<title>Mothers’ Perceptions of Human Milk Banking</title>
<p>Study participants unanimously supported establishing a human milk bank because they perceived breast milk to be the best nutrition for babies: “I think because it contains so many essential nutrients and antibodies” (Abby BF). Their view was in the context of mothers being unable to breastfeed using donated milk as a preferable alternative to formula. A few mothers pointed out, however, that mothers produce differential qualities of milk as babies develop and therefore wondered whether milk banks provide age-appropriate milk.</p>
<p>There were some differences between mothers’ perceptions of being potential donors or recipients. All breastfeeding mothers supported donating breast milk to help other mothers and babies, with their only concerns being about practicalities. Mothers of sick or preterm babies reported requiring reassurance that the benefits of banked milk would outweigh potential risks (eg, contamination) when compared with formula: “That is the only thing—I’d have to feel comfortable that it was screened and [my son] wouldn’t be exposed to any illness” (Cecelia PS).</p>
<p>Mothers who had stored excess expressed milk that they could not keep described feeling deep regret at throwing out their milk because they felt it was a terrible waste. Of these, some reported seeking information from health professionals and other mothers about whether they could donate their milk somehow. Those who did not find avenues to donate articulated disappointment that there were no such local facilities: “There were women there who were struggling so much with a lack of milk and I was in the next room pouring it down the sink and to me that’s just so not right” (BFFG).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0890334413481106">
<title>Informal Sharing</title>
<p>In the absence of formal banks, some mothers reported participating in informal milk sharing with family or friends or via the Internet. They described markedly mixed responses from friends, family, and health professionals about donating and receiving milk. Mostly, these mothers would have preferred to use a milk bank:<disp-quote>
<p>Even though I gave my child milk from other women, I’ve taken their word for the fact that they said that there was nothing wrong with them, but with a milk bank you don’t take their word for it, you 100 percent know that that milk is clean and good for your baby. (Isabelle PSRD)</p>

<title>Factors Influencing Mothers’ Decisions to Donate or Use Human Milk Banks</title>
<sec id="section18-0890334413481106">
<title>Families and friends</title>
<p>Almost all mothers indicated that support from their partner (all were partnered) was crucial to donating to or receiving milk from a human milk bank. Their wider family and friends were less of a constraint, because they felt they need not tell anyone who they thought might be unsupportive. In general, they perceived that family and friends’ support of breastfeeding would extend to supporting using human milk banks as a preferable alternative to formula: “A lot of the people I talk to about breastfeeding . . . seem to have a very positive view. Either way, if I was a donor or a recipient I think that people would be positive” (Abby BF).</p>
<p>Mothers in the preterm/sick focus group felt that partners especially would need to be educated with regard to screening processes and milk safety, with the emphasis that it was not wet-nursing: “If I was to explain to my husband what an actual milk bank is . . . that it is screened and all those sorts of things, I think he’d feel more comfortable about it” (PSFG).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0890334413481106">
<title>Health professionals</title>
<p>Some mothers reported having experienced health professionals who were unsupportive of breastfeeding or who had suggested formula too readily. By extension, they felt that such professionals could be unlikely to promote a human milk bank and therefore may create barriers to donation or receipt.</p>
<p>Mothers involved in informal milk sharing reported receiving negative responses from health professionals because of concerns about milk safety. They tended not to talk to health professionals about informal milk sharing because they expected negative responses. Nevertheless, 2 reported being told about milk sharing by a midwife, and 1 reported a midwife being unofficially supportive: “One of the midwives said, ‘Look, if the milk is in the fridge and it’s got your baby’s name on it then that’s the milk that we use’” (Imogen BFPSR). Mothers felt that a milk bank may be more acceptable to health professionals because it would be seen as less prone to contamination than informal sharing.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section20-0890334413481106">
<title>Practicalities</title>
<p>Mothers reported that a number of practical issues would affect donation to or accessing milk from milk banks, including transport, drop-off/pick-up locations, equipment, bureaucratic processes, and the expected commitment to donating.</p>
<sec id="section21-0890334413481106">
<title>Transport</title>
<p>Mothers reported that for ease of access a courier service would be the ideal way to transport expressed milk from donors and to deliver to recipients at home.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Like for me it would have needed to have been somewhere really close by or someone just came and grabbed it off you. . . . It needs to be so, so easy so you can just go “here.” Otherwise that would be a barrier to donating. (BFFG)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mothers talked about transporting milk being similar to transporting blood, with trained professionals being preferable couriers to maintain the milk at the correct temperature because “with their refrigeration you’d know that they’d be spot on” (PSFG).</p>
<p>Having locations already set up for expressing milk, for example, hospitals, was another feasible option: “a bit like a little blood donor centre” (BFFG). Mothers of preterm/sick babies reported that accessing milk in the hospital would also be practical: “She was in hospital for so long, if it was already there at the hospital . . . even when she was out of hospital I still spent so much time going to and from there” (Janice PS).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0890334413481106">
<title>Equipment</title>
<p>Simplicity and expediency were the most important elements with regard to equipment. Most mothers felt that donors should have equipment supplied, or rented with reimbursement. A few potential donors reported that they would “rather use my own breast pump because that’s obviously one that would suit me” (BFFG).</p>
<p>Mothers who had experience expressing felt that it should be a closed system to reduce the risk of contamination and that the milk containers could be “screwed straight onto your pump that you could take off, cap it. It doesn’t matter whether it was a bag or a bottle” (BFFG).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-0890334413481106">
<title>Commitment and bureaucracy</title>
<p>Several mothers expressed concern that a lengthy process of donating or receiving milk would be off-putting. Potential recipients felt that their baby would need milk as quickly as possible: “If there are too many loopholes that you need to jump through to access it. . . . When you’re in the throes of being a new mum . . . all you know is you’ve got a screaming baby who’s not satisfied” (Helena BFR). Some potential donors expressed concern with regard to how long or how much milk they would be expected to donate in order for equipment to be supplied or reimbursed. A few also worried about negative effects on their own baby: “I wouldn’t keep expressing now to donate to someone because it causes issues for feeding my baby” (BFFG).</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section24-0890334413481106">
<title>Promotion of Human Milk Banks—toward a Supportive Social Environment</title>
<p>Participants indicated that successful milk banking would require consistent information and support, particularly from health professionals, family, and friends. The most important aspects of promotion were who should promote human milk banks and to whom, where, and when.</p>
<sec id="section25-0890334413481106">
<title>Sources, settings, and audiences</title>
<p>Most mothers felt that ideally a milk bank’s existence would be general knowledge and be acceptable so mothers would know about it before pregnancy: “In an ideal world, everyone would just know about it. I know that if my kid had leukemia or whatever, I would know that there was such a thing as bone marrow transplants” (Angela BF). Further, mothers felt that health professionals, especially midwives, lactation consultants, and pediatricians, needed to be educated and supportive.</p>
<p>Participants typically thought that information at antenatal visits or classes would be helpful, especially as most felt that face-to-face information would be best. They also suggested providing information in baby “bounty packs” that pregnant mothers receive in hospitals and doctors’ rooms and using media other than posters and brochures, such as fridge magnets.</p>
<p>Several mothers noted that if preterm and sick babies were prioritized, donation to and receipt from milk banks should be promoted more strongly in neonatal intensive care units:<disp-quote>
<p>If it was something that the nurses encouraged, if they would sort of say, “You look like you’ve got a lot of milk. We have a milk bank,” and took it from there, because they’re your main contacts during that period. (Cecilia PS)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-0890334413481106">
<title>Timing</title>
<p>Mothers held divergent views about the timing of milk bank promotion. Most felt that it would be best if pregnant mothers had information early in pregnancy so that the decision to use donated milk would not need to be made in the face of a hungry, sick, or preterm baby when the mothers were unable to breastfeed or express. By contrast, Janice (PS) said, “If someone had told me about it [in early pregnancy] then I probably wouldn’t have really thought about it.” Another mother (PSFG) pointed out that preterm mothers may not have the opportunity to participate in many, or any, antenatal classes prior to the birth.</p>
<p>Mothers of preterm/sick babies also reported being overwhelmed, unwell, or unconscious when the decision about feeding their baby was made. Two mothers suggested that the decision could be part of a birth plan so that consent to feeding donated milk would already have been given:<disp-quote>
<p>Well me being out of it within that first 24 hours, if I had’ve known before and like ticked the box or whatever and said, “Yes, I would like that,” then I would have known he was being fed that even though they couldn’t ask me. (PSFG)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section27-0890334413481106">
<title>Payment</title>
<p>There was strong consensus that donors should not be paid but that, ideally, donation should also not be a cost for donors. Rather than payment, participants felt that donors should either have equipment provided or be reimbursed any expenses associated with donation. Participants felt that if mothers were paid, then the “wrong type” of mother may donate, with her main reason being for the money, as opposed to the “right type” of mother, who does it out of care and concern to help other mothers and babies: “I would have real concerns over, if there is payment involved, people doing it for the wrong reasons and then your screening process is possibly jeopardized because people are going to try and fudge the results” (PSFG). One mother suggested that, rather than paying donors, funds would be better spent on running the milk bank such as “delivery or extra locations for drop offs or anything that might not be able to be afforded” (Abby BF).</p>
<p>There was also a consensus that, ideally, milk from a human milk bank should be free for recipients, particularly in the hospital, because there is no charge for formula in the hospital. They typically felt that if human milk were more broadly available, if there was a cost it should be less than the cost of formula. Nevertheless, mothers also acknowledged that this may not be feasible.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Qualitative data collected by this small study suggest that the establishment of a milk bank in South Australia would be well received, provided that a range of practicalities is addressed to make donation and receipt as easy as possible for mothers. The only concern that mothers conveyed with regard to using donor milk was that donors were screened and that the milk was safe for babies, supporting the scant research on mothers’ perceptions of using milk banks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0890334413481106">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Mothers in our study suggested that human milk bank benefits and processes should be well publicized to increase public awareness as well as acceptance from mothers in the general population, partners, and family of potential donors and recipients. Mothers’ views reflected World Health Organization recommendations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0890334413481106">30</xref></sup> that human milk banks should be part of breastfeeding promotion, where support for maternal breastfeeding is the first choice, with human milk bank milk being the next alternative before using formula, at least for preterm or sick infants.</p>
<p>Mothers felt strongly that human milk banking would need to be well promoted to health professionals as the main resource that mothers rely on for infant feeding information. As found in previous research,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0890334413481106">20</xref></sup> some mothers experienced a lack of support from health professionals for using milk banks and were concerned about this. Promotion and up-skilling of health professionals about the benefits and processes of human milk banking could be an extension of existing breastfeeding strategies or existing guidelines for expressing, storing, and providing milk, such as those used by child care centers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0890334413481106">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Limitations of our research relate to being a small qualitative pilot study. The study sample was restricted to mainly White Anglo, educated, middle-class, partnered mothers, a group that is known to have high breastfeeding rates, and hence that may have influenced the degree of positivity about human milk banking. The sample also included 5 mothers involved in informal breast milk sharing, so these mothers may also be more likely to be positive about human milk banking than mothers in the broader population. The sample included few mothers from lower income and disadvantaged groups and no teenage mothers, mothers with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background, or mothers from culturally and linguistically diverse groups. Such groups are known to have lower breastfeeding rates and may be less supportive of milk banking, have different views about its acceptability, or have different concerns. The researchers wish to address these gaps in future research. As the study was undertaken in South Australia, our research was limited to mothers with no experience of donating to or receiving milk from a formal milk bank. Further research could be conducted with mothers involved in active milk banks to increase understanding of their key role in the supply and demand side of the process.</p>
<p>Considering mothers’ concerns about health professional support, we also suggest further research with health professionals in both public and private practice to identify their views of human milk banks and how these could support their practice, especially those seeing women antenatally (eg, general practitioners, midwives, obstetricians, and health promoters) and those involved in perinatal and postnatal care (eg, pediatricians, neonatal staff, and child health nurses). Finally, given that some participants were involved in informal milk sharing, this could be an interesting area for further research.</p>

<sec id="section29-0890334413481106" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Much of the previous research on human milk banking has focused on the clinical and technical processes and has not sought out the views of mothers, despite their crucial role in the supply and demand side of the milk banking process. Our findings suggest that mothers would welcome the establishment of a milk bank in South Australia and that a range of practicalities, particularly transporting milk from donors and to recipients, would need to be addressed to make donation and receipt as easy as possible.</p>
<p>Extensive public promotion would be crucial so that it would become general knowledge that a milk bank existed and to foster mainstream acceptance. Support from health professionals involved in caring for pregnant and birthing mothers and infants would be fundamental to the success of a human milk bank in South Australia. Our findings build on evidence from other developed nations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0890334413481106">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0890334413481106"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0890334413481106"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0890334413481106"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0890334413481106">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0890334413481106">32</xref></sup> that human milk banking should be supported as an extension of national breastfeeding policies.</p>
