<p>An outbreak is usually defined as either two or more linked cases, or an increase in cases against the normal background levels of an organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757177412455444">Anonymous, 2011</xref>). When the background level of an organism is zero, one case can and should be recognised as an outbreak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757177412455444">Anonymous 2012</xref>). The normal background level of nosocomial bloodborne viruses (BBV) should be zero, and consequently, a single nosocomial BBV transmission should be considered an outbreak. This Outbreak Column is focused on recent nosocomial BBV outbreak reports. This is not so much to emphasise that they should be classified as ‘infection control never events’, but rather because the fact these relatively small sporadic outbreaks occur, suggests that standard infection control precautions may not be practised sufficiently well generally to prevent BBV outbreaks. Included in this column are nosocomial BBV outbreak investigations implicating re-used cotton wool balls, colonoscopy procedures, lancing devices and details of one outbreak that occurred in two hospitals. There is a good degree of variation in the depth of the investigations and in the certainty with which the investigators present their case for the probable causative transmission pathways. This is in the main due to the retrospective nature of outbreak investigations. This Outbreak Column will not include detailed discussions of phylogenetic analysis presented in the papers – this is beyond my expertise. It is assumed that the authors and the journals’ peer reviewers have accepted that the evidence presented is sufficient to justify a diagnosis of nosocomial BBV cross-transmission.</p>
<p>The first outbreak implicates a contaminated single cotton wool ball, which had been used to stop bleeding on five women following routine phlebotomy, as the outbreak transmission pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177412455444">Mboto et al, 2010</xref>). The setting was an antenatal clinic in Nigeria. The chronology of events is perplexing; the incident occurred in 1997, the outbreak was confirmed in 2005 and the authors published some five years later in 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177412455444">Mboto et al, 2010</xref>). It appears that an observed practice of re-using the same cotton wool ball on one patient, who was number five of five on whom the same cotton wool ball was used, was the trigger to investigate. The women were investigated to determine their immediate BBV status and any risk they may have posed to others. The second patient on whom the cotton ball was used was positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV). None of the five patients were positive for HBV or HIV. Repeat tests performed an inexplicable eight years later showed that in order of cotton wool ball usage, the second, third and fourth patient were now all HCV positive. The first and fifth patient remained negative for all BBVs. The spouses and the children of all five patients (<italic>n</italic>=25) were negative for all BBVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177412455444">Mboto et al, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The authors state that in developing countries, nosocomial outbreaks of BBVs have arisen as a consequence of re-using syringes and gloves; also the dearth of healthcare workers (HCWs) trained in safe practices increases the transmission risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757177412455444">Mboto et al, 2010</xref>). The phylogenetic relatedness of strains was not studied for in this investigation – possibly due to a lack of facilities and resources. However, there were no reports of blood transfusion or other healthcare interventions for the patients in the years since the recognised nosocomial exposure. This incident occurred in a healthcare setting within a resource limited country, and the investigation process may be too elongated for any conclusion to be drawn with confidence. However, it does have lessons for us because the implicated transmission pathway is plausible and involves a procedure that occurs ubiquitously in our hospitals and healthcare settings. Re-use of a BBV contaminated cotton wool ball is a plausible transmission pathway sufficient to cause a BBV outbreak because of three key factors: firstly, only relatively small quantities of blood are needed to cause cross-transmission with HCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757177412455444">Girou et al, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757177412455444">Laporte et al, 2009</xref>). Secondly, the procedure would have involved pressing of the HCV contaminated cotton wool ball directly on another patient’s skin break. And finally, HCV is viable in the environment for up to a week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757177412455444">Ciesek et al, 2010</xref>). To highlight the plausibility of this hypothesis, a study looking for HCV RNA on intravenous drug users’ paraphernalia found alcohol and used cotton swabs were not only frequently positive (83%, <italic>n</italic>=110), but also that swabs were the most frequently positive item. These swabs also had a higher HCV titre than syringes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757177412455444">Thibault et al, 2011</xref>). The obvious question that the authors did not explore relates to case-finding: although this unsafe practice was done on five patients in one clinic, was the practice the norm in this and other clinics and if so, for how long? Ergo case-finding may have been insufficient to have identified other similar outbreaks. The available resources may also have hampered more extensive investigations.</p>
<p>There is stronger transmission pathway evidence presented in the second outbreak, which was recognised in Spain in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177412455444">Gonzalez-Candelas et al, 2010</xref>). The outbreak involved endoscopy equipment, which has been the ‘probable’ source of several outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177412455444">Morris et al, 2006</xref>). The investigation was instigated following the diagnosis of hepatitis C infection in two regular blood donors. These patients did not have lifestyle risk factors and the investigation soon focused on the colonoscopy procedures that they had both undergone on the same day in December 2005. These two newly positive HCV patients were known to be negative for HCV before their colonoscopy. Between their negative HCV test and their colonoscopy, all patients who had had an endoscopy procedure were identified (<italic>n</italic>=36). Two of these 36 patients were identified as being HCV positive. One of the two known HCV positive patients had had a colonoscopy before, but on the same day as the patients who had acquired the nosocomial HCV infection. Crucially, all three had a similar phylogenetic strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177412455444">Gonzalez-Candelas et al, 2010</xref>). Three possible transmission pathways were identified:</p>
<list id="list1-1757177412455444" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Blood collection and intravenous device placement</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Anaesthetic drug administration (propofol and midazolam)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Colonoscopy decontamination failure</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The remainder of the outbreak investigation was hampered by a lack of evidence of what practices had been undertaken when the cross-transmission occurred. There were umpteen failures in both decontamination processing and in the recording thereof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177412455444">Gonzalez-Candelas et al, 2010</xref>). The usual BBV nosocomial outbreak suspects of multi-dose vials or poor injection practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177412455444">Lanini et al, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177412455444">Dolan et al, 2010</xref>) could similarly not be eliminated by recorded actions/interviews. However, the authors hypothesised that it was more likely to be a colonoscopy decontamination failure because in between the known HCV positive patient and the two acquired HCV cases on the same list, there had been a patient who had had a gastroscopy procedure. The patient who underwent the gastroscopy had had the same anaesthetic procedures and intravenous device placement procedures but significantly not the same scope procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177412455444">Gonzalez-Candelas et al, 2010</xref>). Although BBV transmission from a colonoscope has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757177412455444">Bronowicki et al, 1997</xref>), the evidence in this outbreak is circumstantial. What is important, however, is that two <italic>infection control never events</italic> occurred in the endoscopy suite and no one can be absolutely sure how.</p>
<p>I believe you can estimate how long an infection control nurse has been in post by the recollections of their first local decontamination facilities. My first ICU had five open buckets of glutaraldehyde, the ENT department kept their glutaraldehyde next to their tea tray, and the endoscopy suite decontamination facility was by today’s standards primitive. I took up post in early 1988. The need for and development of ongoing quality assurance and quality control that has occurred since my appointment for this high-risk procedure is designed specifically to prevent nosocomial outbreaks and ensure patient safety. In addition, should any outbreak arise, with good documentation, there can be optimal investigation and an accurate assessment of the risk to any exposed others, i.e. reducing unnecessary anxiety as a consequence of extensive patient notification exercises.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757177412455444">Lanini et al (2009)</xref> published an excellent review of 33 nosocomial hepatitis B virus (HBV) outbreaks which identified that 57.2% were caused by contaminated multi-dose vials and non-disposable multi-patient capillary blood sampling devices. The lead author also published an actual nosocomial HBV outbreak report where the cause was clearly identified – a lancing device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177412455444">Lanini et al, 2012</xref>). The investigations in this outbreak report were extremely thorough and included a retrospective cohort study to identify all potential cases, a nested case-control study to identify the source, and a prospective study to be sure that the introduced control measures and system changes were effective in preventing further transmission. The investigators also undertook extensive audits of infection control practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177412455444">Lanini et al, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The alert signal arose in February 2007, when it was noted that two patients in an Italian oncohaematology unit had been diagnosed with HVC in less than two months. To make sure that where the outbreak manifested was where cross-transmission had occurred, the investigations extended to two other associated clinical areas – the interventional radiology unit and the transfusion medical unit. The investigation period extended retrospectively from May 2006 to February 2007, that is, from 10 months before the alert signal and 13 months prospectively post alert signal. In the retrospective investigation of those available for testing 50 patients were identified as being susceptible for HBV infection, i.e. they had negative serology and had not been immunised prior to admission. From these 50 patients a total of six patients were identified as being ‘incident cases’, i.e. acquiring HBV during their admission (this includes the two patients identified at the alert signal). Three patients were identified as ‘prevalent cases’; these were patients known to be HBV positive before admission. One prevalent case and three incident cases were found to be infected with an identical HBV variant (not all incident cases were tested) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177412455444">Lanini et al, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Several practices were considered possible transmission pathways:</p>
<list id="list2-1757177412455444" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Nurses stated that they had occasionally shared 100 ml 0.9% NaCl diluents.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>All nurses stated that they used a shared multi-patient lancing device (this was done with both a fresh lance and a fresh end cap on each usage).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The use of this device was discouraged and the device itself was obtained for HBV testing. The device was, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, suitable to be used on multiple patients provided the end cap and lancet were changed between each patient use. No possible transmission pathways were identified in the interventional radiology units or the transfusion medical unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177412455444">Lanini et al, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>A strong association between exposure to the multi-patient lancing device and being a case was provided in the nested case-control study. Exposure to the multi-patient lancing device in the cases was a median 29.5 days (interquartile range (IQR) 15–31), whereas for the 44 controls the exposure was a median 0 days (IQR 0–11) days. However most convincing of all, the multi-patient lancing device was found to be contaminated with an HBV molecular variant identical to the one which had been found in the index case and three of the six nosocomial cases where phylogenetic analysis had been performed on the HBV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177412455444">Lanini et al, 2012</xref>). Once the lancing device was removed no further cases were identified. The authors hypothesised that transmission occurred either because of a failure to change the lance, or end cap, or contamination of the end cap or lancet when changing these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177412455444">Lanini et al, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The last outbreak in this short column occurred in Ireland and involved four HBV transmission episodes in two different hospitals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412455444">Burns et al, 2011</xref>). The alert signal was the admission in March 2006 of a 57 year old patient with acute HBV whose only risk factor was previous admission to hospital in December 2005. There were no staff members involved in this patient’s care who were known to be HBV positive and the patient had not received any blood or blood products. Although there were exposure prone procedures performed, the authors discounted these as the modes of transmission. The trigger patient was in fact the third patient to acquire the HBV (patient D). Extensive investigations identified that cross-transmission had most probably occurred from an index patient A to patient B in the first hospital. There was then cross-transmission from patient B to patients C and D in the second hospital and finally to patient E again in the second hospital. The duration of overlapping admissions was: A-B 10 days, B-C five days, B-D three days and D-E six days. Patient D had been the trigger for this outbreak. A failure of standard infection control precautions around the misuse of phlebotomy equipment was thought to have been implicated in this outbreak. The prevalent use of needle/blood tube-holding devices may have played a role in this outbreak although again this is circumstantial evidence. Indeed, phlebotomy records revealed that patient A (the index case) had phlebotomy performed directly before patient B. Patient A was subsequently found to have been highly infectious for 10 months without clinicians being aware of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412455444">Burns et al, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>What is most disturbing about these outbreaks is the investigators’ acceptance of <italic>health care</italic> as a risk factor for BBV acquisition. Furthermore, in one review the authors seem to accept a low BBV transmission risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757177412455444">Morris et al, 2006</xref>). I would argue that low risk does not make it acceptable. Also in most instances in this column where the investigators found a case, the harder they looked, the more cases they found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757177412455444">Gonzalez-Candelas et al, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757177412455444">Burns et al, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757177412455444">Lanini et al, 2012</xref>). An APIC position paper on safe injection, infusion and medication vial practices in healthcare in 2010 identified some uncomfortable truths and an introductory paragraph summarises the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757177412455444">Dolan et al, 2010</xref>):
<disp-quote>
<p>“Breaches in safe injection, infusion, and medication vial practices continue to result in unacceptable and devastating events for patients. More than 35 outbreaks of viral hepatitis have occurred in the United States over the past 10 years because of these unsafe practices. These outbreaks have resulted in the exposure of &gt;100,000 individuals to viral hepatitis and the transmission of either HBV or HCV to more than 500 patients.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>These nosocomial BBV outbreak reports or ‘infection control never events’ suggest that IPCTs and HCWs generally need to assure themselves that their systems are safe, that is, the HCWs have the equipment, knowledge, support, environment and information needed to negate this risk and to continuously practise, as a minimum, standard infection control precautions. The study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757177412455444">Thibault et al (2011)</xref> emphasises how simple it could be with a contaminated cotton wool ball to cause HCV cross-transmission in a healthcare setting.</p>

<label>Footnote</label>
<p>I have read many nosocomial BBV outbreaks over the years and each time I naively think that the latest one will be the last. This is not the case. In addition, what is published is only likely to be the tip of the iceberg. Like all tragedies (and I personally would count a BBV cross-transmission as a tragedy), for each case there will be many more instances where patients were exposed to someone else’s blood but, as they did not have a BBV, cross-transmission did not arise. And probably many, many more incidences where there was a decontamination failure, or an exposure to blood, but fortuitously as patients did not have a skin break to allow access to a virus. Nosocomial BBV outbreaks are a failure of standard infection control precautions, our most basic safety system to prevent any healthcare associated infection. These outbreaks are and should be considered an ‘infection control never event’. To prevent such events like the changes in endoscopy decontamination there should be both quality control and quality assurance in all clinical areas to show it could not happen here. In addition, the case for system safety engineering with a ban on the use of multi-dose vials and the removal of all multi-patient lancing devices seems a good place to start.</p></fn>
