<p>Author of the book needs no introduction for his innovative and unique ideas in Indian Management. He has significantly contributed to this field through his path breaking ideas, creative concepts and innovative models. His pioneering contribution and thought provoking models in management literature has led to some rethinking and revisiting earlier approaches and thereby have provided some new directions to new age management.</p>
<p>India is well known for Kautilya’s Arthashastra. That was the ancient period. With new developments over the centuries, there is a need for a new ‘Earth Sastra’ keeping in view the contemporary requirements of human society. A new ‘Earth Sastra’ proposed in this book is based on a new integration of Indian thought with developments in Economics. This book is largely based on the author’s papers published in Southern Economist, which have been revised and updated in this book. His papers in Southern Economist were largely related to various aspects of ‘Development Thinking’, Management Education and Indian Ethos as foundation for soft power of India. On the occasion of Golden Jubilee Celebration of Southern Economist, the author compiled these papers together in the form of this book. It is a creative presentation of the author’s earlier works and publications. The various chapters in the book portray author’s indepth understanding of various social, cultural, political and ethical issues.</p>
<p>In Section I of the book titled as Harmonic Globalization, the author presents an Earth model captured through the acronym EARTH representing Enlightenment (E), Awakening (A), Realization ( R) of Truth (T) and Harmony (H). According to the author, today Earth needs this Earth model to create ‘Inclusive and Sustainable Economics (ISE) to create a new WISE world (World based on ISE). Some of the key ideas in this section are four forces model represented by metaphor of four lions viz. Force of Market, Force of State, Force of People and Force of Self, need to move from Adam Smith (Self-interest) to ADAM (Artha, Dharma, Moksha integration) represented by balance between market values, social values and spiritual values leading to vision of holistic development, that is, HDM (Holistic Development &amp; Management).</p>
<p>Section II is titled as Roads to Development and the author provides RICH model (based on parameters viz. per capita resource availability, per capita income, per capita basket of consumption and per capita happiness) as a conceptual framework for nation’s development. Three roads viz. Corporate approach, State driven development and Capillary action (grassroots approach) have been interlinked for the holistic and inclusive view of nation’s development. Author suggests need for Wholsitic Development Index (WDI) as a ranking scale to assess nations, States and cities on a scale of holistic development. STEPS (Social, Technological, Economic, Political and Spiritual) development model has been suggested for an integrative perspective of development.</p>
<p>Section III relates to Development of Sacro-civic Society. Author brings to the fore the core ideas of Indian Ethos, the need for a new social order and the need for the vision of sacro-civic society. He suggests the HOST (Home, Office, Society and Temple) model of work-life balance.</p>
<p>Section IV suggests the idea of Liberation and author focuses on the idea and techniques of mind liberation such as Inversion-Subversion-New version, Grounded Praxis, Deprogramming and reprogramming of mind. He reinforces the idea of sacro-civic society linking it with Orchha vision and Kailash vision derived on the basis of philosophical ideas represented by these two well known places.</p>
<p>Section V relates to Leadership and author presents various leadership approaches such as DEAN (Direct Enlightenment Awakening &amp; Nirvana) Approach to leadership, Corporate Rishi model of leadership, BEST (Behavioral, Economic, Strategic and Technical dimension) managers, CEO ( Creative, Enlightened and Organic) leaders and the need for ‘MBA’ (Mind Balancing Attitude). Author also provides illustrations of some institutions in India built around these ideas.</p>
<p>Section VI relates to Living and focuses on five foundational Principles of Indian Ethos and Indian Management viz. the idea of oneness, divine and demonic types of human beings, Trigunaorthree qualities in nature, that is, Sattvic, Rajasik and Tamasik, four Purusharthas (Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha) and the Panchkosha.</p>
<p>In Section VII on New Age Strategic Thinking author provides the idea of Moon Ocean Strategy taking us beyond Blue Ocean Strategy based on imagination and imaginative thinking. Finally, the author concludes with New Earth Sastra vision articulated, ‘From Soil to Soul philosophy’. This new vision provides an integration of three thought currents in human society viz. Transactional, Transformational and Transcendental metaphorically represented by Market’s Maya, Mahatama Gandhi and Mt. Kailash.</p>
<p>Different sections of this book acquaint the readers with different facets of Harmonic Globalization, Roads to Development, Sacro-civic society, Liberation, Living, Leadership and New Age Strategic Thinking. Proposed models with ancient roots have universal appeal. The book is very impressive and inspires the individuals to have a fresh perspective to view things, situations and events. The book is well structured, narrated in lucid style and simple language and insightfully organized, therefore, keeping the reader glued throughout. It makes a significant contribution towards improved understanding of concepts of Indian management and creating a new vision of management and society. The book’s style of presentation widens the scope of its readership from management community to most people who have interest in this area. A must read for new age managers looking for new ideas. It also opens new vistas of research opportunities for research scholars in the area of management and leadership.</p>
