<p>Whilst this paper relates to a small, specialist group of nurses, the point made relating to role development and the titles used by these nurses reflects the findings of other literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987110385991">Mantzoukas and Watkinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987110385991">McGee, 2009</xref>) in diverse areas of nursing. All nurses whom I have asked as to why they have developed their advanced practice role have identified somewhere in their answer that the patients had a need which was not being met, and there was a need to change practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987110385991">Mantzoukas and Watkinson (2006)</xref> identify that these are generic features of the advanced nurse practitioner. As this paper identifies, nurse practitioners have been in existence globally for over 40 years yet there is still debate about the role, title and regulation, thus highlighting the similarities and differences. That this paper refers to two different countries is very useful.</p>
<p>This paper identifies that in New Zealand there is a clear regulatory process which the Nursing and Midwifery Council in the United Kingdom is currently still investigating with stakeholders. Regulation, I could argue, will clearly identify what the requirements of an advanced practice nurse are, give clarity to the title and would address the issues of patient safety. It is interesting to read that regulation alone does not seem to change practice in terms of the titles used and the education the nurses undertake. From this study there is evidence to suggest that there is still a large number of nurses working at an advanced level as a ‘clinical nurse specialist’ who have not received educational input at a masters level. The development of a system for regulation must take into account these issues and the points made in the conclusion of this paper in relation to ‘grandfather rights’, salary scales and benefits for the nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987110385991">Marsden, 2010</xref>). If this approach is to be successful, the experience of other countries who have gone down the regulation route must be utilised to identify the best fit for the service that nurses in the UK are required to provide: this is crucial to successful change.</p>
<p>As the paper identifies, advanced practice in the UK is flourishing, but do these nurses all work at an advanced level as identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987110385991">International Council of Nurses (2009)</xref>? Is the clinical role sufficient? Should these nurses working at advanced levels all be required to have management and leadership roles as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987110385991">Mantzoukas and Watkinson (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987110385991">McGee (2009)</xref>?</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I did not mention the European Union working time directives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987110385991">Department of Health, 2009</xref>) and the current financial climate; these have and will continue to require all health practitioners to look at their practice and demonstrate quality care for less. Indeed healthcare workers are going to be canvassed as to how this can be done. We must work interprofessionally, utilising the evidence we have to support role development and service changes to the benefit of the individual using the service.</p>
