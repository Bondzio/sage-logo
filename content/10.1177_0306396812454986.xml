<p>Time was that ‘radical’ was a term of approval. A radical was on the side of progress, a radical ‘exhausted the limits of the possible’. And radicalisation meant being open to the world as a changing thing and engaging with others to leave that imprint of difference, of change. Above all, radical was associated with being on the Left, on the side of progress, a history that took humanity to a higher plane. That was radicalisation, when the idea of a socialist revolution was still a possibility and the lessons of the Holocaust had not been lost.</p>
<p>But now, post 9/11, radicalisation’s meaning has been corrupted; it now bears the mark of Cain. In one fell swoop, the term has gone from its normal usage to meaning someone being won over to fundamentalist interpretations of Islam, which simultaneously makes him, therefore, won over to a violent, extremist, jihadist ideology and, hence, a potential terrorist.</p>
<p>In this issue of <italic>Race &amp; Class</italic>, contributors cover differing conceptions of radicalisation. Frances Webber, a UK immigration lawyer for over thirty years, reveals in ‘Borderline justice’ how even a profession as staid and traditional as the law can be radicalised by a coterie of committed solicitors and barristers to stand shoulder to shoulder with campaigners and victims against the power of the Executive. Martyn Hudson, through an examination of Michael Tippett’s 1941 oratorio <italic>A Child of Our Time</italic> (about the Jewish teenager who killed a German diplomat, provoking <italic>Kristallnacht</italic>), shows how the composer found his more radical resonances through the use of the African American spiritual. Culture can radicalise as it borrows, incorporates and fuses forms. Tim Brennan reveals the contribution that a scholar can make to radicalising his or her academic field, as he reviews the stance taken by Neil Lazarus in his controversial book on <italic>The Postcolonial Unconscious</italic>.</p>
<p>A lawyer, composer, university professor: these are radicals who have the security of a profession to help them keep the faith. But what happens to the radicals of the movement when their God fails or the popular tide turns against them and they are left stranded? Ashley Lavelle speculates on the sorry tale of one of the 1960s political icons, Eldridge Cleaver, and his move from ‘Soul on Ice’ to ‘Soul for Hire’, from radical Black Power leader to renegade would-be Republican senator.</p>
<p>But it is Arun Kundnani who shows in ‘Radicalisation: the journey of a concept’ how the term has become debased. A whole scholarship, with its own assumptions and biases, is being slowly built around ‘radicalisation’, which has, for western governments, intelligence services and armies, come to have just the one, and very pejorative, meaning. Shamim Miah reveals how this fear of radicalisation is contaminating other spheres, such as education, and now leading in policy terms to the forced integration of ‘Muslim’ and ‘white’ schools in northern England, where young South Asians rioted in 2001.</p>
<p>To try to reclaim a word when its day is done is an empty task. Words reflect their time, they do not create them. Black could suddenly be beautiful in Cleaver’s heyday because of a whole range of cultural activities, politics, literature and thinking emanating from the US’s black communities, fighting for their rights. It is the spirit of radicalism, its urgency and optimism, its sense that each individual can contribute to a larger transformation, that we need to recover. And that is only possible through a return to radical activism. In the beginning is the act, not the word.</p>
