<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate gender differences in quality of life and coping patterns after discharge for patients with burns in China. Cross-sectional survey research design and purposive sampling were used in this study, for which 92 subjects, including 56 males and 36 females, were recruited from a medical centre in central China. Quality of life was measured by the burn-specific health scale-brief (BSHS-B) and coping patterns were measured with the coping with burns questionnaire (CBQ), while demographic data was collected using a demographic questionnaire. An independent <italic>t</italic>-test and bivariate correlate were employed to analyse the data. The study results showed significant differences in quality of life between genders and coping patterns. There was a statistically significant gender difference in the sub-domain of the BSHS-B score for affect and relations, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, and for coping patterns: emotion support, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. The findings indicated that optimism/problem solving, revolution/adjustment and avoidance were the most commonly used coping patterns for males and females. The rank orders were same. The study indicated that women are more sensitive to relationships with family after discharge and tend to exhibit depressive symptoms. For women, emotional support is more important than it is for men. A number of significant positive and negative correlations were found among the variables.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1744987110379301" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Burns are a common trauma; every year in America there are 2–3.6 million patients suffering from burns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987110379301">Fauerbach et al., 1999</xref>), and the rate is about 1,000/million (1%). In China there are 5–10 million patients who suffer from burns every year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987110379301">Sheng, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>To the victim, sustaining a burn injury is not only a physical trauma, but also a psychological trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987110379301">Asgjerd et al., 2007</xref>) and the effects do not disappear with discharge. Survivors of burns often have a challenging and protracted recovery process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987110379301">Taal and Faber, 1998</xref>). Somatic symptoms are generally persistent and psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in its many forms, are relatively frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987110379301">Baur et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>After discharge, the survivors have to face a great change in their life. They have to face the change in appearance, the change in physical function, relationships with other people, employment and the changes of the family economic situation because of the overwhelming expenditures for cure and medical treatment expenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744987110379301">Yue, 2006</xref>). In response to this kind of stressful situation, coping strategies will be used to handle it. Coping strategies have been found to affect health status directly; emotional support and optimism/ problem solving were related to better health status, while avoidance, revaluation/adjustment, self-control and instrumental action were related to poorer health status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987110379301">Willebrand et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>With the recent advances in burn care, the mortality rate is decreasing year by year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987110379301">Dyster-Aas et al., 2004</xref>). With the number of survivors increasing year by year, the questions regarding quality of life for survivors of massive burn injuries emerge. Worldwide, more and more researchers have studied the rehabilitation and other factors that influence the outcome of burn patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987110379301">Herndon, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Gender differences are a timely and contemporary issue. Physiological and immunological differences between men and women have long been recognised and experimental evidence suggests that similar disparities exist in trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987110379301">Jason and Bradley, 2003</xref>). However, few researchers have yet to focus on the topic of gender difference in regard to the quality of life and coping patterns of patients suffering from burns after discharge.</p>
<p>Therefore, the aims of the study were: (1) to investigate the gender difference in quality of life and coping patterns for patients surviving burns after hospital discharge in central China; (2) to examine the relationships among the demographic characteristics, the quality of life and coping patterns of patients with burns.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1744987110379301"><title>Review of literature</title>
<sec id="sec3-1744987110379301"><title>Quality of life</title>
<p>Burn injuries may cause severe disability. Issues relating to the concept of quality of life for patients with burns are drawing more and more attention from scholars and researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744987110379301">Wikehult et al., 2005</xref>). According to the definition provided by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the quality of life is an individual’s perception of his/her position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which he/she lives, and in relation to his/her goals, expectations, standards and concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987110379301">Huang and Hung, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Quality of life is a broad concept affected in a complex way by the person’s physical health, psychological state, level of independence, social relationships, personal beliefs and their relationship to salient features of the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1744987110379301">Yao, 2002</xref>). In this study, the quality of life was measured by the burn-specific health scale-brief (BSHS-B), which includes three sub-scales: affect and relations (BSHS-B subscales interpersonal relationships, affect, sexuality), function (simple abilities, hand function) and skin involvement (heat sensitivity, treatment regimens, body image). The information obtained refers to the quality of a person’s life post-injury, at the moment of interview.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1744987110379301"><title>Coping patterns</title>
<p>Coping refers to a person's cognitive and behavioural efforts to manage stressful situations and any accompanying negative emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1744987110379301">Willebrand et al., 2001</xref>). Coping is a changing process that is altered to fit the characteristics of the situation and how well the coping strategies are working (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987110379301">Lazarus, 1993</xref>). Generally, coping is suggested to have two opposite roles in relation to physical and psychological symptoms; after traumatic events people tend to oscillate between avoidance and approach, the former being a protection against emotions that are too strong and the latter offering possibilities for working through the event. Avoidance is considered to be adaptive directly after a stressful experience, while approaching strategies are beneficial somewhat later in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987110379301">Suls and Fletcher, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987110379301">Roth and Cohen, 1986</xref>). Coping strategies are receiving increasing attention, since it has been established that injury-specific factors alone do not explain the differences in health outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987110379301">Tedstone et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Patients with burns have previously been observed to use avoidant strategies after discharge and to avoid social interactions and activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744987110379301">Tarrier, 1995</xref>). Patients with burns that have an isolated lifestyle have been observed to have a poorer recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987110379301">Taal and Faber, 1998</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1744987110379301"><title>Factors associated with the quality of life</title>
<p>Previous research studies on factors associated with the quality of life suggest that findings tend to fall into three major categories: burn severity, the demographic characteristics and the coping pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1744987110379301">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Significant associations between the extent of total body surface area (TBSA), burn full thickness injury (FTI) and patient health status were demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987110379301">Kimmo et al., 1998</xref>). Extensive use of avoidant coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987110379301">Kildal et al., 2005</xref>) seemed to be associated with impaired burn-specific health. Finally, better adjustment has been reported among male patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987110379301">Litleré et al., 2003</xref>), those who were married, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1744987110379301">Kildal et al., 2002</xref>) and those who were employed at the time of the query (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987110379301">Litleré et al., 2003</xref>). Asjerd et al. (2007) demonstrated that, at an average of 47 months after being burned, the injury still interfered significantly with patient health status and their work. The most relevant characteristics of factors observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987110379301">Salvador-Sanza et al.’s study (1999)</xref> are low percentage of body surface area burned, scant number of surgical interventions, low education and economic levels and a high percentage of burns located on face, trunk, genitals and upper extremities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987110379301"><title>Gender differences</title>
<p>Physiological and immunological differences between men and women have long been recognised and have been the basis for a considerable amount of research. Experimental evidence suggests that similar disparities exist in trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987110379301">Jason and Bradley, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1744987110379301">Van’s study (2003)</xref> shows that the female patient is often more vulnerable to trauma.</p>
<p>There have also been several studies examining the effect of gender on outcome following trauma and other disorders. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987110379301">Eun et al. (2004)</xref> explore gender influences on burn outcomes in the elderly and have found that gender plays a greater and more complicated role in patient care than previously thought. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1744987110379301">Wohltmann et al.’s study (1999)</xref> suggests that males who were younger than 50 years old had increased mortality rates compared with females of the same age. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987110379301">Brown et al. (1988)</xref> compared male and female patients who were burned, on their functional disability, disfigurement, coping responses, social resources and psychosocial adjustment to a burn injury. Brown et al.’s study (1988) showed that less functional disability for men and greater problem solving for women were the most important variables in explaining psychosocial adjustment to a burn injury. Furthermore, he suggested that researchers need to be cognisant of gender differences and consider men and women as separate populations in the future.</p>

<sec id="sec7-1744987110379301"><title>Research questions</title>
<p>Therefore, based upon the previous literature review and the objectives of the present study, the following research questions were posed.
<list id="list1-1744987110379301" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What differences exist between the quality life and coping pattern between male and female patients with severe burns in China?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What relationships exist between the demographic characteristics, ways of coping and health status?</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1744987110379301"><title>Research framework</title>
<p>According to the previous literature review and the present research questions, the researcher proposed a modified research framework as the guideline for the investigation. As reflected in the research framework, the independent variables encompass two major factors, socio-demographic characteristics and coping patterns, while the dependent variable is quality of life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744987110379301">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1744987110379301" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<sec id="sec10-1744987110379301"><title>Design</title>
<p>This study used a cross-sectional, descriptive and correlational research design. Purposive sampling was used in a burn centre in Nanchang, China, with structured questionnaires and face-to-face interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1744987110379301"><title>Setting</title>
<p>The setting was a burn centre in Nanchang, central China.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1744987110379301"><title>Sample</title>
<p>The data was gathered during the time period from July to December 2008. The subjects were patients with burns after discharge between six months and five years who fulfilled the following criteria: (1) &gt;18 years of age; (2) total burn surface area (TBSA) 10%; (3) ability to read Chinese; (4) willingness to participate in the research study; (5) no mental illness. Based on power analysis, by a convention developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987110379301">Cohen (1988)</xref>, the value of γ in a two-group test of mean differences is estimated at 0.50, with an α value of 0.05 and power of 0.80; the <italic>n</italic> (number of subjects per group) determined at least 56 participants were to be involved. The sample consisted of 92 patients, 56 male and 36 female, from the burn medical-centre hospital, located in Nanchang, China.</p>

</fig>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1744987110379301"><title>Instruments</title>
<p>Three major variables were examined, including socio-demographic characteristics, quality of life and coping patterns of patients with burns. Data were gathered using structured questionnaires.</p>
<p>The study was implemented using three tools: the socio-demographic data questionnaire, the BSHS-B and the coping with burns questionnaire (CBQ).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1744987110379301"><title>The socio-demographic data questionnaire</title>
<p>The ‘socio-demographic data questionnaire’ was constructed by the researcher and questions were asked about age, gender, marital status, employment status, education level, family income, injury severity and time after discharge. Participants spent approximately five minutes responding to the questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1744987110379301"><title>The burn-specific health scale—brief</title>
<p>The BSHS-B, an abbreviated version of the burn-specific health scale (BSHS), developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987110379301">Kildal et al. (2001)</xref>, was used to measure the quality of life. The original scale was developed in 1982 by Blades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987110379301">Blades et al., 1982</xref>) and is widely used to measure the quality of life patients with burns after discharge. Since then three modified versions (BSHS-A, BSHS-R, BSHS-B) have been developed.</p>
<p>The BSHS-B is the latest questionnaire, with good psychometric properties. The scale has a 40-item inventory with nine scales: simple abilities, heat sensitivity, hand function, treatment regimens, work, body image, affective disorders, interpersonal relationships and sexuality. Three internally consistent and well-separated domains were derived: affect and relations (BSHS-B Subscales interpersonal relationships, affect, sexuality), function (simple abilities, hand function) and skin involvement (heat sensitivity, treatment regimens, body image). The three domains had important associations with injury-specific, socio-demographic and personality-related variables. The items were made on a five-point scale from 0 (extremely) to 4 (not/none at all). Intercorrelations ranged from 0.11 to 0.56, and Chronbach's factor alphas ranged from 0.75 to 0.93 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987110379301">Kildal et al., 2001</xref>). Each item says something about well-being ‘how much difficulty do you have, to what extent does each of the following statements describe you?’ Respondents are asked to think about the extent to which they use each option on a five-point scale ranging from 0 = extremely to 4 = not/none at all. Scoring involves adding up the individual item responses for each of the three domains.</p>
<p>The BSHS-B was written in English, so translation was required from English into Chinese, with back translation to ensure that the meaning of each item had not changed. This was done by comparing the back-translated version to the original English version of the instrument. Several reports proved that the scales were reliable and validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987110379301">Kildal et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987110379301">Dyster-Aas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744987110379301">Wikehult et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, the reliability coefficient of the Chinese version of the instrument was 0.818. It took approximately 10 minutes for the participants to complete the questionnaires.</p>
<p>The investigator sent an email to the Burn Unit in Sweden, Swedish Department of Neuroscience, Psychiatry, Sweden (bengt.gerdin@ plastik.uu.se) to obtain permission to use the BSHS-B. Permission was granted at no cost to the researcher.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1744987110379301"><title>The coping with burns questionnaire</title>
<p>The CBQ, developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987110379301">Willebrand et al. (2002)</xref>, was used to measure coping after discharge, and the majority of the items were burn or trauma related. The CBQ consists of 33 items divided into six scales: emotional support, optimism/problem solving, avoidance, revaluation/adjustment, self-control and instrumental action. Internal consistency was moderate to high with alpha values ranging from 0.56 to 0.83 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1744987110379301">Willebrand et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Several reports indicated that the tool was reliable and valid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987110379301">Willebrand et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744987110379301">Noble et al., 2006</xref>). Participants were instructed to think back to the time when they were discharged from hospital, and to think about the problems they faced and how much they used the strategies described in each item. Items were rated on a scale of 1 = does not apply/not used to 4 = used a great deal.</p>
<p>The CBQ was written in English, so translation was required from English into Chinese, with back translation to ensure that the meaning of each item had not changed. The back-translated version to the original English version of the instrument. In this study, the reliability coefficient of the Chinese version of the instrument was 0.818. It took approximately 10 minutes for the participants to complete the questionnaires.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-1744987110379301" sec-type="methods"><title>Procedure</title>
<p>The data were gathered as follows: (1) permission was obtained from the author of instruments, the scales BSHS-B and CBQ, to use them in this study; (2) approval was obtained from the review committee of Wuhan University HOPE School of Nursing, Wuhan University; (3) permission for entering into the hospital and obtaining subjects for the study was granted from each appropriate hospital administrator; (4) eligible subjects were recruited according to the selection criteria; (5) initial contact was made with each potential subject and an explanation of the study was given; (6) administration of the questionnaires was carried out; and (7) the investigator waited while each subject completed the questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-1744987110379301"><title>Ethical consideration</title>
<p>The participants were informed of the purpose of this study both orally and in writing. It was made clear that the participants could withdraw from the study at any time for any reason and that their withdrawal would in no way influence the quality of the health care that they received. Subjects were assured anonymity; code numbers were placed on the questionnaires after they were completed and returned to the investigator. Completed questionnaires were placed in a locked cabinet and were reviewed only by the investigator and the investigator’s advisor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-1744987110379301"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>All data were analysed using SPSS 11.0 software. Descriptive statistics were used for demographic data. An independent <italic>t</italic>-test was performed to answer the research question of what differences exist between the quality of life and coping patterns between male and female patients with severe burns in China. Spearman’s Rho was used to analyse the second research question: What relationships exist between the demographic characteristics, ways of coping and quality of life? Forced-entry multiple-liner regression was conducted to identify the effect of a combination of socio-demographic characteristics and coping patterns on quality of life. The assumptions for each of the statistical measures were met and an alpha level of 0.05 was established.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987110379301">Table 1</xref> presents the demographic characteristics of the sample. The majority of both males and females (51.8% and 40%, respectively) were between 26 to 50 years old, and the majority (62.5%) of males and 44% of females were married. In terms of educational level, 42% of the males had at least a junior high-school education, while 37.8% of the females had completed only an elementary school education. A total of 50% of the males and 63.9% of the females came from a family whose yearly income was less than 10,000 ¥<?tf?> per year. The majority of participants (58.2% of males and 51.4% of females) did currently hold jobs. A total of 39.3% of the males belonged to the group of patients with TBSA burns between 11% and 30%, FTI &lt; 10%, while 44.4% of the females belonged to the group having TBSA burns of between 31% and 50%, FTI 11–20%. A total of 87.3% of the male population and 69.4% of the female population were victims of genital, facial and hand burns. As such, the majority of the males within the sample population (57.1%) and one-third of the females (33.3%) were discharged in half a year.

The rank order (most frequent to least frequent) of coping strategies used by the males and females was the same. The order was: (1) optimism/problem solving; (2) revolution/adjustment; (3) avoidance; (4) instrumental action; (5) emotional support; (6) self-control. Except for emotional support, there were no other differences in other coping patterns seen between male and female subjects.

<sec id="sec23-1744987110379301"><title>Significant positive correlations</title>
<p>Significant positive correlations were found between demographic characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, family income, injury severity, time of discharge and coping patterns. Older persons tended to have more favoured coping styles, such as emotional support and optimism problem solving. The persons with high family income tended to use the coping pattern(s) of revolution/adjustment, while the patients in employment tended to use coping patterns such as emotional support, self-control and instrumental action. The married persons who used the coping pattern avoidance tended to be more seriously injured.</p>
<p>Significant positive correlations were also found between the quality of life (a) affect and relations, (b) skin involvement, (c) function and the coping patterns. Those scoring higher in affect and relations, skin involvement and function tended to use the coping pattern avoidance and those scoring higher in skin involvement favoured the coping pattern self-control.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-1744987110379301"><title>Significant negative correlations</title>
<p>Demographic characteristics, such as age, education level, employment status, marital status and injury severity accompanied with face, hand and private place burns, had significant negative correlations with the quality of life and the coping patterns. Those unemployed persons who came from a poor family and received a lower education level tended to be more seriously injured, accompanied with face, hand and private place burns. The married persons with higher injury severity were likely to score lower in the quality of life; function, affect and relation, and skin involvement and were less favoured than the coping pattern emotion support. Those with lower family income were likely to score lower in the quality of life function and those accompanied with hand, face and private place burns showed lower scores in the coping pattern(s) avoidance.</p>

<sec id="sec26-1744987110379301" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The sample contained 56 male and 36 female participants, as seen in the previous section. There were no differences in general quality of life. However, gender differences existed in the sub-domain of quality of life: affect and relations. The gender differences also existed in the coping pattern: emotional support, which indicated that women were more sensitive to relationships with family after discharge and tended to have depressive symptom; for women, emotional support was more important than it was for men.</p>
<p>These finding were similar to prior research conducted in China by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1744987110379301">Yue (2007)</xref>, which suggested that gender was relative to quality of life and coping patterns. Women were more sensitive to relationships with family members and friends after their burn(s) and were willing to accept more help from others. However, on the contrary, due to the fact that men often exhibited higher self-esteem than women, some would refuse to seek help. One contra indicating factor to this was the fact that the male was often a dominant person in the family, so males often received more support from their family than women.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987110379301">McGwin et al.’s (2002)</xref> study has suggested that female patient with burns have increased mortality as compared to men, even though oestrogen increases proliferation of the epidermis and the rate and quality of wound healing. Therefore, it is not surprising that gender was an independent predictor of outcome in trauma and, specifically, burns.</p>
<p>The results also showed that the demographic characteristics of age, employment, marital status, family income, injury severity accompanied with face, hand and genital area burns, and time of discharge were related to the quality of life and coping patterns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987110379301">Asgjerd et al.’s (2007)</xref> study demonstrated that, at an average of 47 months after being burned, the injury still interfered significantly with patient health status and work. They study also found that social factors, such as living alone or having housing or economic problems, correlated with reduced burn-specific health status. This suggested family income and emotional support from the family were important factors influencing the burn patient’s quality of life after discharge.</p>
<p>Comparing the results from this study sample with those published by other authors using the same health scale, it was observed that for the group of 115 patients studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987110379301">Francisco et al. (1999)</xref> that there were similar results. The most relevant characteristics observed in the description of the sample were the following: the long period between injury and date of interview, low percentage of body surface area burned, scant number of surgical interventions, low education and economic levels, high percentage of burns located on face, trunk, genitals and upper extremities, low psychological support and high degree of maintaining former employment. In this study, the female sex presented, with respect to the males, a lower quality of life at the psychological level without observing any significant differences physically. So, this suggests that women suffer more intensely than men from the stigma resulting from a burn, given that they are valued more highly for their physical appearance.</p>
<p>Injury severity was found to have a significantly negative correlation with function, affect and relations, skin involvement and emotional support. This was similar to the observations made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987110379301">Druery et al. (2005)</xref>. According to this study, injury severity increased the feelings of difficulty in performing complex roles, such as leisure-time activities (function), reduced perceived well-being in social interactions (affect and relations) and impaired patient perception of health (skin involvement). At the same time, for more severely burned persons, the coping strategy of emotional support was adopted more frequent. These findings suggested that injury severity creates disadvantages for social re-integration and a propensity for withdrawal from leisure-time activities.</p>
<p>In the research conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987110379301">Hamaoui et al. (2002)</xref>, age, gender, educational level and burn severity were all related to quality of life and coping patterns. In this study, women tended to be more likely to present with intense depressive symptoms. Elderly female survivors were significantly older than the male survivors and mortality rates among the elderly were over five-fold higher than in younger adults with equivalent-sized injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987110379301">Chang et al., 2005</xref>). According to our findings, and the comparative studies with works of other authors, it can be deduced that distinct characteristics are considered as factors of severity (sex, age, injury severity, etc.) that provoke, when present, a significant decline in the levels of quality of life.</p>
<p>These finding suggested that in both men and women, the most frequently used similar coping patterns were: (1) optimism and problem solving; (2) revolution/adjustment; (3) avoidance; (4) instrumental action; (5) emotional support; (6) self-control. The coping patterns were significantly correlated with the quality of life, which were similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987110379301">Willebrand et al.’s (2002)</xref> study, in which the avoidant copers displayed the lowest quality of life, the extensive copers had intermediate ratings, while the adaptive copers had the most favourable outcome. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987110379301">Willebrand et al.’s (2002)</xref> study also supported that the coping patterns of re-evaluation/adjustment, avoidance, self-control and instrumental action were positively related to symptoms, while emotional support and optimism/problem solving were negatively related to symptoms.</p>
<p>The study results contribute to an increasing awareness of the gender differences in quality of life and coping patterns of patients with burns after discharge. Further research is needed to identify which demographic characteristics and coping patterns best predict quality of life for Chinese male and female patients who have experienced burns. Furthermore, a future study, which utilises a more diverse sample taken from multiple locations throughout China, would serve to be of further educational and research significance. In addition, once relationships among coping patterns and the quality of life have been confirmed, then intervention studies would be needed to assess how to best foster positive coping mechanisms and an increased and better quality of life among Chinese burn patients after discharge.</p>

<sec id="sec27-1744987110379301"><title>Limitations of the research</title>
<p>The results of this study corroborate already existing prior knowledge about gender differences in quality of life and coping patterns of patients with burns within China. In addition, these findings support the hypothesis of quality of life related to the demographic characteristic and coping patterns. However, like any other study, this study had some limitations. Due to the use of hospitals in only one location and the fact that a non-random sample was used, generalisability of the study’s findings is limited. Secondly, as with any survey design, the investigator had to assume that the respondents were being honest about their responses. Thirdly, the instruments used in this study were developed within a western culture. It is possible that they were not completely appropriate or urbane for use on or with Chinese subjects, even though they demonstrated good reliabilities. The study was cross-sectional and, as such, the successful outcome process over time after discharge may not be as yet well understood. As no intervention was performed over the course of this study, no casual inferences can or should be made.</p>
