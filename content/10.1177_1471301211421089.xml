<abstract>
<p>Dementia continues to be under-recognized, an important issue in many countries. Policy addressing this has focused on the role of general practice-based staff, but dementia represents an area in which closer collaboration between community health and social services can reap benefits. This study examined the impact of a national policy in England, the Single Assessment Process (SAP), introduced across these agencies from April 2004, aimed at improving assessments by the use of shared procedures and assessment tools. Impact was measured in terms of the reliability by which dementia, and associated conditions, were identified and correctly detected in one area’s statutory community care assessments. Recognition of dementia, grooming, toileting and incontinence difficulties were significantly improved after the policy. Depression was an exception. Existing communication difficulties made it more likely that dementia would be identified and correctly recognized. Findings are discussed in terms of more closely involving care managers in detecting dementia.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1471301211421089" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Accurately identifying dementia remains an important concern although in many countries this aspect has posed a challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211421089">Arai, Zarit, Kumamoto, &amp; Takeda, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211421089">Black, LoGiudice, Ames, Barber, &amp; Smith, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1471301211421089">Solomon et al., 2000</xref>). Linked to the increasing availability of treatments and support, early recognition has come to be seen as vital in ensuring effective responses to the illness. However, dementia is under-recognized with, in England for example, more than half of people not diagnosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211421089">Knapp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1471301211421089">National Audit Office, 2007</xref>). Early identification may mean that more individually tailored services can be provided, which can offer benefits to the individual and their unpaid carers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211421089">Philp, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Policy addressing this issue has focused on the role of the general practitioner (GP) and primary care staff in early recognition of the symptoms of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211421089">Downs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1471301211421089">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence/Social Care Institute for Excellence, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1471301211421089">Rondeau et al., 2008</xref>). However, whilst general practitioners play a central role, not least in referral on to appropriate specialists, many people with difficulties do not approach their GP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211421089">Alzheimer’s Disease International, 2004</xref>). Moreover, in England, most people with dementia (around two thirds) are living in the community, often supported by friends and family, with the scope of possible services to respond to their needs being a mix of primary care, hospital and local authority social services, as well as voluntary organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1471301211421089">National Audit Office, 2007</xref>). Coordinating this range of possible responses is therefore crucial and dementia and its management represent a key test of how effective this coordination is.</p>
<p>Assessing dementia and its associated difficulties is complex in itself. There is a significant degree of co-morbidity in dementia and the condition often exists alongside and influences a range of other difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1471301211421089">Sanderson et al., 2002</xref>). Reliable assessment of dementia therefore needs to take into account these other problems and conditions and their effects on presentation. Different professional groups may approach recognition with reference to these other conditions as markers of the possible existence of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211421089">Manthorpe &amp; Ilife, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211421089">Manthorpe, Ilife, &amp; Eden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1471301211421089">Miller &amp; Butin, 2000</xref>). In addition, whilst the role of specialist services, such as secondary health care clinicians (old age psychiatrists and geriatricians), has been viewed as central in providing a diagnosis, other professionals are important in offering an assessment of the difficulties faced by the person with dementia and in subsequently organizing services. Given also the low detection rate and diagnosis by GPs and the lack of a defined care pathway for detection and management of the condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1471301211421089">National Audit Office, 2007</xref>), other professionals such as community nurses, social workers and occupational therapists, working under community care arrangements, may be an important source of identifying dementia at different points in an individual’s care ‘career’. This fact reinforces the need for closer working and coordination between professionals involved in the care of older people as a way of pooling assessment information, not just for early detection but also for more effective on-going recognition and subsequent management.</p>
<p>In England, these issues have been increasingly recognized and have informed subsequent policy developments. The most recent National Dementia Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421089">Department of Health, 2009</xref>) called for progress in the early detection of dementia. This policy builds upon other documents, such as the good practice guide of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1471301211421089">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE) (2006)</xref>, which reinforced the need for early identification but also an integrated approach, across health and social care, for managing the condition. An integrated approach has been viewed as important at the assessment phase. The Single Assessment Process (SAP), originally advocated in the National Service Framework for Older People (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211421089">Department of Health, 2001</xref>), aimed to develop a standard approach to assessment across agencies for all older people and develop better information sharing and coordination of assessments made by multiple professionals. The SAP was seen as necessary due to: previous disagreements between professionals on the existence of certain needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1471301211421089">Runciman, 1989</xref>); the lack of standardization and neglect of information on certain areas in community care assessments, such as cognitive impairment and mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1471301211421089">Stewart, Challis, Carpenter, &amp; Dickinson, 1999</xref>); and, importantly, a concern from patients about multiple contacts by professionals with duplication of questions and a lack of coordination between agencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211421089">House of Commons Health Select Committee, 1998</xref>). The policy was formally introduced in England from April 2004. Up to now, however, there has been little evidence of the impact of the SAP in people with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421089">Department of Health, 2009</xref>), a point particularly important to the study described here.</p>
<p>Several studies have provided evidence of the beneficial effects of closer inter-professional working, particularly at the assessment stage. Social services care managers, performing a care co-ordinating role with respect to a range of other health and voluntary agencies, have been shown to be beneficial in the care of people with dementia in one study in Lewisham (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421089">Challis, von Abendorff, Brown, Chesterman, &amp; Hughes, 2002</xref>). More recently, the experimental study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421089">Challis et al. (2004)</xref> found that integrating the assessments of social services care managers with those of specialist clinicians resulted in a further 36% of cases of cognitive impairment being recognized that were previously unknown to care managers. This intervention also brought about benefits to the older people concerned and reduced costs, particularly to the National Health Service. However, it is important to generalize from the results of such research evaluations and move towards recognition of the benefits of closer inter-professional working in routine practice. Recent polices aimed at providing a collaborative framework for the routine assessments of older people, such as the SAP, have the potential to more reliably identify a range of conditions, including dementia, and to enhance subsequent care. Policy impact studies are therefore required to determine whether the potential benefits evidenced in research studies can be extrapolated to the national picture. It is in this context that this article presents an evaluation of the impact of the SAP in a setting in which the benefits of closer collaboration and greater standardization of assessment were expected to be evident. The findings from an observational study in one English social services area are presented in terms of the extent to which the SAP resulted in a greater number of assessed (‘identified’) and detected (‘recognized’) cases of dementia, confirmed by independent standardized interview, among the statutory community care assessments of care managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421089">Department of Health, 1990</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec2-1471301211421089" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants and methods</title>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211421089"><title>Study design</title>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211421089"><title>Context</title>
<p>The study was conducted within Manchester City Council Adult Social Care, a large social services local authority. Like all local authorities, health and primary care trusts in England, Manchester was expected to have processes in place to support the SAP from 1 April 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211421089">Department of Health, 2004</xref>). These processes included: expectations of closer professional working between clinicians, social workers, nurses and others, shared recording procedures, new assessment tools, and a shared structure to the assessment process for health and social care agencies around four types of assessment – ‘contact’, ‘overview’, ‘specialist’ and ‘comprehensive’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1471301211421089"><title>Recruitment of practitioners</title>
<p>Twenty-three care managers across six teams in the area served by the authority were recruited to refer cases to the research team. The care managers were all qualified social workers responsible for community care assessments, which required co-ordinating the work of multiple professionals and care providers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211421089"><title>Recruitment of older people</title>
<p>Care managers were asked to refer to the study older people whom they considered to be at risk of admission to a care home (residential or nursing homes in England). Those eligible were older people over 60 years old and resident within the City of Manchester who had recently had an assessment under community care legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421089">Department of Health, 1990</xref>). At two time periods, reflecting before and after SAP implementation (see <italic>Policy intervention</italic> below), care managers identified older people, either recent referrals or existing cases, where an assessment had been completed. These cases were ones assessed for substantial levels of care or judged to have complex needs, with active consideration being given to care home admission. Thus, all older people referred to the study constituted an at-risk group and therefore were included on the basis of similar judgements regarding complexity or case-mix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211421089">Bjorkgren, Fries, &amp; Shugarman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421089">Carpenter, Main, &amp; Turner, 1995</xref>). These criteria were devised to encourage suitable referrals in terms of recent health or care needs that would furnish a more ‘comprehensive’ assessment under the SAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211421089">Department of Health, 2002a</xref>). A full description of the criteria has been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421089">Challis et al., 2004</xref>). The data, on the existence and identification of a range of needs, from before the SAP were available from a randomized trial of assessment practice for older people, the findings of which have already been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421089">Challis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421089">Clarkson, Venables, Hughes, Burns, &amp; Challis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1471301211421089">Venables, Clarkson, Hughes, Burns, &amp; Challis, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211421089"><title>Exclusions</title>
<p>The following groups of older people were excluded: those recently examined (within the last 14 days) by a geriatrician or old age psychiatrist (such as in hospital); those having a medical condition that was being monitored by a specialist, other than a geriatrician or old age psychiatrist, which may have been responsible for a recent deterioration in health; those with a diagnosis of a terminal illness; those already admitted to a care home as an emergency; and self-funders to care homes who were not assessed by a care manager under community care legislation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1471301211421089"><title>Policy intervention</title>
<p>The SAP was a national policy in England to integrate the assessment processes of different professionals involved in the care of older people and to offer greater structure and standardization to the assessment process. The policy involved the use of shared tools and assessment protocols. Similar policies, with different emphases, were implemented in Scotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1471301211421089">Scottish Executive, 2001</xref>) and Wales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1471301211421089">Welsh Assembly Government, 2002</xref>). Before the SAP (in this study, referred to as time 1; where data were collected between July 1998 and November 2000), assessments were largely conducted by care managers in isolation and were relatively unstructured, although in Manchester there was a range of required headings under which care managers had to detail their concerns regarding the functioning of older people referred to them and any services that were felt to be necessary to support them at home. After the SAP (referred to as time 2; where data were collected between February 2006 and July 2006) – between 21 and 27 months after the policy’s introduction – Manchester’s approach included the provision of training, a greater focus on sharing information with health colleagues and the use of a locally-developed structured assessment tool. In the latter respect, its approach was similar to the majority (66%) of local authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421089">Department of Health, 2008</xref>). The study therefore examined the impact of the policy (between time 1 and time 2) on the detection of dementia and associated difficulties, the policy’s impact at the local level being conceived of as particularly involving the effects of enhanced multidisciplinary working and the use of a more structured assessment tool.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1471301211421089"><title>Outcomes</title>
<p>The study objective was to determine whether dementia, and associated difficulties, was more reliably identified after SAP implementation than before. The primary outcome measure in the present study was therefore the accuracy of detection, measured by comparing needs (dementia and its correlates) identified by care managers with ratings of those needs by independent standardized interview at each of the two time periods, using the kappa statistic (see below). During the interview, with each referred older person and any carer if requested, researchers used: the Standardized Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1471301211421089">Molloy &amp; Standish, 1997</xref>) to establish a probable diagnosis of dementia; the 15-item geriatric depression scale (GDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1471301211421089">Shiekh &amp; Yesavage, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1471301211421089">Yesavage et al., 1983</xref>); the Barthel index for physical function (grooming, toileting and incontinence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211421089">Mahoney &amp; Barthel, 1965</xref>); and the Clifton Assessment Procedures for the Elderly behaviour rating scale (CAPE BRS) for communication difficulties and social disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1471301211421089">Pattie &amp; Gilleard, 1979</xref>). Ratings of the existence of needs from these measures acted as independent gold standard judgements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421089">Goldberg &amp; Huxley, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1471301211421089">Wachokter, Armstrong, &amp; Hartge, 1993</xref>) of the true presence of needs at the two time periods. Particular areas of difficulty were considered in different ways. For difficulties with grooming, toileting, incontinence and the presence of communication difficulties and social disturbance, separate items from the Barthel Index and CAPE BRS were scored dichotomously as presence/absence of a difficulty. For dementia, a cut-off score of ≤ 17 on the total MMSE score was used to denote a probable case of moderate-severe dementia, a relatively stringent case definition reflecting the level of cognitive impairment at which support in daily living activities becomes necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421089">Brayne &amp; Calloway, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211421089">Ely, Brayne, Huppert, O’Conner, &amp; Pollitt, 1997</xref>). Similarly, for depression, a cut-off score on the GDS of &gt; 5 was used, reflecting a case definition of probable depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1471301211421089">Yesavage, 1988</xref>). All three interviewers (PC, MA and CS) were qualified social workers and/or researchers with extensive experience in interviewing vulnerable older people and were independent of the care managers conducting assessments.</p>
<p>To obtain information on needs identified by care managers, researchers screened the assessment documents relating to each referred case within the agency. Data were extracted from the assessment document and relevant supporting information (such as correspondence) using a pro forma listing each relevant need, comparable to that contained in the standardized measures above, and whether the condition or difficulty had been identified at any level of severity by the care manager (including when this had been stated after consultation with health colleagues). A relatively inclusive criterion was used to signal when care managers had identified the existence of dementia as part of their assessments: a prompt for researchers collecting the data from records was the mention of ‘dementia’, ‘forgetfulness’ or ‘poor memory’ (but not ‘occasionally’), or ‘impaired decision-making’. Other outcomes examined, apart from the accuracy of detection, were the proportion of cases assessed as having (or suspected of having) dementia by care managers and the proportion of correctly identified dementia cases, after confirmation by the standardized interview (‘true positives’), at each time period. From these, the positive predictive values of the care managers’ assessments at each time period were calculated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1471301211421089"><title>Sample size calculation</title>
<p>We calculated sample sizes to establish the likelihood of achieving a statistically significant result in terms of comparing the accuracy of detection in the samples at the two time points. Sample sizes are difficult to estimate as there is little evidence of the extent to which needs are identified in this social services population from which to compare ratings. Given previous reports of low accuracy in identifying some needs, particularly cognitive impairment, in this setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1471301211421089">Stewart et al., 1999</xref>), a relatively conservative estimate was used. We used sample size calculations for comparing two or more coefficients of reliability, or agreement, in needs identification between the two periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211421089">Donner, 1998</xref>). To detect a significant difference, at the 5% significance level, from a coefficient of 0.20 (‘slight’ agreement) to a coefficient of 0.60 (‘moderate’ agreement) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211421089">Landis &amp; Koch, 1977</xref>), assuming the prevalence of the need in question to be 0.50, required a sample size of 83 older people in each group at a power of 80%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1471301211421089"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Descriptive statistics (means and proportions) were first of all used to summarize data at both periods, in terms of both the characteristics of the samples and the existence of dementia and associated difficulties (within-sample ‘prevalence’ from the standardized measures). These data were compared to assess the equivalence of the samples, at the two time periods, to test the robustness of conclusions regarding the impact of other factors, principally those arising from the policy change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211421089">Campbell &amp; Stanley, 1966</xref>).</p>
<p>To test the impact of the policy intervention (SAP) we then analysed each of the proportion of cases assessed (‘identified’) as having dementia by care managers and the proportion of correctly identified (‘recognized’) dementia cases, after confirmation by the standardized interview, at each time period. The accuracy, or precision, of the care managers’ assessment was then evaluated by means of the positive predictive values, i.e. the proportion of correctly identified cases among those assessed as having dementia, at each time period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211421089">Altman &amp; Bland, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421089">Goldberg &amp; Huxley, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall accuracy was then analysed by inter-rater reliabilities between social services care managers and the standardized assessments on the identification of dementia, and associated needs, at each time period using the kappa statistic (κ). Reliability refers here to the consistency of ratings (whether a need exists or not) on a specific case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211421089">Dawson &amp; Trapp, 2004</xref>). Kappa measures the degree of difference between observed agreement and that expected by chance (expected agreement) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211421089">Cohen, 1960</xref>). This difference is expressed as a score between -1 and 1, where 1 is perfect agreement, 0 is what would be expected by chance, and a negative value is agreement less than chance. However, because an unadjusted kappa value may not take account of the prevalence of need and the propensity of different observers to identify it, the maximum possible value of kappa (kappa max) was also calculated using the equation: 1 - (minimum disagreement/expected disagreement) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421089">Dunn, 1989</xref>). The ratio κ/κ max was used as a general measure denoting the degree of agreement beyond chance within these constraints. This adjusted value is useful when comparing different populations, as here, when the intention is to interpret the different degrees of agreement that may result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1471301211421089">Sim &amp; Wright, 2005</xref>). The overall kappa coefficients at time 1 and time 2 were compared for each area of need using a test statistic that follows a chi-square distribution, with appropriate probability values therefore reportable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421089">Donner, Eliasziw, &amp; Klar, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1471301211421089">Skaane, Engedal, &amp; Skjennalda, 1997</xref>). This analysis tested the hypothesis that, for each difficulty, the accuracy of detection was significantly higher post SAP implementation. We report as significant effects at the 5% level, with 95% confidence intervals reported for unadjusted kappa values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421089">Barnette, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>We also carried out logistic regression analyses to model the effects of ‘exposure’ to the SAP policy (time 2 versus time 1) on both the probability of care managers’ identifying dementia and also correctly detecting dementia (confirmed from standardized interview), controlling for the ‘prevalence’ of this and several associated difficulties and circumstances as potential confounding effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1471301211421089">McNamee, 2005</xref>). Two separate models were examined in each case: The first controlled for the prevalence of dementia and also depression, difficulties with grooming, toileting, incontinence, communication and social disturbance; the second controlled also for age, gender, marital status and residence. These analyses were to determine the effects of the changed assessment arrangements allowing for the possible differing prevalence of conditions at the two time periods; in effect controlling for the potential to first of all identify and second to accurately recognize dementia more easily if more of these difficulties were present. All analyses were done with SPSS version 14.</p>

<p>Over the pre-SAP period, after exclusions, there were 127 older people referred for whom a full social services assessment was available. Of these, 106 (83%) agreed to take part and were interviewed. Corresponding figures for the post-SAP period were 134 referrals with 110 (82%) being interviewed. The demographic characteristics of those interviewed did not differ significantly from those who refused or were unavailable for interview at both time periods (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05 for all variables).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1471301211421089">Table 1</xref> reports the characteristics of older people interviewed before and after the introduction of the SAP, showing equivalence between the samples. Older people in both periods were relatively old (a mean age of 82 years), predominantly female, White, widowed or single, living alone, and in their own homes (either owned or rented). These characteristics mirror those found in surveys of older people entering care homes, adding validity to the entry criteria for the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211421089">Cohen, Tell, &amp; Wallack, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1471301211421089">Netten, Darton, Bebbington, &amp; Brown, 2001</xref>). However, there were differences in the prevalence of some needs and conditions, with more older people interviewed at time 2 having problems with grooming, toileting and incontinence, communication difficulties and social disturbance. Probable dementia, measured by the MMSE cut-off score used here, was also more prevalent at time 2.

<sec id="sec14-1471301211421089"><title>Impact of the policy on the number of assessed and detected cases</title>
<p>In terms of monitoring the impact of the policy over time, of the 105 older people in the time 1 sample (one case had missing values on the MMSE), 35 (33.3%) were identified as possibly having dementia in social services assessments. This figure for time 2 (with five missing cases on the MMSE giving a total also of 105) was 50 (47.6%). Of these, however, the number of correctly detected cases, confirmed by the MMSE, was five at time 1 and 29 at time 2 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1471301211421089">Table 2</xref>). Thus, the positive predictive value (PPV) of the care managers’ assessment for dementia was 5/35 = 14.3% at time 1 and 29/50 = 58% at time 2. Although this finding suggests increased accuracy of care managers’ assessment post SAP, there were a larger proportion of cases assessed as having dementia at time 2 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.05). In addition, there were a larger proportion of cases with dementia (prevalence) at time 2 (37% <italic>vs.</italic>19%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.005). Of interest also is the relatively large proportion of ‘false positives’ (when care managers identified a case of dementia in their assessments that was not subsequently confirmed by standardized interview) at each time period (28% at time 1 and 20% at time 2).

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1471301211421089">Table 3</xref> shows data relating to the overall accuracy of needs identification across the two periods. In all areas, with the exception of depression, agreement between social services assessments and interview was higher at time 2. In the areas of grooming, toileting, incontinence and recognition of dementia, this difference was statistically significant. In terms of whether a case of dementia was identified, agreement at time 1 was very low. Post SAP implementation (time 2), however, the adjusted kappa values suggest that there remains room for improvement with agreement only ‘slight’ to ‘moderate’ in most areas (range 0.10–0.58). For some areas, notably depression, adjusted kappa values suggest only ‘slight’ agreement between social services assessments and the standardized measures, this remaining appreciably the same before and after SAP implementation.

<p>The results of logistic regression analyses, controlling for prevalence of dementia and associated difficulties, showed that the probability of identifying possible dementia was no greater after SAP; care managers did, however, identify the possible existence of dementia in cases where communication difficulties were present in their cases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1471301211421089">Table 4</xref>). This was the case controlling for both the prevalence of other conditions, including dementia, and also demographic characteristics. However, in terms of correctly detecting dementia (confirmed by standardized interview), care managers were more likely to recognize the condition after SAP (time 2). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1471301211421089">Table 5</xref> shows, for example, that dementia was 12 times more likely to be detected, controlling for its prevalence and that of associated difficulties. Controlling also for demographic factors, dementia was 16 times more likely to be detected after SAP implementation. The prevalence of other difficulties did not have a significant impact on detection, suggesting that the SAP had impacted positively on detection despite, and independently of, the existence of each of these areas of need. The exception was, again, the existence of communication difficulties; dementia was more likely to be recognized in cases where communication difficulties were apparent.

<p>The findings from this study confirm a general improvement in the reliability with which dementia and associated difficulties were detected within statutory community care assessments in one area after the introduction of the SAP in England. It was expected that, after this policy, assessments would involve closer working and information sharing between health and social care professionals and also a more standardized approach to collecting assessment information. All participants in this study were those at risk of entering care homes and so would be expected to meet the criteria for ‘comprehensive’ assessment within the SAP, involving a pooling of assessment information from specialist clinicians and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211421089">Department of Health, 2002a</xref>). This is the first study to examine the identification and detection of dementia after this policy initiative in England and its findings add to the evidence base and rationale for increasing the reliability with which dementia is recognized, following from other, more recent, policy documents.</p>
<p>Other studies examining this particular policy have tended to either survey professionals’ responses or to detail implementation issues. A survey in old age psychiatry, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211421089">Ferriter, Gangopadhyay, Nilforooshan, &amp; Ardern, 2006</xref>), found that referrals from GPs after SAP introduction took longer to read, were more illegible and contained less information. These changes were thought to have impaired inter-professional communication. Implementation issues arising from the policy’s introduction have included the challenge for different professionals to become aware of the existence of a range of conditions, perhaps not traditionally part of their professional brief, and to accept the assessments made by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421089">Evans &amp; Means, 2005</xref>). Moreover, the policy was a national one, expected to make an impact at the local level amongst a range of assessments conducted by professionals in different settings and designed to address several problems with the assessment process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211421089">McNally, Cornes, &amp; Clough, 2003</xref>); its impact is thus difficult to evaluate as the policy itself contains multiple processes that may be subject to variation and re-interpretation at the local level as implementation takes place. However, none of these previous studies have directed their attention to arguably the most important aspect of assessment, that of initially identifying needs and difficulties. In this respect, our findings show broad improvement after SAP introduction.</p>
<p>While the SAP did appear to improve the identification of dementia and other difficulties as part of assessments, there remain several points of note. First, the accuracy of assessments was still unacceptably low. Even though, post SAP, assessments were intended to involve the collaboration of other health and social care staff, there still remained around 25% of real cases unidentified (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1471301211421089">Table 2</xref>), despite our relative inclusive criterion for signalling when care managers’ assessments had identified the existence of dementia. Depression, in particular, was poorly identified, a fact which is of concern in the light of previous studies testifying to poor detection of this condition across settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211421089">Banerjee &amp; Macdonald, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1471301211421089">Tylee &amp; Katona, 1996</xref>). There thus remains room for improvement in these community care assessments and the contribution made by different elements in the policy’s guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211421089">Department of Health, 2002a</xref>) requires further elucidation. While the reported gains in this study are likely to be attributable to the SAP preparatory and training procedures (in particular joint training with health colleagues), the role of other aspects, such as the use of standardized tools, is harder to discern. Further work is ongoing to explore these other aspects and their relationship to impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421089">Department of Health, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1471301211421089">Sutcliffe, Hughes, Abendstern, Clarkson, &amp; Challis, 2008</xref>). Second, as an evaluation, it is difficult to isolate the effects of the policy change from other influences ongoing at the time of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211421089">Jiménez, Chaparro, &amp; Smith, 2003</xref>). Whilst the samples at the two time points were similar in several respects, some conditions, including dementia, were more prevalent after the introduction of the SAP. The reason for this may have been partly due to other policies working through to the local level, such as the Fair Access to Care guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211421089">Department of Health, 2002b</xref>), which may have led to the application of more restrictive eligibility criteria by the social services authority. In other words, the threshold to receive assistance and thus to dictate referral to care managers may have been raised thus leading to a more dependent population entering the system post-SAP. This may have made detection of these conditions more likely. However, our adjusted kappa ratings did take account of this possible confounding effect. Furthermore, regression analyses took account of this and showed a negligible effect of the prevalence of conditions on both the identification of dementia and its detection by care managers. Nonetheless, our study, as an observational design over time, could not allow for multiple policy influences and so it is difficult to conclude unequivocally that the SAP alone was instrumental in improving the detection of dementia.</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of this study, however, concerns the beneficial impact of this policy on the assessments of staff, principally from a social work background, not traditionally considered central to the detection of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211421089">Manthorpe &amp; Iliffe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211421089">Moriarty, 2002</xref>). Previously, by directing policy for early detection at the door of primary care, an important opportunity may have been missed for involving professionals who are core to the wider assessments and care planning for vulnerable older people living in the community. These professionals are well placed, not only to recognize dementia early but also to detect its presence in people who are already receiving services to assist with other difficulties. Enhancing such recognition may be beneficial in terms of referral to other professionals, such as specialist clinicians, in the assessment and management of people with dementia, where difficulties were previously unrecognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421089">Challis et al., 2004</xref>). Our analyses showed that the policy did not increase the probability that care managers would initially identify dementia as being present (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1471301211421089">Table 4</xref>). This suggests that there was unlikely to have been a general ‘Hawthorne effect’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211421089">Mayo, 1949</xref>) from the policy’s introduction; that is, that care managers may have been more sensitized to the idea of dementia being present merely by virtue of the attention given by managers or trainers in implementing the policy, and so would identify it to a greater degree. However, the policy did have an impact on the correct detection of dementia, compared with standardized interview (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1471301211421089">Table 5</xref>). Thus, even given the reservations above, this impact was a real and significant one. The findings also suggest that an important aspect to these professionals’ assessments was the role played by communication difficulties in the people being assessed. The fact that, allowing for other factors, existing communication difficulties made it more likely that dementia would be both identified and correctly recognized points to a central concern with these problems by social workers in seeking to identify the signs of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211421089">Manthorpe &amp; Iliffe, 2005</xref>). This finding has implications in terms of further training for such professionals in dementia recognition.</p>
