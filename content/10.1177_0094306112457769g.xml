<p>The specter of genetic enhancements to the human race has long captured our collective imagination. Once relegated to discerning breeding habits (or selective infanticide), the ability to choose the physiological makeup of our children (and hence, by extension, our species) has become much more technologically sophisticated, and promises to be even more effective, and more widespread, in the years ahead. Reproductive genetic technologies (RGTs)—technologies that facilitate some form of genetic manipulation of offspring—have provoked debates among scholars, theologians, and policymakers that reflect deeply held values concerning the nature of life and humanity. As existing technologies become more readily available, and as new technologies emerge that make the manipulation of human genes more extensive, RGTs are certain to become a salient social issue. At least, this is what John H. Evans foresees in <italic>Contested Reproduction</italic>. In this book, Evans attempts to map what form the future RGT debates will take through extensive empirical investigation.</p>
<p>To accomplish this task, Evans chooses to focus not on the general public, but on the <italic>religious</italic> public. Specifically, Evans has amassed data from 145 in-depth interviews from across the United States of four Judeo-Christian religious traditions: Jews, Catholics, Mainline Protestants, and Evangelical Protestants. Evans corroborates his qualitative data with a nationally representative survey in which he asks respondents their opinions on various RGTs. As a justification for this somewhat limited population of interest, Evans argues that when RGTs do become a major social issue, the stiffest opposition to them will come from those with religious beliefs that problematize RGTs, and so it is necessary to understand the religious public’s views on this topic. In addition to the 145 in-depth interviews from the four Judeo-Christian traditions are interviews with 35 respondents who have no religious affiliation. Although Evans claims that these “seculars” serve as a comparison group, the data used to support his arguments are drawn almost exclusively from his religious respondents. The “seculars” are notably absent throughout much of the book.</p>
<p>In addition to an exploration of opinions on RGTs among rank-and-file adherents (the elite of many religious traditions have already spoken out against RGTs), the other problem that motivates Evans’ research is the extent to which the merits and shortcomings of RGTs can be debated effectively in the public sphere, or whether, like abortion, irreconcilable differences in values will limit the possibility of genuine dialogue among those who support them and those who oppose them. Some theorists of public discourse have argued that a “culture war” has developed in the United States, in which two opposing sides—organized on the basis of conflicting views on moral issues such as abortion, homosexuality, and gender roles—perpetually fail to engage in meaningful dialogue because their worldviews make fundamentally different assumptions about society and humanity. The impetus for <italic>Contested Reproduction</italic> derives from a deep concern by Evans that RGTs may become coupled with other culture war issues (especially abortion). If this would occur, we would be missing an opportunity to debate meaningfully the virtues, failings, and dangers of a set of technologies that have the potential to shape drastically the course of our civilization.</p>
<p>Evans asked his respondents their views about several kinds of RGTs. He also varied the circumstances surrounding the application of each RGT, attempting to understand his respondents’ reasoning behind either their endorsement or their rejection of them. He asks his respondents about the appropriateness of using RGTs to alleviate disease, but also for genetic “enhancements” (Evans’s term) such as improved intelligence. He groups his responses into four primary categories of discourse: “embryonic life,” “Promethean fatalism,” “human dignity and equality of treatment,” and “meaningful suffering.” The “embryonic life” discourse includes the premise that life begins at conception, and so RGTs that involve discarding unwanted embryos would be considered unacceptable under this discourse. Evans links this discourse to the discourse that frames the current anti-abortion position. Because both abortion and RGTs make use of the “embryonic life” discourse, Evans suspects that, like abortion, those who consider life to begin at birth will be unable to debate RGTs with those who assume that life begins at conception. The “Promethean fatalism” discourse includes arguments against RGTs because of the power they give people to manipulate the biological makeup of human beings, a privilege reserved for God (analogous to Prometheus stealing fire from Zeus and giving it to humans). The “human dignity and equality of treatment” discourse is used to oppose RGTs by arguing that all forms of life, even the diseased or the dim, are valuable in themselves and hence worthy of bringing into the world. And finally, the “meaningful suffering” discourse is used by respondents who insist that suffering has pedagogical value, teaching the afflicted person and those around him or her how to cope with hardship.</p>
<p>While all of Evans’ respondents opposed some form of RGTs, some were more open to medical applications (as opposed to genetic “enhancements”) than others. Importantly, those more open to RGTs largely shared the discourses used by those who were more vehemently opposed to them. Evans cites this as evidence that it will be possible to debate publicly RGTs in a meaningful way: the relative proponents of RGTs and their opponents use the same kinds of arguments to talk about them, though in slightly different ways, which brings them to divergent conclusions. If proponents and opponents of RGTs can make connections using shared discourses, perhaps a consensus can be reached.</p>
<p>The relevance of this book is ultimately tied to the future of reproductive genetic technologies. Some of the RGTs that Evans discusses, such as human genetic engineering, are not yet possible. Others, like sperm sorting, have arrived but are still too expensive to be an option for most parents. If RGTs become a major social issue in the near future, <italic>Contested Reproduction</italic> will surely prove to be an invaluable resource for navigating the public debates that surround them.</p>
