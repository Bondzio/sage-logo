<abstract>
<p>Unmanned aircraft system (UAS) mishaps attributable to lack of attention to human factors/ergonomics (HF/E) science in their ground control stations (GCSes) are alarmingly high, and UAS-specific HF/E engineering standards are years away from development. The ANSI/HFES 100-2007 human factors standard is proposed as a specification for the design of UASes because of the similarity between general-purpose computer workstations and GCSes. Data were collected from 20 UASes to determine the applicability of commercial standards to GCS designs. Analysis shows that general-purpose computer workstations and UAS GCSes are up to 98% similar. Therefore, our findings suggest that the application of commercial human factors standards may be a good solution for minimizing UAS mishaps.</p>

<p>In the absence of standards for improved design of UAS ground control stations, one commercial standard could be applied to resolve HF/E issues leading to damage or loss.</p>
<p><bold>In the past decade, the use of unmanned</bold> aircraft systems (UASes) by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has grown exponentially. More than 30 types of UASes are in current use, and more than 100 types of UASes are under development or testing. The DoD’s use of UASes has increased sixfold, from about 100,000 flight hours in 2005 to 600,000 in 2011. In the same period, the DoD UAS budget increased fourfold, from $1.5 billion in 2005 to $6 billion in 2012. DoD UASes are used for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, attack, and battlefield assessment.</p>
<p>Although DoD UAS mishap rates vary between platforms, an average of 50 mishaps occur every 100,000 flight hours. In contrast, DoD human-operated aircraft average one mishap per 100,000 flight hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1064804612463215">Weibel &amp; Hansman, 2005</xref>). The DoD defines a mishap as an accident in which personnel are hurt and/or a UAS is damaged or destroyed.</p>
<p>DoD UAS ground control stations are marred by human factors/ergonomics (HF/E) problems, and their designs often fail to account for human abilities, characteristics, and limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1064804612463215">Government Accounting Office [GAO], 2008</xref>). In this article, we describe (a) the exponential growth of UASes in the U.S. DoD, (b) the alarming rate of HF/E in mishaps, (c) the need for HF/E standards to minimize mishaps related to HF/E, and (d) a proposed CWS standard that can be used to marginalize HF/E issues with GCSes.</p>
<sec id="section1-1064804612463215">
<title>Causes, Incidence, and Consequences of UAS Mishaps</title>
<p>DoD UAS mishaps are divided into four categories (A, B, C, and D) based on their severity in terms of revenue and human life, from the most costly category (A) to the least costly (D). Only the U.S. Army is required to report Class D mishaps. Studies indicate that human factors are involved in 69% of all UAS mishaps; of these, 24% of mishaps are attributed to HF/E shortfalls in ground control station (GCS) designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1064804612463215">Manning, Rash, LeDuc, Noback, &amp; McKeon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1064804612463215">Rogers, Palmer, Chitwood, &amp; Hover, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1064804612463215">Seagle, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Some researchers have shown that there are more than 10,000 UASes in the air around the world at any given time. In Afghanistan and Iraq, at least 38 UASes were in flight around the clock as of 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1064804612463215">Zucchino, 2010a</xref>). An average UAS flight mission is about 12 hours, and a mishap occurs every other day; an HF/E-related mishap occurs weekly in Afghanistan and/or Iraq. These numbers suggest that there is room for improvement. HF/E issues generally pertain to the design of the GCS interface to suit the operator, such as adapting displays, control layouts, input devices, and seating to provide comfort for the operators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1064804612463215">Manning et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>UAS mishaps cost the United States millions of dollars each year. One report showed the U.S. Air Force lost a third of its entire UAS fleet between 1994 and 2009. Additionally, the Army lost 18 UASes in 2006 and 13 in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1064804612463215">U.S. Congress, 2009</xref>). The Air Force spent $216 million to replace 12 UASes lost to mishaps in 2010. Nearly 30% of UAS mishaps were attributable to HF/E issues with the GCSes.</p>
<p>To reduce these losses, the DoD is revising critical acquisition and program-level requirements (i.e., key performance parameters). UAS system viability, airworthiness, and cost savings are now prioritized above delivery schedule and technical performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1064804612463215">DoD, 2011</xref>). In 2005, the DoD started developing annual UAS roadmaps and emphasized the need for standards and compliance guidelines for qualifying UASes. However, to date, the DoD has failed to produce a GCS-specific HF/E standard in spite of the proliferation of these craft, unusually high mishap rates (compared with manned aircraft), and increasing economic impacts. HF/E GCS standards are needed that could reduce the effects of HF/E limitations while improving the outlook for UAS viability, airworthiness, and total life cycle costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1064804612463215">Williams, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1064804612463215">
<title>UAS Types and Proliferation</title>
<p>UASes generally consist of an aircraft vehicle and a GCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1064804612463215">Pastor, Lopez, &amp; Royo, 2007</xref>). The GCS employs one of three types of UAS control mechanisms: autonomous, semiautonomous, or ground control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1064804612463215">Nas, 2008</xref>). Autonomous UASes fly a complete mission from takeoff to landing. Operators perform supervision tasks and have the option to modify the mission but cannot control the UAS directly. Semiautonomous UASes are capable of performing autonomous tasks. Operators perform supervision tasks and are allowed a moderate level of UAS flight control using a joystick. Ground control UASes are directly controlled by operators using a GCS from takeoff to landing.</p>
<p>The DoD is continuing to expand its UAS inventory and holds the largest quantity and variety of UASes in the world. The DoD categorizes them into five groups. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1064804612463215">Figure 1</xref> provides group specifics and names of some of the most commonly used UASes.</p>

</fig>
<p>Group 1 UASes use portable or handheld GCSes that employ ground control mechanisms. Groups 2 through 5 use stationary, preassembled, and/or fixed GCSes that typically employ autonomous or semiautonomous control mechanisms. Some of the older UASes in these groups also employ ground control mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1064804612463215">Weatherington, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>High UAS demand resulted from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, leading to their rapid development and deployment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1064804612463215">Baur, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1064804612463215">Zucchino, 2010b</xref>). Subsequently, lengthy processes for systems and software engineering design, development, and testing were streamlined by virtue of their overall simplicity (relative to safety-critical fighter jets, which necessitated tens of billions of dollars and decades to develop). In a recent study, the authors concluded that the military considers UAS safety very important (7 on a scale of 1 to 8, from most to least important; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1064804612463215">AeroVations Associates, 2004</xref>). All of these factors (sudden demand for thousands of UASes, rush to deployment, and lack of safety) contributed to the proliferation of HF/E issues in GCSes.</p>
<p>The GAO conducted interviews with several UAS developers and DoD officials and found that UAS development lacked incorporation of HF/E engineering in early stages of development. HF/E issues continue to persist because of lack of GCS HF/E standards, which leads to GCS layouts that are unique to UAS platforms. DoD GCS HF/E standards are needed to minimize the proliferation of HF/E issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1064804612463215">GAO, 2008</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1064804612463215">
<title>UAS Mishaps and Mishap Data</title>
<p>There is no central database that holds information on all DoD HF/E mishaps. Each branch of the military has its own mishap database, if at all, and mishap reports are often kept confidential. Some data mentioned in this study are taken from other studies, and a few Accident Investigation Board reports were obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>Another reason UAS mishaps are underreported is that many of them fall below the Class C mishap reporting require-ments established for all branches of the U.S. military. Furthermore, instances in which mishaps were nearly avoided are rarely reported. The DoD has more than 2,000 UASes in its inventory from Groups 2 to 5. The increasing use of UASes and number of mishaps have been a cause of concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1064804612463215">GAO, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1064804612463215">Table 1</xref> illustrates HF/E-related UAS mishaps from 2006 to 2007.</p>

<p>A 2006 UAS mishap was associated with the GCS interface design. The landing gear button was placed in an awkward location on the side of a joystick, and the ignition switch was placed next to buttons and switches that are frequently used during flight. Because of the awkward location of the landing gear button, it could not be pressed without having to release the joystick. As the UAS was approaching the landing strip, the operator tried to reach for the landing gear switch on the joystick while holding the joystick and mistakenly pressed the ignition switch, shutting off the engine. This was a Class A mishap and loss of a $1.5-million craft.</p>
<p>In 2001 and 2005, two individual Class A UAS mishaps were associated with GCS display mounting and lighting that caused high levels of glare which operators tried to eliminate but could not do so completely. In the first instance, a fixed support was used for mounting the display, which could not be adjusted to avoid glare. The operator misread the air speed because of glare, and the vehicle made a fast approach and hard landing, resulting in the loss of a $1.5-million UAS. In the second instance, improper lighting in the GCS resulted in glare on the display screen. The operator in this case misread the UAS landing confirmation and proceeded with an engine shutoff command while the UAS was in the air, resulting in a $4.35 million loss.</p>
<p>The DoD has endorsed the use of automation in its UASes and their ground control stations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1064804612463215">Button, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1064804612463215">DoD, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1064804612463215">Sullivan, 2009</xref>). A former pilot who teaches UAS design at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology believes that all GCS designs should evolve to incorporate automation. The new approach advocates a point-and-click paradigm versus the traditional stick and rudder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1064804612463215">Hoffman, Tilghman, LaGrone, &amp; Iannotta, 2008</xref>). The evolution of UAS GCSes from ground to autonomous control also represents a dramatic change during the last decade. Allowing the physical design and workload of GCSes to slowly evolve toward a general-purpose computer workstation (CWS) may be leveraged to eliminate HF/E issues (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1064804612463215">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In light of the changes that UASes and their GCSes have undergone, major policy issues remain. For instance, no single agency or organization, military or otherwise, bears the responsibility for developing HF/E standards for the design of UASes or GCSes. Individualized agency-level efforts to develop these standards are under way but are years away from development.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1064804612463215">
<title>Addressing the Lack of UAS Design Standards</title>
<p>UASes are often put into service without complete assessment and mitigation of HF/E issues with the ground control stations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1064804612463215">Air Line Pilots Association, 2007</xref>). A simple HF/E issue could lead to multimillion-dollar mishaps, mission failures, and/or the escape of dangerous, high-value targets. UASes may pose a direct threat to human lives and property on the ground if problems occur in populated areas. The presence of HF/E issues in GCSes negatively affects the quality, reliability, and safety of these craft and can increase design, development, and operation costs. Because of UASes’ weight, size, and airspeed, HF/E issues with the GCSes of Groups 2 through 5 are significantly more expensive.</p>
<p>UAS GCS evolution is similar to that of CWS. As CWS HF/E standards were developed for their environment, the interface layout of CWSes became more operator friendly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1064804612463215">GAO, 2008</xref>). An HF/E standard for GCSes is needed to help engineers design systems that are more tolerant of human limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1064804612463215">Dekker, 2001</xref>). Most of the UAS GCSes in Groups 2–5 that employ autonomous or semiautonomous control mechanisms in their designs resemble general-purpose CWSes. This design may open the door to the application of commercial standards to ensure the application of HF/E science in the design and development of DoD UAS GCSes.</p>
<sec id="section5-1064804612463215">
<title>ANSI/HFES 100-2007 as a starting point</title>
<p>Military and commercial computer systems have been in use since the 1940s and 1950s. CWSes similar to those for ground control of UASes date from the 1970s (e.g., microcomputers). Individualized CWSes have been the subject of intense scrutiny by cognitive psychologists and engineers for at least three decades; thus, HF/E research of CWSes is a well-established discipline. The Human Factors and Ergonomics Society (HFES), an internationally recognized nonprofit organization founded in 1957, has an American National Standards Institute (ANSI)–approved standard for HF/E engineering of computer workstations, ANSI/HFES 100-2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1064804612463215">HFES, 2007</xref>). This standard was introduced in 1988 and has been adopted in a variety of commercial industries.</p>
<p>ANSI/HFES 100-2007 provides guidance for the design and configuration of ergonomically acceptable CWS environments. It is intended for users and operators who have a need for intensive text, data, and graphics processing. It provides quantitative parameters based on empirical data and well-established HF/E engineering principles and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1064804612463215">HFES, 2007</xref>). The application of these parameters enables engineers to design components and/or configure systems that address human limitations to provide an ergonomic environment for its users. This standard has been used to design ergonomic environments for CWS-based emergency dispatch centers, factories, and power plant control systems.</p>
<p>ANSI/HFES 100-2007 may be used to evaluate CWSes in four subcategories: installed system, furniture, input devices, and visual displays. For this study, these subcategories are divided into two main areas: operator comfort (OC) and input-output (IO). OC includes installed system and furniture subcategories, and IO includes input devices and visual display subcategories. If OC and IO prove to be applicable to UAS GCSes in Groups 2–5, then ANSI/HFES 100-2007 could possibly be applied. These categories are described next.</p>
<list id="list1-1064804612463215" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>OC</bold>: OC provides HF/E engineering specifications for developers to design an ergonomic layout and a comfortable work environment. It specifies requirements for posture, arm position, viewing, work surfaces, and foot comfort. When properly applied, it reduces discomfort for operators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1064804612463215">Sauter, Schleifer, &amp; Knutson, 1991</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Moreover, OC contains requirements for lighting, acoustics, temperature, ventilation, and emissions. Appropriate lighting enhances viewing for workstation displays. Proper acoustic levels minimize unnecessary audio distractions. Proper temperature, ventilation, and emissions create a comfortable work environment. These requirements improve operator productivity and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1064804612463215">Corlett &amp; McAtamney, 1988</xref>). Because of these similarities, OC is assumed to be applicable to UAS GCSes.</p>
<list id="list2-1064804612463215" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>IO</bold>: IO provides specifications based on HF/E engineering principles to design human-friendly interfaces for auxiliary IO devices used in CWSes. IO devices addressed by this standard are a keyboard, mouse, puck devices, trackball, joystick, stylus, light pen, tablet, overlay, touch screen, and display. IO device requirements are applicable to UAS GCSes only if the devices addressed by the standard are employed in those systems.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Part of the aim of this study is to verify the applicability of general-purpose CWS standards, such as ANSI/HFES 100-2007, to UAS GCSes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1064804612463215">
<title>GCS conformance process</title>
<p>The ANSI/HFES 100-2007 standard provides component and system-level requirements that should be met to achieve conformance with the standard.</p>
<list id="list3-1064804612463215" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><bold>Component level</bold>: These requirements assist engineers with procurement of ergonomically designed components without their having to consider the entire GCS layout (prior to system integration). For example, individual keyboard, display, and furniture requirements could be used to procure ergonomically friendly components.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>System level</bold>: These requirements assist engineers in system integration. Meeting these requirements would ensure that GCSes meet ergonomic requirements established by the standard. For example, engineers need to ensure only that installation of system components (procured on the basis of component-level requirements) supports the range of acceptable configurations and clearances.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Finally, the standard provides assessment protocols for engineers to perform conformance evaluations. Conformance with these requirements would need to be reassessed when UAS GCS components are added, modified, replaced, or removed during its operational life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1064804612463215">HFES, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1064804612463215">
<title>Standards application in GCS</title>
<p>The IO category of ANSI/HFES 100-2007 specifies the ergonomic shape of auxiliary input devices that best conforms to humans, bodily constraints, and layout. Many UAS mishaps may be avoided with the application of button layout specifications provided by the standard. When designing a button layout, engineers are required by the standard to consider hand movements and extreme thumb and/or finger motions that lead to fatigue and operational failures.</p>
<p>The standard provides guidelines for selecting displays that best suit the operator and on display mounting and lighting that reduce or minimize glare. Application of ANSI/HFES 100-2007 could prevent many UAS mishaps through the installation of light fixtures or adjustable mounts to remove glare. The breadth of information contained in the standard addresses specific HF/E issues between humans and components. When applied collectively, it could ensure ergonomic operation of UAS GCSes, interface conformance, and maneuverability.</p>

<title>Method Used in the Study</title>
<p>To further the investigation of the link between commercial standards and DoD UAS GCS design, our research methodology consisted of three broad stages: UAS and operator selection, measurement instrument development, and data collection.</p>
<p>For a UAS to be included in the study, it had to fit five selection criteria: (a) The UAS must belong to Groups 2–5; (b) GCSes must be stationary, preassembled, and/or fixed; (c) GCSes must implement semiautonomous or autonomous mechanisms for UAS control; (d) HF/E must not be used during GCS configuration; and (e) an operator must be willing to participate.</p>
<p>Use of data from the public domain was a major goal of this study. We employed literature searches, analysis of conference data, professional networking, and Internet searches to identify candidate UASes. This search resulted in the identification of 40 possible UASes for inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1064804612463215">Unmanned Vehicle System International [UVSI], 2011</xref>). Project managers and engineers were then contacted, resulting in a short list of 24 UAS operators who were willing to participate in this study. A preliminary measurement instrument was shared with candidate UAS operators to aid in their decision to participate in this study.</p>
<p>A measurement instrument was designed to be completed by UAS GCS operators. Its main purpose was to clearly and objectively identify the IO devices used by GCS operators to control their UASes. This excluded standalone devices, such as communications gear. An extensive literature review failed to yield existing measurement instruments for comparative analysis and use. Research items were derived from the ANSI/HFES 100-2007 standard.</p>
<p>A draft measurement instrument was composed and cognitive interviews were conducted with GCS engineers for preliminary content validation. This procedure resulted in numerous improvements to accuracy, precision, relevancy, readability, wording, and length.</p>
<p>The final measurement instrument was divided into three categories: operator, UAS, and GCS IO devices. The latter section provided a list of most common CWS IO devices. The research items measured the degree to which CWS IO devices were used in GCS designs. We also asked operators to describe their GCS use (i.e., departure and takeoff, in-flight maneuvers, and return and landing).</p>
<p>The research instrument was sent to 16 of the 24 GCS operators for individual completion. The remaining 8 operators were interviewed in person. Because of the small number of UASes in the study, it was critical that we maximize the response rate and data validity. Remote GCS operators were gently reminded to submit their data, resulting in 12 completed research instruments from this group. A total of 20 research instruments (from the original 24) were completed, which included 12 remote GCS operators and 8 in-person interviews. The remaining four research instruments from remote GCS operators were not returned. Data came from 10 semiautonomous and 10 autonomous UASes. The complete data collection cycle was approximately 15 days. The data were entered into an Excel spreadsheet for preliminary analysis.</p>

<title>Analysis and Findings</title>
<p>We analyzed the number of ANSI/HFES 100-2007–compliant IO devices used by UAS GCS operators and found that most of those used in Groups 2–5 corresponded to those specified by ANSI/HFES 100-2007 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1064804612463215">Figure 3</xref>). This correspondence helps confirm the theory that UAS GCSes are indeed similar to general-purpose CWSes, and commercial standards for reducing HF/E issues may be applied in lieu of U.S. DoD standards (which do not exist).</p>

</fig>
<p><italic>Workstation IO</italic> refers to devices identified in ANSI/HFES 100-2007, and devices not identified in the standard are referred to as <italic>nonworkstation IO</italic>. In this study, most (if not all) devices used by GCS operators in Groups 2–5 are covered by the standard. Only one device not in the standard – a gamepad – was used by GCS operators.</p>
<p>A general analysis of each of the IO devices is shown next:</p>
<list id="list4-1064804612463215" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Display: A device used in CWSes to display text, data, and graphics (aka <italic>monitor</italic>). The purpose of the UAS GCS display is similar to that of a CWS display. It is used by the operator during takeoff, landing, and in-flight operations. One or more displays were found on all the UAS GCSes. It is an integral part of the GCS, and operators heavily rely on it for health and status monitoring, geolocation, and overall control and maneuvering.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Keyboard: A device that provides CWS users with an interface to enter alphanumeric data. Its purpose in UAS GCSes is similar to that for a CWS. It allows operators to enter preflight configurations, in-flight modifications, and prelanding adjustments. Keyboards are an important device in the GCS design and were found in all the UAS GCSes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Mouse and trackball: Devices that provide CWS users with the ability to manipulate graphical user interface controls by pointing, clicking, and other fine-grained adjustments. The purpose of these devices in GCSes is to operate computer programs, select data input fields, and make fine-grained adjustments by clicking “+” or “–”, which is very similar to that of a CWS. They are used by the operators during takeoff, landing, and in-flight operations. Mice and trackballs were found in most, if not all, of the GCS UAS GCSes. These two devices are interchangeable; however, the majority of the GCSes included both the mouse and trackball, whereas some had one or the other.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Joystick: A hand-operated stick that pivots on a base and reports its angle and/or direction to the CWS. It is similar to the center stick used by pilots to control aircraft. A joystick provides the most efficient, user-friendly, and easy-to-use means to input angle and direction into the GCSes, much like its use in a CWS. It is used by the operator to conduct in-flight maneuvers only. Joysticks were found in half the UAS GCSes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Touch panels: A touch-sensitive panel for controlling a system without the use of a keyboard, mouse, or trackball. Its purpose in GCS is similar to that of a CWS. They are very similar to the touch screens on modern-day smartphones or tablets. However, their function is that of virtual versus physical buttons, switches, dials, and other analog controls. Touch panels are used during preflight configuration, in-flight modifications, and prelanding adjustments. Touch panels were found in 25% of the UAS GCSes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Gamepad: Gamepads (aka <italic>joypads</italic> and <italic>control pads</italic>) are typically not used with CWSes but are supplied with gaming consoles such as PlayStation and Xbox. The user holds the gamepad in his or her hands to operate it with both thumbs. Shoulder buttons are often included, which can be operated with an operator’s index fingers. When used with gaming consoles, gamepads provide a means to control an on-screen object or enable the user to move through menus to make selections. Their use in the GCS is limited to surfing through menus and making selections. A gamepad is employed during preflight configuration, in-flight modifications, and prelanding adjustments. Gamepads were found in 10% of the GCSes.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As can be seen, all the UAS GCSes had IO devices that were similar to those of a general-purpose CWS. In the data collected, 90% of the UAS GCSes employed IO devices identical to the ones used in general-purpose CWSes. The remaining 10% of UAS GCSes employed 86% of the IO devices that are used in general-purpose CWSes.</p>
<p>Overall, 98% of IO devices used in the 20 GCSes examined for this study were identical to those specified by ANSI/HFES 100-2007. Given the high percentage of IO device similarity between GCSes and CWSes, it is possible that some of the IO devices used in the GCSes may meet the component-level HF/E engineering specifications of the standard. However, for GCSes to conform to the standard, the system-level specifications must be applied in conjunction with the component-level specifications, and the system must pass the standard’s assessment evaluations.</p>
<p>The gamepad was the only IO device beyond the scope of the ANSI/HFES 100-2007 standard. Gamepads were found in two UAS GCSes and were produced by the same vendor. They were used to quickly and efficiently “surf” through GCS interface menus.</p>
<p>This study also indicated that GCSes include a communications system for operators, typically a standalone system that is not an integral part of GCS controls. Operators indicated that most communications systems are set up at the beginning of the flight and are not modified until the end. Therefore, communication systems were not included.</p>
<p>The preliminary findings indicate that UAS GCSes are a derivative of general-purpose CWSes. Therefore, it might be possible to apply the ANSI/HFES 100-2007 standard to the design, development, and evaluation of UAS GCSes. Furthermore, it may not be necessary to develop a GCS standard if modern UAS GCSes are adequately addressed by commercial standards. The ANSI/HFES 100-2007 standard exists in part to reduce problems and issues associated with development of general-purpose CWSes. It also aims to improve the degree to which operators can interact successfully with CWSes. Therefore, standards such as ANSI/HFES 100-2007 may indeed prove useful for the design and development of UAS GCSes as well as for the reduction of HF/E issues and mishaps.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>With the exponential growth and proliferation of UAS technology in the early 21st century, the need for HF/E engineering of UAS GCSes has never been greater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1064804612463215">DoD, 2004</xref>). UAS mishap rates attributable to the lack of HF/E engineering in UAS GCSes are alarmingly high. Mission failure translates into an unthwarted enemy, an unmitigated natural disaster, or the necessity of putting human pilots in harm’s way. These risks are all unacceptable in today’s UAS-intensive world.</p>
<p>Therefore, the challenges are twofold. First, the U.S. Department of Defense might benefit from applying commercial standards, such as ANSI/HFES 100-2007, to the development of UAS GCSes to reduce HF/E-related mishaps. The application of this standard could help to ensure that only HF/E engineering-qualified components are selected for GCS design and that the GCS layout accounts for adequate UAS operation. Second, both the DoD and commercial industries might elect to develop UAS GCS-specific HF/E engineering standards to improve operator and mission effectiveness and to reduce issues related to the lack of consideration of human factors/ergonomics. More important, the lack of UAS GCS-specific standards should not minimize, hinder, or delay the application of commercial standards to Groups 2 through 5 of U.S. DoD UAS GCSes.</p>
<p>In summary, this study has resulted in several major findings:</p>
<list id="list5-1064804612463215" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>UAS technology has matured after more than a century of R&amp;D, and UASes now range in the tens of thousands.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>UAS failure rates are several times greater than those for human-piloted vehicles.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>GCS HF/E engineering issues continue to proliferate and cause UAS mishaps.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>UAS GCSes from Groups 2–5 are very similar to general-purpose CWSes that emerged in the 1970s.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Commercial industry standards, such as ANSI/HFES 100-2007, exist to ensure the application HF/E engineering in general-purpose CWSes.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>ANSI/HFES 100-2007 may be used to ensure HF/E engineering of UAS GCSs in Groups 2–5.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Applying commercial standards to UAS GCSs may reduce the alarmingly high rate of HF/E-related operator errors and mishaps.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The design of this study is exploratory in nature; it was designed to explore the history of UASes, the degree of their proliferation, and common problems that may be linked to ergonomics–related issues. Furthermore, it was designed to explore the scope of the ergonomics issues associated with UASes and their GCSes. The results of this study are very preliminary in nature, and they open the door to future in-depth case studies, simulations, and experiments.</p>
