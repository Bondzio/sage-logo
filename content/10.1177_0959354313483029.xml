<p>Evolutionary psychology has long been struggling with offering a graceful account of culture. Early attempts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959354313483029">Tooby &amp; Cosmides, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959354313483029">1992</xref>) were justifiably accused of reductionist and individualist perspectives on culture, with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959354313483029">Miller’s (1999)</xref> sexual selectionist account of cultural display being one of the few exceptions. Recently, however, there seems to be a renewed interest in evolutionary approaches to culture, often building on the idea of embodied cognition. One of the most comprehensive and accessible examples might be <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959354313483029">Barrett’s (2011)</xref> <italic>Beyond the Brain</italic>, which focuses primarily on animal cognition. Bradley Franks has recently added another interesting book to this growing field, looking more specifically into human culture.</p>
<p>Franks uses the age old debate between social constructionism and naturalism as a backdrop to his account. Pitting the circularity problem of the former against the reductionism of the latter, he shows how both are practically unacceptable and searches for a way to move beyond them. He argues that evolutionary psychology is prevented from giving an accurate account of the dynamic relation between cognition and culture due to its massive modularity hypothesis and the static notion of the Pleistocene as the relevant environment for evolution. At the same time, a social constructionist ontology is incompatible with naturalist thinking because its relativism does not allow for the universals assumed within a naturalist account. However, when interpreted as a psychological theory about mental states or social facts, constructionism seems a necessary part of any approach to culture. After all, most of what culture entails is widely negotiable, and thus calls for a theory of that negotiation.</p>
<p>By rejecting both ontological relativism and massive modularity, Franks reconciles constructionism and naturalism into an evolutionary account that allows the environment a constitutive role. One could say that he transforms the static <italic>Adapted Mind</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959354313483029">Barkow, Cosmides, &amp; Tooby, 1992</xref>) of evolutionary psychology into a dynamic <italic>Adaptive Mind</italic> instead. In doing so, he tentatively offers a solution to a lingering problem with evolutionary psychology: its inability to come up with a plausible account of ontogeny. Franks achieves this by applying the notion of embodied cognition to the problem. Elaborating on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959354313483029">Gibson’s (1977)</xref> theory of affordances he suggests that cognition is relational instead of representational. It is not a property of the individual, rather of the individual’s relation with the environment. Such relations have two faces. One, facing inward, is affective and motivational; the other, facing outward, is extending into the environment. The structure of the environment indicates the appropriate actions directly, without mediation by descriptive, mental representations. “Mind” is thus no longer assumed to be in the individual; rather, it is distributed across the environment, which is not only ecological, but also largely social and cultural. Consequently, affordances are also largely social, for instance, when the aspect of the environment that elicits the action is itself another person or when a public artefact or someone else’s beliefs provide a normative source of action. In such cases, the affordance is social or cultural in origin, respectively.</p>
<p>The question is how such cultural affordances become joint commitments for groups, because their inward-facing aspect ties them egocentrically to the individual. How do affective, first-person, singular accounts, turn into first-person, plural accounts, so as to enable engagement in the pursuit of joint goals? A representationalist account would assume that, while growing up, we learn that others have intentions and subsequently form representations of those intentions so that they become shared. Franks goes to great lengths to get around such an account, showing how the interplay between individual intentions seems enough to produce cultural affordances. From there on however, his account explores a multitude of directions, and becomes increasingly less decisive about leaving representationalism behind.</p>
<p>At the same time, a truly pragmatic solution can be found among the many options he explores. He just seems hesitant to defend it. We do not have to <italic>know</italic> each other’s intentions or to have shared goals; we only have to <italic>believe</italic> that others have intentional states and that shared goals do exist. In our most naïve state we even assume such states in rocks and trees. Once we assume such states, we act according to those beliefs. Combined with our primal need to belong, this assumption makes us highly sensitive to cultural affordances. For instance, the objects and people that others interact with become desirable. In our attempt to acquire and maintain membership in the groups to which we wish to belong, we pursue goals similar to those of members of those groups. As a result, convergence of those goals occurs to the extent that we can speak of joint goals or commitments. These are not shared in the literal sense, but they are joint in the sense that they are consonant. Culture then can be defined as the pattern of such cultural affordances involving normative, joint commitments to which we adhere due to our affective need to belong. These affordances are readily available in artefacts and behaviours within the cultural niche, rendering costly representation of others’ mental states unnecessary. Similarly, cultural transmission need not be about true imitation, like a representationalist account would assume; obtaining joint goals through processes like stimulus enhancement or end state emulation should suffice.</p>
<p>Such a pattern of normative cultural affordances within the cultural niche is what Franks calls “external theory of mind.” Most theories about culture assume an “internal theory of mind,” which allows us to interpret others’ mental states, so as to coordinate joint behaviour. However, we are not as good at this as we think we are. Surely, when lying in bed at night, we are able to reflect on others’ intentions, but when engaged with them during the day, truly understanding their intentions is not our forte. This leaves an adaptive gap in our theory of mind, which we have filled with an external theory of mind: cultural affordances that indicate to us how to anticipate mental states of the people we interact with. If our theory of mind was as good as it is supposed to be, culture would be obsolete; but since we are not that good at reading minds, the intricate pattern of cultural affordances is a much-needed guide to social behaviour.</p>
<p>Franks’ attempt at integration of all these perspectives is brave and should be applauded. The book is very timely, dipping into current debates and utilizing them to come up with a new angle on some very old issues. Obviously, there are kindred perspectives that he could or should have incorporated, most notably the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959354313483029">Gigerenzer (2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959354313483029">Gigerenzer &amp; Todd, 1999</xref>) on heuristics, ecological rationality, and situated cognition. This would have fit well with Franks’ approach and probably also would have offered some dearly missed pragmatic anchoring. In that regard, there is an ironic contradiction in the book. Franks develops an account that explicitly calls for a shift towards a theory of mind as being affective and anchored in the real world. However, for a book that defends such a position, it contains remarkably few real-world examples. It is highly abstract, almost to the extent that it is difficult to see how his theory applies to everyday life.</p>
<p>To me, the strongest and most noteworthy point of Franks’ endeavour is his recourse to embodied cognition. This perspective might just be the life buoy that could save evolutionary psychology from going down as yet another representationalist account. However, Franks seems reluctant in this respect. His account is explicitly based on notions of hot or affective cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959354313483029">Duncan &amp; Barrett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959354313483029">Kunda, 1990</xref>), emphasizing how descriptive representations are only part of the symbolic environment that affords our behaviour. But he also keeps his options open and suggests that there may still be a role for full-blown representations in more complex cognitive tasks. Whether these representations remain in the symbolic environment or are sneaking back in through the back door as explicit mental representation is not completely clear. Franks could have been more explicit and decisive in this respect. It would have made his account maybe less nuanced, but also much more thought provoking.</p>
