<p>School turnaround commonly refers to the process of quickly improving the performance of chronically low-performing schools. Schools under turnaround usually garner significant additional resources and are expected to reach precise achievement targets accompanied by sanctions for failure. In the USA, as defined under No Child Left Behind (NCLB), schools with high proportion of students (generally 20 per cent or more) failing to meet state standards of proficiency in mathematics or reading over two or more consecutive years will be mandated to restructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143212450270">Herman et al., 2008</xref>). Turning around low-performing schools has become a top priority of the Obama administration’s educational policy and the funding priority of Institute of Education Sciences (IES). Similar political efforts have been taken place in the UK (such as the zero-tolerance program) and Canada as well. This book gathers both qualitative and quantitative evidences from English, Canadian and US school systems and describes the enactments of successful leadership practices in the contexts of turnaround schools. In this review, I discuss the main framework and methodology of this book and then offer a brief critique of this study.</p>
<sec id="section1-1741143212450270">
<title>Main Framework</title>
<p>This book contains 10 chapters, which are organized into three thematic parts. It first describes the dynamic contexts in which turnaround leaders work (Part 1), then specifically presents evidence on what turnaround leaders do, and how they do under different stages of turning schools around (Part 2). It lastly further speaks to the challenges of sustaining a failing school once it has been significantly improved and reach high performance (Part 3).</p>
<p>
<italic>Dynamic contexts: </italic>Chapter 1 illustrates reasons for school failure. A disproportionate number of failing schools are located in high poverty areas and serve socially disadvantaged students who experience low expectations from their parents, low quality of school staff and negative student peer interactions. Accountability achieves little for these schools. In addition to demonstrating low levels of student performance and lack of annual progress, schools that are potential candidates for turnaround often experience frequent leadership turnover, poor staff morale and low levels of staff collaboration (O’Day and Biter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143212450270">2003</xref>). Therefore, these schools often lack of the internal capacity to sustain their initial gains made with considerable external assistance, and particularly lack of successful leadership that can develop high-quality teachers and motivate students to learning.</p>
<p>
<italic>Leadership in staged turnaround processes: </italic>Leithwood et al. develop the staged conception of school turnround processes in chapter 2.</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Stage 1: Stopping the decline and creating conditions for early improvement.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Stage 2: Ensuring survival and realizing early performance improvement.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Stage 3: Achieving satisfactory performance and aspiring to much more.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Then they collect empirical evidence on how specific turnaround leadership practices are enacted under different stages of turnaround. Successful turnaround leaders: (1) engage their staff in setting up a shared vision; (2) provide formal and informal opportunities to support the development of faculty and staff; (3) nature the development of norms and values that encourage staffs to work collaboratively on the improvement; and (4) support instructional programs. The successful enactment of these leadership practices in each stage of the turnaround processes would change teachers’ capacities, motivation, and instructional settings, which would ultimately change student achievement.</p>
<p>
<italic>Challenges to ‘stay around’: </italic>Once the school shows initial improvement, sustaining the high student performance over time becomes an issue. The authors outline four conditions and paths that school leaders can follow to build internal capacities to create sustainable improvement. The <italic>rational path</italic> changes the technical core of instruction and learning in the classroom. <italic>Emotional path</italic> builds trust and collaboration among school staff, and motivates them to strive for the best. <italic>The organizational path</italic> changes teachers’ working conditions, including school structure, culture, policies and standard operating procedures. The last condition considers <italic>family and community engagement</italic>.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The empirical evidence is primarily gathered from the mixed-method study in Canada and the qualitative case study in England. To encompass the American school system, the book extensively reviewed studies about school turnaround in the USA.</p>
<p>
<italic>The Ontario study in Canada</italic>: This study included two phases. Qualitative research methods were used in the phase I to generate theory and to deepen understandings about contextually appropriate enactments of core leadership practices. One elementary and one secondary school in each of four districts were selected. Semi-structure interviews were conducted with principals, vice principals and teachers, while group interviews were conducted with parents and students. Phase II used survey data to quantitatively test some first-phase findings. Data were collected from 340 teachers and 20 administrators responded to the survey in the first sample of 11 turnaround schools, and 288 teachers and 24 administrators in the second sample of 20 schools. The data analysis primarily used correlations and regression analysis.</p>
<p>
<italic>The UK study</italic>: The data collection process in the UK adopted a qualitative design and case study methodology. Data were collected during two-day visits to each of the 20 selected schools. Semi-structured interviews were used with a range of stakeholders, such as governors, school leaders and leadership teams, teaching staff, support staff, and parents. Results were analyzed by using NVivo program and grounded themes.</p>

<title>Critique</title>
<p>One of the central purposes of this book is to directly speak to school and district leaders faced with the task of turning around underperforming schools. No doubt that the authors have tailored structure and language for this book to practitioners. Additionally, this book speaks to researchers who are interested in examining leadership in turnaround schools, because it includes several multi-year cross-nation studies and well conceived theory. This is a significant book but some areas could have been improved.</p>
<p>First, despite this book being written primarily as a practice guide for practitioners, the research design and data analysis, primarily included in the introduction and the appendix, were fully elaborated. Although the authors discussed the similarities and differences among English, Canadian, and US educational systems, there is a lack of discussion on the similarities and differences in school background characteristics and local policies among the sampled schools. Without such information, practitioners cannot examine the generalizability of the findings.</p>
<p>Second, the primary evidence is qualitative and some is relatively weak in support their arguments. For example, on page 169, the authors used interview data from some teachers and teacher leaders to suggest that a few teacher leaders’ responsibilities in sharing information sharpened the school’s focus on student achievement results. However, the quotes from all of these three teacher leaders did not specifically indicate how they communicated this information to teachers and what kinds of information were provided to other teachers in formal school meetings. Without this specific information of how and what being communicated from teacher leaders and other teachers, practitioners still do not know how to employ teacher leaders to share information with other teachers, and researchers still cannot make the connection between sharing information among teachers and influence on student achievement.</p>
<p>Third, for the quantitative data analysis, although the author mentioned factor analysis and Cronbach’s alpha, they did not report the validity of the survey instrument. That is, we still do not know whether the instrument measured the intended-to-measure latent constructs. Moreover, correlations and regression analyses were reported to be undertaken, however, regression coefficients were only reported on page 211. The authors failed to present enough information on how the composite variables were derived, what the sample sizes of final analysis were and how many missing values were attributable to each variable. In particular, what was the scale of Grade 3 students’ reading scores: either scale score, or percentile, or letter grade? How did the authors calculate the changes in these students’ reading scores? The inclusion of such detail would have been valuable and beneficial to readers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1741143212450270">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Improving underperforming schools will continue to be the focus of current and near-future policy. In order to identify the solutions to low-performing schools, more studies are needed to collect more rigorous evidence on leadership and how leadership is intertwined with other aspects of turnaround efforts, such as the change in instructional programs, the efforts of building a high-quality and committed faculty team and the increase in community support. Beyond the temporary additional resources and the huge pressure from sanctions, practitioners truly need more guidance on changing the internal conditions of schools to sustain long-term improvement.</p>
