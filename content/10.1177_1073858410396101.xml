<abstract>
<p>Neuronal networks within the spinal cord of mammals are responsible for generating various rhythmic movements, such as walking, running, swimming, and scratching. The ability to generate multiple rhythmic movements highlights the complexity and flexibility of the mammalian spinal circuitry. The present review describes features of some rhythmic motor behaviors generated by the mammalian spinal cord and discusses how the spinal circuitry is able to produce different rhythmic movements with their own sets of goals and demands.</p>

<body>
<p>In mammals and other vertebrates, neuronal circuits within the spinal cord, called central pattern generators (CPGs), can produce variants of a rhythmic motor pattern, such as walking and running, or altogether different rhythmic motor behaviors, such as locomotion and scratch. A CPG is a network that produces a rhythm autonomously, without inputs from supraspinal or peripheral sources. To produce such a vast repertoire of rhythmic movements, the spinal network must be flexible, in terms of neuronal connections and properties. At the present time, the functional and structural organizations of CPGs within the mammalian spinal cord remain elusive. One important and largely unanswered question is how the mammalian spinal network gives rise to different rhythmic motor behaviors. In other words, how does the spinal cord construct different CPGs from a finite set of neuronal elements to produce various rhythmic motor tasks?</p>
<p>The purpose of this review is to compare features of two very different rhythmic motor patterns that can be generated by the mammalian spinal cord—specifically, locomotion and scratch in the adult cat—followed by a discussion of the potential mechanisms involved in generating these two rhythms. On the basis of experimental data, it will be argued that locomotion and scratch are produced by reconfiguring spinal CPG circuitry through a combination of mechanisms. The implications of reconfiguring spinal CPG circuitry on the recovery of locomotion after spinal cord injury (SCI) are then briefly discussed.</p>
<sec id="section1-1073858410396101">
<title>Investigating Central Pattern Generation: Fictive Motor Patterns</title>
<p>The study of spinal CPGs was greatly facilitated by the use of fictive motor patterns in several animal species. Fictive motor patterns refer to motor outputs recorded from nerves or ventral roots in paralyzed decerebrate animals or in isolated (or semi-isolated) spinal cord preparations. The term <italic>fictive</italic> refers to the fact that motor output is recorded without any overt movement. Semi-isolation refers to preparations where the brainstem or hindlimb(s) remains attached to the spinal cord. Although paralysis or isolation eliminates many of the complex dynamic interactions that take place during normal movement, the relative effect of specific manipulations, inputs, or drugs on central pattern–generating circuitry can be evaluated.</p>
<p>Fictive rhythmic motor patterns recorded from nerves or ventral roots are characterized by cyclic alternation between extension and flexion activities in a limb. Although the alternation between extension and flexion phases is a good basis to describe a fictive rhythmic motor behavior, it is an oversimplification because the pattern is better defined as a complex sequence of activations (and inactivations) in several motor pools. However, the pattern of recruitment of a given motor pool can generally be classified as belonging to either extension or flexion.</p>
<p>In movements that require more than one limb, such as locomotion, coordinated activity can be recorded from homologous limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1073858410396101">Grillner and Zangger 1979</xref>) and also between the fore- and hindlimbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1073858410396101">Orsal and others 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1073858410396101">Juvin and others 2005</xref>). Functionally distinct CPGs control each limb, which are interconnected via propriospinal pathways to ensure proper left-right and anteroposterior coordination during quadrupedal movements. Note that human bipedal walking is considered to share many features of mammalian quadrupedal locomotion and hence a similar neural control system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1073858410396101">Zehr and others 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073858410396101">Dietz and Michel 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Fictive motor patterns can occur spontaneously or be triggered by various types of stimulations (i.e., tactile, electrical, or pharmacological). During fictive locomotion, the extension and flexion phases correspond approximately to the stance and swing phases of walking. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410396101">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the electromyography (EMG) and electroneurography (ENG) of several hindlimb muscles and nerves, respectively, during treadmill walking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410396101">Fig. 1A</xref>) and during an episode of spontaneous fictive locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410396101">Fig. 1B</xref>) in adult cats. During both types of locomotion, the burst in the semitendinosus (St) muscle or the combined posterior biceps–semitendinosus (PBSt) nerve is of short duration and begins slightly earlier than the burst in other flexor muscles or nerves (flexors are in red). During slow treadmill walking and in the majority of spontaneous fictive locomotor episodes, the extensor activity (extensors are in blue) occupies greater than 50% of the cycle. The similarity in the sequential activation of various muscles during fictive and real motor patterns indicates that part of the pattern is centrally generated, although supraspinal signals and sensory feedback certainly play a major role in shaping the final pattern during real movements through dynamic interactions with the spinal network (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1073858410396101">Rossignol and others 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Organization of Spinal Central Pattern Generation</title>
<p>Although the structural and functional organizations of mammalian CPGs are currently unknown, they must perform two basic functions: (1) generate the basic rhythm and (2) form and coordinate the pattern of activity in multiple motoneuron pools. Spinal CPG circuitry could be composed of multiple unit oscillators with rhythmogenic properties, whereby rhythm generation and pattern formation are controlled at the same level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1073858410396101">Grillner 1981</xref>), or rhythm generation and pattern formation could constitute two separate, yet deeply intertwined, levels of the spinal CPG (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073858410396101">McCrea and Rybak 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073858410396101">Brownstone and Wilson 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1073858410396101">Whelan 2010</xref>). In a multilayered CPG organization, the rhythm-generating level is defined as the clock function of the CPG, responsible for setting the frequency (i.e., cycle period), phase durations, and phase transitions, whereas the pattern formation level ensures proper activation of motoneurons for single- and multilimb movements. As discussed later on, rhythm generation and pattern formation for locomotion and scratch share some features, but notable differences are also found.</p>

<title>Cycle Period and Its Asymmetric Regulation</title>
<p>Cycle period, defined as the time between successive bursts recorded in a nerve or ventral root, reflects movement “speed.” During treadmill walking in dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073858410396101">Arshavsky and others 1965</xref>), cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1073858410396101">Halbertsma 1983</xref>), and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1073858410396101">Grillner and others 1979</xref>), cycle period is regulated predominantly by changing the duration of the stance phase, while swing phase duration remains relatively invariant. Thus, during walking, cycle period is regulated asymmetrically, by changing the duration of one phase and not the other. It was suggested that the asymmetry in the control of cycle period is accomplished within the spinal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1073858410396101">Grillner and Dubuc 1988</xref>), by descending supraspinal signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073858410396101">Armstrong 1988</xref>), or by phasic sensory inputs from peripheral receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1073858410396101">Yakovenko and others 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1073858410396101">Juvin and others 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1073858410396101">Musselman and Yang 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine if the asymmetry in the regulation of cycle period is centrally generated, we recorded episodes of fictive locomotion, occurring spontaneously or evoked pharmacologically, and episodes of fictive scratch in adult decerebrate cats, with or without complete spinal transection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073858410396101">Frigon and Gossard 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073858410396101">2010</xref>). Cycle period can vary spontaneously during fictive motor episodes with changes primarily in the duration of the extension (i.e., extensor-dominated) or flexion (i.e., flexor-dominated) phase or by varying the duration of both phases concomitantly (i.e., co-varying). Out of 35 episodes of spontaneous fictive locomotion in 28 cats, extensor-dominated locomotion accounted for the majority of spontaneous fictive locomotor episodes (24/35 episodes), whereas covariance (6/35), invariance (2/35), and flexor-dominated (3/35) episodes were less frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073858410396101">Frigon and Gossard 2009</xref>). The “speed” of the fictive locomotor rhythm did not correlate with patterns of dominance. In acutely spinalized cats injected with nialamide and L-DOPA, the locomotor rhythm was always extensor-dominated (6/6 episodes in 5 cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073858410396101">Frigon and Gossard 2009</xref>], 14/14 episodes in 10 cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1073858410396101">Grillner and Zangger 1979</xref>]). Fictive locomotor episodes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1073858410396101">Grillner and Zangger (1979)</xref> were also recorded in acutely spinalized cats that were deafferented, which abolishes phasic and tonic sensory inputs to the lumbar CPG circuitry.</p>
<p>To determine if the observed extensor dominance in regulating cycle period could result from acute spinalization, we compared fictive locomotor episodes in 16 cats spinalized 1 or 3 months before the acute experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073858410396101">Frigon and Gossard 2009</xref>). Intravenous clonidine injection combined with perineal stimulation initiated fictive locomotion in these chronic spinal cats. Extensor-dominated locomotion accounted for 24 of 26 episodes, with one episode that did not vary and one that co-varied. Therefore, these data indicate that extensor-dominated asymmetry in regulating cycle period during walking is an intrinsic property of the spinal locomotor CPG circuitry because it does not require supraspinal or peripheral inputs, is observed in acute or chronic spinal cats, and is found with different pharmacological activations.</p>
<p>However, the regulation of cycle period is highly task-dependent, which can switch from predominantly extensor-dominated during most types of evoked locomotor activities to flexor-dominated during other motor and even locomotor activities. For instance, during mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR)–evoked fictive locomotion, the majority of episodes were flexor-dominated (22/31 episodes from 23 cats) in adult decerebrate cats, with 9 of 31 episodes displaying extensor dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1073858410396101">Yakovenko and others 2005</xref>). During fictive scratch, 20 of 28 episodes were flexor-dominated, with the rest varying with the interval between flexors bursts (7/28 episodes) or not at all with either phase (1/28 episodes). Real scratch in adult cats also appears to be flexor-dominated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1073858410396101">Kuhta and Smith 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1073858410396101">Figure 2</xref> shows episodes of spontaneous fictive locomotion followed by episodes of MLR-evoked fictive locomotion and fictive scratch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073858410396101">Frigon and Gossard 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073858410396101">2010</xref>). In both cases, the rhythm, which was extensor-dominated during spontaneous fictive locomotion, became flexor-dominated during MLR-evoked fictive locomotion and fictive scratch. In seven trials in two cats, MLR stimulation did not modify the ongoing spontaneous locomotor rhythm but replaced it with another faster rhythm. During the spontaneous locomotor episode shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1073858410396101">Figure 2</xref>, extension and flexion respectively occupied 71.1% (extensor burst/extensor cycle) and 30.6% (flexor burst/flexor cycle) of the cycle, whereas during MLR-evoked locomotion, this changed to 44.4% and 81.4%. Thus, under identical experimental conditions, the control of cycle period can switch from extensor to flexor dominance, and the percentage of time occupied by extension and flexion relative to cycle period can also change from greater extension proportion during spontaneous fictive locomotion to greater flexion percentage during MLR-evoked fictive locomotion or fictive scratch. Although fictive scratch and MLR-evoked fictive locomotion share similar regulation of cycle period, there must also be fundamental differences in their rhythm-generating circuitry because MLR-evoked fictive locomotion produces rhythmic alternation between hindlimbs, whereas scratch does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1073858410396101">Perreault and others 1999</xref>). MLR-evoked and spontaneously occurring fictive locomotor activities could reflect patterns for two types of locomotor behaviors with different control mechanisms, or electrical stimulation of the MLR could bias the regulation of the spinal locomotor CPG in favor of flexor dominance.</p>

</fig>
<p>What these studies also show is that, although there is clear bias in favor of one dominance for every rhythm, most rhythms can operate in the other mode, which could be due to changes in the “nondominant” phase. During spontaneous fictive locomotion, the extension phase generally occupies more than 50% of the cycle, whereas during MLR-evoked fictive locomotion and fictive scratch, the flexion phase is greater than 50% of the cycle. In episodes of spontaneous fictive locomotion that were not extensor-dominated, the flexion phase occupied a relatively greater percentage of the cycle compared with episodes that were extensor-dominated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073858410396101">Frigon and Gossard 2009</xref>). Similarly, during fictive scratch episodes that were not flexor-dominated, the interval between flexion phases occupied a relatively greater percentage of the cycle compared with episodes that were flexor-dominated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073858410396101">Frigon and Gossard 2010</xref>). Thus, even though the “short” phase does not necessarily become longer than the “dominant” phase, a small increase in its duration is sufficient to overcome the inherent bias in the asymmetric regulation of cycle period so that it can operate in the nondominant mode. At present, mechanisms involved in regulating spontaneous variations in cycle period are unknown but probably involve subtle changes in excitability of core CPG neurons involved in rhythm generation.</p>

<title>The Regulation of Phase Durations and Transitions by Sensory Inputs</title>
<p>Although phase durations and transitions are governed by the spinal CPG, inputs from supraspinal structures and from peripheral mechanoreceptors can alter the timing of the pattern. For example, maintained dorsiflexion of the left ankle in adult cats, which stretches ankle extensors and applies pressure to mechanoreceptors of the foot, considerably increased cycle period during spontaneous fictive locomotion by lengthening the extension phase, whereas during fictive scratch, the same stimulus had no effect on cycle period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1073858410396101">Fig. 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073858410396101">Frigon and Gossard 2010</xref>). Even episodes of spontaneous fictive locomotion that were not extensor-dominated became so with ankle dorsiflexion. In another study, the position of the hindlimb strongly influenced the fictive locomotion evoked by clonidine and/or perineal stimulation in adult cats with a chronic complete SCI performed a few weeks before the acute experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073858410396101">Pearson and Rossignol 1991</xref>). For instance, flexion of the hindlimb joints (hip, knee, ankle) prevented fictive locomotion, whereas extending the joints facilitated its generation. When the hip was extended from a fully flexed position, a slow locomotor rhythm commenced, which became faster as the duration of the extension phase decreased.</p>

</fig>
<p>Phasic sensory inputs can also alter the timing of phase transitions. In such studies, the term <italic>reset</italic> is used to define stimuli that produce an abrupt transition from one phase to another or prolongation of the ongoing phase with disruption of the poststimulation rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073858410396101">Conway and others 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073858410396101">Guertin and others 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1073858410396101">Pearson and others 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1073858410396101">Schomburg and others 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073858410396101">McCrea and Rybak 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073858410396101">Frigon and others 2010</xref>). A reset is generally taken as evidence that inputs directly access the rhythm-generating circuitry of the spinal CPG. During spontaneously occurring, MLR-induced, or pharmacologically evoked fictive locomotion in adult cats, with or without spinal transection, stimulating group I ankle extensor afferents during flexion resets the cycle to extension or prolongs the ongoing extension phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073858410396101">Conway and others 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1073858410396101">Guertin and others 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1073858410396101">Schomburg and others 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073858410396101">Frigon and others 2010</xref>). However, during fictive scratch, the same stimuli have little effect on the rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1073858410396101">Perreault and others 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073858410396101">Frigon and Gossard 2010</xref>). On the other hand, group II afferent inputs from the sartorius nerve can influence both the locomotor and scratch rhythms but with opposite effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073858410396101">Frigon and Gossard 2010</xref>). During spontaneous fictive locomotion, sartorius group II afferents reset the cycle to extension when stimulated during flexion or prolonged the extension phase but only when stimuli were given in late extension. During fictive scratch, group II sartorius afferents consistently prolonged the flexion phase and cycle period but only if the stimuli fell during early flexion. Therefore, tonic and phasic sensory inputs can strongly influence cycle period, phase durations, and phase transitions, but the access and/or regulation of these inputs on rhythm-generating circuitry are strongly task- and phase-dependent.</p>

<sec id="section6-1073858410396101">
<title>A Switch in Recruitment Pattern</title>
<p>It is thought that, to simplify the control of movement, spinal circuits are organized into “synergies” or “modules” (recently reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1073858410396101">Tresch and Jarc 2009</xref>). Synergies can be roughly categorized as extensor or flexor, although several separate synergies can be found within these two categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1073858410396101">Krouchev and others 2006</xref>). Although many muscles or nerves are active in the same synergy during locomotion and scratch, some consistently switch from flexion to extension. For instance, the knee flexors/hip extensors semitendinosus (St) and posterior biceps (PB) have brief discharges at the onset of the swing phase during real walking and also during fictive locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410396101">Fig. 1A</xref>). However, during real (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1073858410396101">Kuhta and Smith 1990</xref>) or fictive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1073858410396101">Lafreniere-Roula and McCrea 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073858410396101">Frigon and Gossard 2010</xref>) scratch, the St and/or PB are synchronously active with ankle extensors (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1073858410396101">Figs. 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1073858410396101">3B</xref>). It is important to note that the activity of St can also vary during hindlimb walking depending on the locomotor preparation used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1073858410396101">Perret and Cabelguen 1976</xref>).</p>
<p>The PB and St are not the only muscles that can be recruited differently during locomotion and scratch. Other examples include flexor digitorum longus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073858410396101">Degtyarenko and others 1998</xref>) and peroneus longus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1073858410396101">Lafreniere-Roula and McCrea 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1073858410396101">Stecina and others 2005</xref>), which switch synergies from fictive locomotion to fictive scratch. The TA muscle can also become coactive with extensors during rhythmic fast paw shake (real and fictive) in chronic spinal cats, with or without deafferentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1073858410396101">Smith and others 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1073858410396101">Koshland and Smith 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073858410396101">Pearson and Rossignol 1991</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1073858410396101">Grillner (1981)</xref> hypothesized that spinal modules controlling the activity at single joints are coupled by parallel inhibitory and excitatory pathways, which would provide the flexibility to switch the recruitment pattern from one task to another.</p>

<title>Inhibitory and Excitatory Transmission</title>
<p>Although inhibitory transmission is not required for establishing rhythm, it is critical for intralimb and interlimb coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073858410396101">Cowley and Schmidt 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1073858410396101">Quinlan and Kiehn 2007</xref>). Left-right coordination between hindlimbs during locomotion is achieved by commissural excitatory and inhibitory interneurons whose axons project to the other side of the spinal cord (reviewed in Kiehn 2010). The commissural circuitry must be flexible to enable alternating gait patterns, such as walking, as well as synchronous patterns, such as hopping and galloping. However, during fictive scratch in the adult cat, one hindlimb CPG is active, whereas the contralateral hindlimb shows tonic activity in some nerves, which was termed <italic>fictive weight bearing</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1073858410396101">Perreault and others 1999</xref>). Although the coupling between hindlimbs by commissural interneurons is fairly well understood for locomotor circuits, primarily from studies on neonatal rodents (Kiehn 2010), the reorganization of these pathways during scratch and synchronous gait patterns is unclear. If commissural interneurons are core neurons of the CPG circuitry, there must be marked changes in their activity to produce locomotion and scratch. In the majority of fictive locomotor episodes, there is a clear alternation in the discharge of homologous nerves in both hindlimbs, but in some cases, alternating activity between flexors and extensors is observed on one side, whereas the other side displays tonic or no activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1073858410396101">Grillner and Zangger 1979</xref>). The dissociation in the bilateral locomotor rhythm is observed in cats with complete spinal transection, with or without deafferentation, indicating that it is due to some intrinsic change within the spinal CPG circuitry. How this dissociation takes place during locomotion would shed more light as to how CPG circuitry is reorganized to produce scratch or a host of different locomotor behaviors.</p>
<p>Evidently, the inhibitory (and excitatory) transmission that couples limbs must be quite different between locomotion and scratch. However, there appears to be fundamental differences in the control of a single hindlimb as well. For instance, during fictive locomotion in the adult cat, Ia inhibitory interneurons send signals to motoneurons in the phase of the cycle in which they are inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073858410396101">Feldman and Orlovsky 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1073858410396101">Geertsen and others 2011</xref>). This is termed a <italic>push-pull</italic> organization because motoneurons receive an excitatory drive during their active phase (i.e., push) and inhibition during their inactive phase (i.e., pull) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1073858410396101">Endo and Kiehn 2008</xref>). During fictive scratch in the adult cat, some Ia interneurons, such as those that project to ankle extensors and flexors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1073858410396101">Geertsen and others 2011</xref>) or hip flexors and extensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073858410396101">Deliagina and Orlovsky 1980</xref>), maintain a push-pull organization. However, Ia inhibitory interneurons that project to some motoneurons, such as those innervating knee extensors (quadriceps) and flexors (PB and St), can discharge in phase with the scratch activity of their corresponding nerves, indicating that some motoneurons receive excitation as well as inhibition during their active phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073858410396101">Deliagina and Orlovsky 1980</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1073858410396101">Geertsen and others (2011)</xref> also noted that Ia interneurons with input from quadriceps displayed more variable modulation than Ia interneurons receiving inputs from hip and ankle flexors. A similar phenomenon was observed in the turtle during fictive scratch whereby motoneurons received a pattern of balanced inhibition and excitation during their active phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073858410396101">Berg and others 2007</xref>). Not surprisingly, if some agonist-antagonist pairs during locomotion become synergists during scratch, the pattern of reciprocal inhibition should also change to reflect the new modus operandi. Ia inhibitory interneurons receive convergent inputs from multiple sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1073858410396101">Hultborn 2006</xref>), which change from one rhythmic motor behavior to another, thus altering the activity of Ia interneurons to meet specific task demands.</p>
<p>Presynaptic inhibition of primary afferents can also differ during fictive locomotion and fictive scratch. Using intra-axonal and dorsal root potential recordings, it was shown that presynaptic inhibition in the adult cat was reduced during fictive scratch compared with spontaneous fictive locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073858410396101">Cote and Gossard 2003</xref>). Interestingly, in that study, presynaptic inhibition was evoked by stimulating the PBSt nerve, the activity of which, as stated, becomes extensor-like during scratch compared with flexor-like during locomotion. It might be that primary afferent inputs from muscles that switch synergies between movements are regulated differently than inputs from muscles that do not. At present, this remains an open question. What is clear, however, is that different rhythmic motor tasks appear to have specialized programs to regulate presynaptic inhibition. Therefore, task-dependent changes in inhibitory transmission, such as reciprocal and presynaptic inhibition, within or regulated by spinal CPG circuitry might be essential to produce unique features of various rhythmic movements.</p>

<title>Reconfiguring Central Pattern Generating Circuitry: Potential Mechanisms</title>
<p>The previous sections described some features of two rhythmic motor tasks in the adult cat: locomotion and scratch. One important question that remains largely unanswered is how the mammalian spinal cord can generate these two very different motor behaviors. In invertebrates, different motor patterns are achieved by reconfiguring the circuitry through changes in single-cell properties or connections between cells, thus allowing neurons to participate in the production of multiple motor behaviors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1073858410396101">Marder and Bucher 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1073858410396101">Nusbaum and Beenhakker 2002</xref>). In nonmammalian vertebrates, some neurons are specialized for one motor task, meaning that they are active during one task and silent during another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073858410396101">Berkowitz 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073858410396101">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073858410396101">Frigon 2009</xref>). Evidently, over the length of the mammalian spinal cord, the neuronal elements involved in rhythmic motor tasks that require single-versus multilimb movements, or even slow versus fast locomotor speeds, must be quite different, even though some circuits can be shared by multiple movements. It is very probable that mechanisms demonstrated in invertebrate and nonmammalian vertebrate preparations also apply to mammalian preparations, although direct experimental evidence is lacking. The following sections discuss how neuromodulation and inputs from a variety of sources participate in initiating and altering rhythmic motor patterns produced by the mammalian spinal cord and hence in reconfiguring spinal CPG circuitry.</p>
<sec id="section9-1073858410396101">
<title>Neuromodulation of Spinal CPG Circuitry</title>
<p>The rhythmic motor pattern itself is generated by fast synaptic actions of interneurons intrinsic to the spinal CPG in combination with the more slowly acting influence of neuromodulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1073858410396101">Grillner and Jessell 2009</xref>). Neuromodulators are released within the spinal CPG circuitry by intraspinal neurons or by neurons with cell bodies originating in supraspinal structures. To evaluate the effects of various neuromodulators on spinal CPG circuitry, different substances can be injected or bath-applied in various combinations and concentrations, which, depending on the neuromodulator(s), can profoundly influence the rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073858410396101">Pearson and Rossignol 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073858410396101">Cazalets and others 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073858410396101">Cazalets and others 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073858410396101">Cowley and Schmidt 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073858410396101">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073858410396101">Kiehn and Kjaerulff 1996</xref>). For instance, although some neuromodulators generate an organized locomotor pattern, others can produce coactivation of flexors and extensors within one limb coupled with alternating activity between hindlimbs, or reciprocal activation of intralimb flexors and extensors in conjunction with synchronous activity between hindlimbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073858410396101">Cowley and Schmidt 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073858410396101">1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Neuromodulators can also influence the regulation of cycle period. For example, in the in vitro neonatal rat hind-limb-attached preparation, dopamine slowed locomotor-like activity, whereas serotonin increased rhythm frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073858410396101">Kiehn and Kjaerulff 1996</xref>). Others have shown slowing of the locomotor rhythm with higher concentrations of serotonin in neonatal rats during fictive locomotor-like activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073858410396101">Cowley and Schmidt 1995</xref>) and in adult chronic spinal cats walking on a treadmill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073858410396101">Barbeau and Rossignol 1990</xref>). The strength of extensor dominance in regulating cycle period was also greater during dopamine-evoked rhythms compared to serotonin-evoked rhythms in the in vitro neonatal rat hindlimb-attached preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073858410396101">Kiehn and Kjaerulff 1996</xref>). In acute or chronic spinal cats, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) increased the frequency of the clonidine-induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073858410396101">Pearson and Rossignol 1991</xref>) or L-DOPA-induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1073858410396101">Zangger 1981</xref>) fictive locomotor rhythms in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, regulation of rhythm frequency is influenced by the type and concentration of neuromodulators present within the spinal cord.</p>
<p>The neuromodulators used to evoke rhythm can also alter the recruitment pattern of certain muscles. For instance, high doses of clonidine (&gt;4 mg/kg) in acute spinal cats induced synchronous rhythmic intralimb discharges in extensors and flexors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1073858410396101">Zangger 1981</xref>). Some changes can be more subtle. In the neonatal rat, biceps femoris (anterior and posterior heads) and St, which extend the hip or flex the knee, were always coactive with extensors with application of serotonin, whereas with dopamine, these muscles displayed flexor, extensor, or double bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073858410396101">Kiehn and Kjaerulff 1996</xref>). Remember that PB and St activity becomes extensor-like during scratch in the adult cat. Other muscles, such as rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis, and vastus medialis, whose primary function is knee extension (RF can also flex the hip), retain extensor activity with dopamine but can discharge during the flexion phase with serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073858410396101">Kiehn and Kjaerulff 1996</xref>). Thus, although serotonin is undoubtedly involved during locomotion, the presence of serotonin within the spinal cord might be a requisite to initiate and establish the scratch pattern in mammals. In fact, bath application of serotonin produces tonic activity in some flexors, which resembles the aiming phase of fictive scratch, that precedes very rapid rhythmic alternation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073858410396101">Kiehn and Kjaerulff 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, neuromodulators undoubtedly play a major role in reconfiguring spinal CPG circuitry to accomplish variants of a rhythmic motor pattern, as well as different rhythmic motor tasks. In experimental studies using various types of preparations, it is important to consider which drugs are used to evoke rhythm. Rhythms induced by different drugs, or combinations of drugs, in neonates and adults might have specialized rhythm-generating mechanisms and respond differently to supraspinal or sensory inputs. Thus, the effect of specific stimuli should not be generalized to all rhythms.</p>

<title>Selection of Rhythmic Motor Patterns: Role of Descending Inputs</title>
<p>The spinal locomotor CPG is activated by reticulospinal neurons located in the pons and medulla that receive inputs from the MLR and the lateral hypothalamus (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1073858410396101">Jordan and others 2008</xref>). Various diencephalic and telencephalic structures also project directly to the MLR and to the reticular formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1073858410396101">Grillner and others 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1073858410396101">Jordan 1998</xref>). In addition, important neuromodulatory pathways originate from the brainstem and project to the spinal cord (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1073858410396101">Jordan and others 2008</xref>). Serotoninergic pathways originate from subdivisions of the raphe nucleus and the parapyramidal region, the noradrenergic pathway from the locus coeruleus, and the dopaminergic pathway from the hypothalamus. Projections to the spinal cord are widespread, and neuromodulators can be released at specific synapses or in the environment, whereby several neurons can be influenced. Neurotransmitters are released throughout the spinal cord, and given the fact that receptor subtypes are differentially distributed along spinal segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1073858410396101">Schmidt and Jordan 2000</xref>), drugs acting on these receptors could exert very different functions on rhythm generation and pattern formation for single- and multilimb rhythmic movements. Such a complex organization within the brain and brainstem undoubtedly serves to tune the descending projections to spinal CPG circuitry to initiate and modulate locomotor movements.</p>
<p>The descending pathways involved in initiating scratch are less well understood. Scratch can be evoked in animals with high cervical spinal transection because sensory pathways from the pinna enter the spinal cord at more caudal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1073858410396101">Sherrington 1906</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1073858410396101">Power and others 2010</xref>). In decerebrate or decapitate preparations, scratch can also be evoked by electrical stimulation of the cervical cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1073858410396101">Sherrington 1910</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073858410396101">Deliagina and others 1975</xref>). Inhibitory neurotransmitter antagonists, such as curare or bicuculline, are often topically applied to the cervical spinal cord to facilitate the emergence of fictive scratch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073858410396101">Deliagina and others 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073858410396101">Degtyarenko and others 1998</xref>). Thus, it is unlikely that scratch is initiated by supraspinal structures, which indicates that locomotion and scratch are generated by anatomically distinct descending pathways.</p>
<p>Different locomotor behaviors could also depend on separate descending drives. In the <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpole, morphologically and physiologically distinct classes of excitatory descending interneurons are found within the hindbrain and rostral spinal cord, which are active only during swimming or struggling, indicating that different locomotor behaviors are mediated by separate descending drives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1073858410396101">Li WC, Sautois, and others 2007</xref>). Recent work in the lamprey also demonstrated the existence of a cholinergic system within the brainstem that can modulate the descending reticulospinal locomotor drive to the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1073858410396101">Smetana and others 2010</xref>). At present, although it is unclear if separate descending pathways exist for different locomotor behaviors in mammals, from partial spinal lesion studies in adult cats, no one descending pathway is critical for voluntarily initiating locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1073858410396101">Jiang and Drew 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073858410396101">Brustein and Rossignol 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073858410396101">Barriere and others 2010</xref>), which indicates that the spinal locomotor CPG can be configured to produce hindlimb walking by multiple pathways from anatomically distinct subregions of the brainstem. Because mammals can accomplish a greater variety of rhythmic movements than swimming vertebrates, it can be assumed that descending inputs to the spinal cord are also more complex and varied to achieve multiple spinal CPG configurations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1073858410396101">
<title>Selection of Rhythmic Motor Patterns: Role of Peripheral Inputs</title>
<p>From work on spinalized animals, it is clear that descending signals are not required to initiate locomotor activity. Most mammalian species, including mice, rats, and cats, recover hindlimb walking following complete SCI when placed on a moving treadmill belt following a few weeks of locomotor training (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1073858410396101">Rossignol and others 2009</xref>). In these animals, the locomotor pattern is triggered and organized by signals from the periphery. In adult cats with a complete spinal transection at low thoracic levels, different hindlimb rhythmic motor patterns can be generated, such as walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1073858410396101">Barbeau and Rossignol 1987</xref>), airstepping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073858410396101">Giuliani and Smith 1985</xref>), and paw-shake responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073858410396101">Pearson and Rossignol 1991</xref>), all of which have similar and different characteristics and most likely specialized control mechanisms, although these have not been systematically investigated. These rhythmic movements are initiated by different sensory stimuli. For example, following a few weeks of locomotor training, hindlimb walking is initiated when the legs make contact with the moving treadmill belt, airstepping is generated when the limbs are left pendant and the perineal region is stimulated, and paw-shake responses are evoked by dipping or spraying the hindpaw with water. Fictive scratch can also be evoked in cats with complete spinal transection at cervical levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1073858410396101">Power and others 2010</xref>). Thus, the lumbosacral spinal CPG circuitry is capable of recognizing the sensory input to reconfigure itself to evoke the appropriate pattern. In the case of hindlimb walking, this is remarkable because following a few weeks of locomotor training, a simple dragging of the foot dorsum on a moving treadmill belt is sufficient to elicit bilateral stepping with weight bearing. In all likelihood, locomotion is the default rhythmic pattern evoked by the spinal cord because it is the rhythm that occurs spontaneously following decerebration in adult cats. In other words, the spinal cord <italic>wants</italic> to walk.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, electrical or mechanical stimulation of sensory afferents within the spinal cord, dorsal roots, or peripheral nerves can initiate or modify locomotor-like activity, similar to pharmacological neuromodulation. For instance, studies in isolated and semi-isolated spinal cord preparations of neonatal rats showed that crossed and uncrossed multifunicular projections from sacral neurons activate the lumbar spinal locomotor CPG through a relay of short propriospinal neurons, which can be activated mechanically or electrically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073858410396101">Etlin and others 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1073858410396101">Lev-Tov and others 2010</xref>). Different sensory stimuli also elicit characteristic patterns of activity. In the in vitro neonatal rat hindlimb-attached preparation, evoked by applying 5-HT and <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA), or by electrically stimulating the contralateral L5 dorsal root, St discharged in late extension, prior to the onset of flexion, whereas RF started late in flexion and terminated prior to the extension phase during locomotor-like activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1073858410396101">Klein and others 2010</xref>). However, with electrical stimulation of the cauda equina, the timing of St and RF showed opposite patterns, with St discharging in late flexion and RF bursting during late extension, whereas other hip flexor and extensor muscles retained similar phasic patterns in all three types of evoked rhythms. Different compartments of multipartite muscles, such as biceps femoris, can also be recruited in different phases of the cycle during locomotor-like activity evoked by 5-HT/NMDA and by electrical stimulation of the cauda equina or contralateral L5 dorsal root (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1073858410396101">Klein and Tresch 2010</xref>). The effect of these different stimulation protocols persists following deafferentation, indicating that the involved mechanisms are intrinsic to spinal CPG circuitry.</p>
<p>Therefore, similar to pharmacological neuromodulation, electrical stimulation of afferents within or projecting to the spinal cord can alter the locomotor-like pattern. Electrically stimulating different sensory pathways might activate distinct neuronal populations involved in controlling the phase relationship of specific muscles and/or could trigger synaptic release of different types of neurotransmitters at varying concentrations, thus changing single-cell properties.</p>

<title>Reconfiguring Central Pattern– Generating Circuitry: Conceptualization</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1073858410396101">Figure 4</xref> schematically illustrates a potential framework for reconfiguration of the spinal CPG circuitry to produce locomotion and scratch in the adult cat. No functional organization of the spinal CPG network is assumed (e.g., single- vs multilevel organization), other than rhythm generation and pattern formation are separate from last-order interneurons and motoneurons, which might not be the case. The large black, green, or yellow circles represent neuronal elements (e.g., single neurons or small circuits) of the spinal cord, which are involved only during locomotion or scratch, or shared by both behaviors, respectively. In the schema, distinct descending drives that release their own sets of neuromodulators with varying concentrations signal the spinal CPG network to configure itself to produce locomotion or scratch by reweighting the connectivity of the network. Reconfiguration can be achieved by changing single-cell properties and/or by recruiting different neurons during the two tasks, as discussed earlier. Either way, the functional synaptic connectivity (solid lines that connect the circles) between neuronal elements of the spinal CPG networks are different for locomotion and scratch. The varying outputs from the spinal CPGs can recruit bifunctional muscles, such as St, during the flexion (in red) or extension (in blue) phase during locomotion and scratch, respectively. The locomotor and scratch spinal CPGs also possess specialized programs to regulate sensory feedback from the periphery.</p>

<p>Reconfiguration of the spinal central pattern generator (CPG) to produce locomotion and scratch. At rest, the spinal CPG network does not activate last-order interneurons (INs) or motoneurons, which is illustrated by a dotted CPG output. When a signal arrives to the spinal CPG network, some elements are recruited, whereas others are not, depending on the signal, which causes a reweighting (thicker lines) of the connections with the network. The signals make precise connections between descending pathways and spinal neurons and also cause the release of neuromodulators of varying types and concentrations, which can act on interneurons and motoneurons. The signals for locomotion and scratch produce two different functional configurations of the spinal CPG with characteristic output patterns that regulate cycle period, phase durations, phase transitions, and sensory feedback from the periphery, as well as ensure appropriate recruitment of motoneurons in a task-dependent manner. The soleus (Sol) and tibialis anterior (TA) are used as examples of pure extensors and flexors, respectively, whereas the semitendinosus (St) is an example of a bifunctional muscle that can be recruited in a task-dependent manner.</p>

<title>Implications for Locomotor Recovery after Spinal Cord Injury</title>
<p>Evidently, the activation of spinal CPG circuitry is a complex phenomenon that depends on intrinsic properties of the spinal cord itself and on inputs from a variety of supraspinal and peripheral sources. The configuration of the spinal CPG circuitry at any given time depends on dynamic interactions between these control systems. After SCI, some of these interactions are lost or altered, which could limit or influence the reconfiguration capabilities of spinal CPG circuitry. Moreover, SCI in itself constitutes a dramatic reconfiguration of the spinal circuitry, as synaptic connections between supraspinal and spinal structures and levels of neuromodulators are altered or lost. The supersensitivity of receptors to remaining endogenous neuromodulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1073858410396101">Harvey and others 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1073858410396101">Rank and others 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1073858410396101">Li X, Murray, and others 2007</xref>) and constitutive activity of some receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1073858410396101">Murray and others 2010</xref>) further compound changes in the functioning of the spinal network after SCI. Despite all these changes, the spinal cord, in most instances, reaches a new state that is conducive to producing a walking pattern. Undoubtedly, this new state depends on the reactivation of intrinsic spinal CPG circuitry and on changes in the interactions between remaining sources of inputs.</p>
<p>Consequently, it is not surprising that the activation pattern of several leg muscles during walking can be quite different in spinal cord–injured cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1073858410396101">Barriere and others 2010</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1073858410396101">Grasso and others 2004</xref>) compared with healthy controls. Aside from the obvious loss of inputs from supraspinal structures, one reason for changes in activation patterns could be that CPG networks that normally control various forms of locomotion, such as forward walking, backward walking, jogging, and running, begin to function in overlapping modes, as descending signals are no longer capable of producing or segregating different network configurations. Because of the varying degree of SCIs and interindividual variability in the ensuing plasticity, cats and humans can adopt individualized compensatory strategies to recover the kinematic pattern of walking.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, task-dependent changes in inhibitory transmission within spinal CPG circuitry appear critical to produce unique features of various rhythmic movements. Inhibitory reflex pathways are particularly affected by SCI (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1073858410396101">Frigon and Rossignol 2006</xref>). Abnormal patterns of inhibitory transmission after SCI might hamper the ability of the spinal cord to switch from one functional state to another, which would impair not only left-right coordination but also the capacity to smoothly transition from slow to fast walking speeds, which appear to be mediated by different interneuronal and functional networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073858410396101">Gosgnach and others 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1073858410396101">Vasudevan and Bastian 2010</xref>). Although combinatorial strategies appear to work effectively and synergistically to rehabilitate hindlimb walking after SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073858410396101">Courtine and others 2009</xref>), it is important that the stimulations (e.g., training, pharmacology, electricity) used to retrain the injured spinal cord do not produce competing patterns of rhythmic activity.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>In summary, the mammalian spinal cord circuitry is extremely rich, both in complexity and flexibility, which is good news for spinal cord–injured patients. When investigating the effect of various stimuli, such as supraspinal and peripheral inputs, on rhythm generation, it is important to clearly establish what rhythm is being studied (e.g., locomotion or scratch), as well as characteristics of the rhythm, such as the timing of certain muscles relative to others. The method used to elicit rhythm should also be carefully considered because rhythms evoked by different means can have specialized rhythm-generating mechanisms. Moreover, neonatal preparations might not reflect control mechanisms present in the adult. Only by detailing characteristics of multiple types of rhythms in neonatal and adult preparations of various mammalian species will we be able to determine how rhythm generation develops after birth, as well as how the spinal circuitry is reconfigured to produce different patterns. Future studies in mammalian preparations should continue to unravel the interneuronal circuitry involved in generating various rhythms and how single neurons, simple circuits, and large networks behave when switching from one task to another.</p>
