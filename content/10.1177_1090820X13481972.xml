<p>The demand for cosmetic surgery has increased over the past 10 years, partially as a result of these procedures becoming more publicly acceptable and desirable. British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) annual audit figures show that cosmetic surgical procedures in the United Kingdom increased from 19 per 100 000 people in 2002 to 68 per 10 000 people in 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X13481972">1</xref></sup> In the United States, cosmetic surgical procedures decreased from a rate of 563 per 100 000 people in 2002 to 526 per 100 000 people in 2011, despite a positive overall growth rate during that time period, according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ASAPS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X13481972">2</xref></sup> Despite slowed growth, the total rate of cosmetic procedures performed remains high in the United States. Global figures from the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS) showed that the 5 countries that performed the most cosmetic procedures (both surgical and nonsurgical) in 2010, ranked in descending order, were the United States, Brazil, China, Japan, and India. The United Kingdom was ranked 16th.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X13481972">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite overall increases from 2002 to 2011 in both regions, there has been significant annual fluctuation in the growth rates of cosmetic procedures. Both the United Kingdom and United States saw a significant decline in growth rates during 2008 and 2009, coinciding with the global economic recession. A few previous studies have explored possible relationships between cosmetic surgery figures and financial indicators with variable results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13481972">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13481972"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13481972">6</xref></sup> The aim of this study was to explore trends in cosmetic surgical procedures in the United Kingdom and United States and to compare these trends against economic indicators to identify any correlation between the number of procedures and the macroeconomic climate of each region.</p>

<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Cosmetic surgery statistics for the past decade (2002-2011) were obtained from BAAPS and ASAPS. The BAAPS data were based on responses from its membership about the number of procedures they have performed. The figures provided by ASAPS were projected and derived from a questionnaire sent to board-certified physicians (both members and nonmembers), including plastic surgeons, dermatologists, and otolaryngologists. An analysis was performed of both the total number and percentage growth rates of cosmetic procedures reported by BAAPS and ASAPS. Also, the number of each of 10 specific types of procedures performed—including breast augmentation, face/browlifts, and rhinoplasty—was analyzed. Estimated procedures per capita were calculated to allow some comparison between the United Kingdom and United States. The frequency of nonsurgical procedures such as injectables, peels, and lasers was available only for the United States from ASAPS data.</p>

<sec id="section8-1090820X13481972">
<title>Economic Indicators</title>
<p>We analyzed the correlation between certain economic indicators and growth rates for cosmetic surgical procedures from 2002 to 2011. The economic indicators used for these calculations included the following:</p>

<list-item><p>Consumer prices indices (CPI), which measure the change in the general level of prices charged for goods and services bought for the purposes of household consumption.

<title>Volume of Procedures</title>
<p>Despite significant growth in the United Kingdom, as of 2011, the overall volume of procedures performed was still significantly higher in the United States than in the United Kingdom.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In contrast to growth in the United Kingdom, the rate of growth for cosmetic surgical procedures in the United States seems to have reached a plateau. In 2008, Liu and Miller<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13481972">5</xref></sup> predicted, based on forecasts using economic indicators and previous data, that in the United States, cosmetic surgical and nonsurgical procedure volume would exceed 55 million in 2015. They suggested that cosmetic surgical procedures would increase annually by 5%. The trends illuminated in our study suggest that annual growth will fail to reach the predicted levels, and the recession is a likely cause of this.</p>
<p>Our study revealed some interesting correlations between economic indicators and the number of cosmetic surgical procedures being performed in each region. The UK procedural data showed significant correlations with GDP and CPI. Liu and Miller<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X13481972">5</xref></sup> also identified GDP as a significant predictive variable for determining annual growth. The US data, however, did not reveal any significant relationship. The positive correlation between GDP and CPI and cosmetic growth rates in the United Kingdom reflects that the nation’s wealth has a direct impact on expenditure for cosmetic surgery. This is a similar finding to relationships between the GDP and luxury goods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X13481972">14</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1090820X13481972">Figure 5</xref> clearly demonstrates that in periods of economic recession in which there was a decline in GDP (2008 and 2009, for example), there was a reduction in numbers of cosmetic procedures performed.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1090820X13481972-fig5.tif"/></fig>
<p>There was a significant negative correlation between interest rates and the UK figures. Duncan et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X13481972">4</xref></sup> highlighted the possibility of this relationship in a study from 2004. They reviewed the charts of more than 13 000 patients who underwent aesthetic surgery procedures between 1998 and the first quarter of 2003, noting some variation in demand for aesthetic procedures that was possibly related to national changes in interest rates. Our data also revealed that a decline in interest rates was linked with an increase in cosmetic surgery performed in the United Kingdom. This may be a reflection of potential patients being willing to spend more when interest rates are lower. However, this relationship was reversed in the United States, where an increase in interest rates had a direct (positive) relationship with the number of procedures undertaken.</p>
<p>In 2010, Gordon et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X13481972">6</xref></sup> correlated their US cosmetic surgical rates with major US stock indices such as the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones Index, and NASDAQ. They demonstrated a direct positive correlation between liposuction, rhytidectomy, and breast augmentation and these indices. Forehead lift correlated only with the NASDAQ. They also found that noncosmetic procedures such as breast reconstruction and reduction also showed a positive correlation with the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ indices. Our study, however, failed to show any significant correlation between total US cosmetic surgical procedure data and the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ indices. The US data for nonsurgical aesthetic procedures also failed to show any significant relationship with economic indicators in our study. To us, these results have several potential explanations. It could be that cosmetic surgery is no longer considered such a “luxury item” in the United States, so the rate of spending remains constant regardless of the country’s economic indicators. A lack of significant correlation with economic indices has been shown in other “luxury” sectors to represent goods or services that are essential commodities as opposed to discretionary items. The fact that the US growth rates plateaued may also reflect a possible maturity of the US market.</p>
<p>The main limitation of this study was the difference in methodology used by each organization for statistical collection. BAAPS figures are not fully representative of all procedures in the United Kingdom, since a proportion of these operations would be performed by non-BAAPS members. ASAPS and ISAPS figures are also projected figures based on the estimated number of plastic surgeons in each region and responses from a sample of surgeons within each region. These figures do, however, represent trends and hence were appropriate for the purposes of this study.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Statistics provided by BAAPS suggest a growing demand for cosmetic surgery in the United Kingdom, with a major increase (285.9%) in the number of cosmetic surgical procedures undertaken over a 10-year period. ASAPS data illustrate a significantly smaller (1.1%) increase in the number of procedures performed in the United States during the same time period. Despite this, the overall volume of procedures performed remains significantly higher in the United States than in the United Kingdom. Economic indices seem to be accurate predictors of the yearly volume of procedures being performed in the United Kingdom, whereas cosmetic surgical procedure rates in the United States seem to be independent of most economic indicators.</p>
