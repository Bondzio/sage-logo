<abstract>
<p>African Americans viewed Ghana as a symbol of black success, capability, and modernity during the 1950s and pressured the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower to attribute more importance to the decolonizing nation and its leader, Kwame Nkrumah. Black American leaders thus played a role in shifting American policy in Africa toward a more ‘middle ground' approach balancing European and African desires and also helped cause Vice President Richard Nixon's 1957 trip to Ghana and Nkrumah's 1958 visit to the United States. Such actions reveal domestic influence on international relations, black American agency and a positive outcome of racially based worldviews during the Cold War.</p>

<p>During the 1950s the path of Ghana toward independence from Great Britain inspired and energized the African American community. Even before the movement for black civil rights in the United States escalated, Ghana, and its charismatic leader Kwame Nkrumah, appeared as symbols of both black freedom and black ability to embrace modern political, economic and social systems. Such international identifications of African Americans with Ghana occurred amid a harsh climate of domestic racism and anti-communism in which opponents of social change constantly tarred advocates of racial equality with the rhetorical brush of communism. Despite the US Supreme Court’s landmark 1954 decision in <italic>Brown v. Board of Education</italic>, declaring ‘separate but equal’ racial segregation in public schools to be unconstitutional, the subsequent guidelines concerning the implementation of the decision provided no timetable and contained the unfortunately vague, and easily evaded, recommendation that changes be implemented ‘with all deliberate speed’. Violence continued almost unabated against African Americans, most notably when the brutal 1955 murder of Emmett Till in Mississippi went unpunished and when white mobs forced the first black student at the University of Alabama, Autherine Lucy, to flee from campus in 1956. President Dwight D. Eisenhower only intervened in southern race relations when Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus clearly challenged federal authority by using the state’s national guard to block the entry of nine black students to Little Rock’s Central High School in 1957. Even Ghanaian officials were not exempt from American racism, evidenced most clearly in October 1957 when Nkrumah’s finance minister, K.A. Gbedemah, was not allowed to drink an orange juice at a Howard Johnson restaurant in Dover, Delaware. Amid the struggle for racial equality, therefore, African Americans looked to a decolonizing Ghana as an inspiring example and as a symbol of black modernity. Likewise, the way such racism appeared to audiences abroad, as well as international events such as the 1955 Bandung Conference of non-aligned nations, caused a number of State Department officials, to a greater extent than other groups in Eisenhower’s government such as military officials and members of the National Security Council or the Operations Coordinating Board (OCB), to recognize the changing global environment and to realize the importance of race in the international arena. Such views also resulted in part from black American pressure and simultaneously made mid-level State officials more receptive to the views of African Americans.</p>
<p>Indeed, historians have not fully explored the content and ramifications of African American views of Ghana. While Brenda Gayle Plummer, in <italic>Rising Wind</italic>, has written an excellent overview of black American engagement with foreign affairs, she does not provide a sustained treatment of the interactions between African Americans and Ghana or, therefore, of African Americans and US officials concerning Ghana. In <italic>American Africans in Ghana,</italic> Kevin Gaines examines the lives and actions of black radicals who used their residence in Ghana to criticize ‘an American liberalism distorted by white supremacy’, but this article will analyze the symbol mainstream black leaders, those who remained in the United States to conduct the struggle for civil rights, found in Ghana. James Meriwether, in his important work <italic>Proudly We Can Be Africans</italic>, analyzes the development of transnational racial identifications between African Americans and Africa, but only claims ‘Ghana and Nkrumah became important symbols of independence and the ability to overcome’ and does not fully explore the specific way American blacks believed Ghana would reinforce the domestic struggle for civil rights as a symbol of black modernity. Nor does he provide an extensive examination of African American efforts, based on such identifications, to pressure the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower to accord more attention and importance to Africa, and to Ghana specifically. Historians analyzing American foreign relations with Ghana have gone further and explicitly denied African American agency in US foreign policy toward Africa and Ghana. Ebere Nwaubani, who in his book <italic>The United States and Decolonization in West Africa</italic> claims American policymakers cared more about trapping Ghana in a neo-colonial economic relationship with the West than about the Cold War when they dealt with Nkrumah, argues there was ‘no hint of any African-American input, lobby, or pressure in connection with Washington’s policies and behavior in Africa in the 1950s’. Mary Montgomery, who has provided a sound treatment of the tripartite diplomatic relations between the United States, Great Britain and Ghana in her unpublished dissertation ‘The Eyes of the World Were Watching’, similarly states, ‘While nongovernmental agents and citizen lobbying groups increasingly participated in the discussion of US policy toward Africa during the period of this study, I have not found evidence that these groups impacted policy formation related to Ghana’. Both deny any domestic role in American foreign relations with Ghana.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022009413481831">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet this article will argue African American pressure on the Eisenhower administration, while not solely responsible for changes in US policy, played a part in the shift of American foreign policy toward both a more favorable view of African decolonization and a deeper recognition of the importance of the continent. Precisely because Eisenhower and his Secretary of State John Foster Dulles were seldom interested in Africa during the early and mid-1950s, day to day policy development remained in the hands of desk officers and assistant secretaries in the State Department, exactly the officials who were in contact with African American leaders and who recognized black American sentiments regarding Ghana. In policy papers these men began to advocate a ‘middle ground’ approach toward Africa. While black American views of Africa were not the only influence on these officials, who had to deal simultaneously with the international Cold War environment, European allies, and other domestic groups, including segregationist southern congressmen, black opinion became an element of their thinking concerning the general orientation of US policy toward Africa. Even when officials discussed black Americans’ connections to Ghana and Africa in terms of how such identifications would orient Africans toward the USA and bolster US prestige, such conversations usually also contained a level of concern over how US policy in Africa appeared to African Americans, thus indicating black opinion constituted an element in foreign policymaking. These officials thus took into account both domestic and international factors when developing policy.</p>
<p>Although both older organizations such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and newer ones such as the American Committee on Africa (ACOA) put pressure on US officials, with the stated purpose of the ACOA being to ‘bring to our State Department and UN delegation the clear-cut informed opinions of the American people who believe in self-government for colonial peoples’, such contacts were not as systematic or as rooted in mass action as later black campaigns against South African apartheid, for instance. Yet enough African American intellectuals and activists made their views known that officials, who also read black newspapers at times, began taking domestic public opinion favoring African decolonization into account when developing policy in the mid-1950s. The important point here is that, contrary to previous analyses of US foreign policy toward Ghana and Africa, African Americans at least played a role in helping to balance the American approach toward Africa between the desires of Europeans and Africans, although, of course, black Americans urged a more significant US embrace of African aspirations than actually occurred.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022009413481831">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, the above historians have not analyzed the roots of major events in the American relationship with Ghana, including Vice President Richard M. Nixon’s March 1957 trip to Ghana’s independence ceremonies and Nkrumah’s highly publicized official visit to the United States in July 1958. This article will argue that African Americans and the racialized lens through which they viewed Ghana contributed centrally to these events. Exploring the agency of African Americans, who acted primarily due to transnational racial identifications with Ghana, in both general US foreign policy toward Africa and in specific episodes of American relations with a globally important symbol of African decolonization, reveals a black American role in foreign relations during the 1950s, the influence of the domestic realm on American foreign policy, and a way race produced positive results in the international arena during the Cold War, contrary in the latter sense to analyses by historians such as Thomas Borstelmann in <italic>The Cold War and the Color Line</italic> and George White, Jr. in <italic>Holding the Line</italic> who argue the latent racism of high-level American officials limited their enthusiasm for decolonization and nonwhite aspirations. Such sentiments were there, to be sure, but race also worked in other directions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022009413481831">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>A brief survey of African American sentiments regarding Ghana will demonstrate black American views of that nation as a symbol of black ability to embrace modernity. Horace Mann Bond, president of the prestigious historically black Lincoln University from 1945 to 1957, was an ardent defender of an image of Nkrumah and Ghana as thoroughly modern, variously criticizing <italic>The Philadelphia Tribune</italic> for suggesting Nkrumah’s sacrifice of a lamb indicated barbarism, the London <italic>Observer</italic> for arrogantly labeling Nkrumah a ‘detribalized African’, and <italic>Time</italic> magazine for a February 1953 piece portraying Ghana as backwards and primitive. In a 1955 speech at another African American institution, Howard University, Bond argued Ghana’s advance toward independence proved ‘the capacity of so-called “backward peoples” to assimilate the forms, political, social and technical, of Western societies’. At the <italic>Pittsburgh Courier,</italic> one of the largest African American newspapers, George Schuyler criticized the same <italic>Time</italic> article that angered Bond, arguing <italic>Time</italic>’s claims that Ghanaians lived in ‘holes in the ground’ did not prove they were uncivilized or pre-modern because ‘millions in Spain and Russia’ lived similarly. In April 1953 Walter White, the NAACP’s executive secretary, argued in the <italic>Chicago Defender</italic>, another prominent African American periodical:<disp-quote>
<p>One of the most annoying habits of many persons, including some American Negroes, is believing that nearly all Africans are not too far away from primitive society … Many of them have been educated at some of the leading European and American universities and the number of those seeking education constantly grows … modern civilization is itself indebted to Africa in such respects as the discovery of iron.</p></disp-quote>For White, Ghana represented modernity and civilization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022009413481831">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps a 9 March 1957 editorial in the <italic>Courier</italic>, celebrating Ghana’s official independence that had occurred two days prior, best exemplified black American views of how the new nation would reinforce the struggle for civil rights in the United States. After noting many of the ancestors of American blacks had come from Ghana, the editors claimed Ghana would provide positive answers to the questions, ‘Are American Negroes an inferior people? Can they meet the full challenge of modern, Western civilization?’ The editors then reached the conclusion:<disp-quote>
<p>Ghana’s contributions, as a free nation, to peace, to art, to industry, to government, will be regarded by American Negroes as symbols of their own worth and potential. When we, American Negroes, shake hands with Ghana today, we say not only ‘Welcome!’ but also, ‘Your opportunity to prove yourself is our opportunity to prove ourselves’.</p></disp-quote>By demonstrating black ability to embrace modernity, Ghana would undermine racist arguments that black inferiority would lead to racial and social chaos should either independence or civil rights be given rapidly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022009413481831">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two final quotes from the leftist secretary of the Council on African Affairs, W. Alphaeus Hunton, and the politically mainstream professor at Howard University, Rayford Logan, will indicate the longevity and breadth of African American enthusiasm for Ghana and Africa. In 1950 Hunton argued black American pressure for African decolonization was:<disp-quote>
<p>A matter of helping the African people because in doing this we further the possibility of their being able to help us in our struggles here in the United States. Can you not envision what a powerful influence a free West Indies or a free West Africa would be upon American democracy?</p></disp-quote>A decade later Logan worried if newly independent black nations should fall into anarchy ‘die-hard racists will then be able to say: “I told you so; African Negroes are incapable of governing themselves”. And they would almost certainly add: “American Negroes should therefore not be permitted to become first-class citizens”’. These are but a few of the examples indicating how Ghana, the first black African nation to achieve independence, held vast importance in the eyes of African Americans as a symbol of black ability to embrace modernity that would help convince whites who, based on either indifference or racism, feared racial and social chaos upon the granting of full black civil rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022009413481831">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>As early as 1951 African Americans were acting on such identifications to pressure the federal government to accord more importance to Nkrumah. On 30 March Bond contacted the State Department to notify them Nkrumah, who had just achieved electoral victory in Ghana, would be visiting his alma mater, Lincoln University, to receive an honorary degree. Bond told the Department he believed Nkrumah’s trip would ‘provide an opportunity to cement the relations’ between the United States and Ghana and therefore he wanted to ‘respectfully call this event to your attention’. Director of the Office of African Affairs (OAA) Elmer Bourgerie, who fielded Bond’s request, told Assistant Secretary of State for the Near East, South Asia and Africa (NEA) George McGhee, ‘It would be desirable to accord him [Nkrumah] some form of recognition during his unofficial visit to the United States’. Bourgerie then wrote to Bond, ‘The Department appreciates your thoughtfulness in bringing this matter to its attention’, using language indicating the State Department had no plans to host Nkrumah in any way before Bond’s letter. Yet when Nkrumah arrived in June 1951 the Department held an official luncheon for him. A prominent African American had thus successfully pressured the government to attach more importance to an emerging African leader.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0022009413481831">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Two years later Ghanaian officials were in Canada to obtain funding for Nkrumah’s favored industrialization project, a hydro-electric dam on the Volta River, and Bond again contacted the State Department. Bond told the new OAA Director, John Utter, that he believed a visit by the Ghanaian officials to the United States ‘would be of incalculable value in the furtherance of good relations between the United States and all of Africa’. Unfortunately, Bond related, he had heard from contacts in Ghana ‘were it not for the resentment of the African toward America for alleged mistreatment of their Americo-African brethren, no other power in the world could compete’ for the allegiance of Africans. Bond was notifying the Department that domestic race relations had undermined American prestige abroad and he was concerned the government might miss an ‘opportunity’ to improve US–African relations. Although Utter agreed having Nkrumah’s officials nearby was ‘an excellent opportunity’ and ‘would be advantageous in helping to clear up certain misconceptions which some members may have about the United States and also in further cementing relations between the Gold Coast and this country’, no funds existed to sponsor the trip officially. Utter could only promise the Department would meet with the Ghanaians if Bond was able to get them to Washington on his own. Yet Eisenhower’s policymakers clearly recognized the racial ties between African Americans and Ghanaians because when Air Force Colonel Bryon Enyart, the Acting Assistant Director for Plans for Eisenhower’s Psychological Strategy Board, learned of the proximity of the same Ghanaians, he told the Deputy Executive Director of the OCB, Edward Lilly, that he believed ‘one or more prominent Negro educators’ could be used as guides for Nkrumah’s officials to show them evidence of progress in American race relations. In the end the Ghanaians never arrived in the United States in 1953, but an African American leader had notified policymakers of both the negative effect of segregation on the American image abroad and the need to pay more attention to African officials.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0022009413481831">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>African American leaders also sought to bring Nkrumah himself to the United States in 1953. In April of that year Clarence Mitchell, the director of the NAACP’s branch in Washington, DC, telephoned Nicholas Feld, the Officer in Charge of West, Central and East African Affairs, to tell him although Pan American Airways would fly Nkrumah to the United States to speak at the NAACP’s annual convention for free, the airline had requested ‘a declaration from the State Department declaring that the trip is in “the national interest of the United States”’. Feld believed the trip a good idea, but told Mitchell he did ‘not see why it is necessary’ to put such a label on the visit. Feld recorded in a memorandum he wrote on the conversation that he believed ‘the NAACP would write to the Department, probably to Assistant Secretary [of State for NEA, Henry] Byroade’. The organization did just that, according to James Meriwether, who relates that OAA Director Utter told Byroade of the ‘“increasing pressure … from various quarters, including certain American Negroes in positions of some influence, to strengthen our ties with the Gold Coast”’. Considering the inquiry a ‘test’ by black leaders, the Department eventually provided the statement to Pan American. Although Nkrumah never visited the United States in 1953, African Americans had once again convinced the State Department to accord the potential visitor a higher level of importance than previously planned by policymakers by declaring the visit of an African leader to be in ‘the national interest of the United States’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0022009413481831">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>A similar June 1953 attempt by A. Philip Randolph, head of the prominent African American union the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, to influence State Department attitudes on Africa further revealed the recognition by US officials of black public opinion. Randolph wrote to Eisenhower concerning an upcoming conference between the United States, Great Britain and France, urging him to condemn racism and apartheid in Africa. Randolph eloquently asked ‘that the leaders of the Western democracies and, especially, the United States … stand definitely against colonialism and all its evil works’. When Randolph sent a second letter three weeks later, OAA Director Utter responded politely, but evasively. More revealing were Utter’s comments to the protocol officer, a Mr. Simmons, that while Randolph, according to Utter, did not fully understand all ‘the complex of factors’ US officials dealt with when developing policy, he was one of the ‘influential citizens whom it is desirable not to offend’. The exchange revealed that a mid-level official in the State Department was aware of, and indeed wary of upsetting, black public opinion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0022009413481831">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition to early successes in encouraging mid-level US officials to pay more attention to Ghana and to recognize the importance of race, there were also direct personal interactions between African Americans and those officials. In March 1955, for instance, Dr. Weldemar Campbell, a State Department Foreign Affairs Specialist on British Commonwealth and Colonial Affairs, delivered a lecture at Howard University, a prestigious African American institution, as part of a series, which included Rayford Logan and Horace Mann Bond, entitled, ‘Criteria for New Self-Governing Countries’. The most prominent encounter occurred in October 1955 when the State Department invited a number of private individuals and organizations, including African American leaders such as Bond and Howard University’s Director of African Studies E. Franklin Frazier, to a conference on sub-Saharan Africa. Twelve officials from the State Department, including OAA Deputy Director Fred Hadsel and the new Assistant Secretary of State for NEA George Allen, attended the conference along with Department of Commerce and United States Information Agency officials. The conference addressed decolonization, information programs, economic assistance, and general US foreign policy in Africa, ending with a discussion titled ‘The Prospects of United States Policy’. No transcript of the discussions at the conference is available, but African Americans were in close contact with US officials and had likely directly discussed issues of American foreign policy toward Africa with policymakers. In a sign of the increasing importance the State Department was according Africa, before the event took place Hadsel told other US officials, ‘Allen has enthusiastically approved the idea of this conference’. Overall, the written and personal interactions between African American leaders and US officials, which regarding Ghana stretched back to 1951, ensured the latter would have the ideas and concerns of the former in mind when the time came to revise US policy toward Africa in late 1955 and early 1956.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0022009413481831">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>In such policy deliberations African Americans would be one of the factors pressuring US officials to adopt a firmer stance on African decolonization. First, in August 1955 Assistant Secretary Allen delivered to Secretary Dulles a paper drafted by Hadsel, an OAA official who had been in contact with African Americans, which recommended ‘the development of a more independent policy in Africa’ and suggested shedding a ‘“me too” attitude in respect to the colonial powers’ in exchange for:<disp-quote>
<p>supporting a multi-racial approach to the problems of Africa South of the Sahara. Any course of action would, in the long run, meet with such domestic opposition within the United States that it would be next to impossible to carry out.</p></disp-quote>Later in 1955 other US officials recommended shifting policy ‘toward more of a middle ground’ in part because of ‘the possibility of internal political pressures within the United States’. Finally, in early 1956 Mason Sears, the US official on the United Nations Trusteeship Council, wanted to integrate Fourth of July celebrations at US embassies in Africa because, in part, it ‘would please many citizens of the United States, and a careful program should be worked out to see to it that American opinion be informed of this decision’. During the mid-1950s African Americans constituted a substantial segment of the domestic audience for US policy on Africa and mid-level US officials thus noted the role of black public opinion when they mentioned the pressure they felt from domestic public opinion, especially when worrying policy on Africa would be ‘next to impossible to carry out’ without support from the groups paying attention to Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0022009413481831">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>American policymakers also at times explicitly discussed the affinity of African Americans for Africa during the mid-1950s. In December 1955 Assistant Secretary Allen told Secretary Dulles:<disp-quote>
<p>American Negroes are beginning to look on Africa south of the Sahara with somewhat the same kind of sympathy and interest as American Zionists look on Israel. We should capitalize on this sentiment, utilizing it to work towards evolution rather than revolution in Africa. American Negroes, who are our best hope of keeping Africa oriented towards the United States, are anxious for the Department to help in the improvement of economic conditions in Africa and would be very upset by a decision against any technical assistance programs there.</p></disp-quote>While Allen clearly privileged an anticommunist Cold War outlook in his desire to use African Americans to keep Africa oriented toward the West, his statement black Americans ‘would be very upset’ indicated the pressure he felt from black public opinion. Similarly, in a March 1956 report titled ‘Africa: Problems of United States Policy’, State Department officials believed ‘the rising concern and sympathy of American negroes (and whites) for Africans in conditions of poverty, ignorance and colonial dependency is beginning to emerge as an element of domestic politics’. The report went on to note African Americans ‘could often reach the African better than anyone of white complexion’ and declared American blacks ‘a source of potential strength in our relations with Africa’, once again indicating mid-level officials recognized the racial ties between African Americans and Africa. The realization that such transnational racial identifications were influencing domestic politics also indicated the pressure felt by mid-level officials who were aware of, and took into account, domestic public opinion when drafting policy papers, including, most importantly, recommendations that US African policy move toward a ‘middle ground’ approach to the continent. In addition, African American pressure concerning Africa clearly affected Assistant Secretary Allen, who had ‘enthusiastically approved’ a conference on US policy in Africa that included black American leaders. As shown above, during the mid-1950s such black pressure was based overwhelmingly on the transnational racial identification of African Americans with Ghana. While African Americans were certainly not the only, or even the strongest, influence on policymaking, US officials did take into account black public opinion when considering changes in US policy toward Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0022009413481831">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>African Americans were also directly involved in causing some of the most important high-level interactions between US officials and Nkrumah during the 1950s. Historians of US–African relations usually claim, or at least imply, that Vice President Nixon played an important role in shifting American policy in Africa towards a ‘middle ground’ after he attended the independence ceremonies in Ghana in March 1957. Regarding such policy James Meriwether writes, ‘Yet perhaps the most significant measure of symbolic and substantive change was sending Vice President Nixon to represent the United States at the independence celebrations of the new nation of Ghana’. Thomas Borstelmann represents those historians who generally assume Nixon’s primary role in altering US policy when he notes Nixon ‘came home to promote greater US attention to that continent [Africa]’, without exploring why Nixon traveled to Accra in the first place. One historian, George White, Jr., has recently de-centered Nixon from such narratives by arguing mid-level State Department officials led the gradual shift in policy due to a variety of reasons, including bureaucratic drives for more funds and more authority. While White mentions contacts between African American leaders and US officials, he does so only briefly and does not discuss the root of Nixon’s presence in Accra. In the end, Nixon’s important trip to Ghana stemmed most directly from black American enthusiasm for Ghana.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0022009413481831">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Nixon’s presence in Accra in March 1957 to celebrate Ghana’s independence originated in a congressional resolution three years earlier authorizing the State Department to send an official US delegation to Ghana upon independence. In July 1954 Jacob Javits, a liberal Republican from New York, sponsored a resolution in the House of Representatives to congratulate Ghana and Nigeria on their advances toward self-government. The successful resolution, and a corresponding one in the Senate, also authorized, whenever independence should occur, an official US delegation to the respective celebrations in Accra and Lagos. While Javits was the congressman who sponsored the resolution, an African American leader had originally voiced the idea. In early August 1954 an article in the <italic>Chicago Defender</italic> revealingly described events at a party at the Liberian Embassy marking that nation’s independence day. Javits stopped by to announce the successful passage of the above resolution and then ‘said he proposed the resolution which was passed unanimously at the instance of Dr. Max Bond, president of the University of Liberia’. Max Bond was Horace Mann Bond’s brother and the close relationship between the two described by Horace’s biographer Wayne Urban, as well as the fact that Max headed a university in Africa and often traveled around the continent, indicated Max held strong transnational racial identifications with Africa.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0022009413481831">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Once the resolution passed, congressmen and State Department officials assumed a delegation would take place. In October 1955 Javits asked Horace Mann Bond if he knew the date of Ghana’s official independence because the former wanted to ensure ‘legislation making appropriations to provide for the expenses of the delegation agreed on in the previous resolution’ would be introduced and passed on time to fund the official delegation. Javits’s language indicated that once the resolution had passed, no further authorization for a delegation, beyond funding, was needed. Although the Ghanaian government did send a formal invitation to the United States, US officials often referenced the 1954 resolution as the piece of legislation creating the official US delegation. In mid-January 1957 Hadsel, who was by then Director of the Office of South African Affairs (OSAA), told Assistant Secretary of State for NEA William Rountree, George Allen’s successor at the position, the ‘Joint Resolution, August 27, 1954, authorized [sic] Secretary to send a delegation’. Ten days later Dulles described the resolution to Nixon as ‘authorizing the Secretary of State to send a special delegation to the ceremonies’. Such language indicated US officials assumed from 1954 onwards that the resolution, which originated with an African American leader, would justify an official US delegation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0022009413481831">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Further evidence of Nixon’s secondary role in the US delegation to Ghana’s independence ceremonies appeared in his extreme reluctance to travel to Accra. In early January 1957 Dulles told Nixon he ‘would be delighted if he [Nixon] were to go to Africa since it was the coming continent and we were anxious to do all we could’, but the vice president was noncommittal. A week later Representative Frances Bolton (R-OH) urged Eisenhower to take the delegation seriously because she believed ‘what we do towards this emerging country of Ghana on March 6th can well decide our influence in that great awakening continent for a century or more’. Bolton had spoken with Nixon and, she told the president, ‘he told me he had expressed himself to the Secretary of State as being unready to go – but that my arguments would make it necessary to him to reconsider the matter’. Nixon had apparently decided against traveling to Ghana until Bolton’s words made him ‘reconsider the matter’. Eisenhower told Bolton he would not pressure Nixon into going if he did not want to go. After another week passed Dulles sent Nixon a two page letter and sought to convince him to make the trip by arguing:<disp-quote>
<p>The import of what takes place in Accra next March should be clear to the whole world … the other emergent peoples of Africa will follow with particular attention the degree of interest and sympathy which the United States accords these developments.</p></disp-quote>Thus, claimed Dulles, ‘our Delegation should be led by a person of highest official rank in the nation’ in order to show American interest in Ghana and Africa. Even after such enthusiastic exhortation and flattery, Nixon called Dulles and said, only, ‘If the Pres [sic] asked him to go to Africa, he will … [he] would like the Sec to discuss it with the Pres and have the Pres ask him’. Dulles called Nixon back the next day to tell him Eisenhower had written an official request and Nixon finally agreed to go.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0022009413481831">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>In total Nixon vacillated for three weeks over being on the US delegation. Even after members of Congress and the Secretary of State told him of the extreme importance almost everyone else in the administration saw in Ghana’s independence, Nixon still desired a formal written request from the president. Nixon’s intransigence, Dulles’ own words of including ‘a person of the highest official rank’, and the assumptions among US officials that a delegation would occur from 1954 onwards all indicated any high-level figure in the administration could have been plugged into the delegation. While Nixon did turn into a proponent of increased American attention to the continent after his time in Africa, the trip itself and subsequent policy based in part on his trip, including the first comprehensive policy paper for sub-Saharan Africa known as National Security Council paper 5719, stemmed from the 1954 congressional resolution originally proposed by an African American leader. Even if a US presence at the independence ceremonies seemed required by the increasing international attention to Ghana and the administration’s own Cold War desire to keep Ghana oriented toward the West, African Americans still played a substantial role in the development of the delegation and the reality is that a black leader helped produce the mechanism that sent Nixon to Accra.</p>
<p>Eisenhower’s officials were also directly in contact with African Americans in early 1957 and expressed concern over black public opinion regarding the racial makeup of the official US delegation. In early January Assistant Secretary Rountree corresponded with Jessie Vann, the wife of <italic>Pittsburgh Courier</italic> editor Robert Vann, regarding both black American interest in Ghana’s independence and a special <italic>Courier</italic> edition dedicated to the event. Rountree told Vann:<disp-quote>
<p>Officers in both the Department of State and United States Information Agency have told me of your very fine efforts in planning a special Ghana Salute Edition … it seems to me that your own personal efforts and those of the Courier attest to the very real interest the people of this country have in the new State of Ghana.</p></disp-quote>Rountree’s statements indicated numerous US officials were aware of both transnational racial identifications between African Americans and Ghana and of the content of black public opinion concerning Ghana. In mid-January OSAA Director Hadsel told Rountree ‘we believe it necessary that one member be a Negro’ on the official delegation. In late January the State Department’s Director of the Executive Secretariat Joseph Greene told Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs Carl McCardle, ‘the American Negro press has solicited, through Mr. [Maxwell] Rabb [Eisenhower’s Cabinet Secretary who was also in charge of relations with minority groups] at the White House, a Presidential statement … in addition to the formal statement previously approved’. While the administration did not provide such a statement, the request further revealed direct pressure US officials felt from black public opinion. In an even more overt instance of black pressure on the White House, a week later Eisenhower’s Appointment Secretary Bernard Shanley asked Assistant to the President Sherman Adams:<disp-quote>
<p>Would it not be advisable for either Fred Morrow or Ernest Wilkins of the Labor Department [the highest level African American appointees in the administration] to accompany the Vice President on his trip to Africa. I believe we would be subject to much criticism, particularly in the negro [sic] press, if one of our outstanding colored officials did not go on this trip.</p></disp-quote>Likewise, in late February Maxwell Rabb believed providing an official message of congratulations to Ghana would ‘be very helpful on both the international and <italic>domestic</italic> [emphasis added] scenes in making some recognition of Ghana’. E. Frederic Morrow, Eisenhower’s Administrative Officer for Special Projects and the highest African American official in the administration, most clearly described the interactions of African Americans and the administration when he wrote in his diary on February 14:<disp-quote>
<p>Great pressures have been put on the White House and the State Department by prominent Negroes, asking to be named to the official delegation from the United States … Nixon had gone to many colored countries in the world before without a Negro member in his group … Each time the Vice-President had made one of these trips, the Negro press had asked why he was not accompanied by some Negro official.</p></disp-quote>US officials were clearly aware of black sentiments regarding Ghana. Black public opinion thus contributed to the presence of an African American, Representative Charles Diggs (D-MI), on the official US delegation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0022009413481831">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>As with Nixon’s visit to Accra in March 1957, historians of US–Ghanaian relations have either discussed no causation for Nkrumah’s widely publicized and important visit to the United States in July 1958 or have suggested the trip occurred based on an invitation from Eisenhower on Ghana’s first anniversary of freedom. Expressing the former view, James Meriwether remarks, ‘Nkrumah returned to the United States in 1958’, and Ebere Nwaubani writes, ‘The United States/Ghana relationship was deepened by Nkrumah’s official visit to the United States in July 1958’. Mary Montgomery reflects the second view in her statement, ‘President Eisenhower marked the occasion [Ghana’s first anniversary of independence] with a congratulatory note to the Prime Minister that included an official invitation to visit Washington’. Yet just as the roots of Nixon’s trip lay in the 1954 congressional resolution, Nkrumah’s US visit, during which he met twice with Eisenhower, attended numerous official events, and gave a number of speeches to both government bodies and mass audiences in Washington, New York and Chicago, originated in the transnational racial identification of African Americans with Ghana stretching back to March 1957.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0022009413481831">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>While Nkrumah apparently claimed during Ghana’s independence ceremonies that he wanted to visit the United States, African American enthusiasm for Nkrumah formed the concrete basis for his 1958 visit and brought about government involvement in the trip. On 13 March 1957 the Director of Public Relations for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Albert Ceres, circulated a letter to the University of Pennsylvania, Lincoln University, and the Hershey Chocolate Company asking for help in bringing Nkrumah to the United States to speak to veterans in Pennsylvania. Ceres noted, ‘Hundreds of our members are Negroes’ and said he believed the visit ‘would have <italic>domestic</italic> [emphasis added] and international significance’, thus revealing that he designed the trip in large part based on black American enthusiasm for Nkrumah. A month later Ceres telephoned OSAA Deputy Director George LaMont to discuss State Department involvement in such a potential visit. When LaMont wrote to Ceres later that day, his statement, ‘I refer to our telephone conversation this morning regarding your proposal to invite Prime Minister Nkrumah of Ghana to visit the United States’, revealed US officials had no initial plans to invite Nkrumah, similar to Horace Mann Bond’s interactions with the State Department in 1951. Indeed, although LaMont regretted funds were no longer available in 1957 to pay for official visits by foreign leaders, he nevertheless concluded, ‘We shall, of course, bear in mind the possibility of inviting him officially to the United States at some time in the future’. Ceres, acting on his awareness of black American identification with Ghana, had placed the idea of an officially sponsored visit by Nkrumah in the mind of a State Department official.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0022009413481831">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>The exact same official, LaMont, subsequently placed Nkrumah on the list of foreign leaders to be invited for official US visits in 1958. In mid-August 1957 one of Assistant Secretary Rountree’s staff assistants told other State officials, ‘Rountree at a recent staff meeting approved the suggestion that early thought should be given to the question of state and official visits deemed desirable by this Bureau for calendar year 1958’ and asked for recommendations from desk officers. LaMont replied that a visit by Nkrumah ‘would clearly be in the best interests of the US’ because ‘Dr. Nkrumah received the major portion of his education in this country and has maintained close relations with certain US academic circles during the entire period in which he has led Ghana in its steps toward independence’. The phrase ‘certain US academic circles’ most likely meant African American leaders such as Horace Mann Bond and others at black institutions who viewed Nkrumah as a symbol of black capability and modernity. Indeed, LaMont went on to list Howard and Lincoln universities among the institutions interested in a visit by Nkrumah and declared, ‘It would be advantageous for us to afford our own official recognition of his position of African leadership’. The latter statement clearly indicated the advantages the administration would gain domestically from a visit by Nkrumah because LaMont then spent an entire paragraph discussing Ghana’s importance in the international arena and explicitly noted how an official trip by Nkrumah would also please ‘the people of Ghana and other African areas’. While Nkrumah decided by early October he was too busy to visit the United States in 1957, as late as 9 August Secretary Dulles asked the US embassy in Accra for any available travel plans by Nkrumah in order to ensure ‘sufficient time [sic] make plans for Nkrumah to be properly received’, indicating the State Department was scrambling to take advantage of any privately sponsored trip. Nkrumah’s important 1958 US visit did not originate out of thin air or with Eisenhower’s invitation in March 1958, but with the recognition by Ceres, and later LaMont, of African American identification with Ghana. Indeed, LaMont’s justifications for the trip included a clear argument for the domestic significance of such a visit. Thus in August 1957 LaMont submitted Nkrumah’s name for the list of official invitees for 1958 and Eisenhower subsequently extended such an invitation, due in large part to African American enthusiasm for Nkrumah. Again, while a visit by Nkrumah to the United States may have been a likely possibility based on the Eisenhower administration’s need to appear welcoming to decolonizing nations in the context of the global Cold War, the fact remains that African Americans played a substantial role in bringing Nkrumah to the United States in 1958.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0022009413481831">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the 1950s Ghana was not only a symbol of black freedom, but also of black capability to engage modern political, economic and social systems intelligently. African Americans began to incorporate Africa in their self-identification, as James Meriwether has shown, but in specific ways that would bolster the movement for black civil rights in the United States. American blacks were proud of black successes in Africa on their own terms, to be sure, but African Americans also consistently sought to appropriate the image of Ghana as a modern nation to convince whites at home that the racial and social chaos white defenders of the color line argued would occur upon full racial equality was a myth. Numerous black leaders, including Horace Mann Bond, Max Bond, members of the black press, and NAACP officials, subsequently acted on their views of Ghana to press the Eisenhower administration to accord more attention and importance to Ghana and Africa. While such actions did not mirror the breadth of later mass campaigns concerning international issues, one institution created at the time, the ACOA, later played a significant part in the battle against South African apartheid through its Africa Fund. Despite the relative lack of sustained institutional pressure, however, enough voices from the NAACP, the ACOA, and individual black writers, intellectuals, and activists reached the State Department during the 1950s to have an effect.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0022009413481831">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>The international Cold War environment, European allies and domestic opponents of African decolonization and racial equality, as Thomas Borstelmann has shown, also mattered in the minds of American policymakers. Yet even though black public opinion was not the sole, or even the strongest, influence in foreign policymaking during the 1950s, it did constitute an element that US officials increasingly took into account throughout the decade. In the branch of the State Department responsible for Africa before the separate Bureau of African Affairs opened in 1958, assistant secretaries of state for NEA, especially George Allen and William Rountree, recognized black views concerning Africa and at times noted such views as part of their policy deliberations. Even more often, desk officers in the State Department were in contact with individual African American leaders and were aware of black public opinion. Precisely because Eisenhower and Dulles paid little attention to Africa, these desk officers and assistant secretaries, who often wrote the first drafts of policy papers, were able to gradually shift US foreign policy toward Africa gradually over the course of the 1950s, in part based on their recognition of the importance of Ghana to African Americans. Even though black Americans did not achieve their final goals of forcing a full embrace of African decolonization and African aspirations, they were partially successful in that the State Department began to move American policy toward a ‘middle ground’ approach balancing European desires with the aspirations of Africans. In addition, African Americans achieved some of their greatest international successes of the 1950s when their transnational racial identification with Ghana helped form the root of two major events in US–Ghanaian relations during the decade, Nixon’s March 1957 trip to the independence ceremonies in Accra and Nkrumah’s July 1958 visit to the United States during which he met twice with Eisenhower. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0022009413481831">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>While historians Ebere Nwaubani and Mary Montgomery have claimed no African American agency occurred in American foreign relations with Africa during the 1950s, this article has shown American blacks clearly affected the views of State Department officials and also helped cause some of the major actions the Eisenhower administration undertook in its relationship with Ghana. This study not only reveals black agency and the influence of the domestic sphere on American foreign relations with Africa during the 1950s, but also demonstrates a positive way race operated in international relations during the Cold War. Historians Thomas Borstelmann and George White, Jr. have argued for the negative effect of race on American Cold War foreign policy in Africa by emphasizing the racism of high-level Eisenhower policymakers. Yet race could also produce beneficial results, as Mary Dudziak has shown in <italic>Cold War Civil Rights</italic> where she argues US leaders felt global pressure to adopt at least formal racial equality and as this study has shown in how African Americans both played a role in the shift of US foreign policy in Africa toward a more ‘middle ground’ approach and helped form the root cause of some of the most important interactions between high-level American and Ghanaian officials during the 1950s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0022009413481831">24</xref></sup></p>

<bio><title>Biographical Note</title>
<p><bold>Kevin Grimm</bold> received his doctorate from the Department of History and the Contemporary History Institute at Ohio University in June 2012. He was a visiting assistant professor at Beloit College from 2012–2013. To an upcoming collection edited by Novotny Lawrence, <italic>Documenting the Black Experience</italic>, he has contributed a chapter exploring the impact that recent films on the murder of Emmett Till have had on the public memory of the civil rights movement and on legislation addressing unsolved cases from the civil rights era. He has also authored an essay on the historiography of the Eisenhower administration’s relations with the Third World in the forthcoming volume by Wiley-Blackwell, <italic>A Companion to Dwight D. Eisenhower</italic>, edited by Chester J. Pach, Jr. His dissertation focused on the topics in this article and in the future he plans to explore the activities of international labor unions, including the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, in newly decolonized African nations.</p></bio>
