<abstract>
<p>Focus groups with youth and their parents were used in this research study to better understand the impact of the On Belay Program, an adventure-based support group for youth whose parents have cancer. Results demonstrated that challenge course programs reduce isolation in youth by creating a caring community and normalizing the cancer experience. Results also showed the importance of providing a place where the youth, not the parent or the parent’s illness, is the focus. Finally, the feelings of strength and empowerment gained from successfully accomplishing the physical challenges faced in the program were also applied to challenges faced at home.</p>

<p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053825913487889">American Cancer Society, 2010</xref>). The diagnosis of cancer dramatically affects the lives of the cancer patient as well as family and friends. Many programs have been developed and researched to help individuals with cancer cope with the psychosocial issues that go along with the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053825913487889">Meyer &amp; Mark, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053825913487889">Niemelä, Hakko, &amp; Räsänen, 2010</xref>). The children of individuals who have cancer have not received similar attention from the health and research communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053825913487889">McFayden, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053825913487889">Romer, Barkmann, Schulte-Markwort, &amp; Riedesser, 2002</xref>). In fact, they are considered the “lost group” when families are dealing with life-threatening illnesses like cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053825913487889">Niemelä et al., 2010</xref>) even though they too are in need of support.</p>
<p>Children who have a parent with cancer face significant threats to their security due to the uncertainty of their parent’s future. Although the threats depend on the phase of the parent’s illness and the stage of the child’s development, many are present throughout the parent’s illness and vary in degree over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053825913487889">Diareme et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053825913487889">Watson et al., 2006</xref>). In their review of literature on the impact of parental cancer on children, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053825913487889">Grabiak, Bender, and Puskar (2007)</xref> found a variety of factors affecting these youth, including changes in daily routines, modifications to child care, added responsibilities, parental role reversal, and family financial stress.</p>
<p>Research on the psychosocial impact of parental cancer reveals reactive behaviors in children, including increased stress responses, decreased school performance, and increased conflicts with parents, siblings, and peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053825913487889">Stanko &amp; Taub, 2002</xref>). Adolescents were found to display significant increases in abnormal psychosocial functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053825913487889">Visser, 2007</xref>), including increased levels of depression and anxiety, decreased self-esteem and social competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053825913487889">Christ, 2000</xref>), and psychosomatic issues like head and stomach aches, dizziness, sleeping problems, and loss of appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053825913487889">Grabiak et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>With the family’s attention on the sick parent and the resulting change in routine, financial constraints, and increased responsibilities, children often feel abandoned and experience social isolation and loneliness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1053825913487889">Welch, Wadsworth, &amp; Compas, 1996</xref>). The children may feel that they are alone and have no one to turn to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053825913487889">Stanko &amp; Taub, 2002</xref>). Even their friends may not know what to say or do—making unintentional insensitive remarks, tiring of the issue and expecting their friend to continue as normal, or even withdrawing their friendship as a result of awkwardness. These situations make the child feel even more different and more isolated from his or her peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053825913487889">Stanko &amp; Taub, 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Peer Group Interventions</title>
<p>A variety of psychosocial support groups for children and adolescents who had a parent with cancer arose during the 1990s as part of the holistic treatment of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053825913487889">Barrera, Chung, &amp; Fleming, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053825913487889">Call, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053825913487889">Diareme et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487889">Greening, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053825913487889">Osborn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053825913487889">Visser, 2007</xref>). The first recognized program was a school-based program that focused on strengthening illness-related coping skills, addressing emotional difficulties, and increasing understanding of the illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053825913487889">Call, 1990</xref>). The “Kids Can Cope” program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053825913487889">Taylor-Brown, Acheson, &amp; Farber, 1993</xref>) was facilitated by an oncology nurse and social worker after school for 6 weeks with a focus on education, support, and increasing the coping skills of the group participants. The “Bear Essential” Program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487889">Greening, 1992</xref>) provided education and support to young children, and also included the parents who had cancer along with their spouses. Children and their parents attended monthly sessions that included discussions about illness-related questions and concerns, education about cancer and its treatment, and activities for the children to express their feelings in a nonverbal way because of their age. The “For Kids Only” program provided education and support to children with parents with cancer in a short-term 1-day program format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053825913487889">Bedway &amp; Smith, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>No formal evaluations were conducted for any of these programs. The impacts of the programs were based on observations and in some instances, comments and feedback from the children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053825913487889">Bedway &amp; Smith, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053825913487889">Call, 1990</xref>) and parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053825913487889">Bedway &amp; Smith, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053825913487889">Call, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487889">Greening, 1992</xref>). In general, the children felt supported and comforted by their peers, less alone in their situation, better able to understand and cope with their parent’s illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053825913487889">Bedway &amp; Smith, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053825913487889">Greening, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053825913487889">Taylor-Brown et al., 1993</xref>), and more open about expressing feelings around their parents’ illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053825913487889">Call, 1990</xref>). Although promising, the impact of these groups is not thoroughly understood due to the lack of a more detailed examination.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053825913487889">Heiney and Lesesne (1996)</xref> provided the first attempt at a more in-depth exploration of a support group for children with parental cancer. The authors evaluated “Quest,” a program that included education about cancer, development of coping skills, and creation of opportunities for discussion about the diagnosis. The researchers administered a 10-question survey to the youth (<italic>n</italic> = 8) after the program that measured aspects of program satisfaction and conducted follow-up interviews with parents. Children reported the most valuable aspect of the program was the education provided by the program about cancer and its treatment; the data were also supported by the parent’s postprogram interviews.</p>
<p>The literature review suggests that most support groups for healthy children in a family where cancer is present incorporate education around the cancer and normalization of the experience through meeting peers in the same situation. It is also evident that more research is needed on the impact of peer support groups on youth who have parents with cancer. Due to the effect the illness has on the family, it is important for researchers to engage the youth and their parents to gain a more holistic understanding of the impact of support programs on the youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053825913487889">Diareme et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section2-1053825913487889">
<title>Using Adventure With Cancer-Affected Youth</title>
<p>The benefits of adventure programming with children who have cancer are well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053825913487889">Balen, Fielding, &amp; Lewis, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053825913487889">Mosher, 2006</xref>). The psychosocial benefits of participation on challenge courses are also well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053825913487889">Gillis &amp; Speelman, 2008</xref>). There is, however, no research that examines the impact of adventure or challenge course programming on youth who have a parent with cancer. Hence, this research study was designed to understand how outdoor adventure programs affect feelings of support and empowerment in youth whose parents have cancer.</p>

<sec id="section3-1053825913487889">
<title>The On Belay Program</title>
<p>On Belay was founded in 2004 by a woman diagnosed with breast cancer as a way to support her two daughters through the challenge. After researching support groups that relied more on talking than doing, the founder determined none were the right fit for her “animated, active, adventurous” daughters. In reaction to this lack of programming, she created <italic>On Belay</italic>, an adventure-based program with the mission of building community among children 9 to 19 who have or have had a family member with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053825913487889">On Belay, 2011</xref>). In addition, the program aims to help these youth discover their personal power in the face of the challenge of having a parent with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053825913487889">On Belay, 2010</xref>). Youth take part in a full day of adventure activities, including challenge course and indoor climbing programs. The program is funded through individual, community, and corporate support allowing the program to be free of charge to participants. The On Belay programs take place 4 times a year serving children throughout New England.</p>
<p>On Belay is an outdoor adventure program in which participants work together in small groups to face a variety of challenges. The activities include cooperative games, problem-solving initiatives, and low and high challenge course elements. The program is carefully sequenced by trained facilitators with the goal of empowering the participants through building community and providing challenging and attainable experiences. This 8-hr full-day program begins the day with games and initiatives ending the morning with low challenge course elements and transitioning after lunch into high challenge course elements. The progression of activities build upon each other in terms of their requirements of group cooperation, trust, and risk with choices of activities adapted based on the age of the clients participating. Often, there is one group for younger children (8-12 years old) and another for older children (13 years and up) to appropriately meet the capabilities physically and developmentally of the youth. After each activity, facilitators process the experience with the group by asking questions about what happened during the activity, what was learned during the activity, and how the learning may influence future behaviors? The intentional sequencing of activities as well as the planned debriefing of the activities are key to making adventure-based groups not just recreational, but educational and at times therapeutic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053825913487889">Tucker, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section5-1053825913487889">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The goal of the study was to gain a better understanding of how the challenge course experience affected youth who had participated in the On Belay program. To accomplish the goal, the researchers recruited youth and their parents who had attended the On Belay program at least twice during the past 3 years to participate in a focus group. The purpose of interviewing youth and parents involved in the program multiple years was to help the researchers understand the impact of the program over a longer period of time. To recruit the sample, On Belay staff sent out a letter and/or email to all identified parents and youth describing the purpose the study. In total, emails and letters were sent to 20 families. All letters and emails included the researchers’ contact information and parents and youth were instructed to contact the researchers independently to insure that choosing not to participate would not affect their relationship with On Belay.</p>
<p>It is important to note that none of the researchers were involved in the programming, running, or funding of the On Belay program; however, each had significant experience working with youth on challenge courses and received a separate grant from <italic>The Association for Challenge Course Technology</italic> to conduct this study. This study was reviewed and approved for human subjects by the Institutional Review Board at the lead researcher’s university.</p>
<p>The dates for the focus groups were chosen to coincide with the dates of the On Belay programs in October 2009 and June 2010 so not to burden the families, especially those that lived far away from the program site. On each date, one focus group was conducted in the morning with parents after they dropped off their child(ren) and another focus group was conducted with youth participants following their program in the afternoon. Each youth and parent received a US$15 gift card for their participation, and the youth were provided a meal as well.</p>
<p>Each focus group lasted approximately 1 hr, was conducted by the two researchers, and video- and audiotaped by a social work graduate assistant. The focus groups for the youth and parents consisted of semistructured questions aimed at understanding how participation in a challenge course experience affected the youth’s feelings of support and personal power and their ability to communicate and process the experience of having a parent with cancer. The youth were asked to talk about what happened during the day of an On Belay program, including the best and the most challenging parts, what they had learned about themselves and their situation from participating in the program, and if and how the challenge course was an important part of their experience (vs. another group activity like bowling or a picnic). The parents were asked why their child(ren) chose to participate in the program, what their child enjoyed most, what was the most challenging, if and how the program had helped their child, and why the challenge course experience was different from other group activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1053825913487889">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Four focus groups were conducted with a total sample of 12 youth and 9 parents. The ages of the 12 youth ranged from 10 to 15 years old. Five of the youth were male and the other seven were female. In both the October and June focus groups, there was a set of brother and sister siblings who participated. All of the youth had a parent with cancer with varying ranges of health. The father of 2 of the youth was currently under hospice care and the mother of 1 youth had died in the previous year. The mother of another youth was currently undergoing cancer treatment, and the parents of the remaining 8 youth were currently in remission. Out of the nine parents who participated, one was a father and the rest were mothers of the youth who participated in the program. Four of the parents in the focus groups were cancer survivors, while the other five parent participants had spouses with cancer. Overall, each parent and child had been recently affected by the cancer of a family member. Only 1 youth who participated did not also have a parent take part in a focus group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1053825913487889">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>For the purpose of data analysis, a technique based on the constant comparative method was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053825913487889">Maykut &amp; Morehouse, 1994</xref>). Each focus group was transcribed verbatim by a social work graduate assistant and independently analyzed by the researchers, one doctoral student in outdoor education and a social work graduate assistant. During the analysis process, transcribed interview texts were divided into “units” of meaning. These units were grouped thematically into categories and given titles designed to represent their common theme. Through a process of constant comparison between the emerging themes, the categories were refined to the extent that the main themes represented within the data were identified. This analysis was a continuous process as new information and themes were found and supported until the entire data were analyzed. After each individual analysis, the team of coders met together to review the consistency of their findings. Overall, the same themes emerged from each group of coded transcripts.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1053825913487889">
<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section9-1053825913487889">
<title>Community</title>
<p>The idea of community and the role it plays in the On Belay experience was a central theme reported by the youth and the parents. Being with a group of youth who were experiencing the same situation at home built a community of friends, reduced their sense of isolation, and increased feelings of support.</p>
<sec id="section10-1053825913487889">
<title>I Am Not Alone</title>
<p>During the On Belay program, all youth participants reported that they developed a common connection with each other, relieving the feeling of being completely alone. The connection with cancer links the participants, making it easier for them to understand each others’ situations and develop strong friendships. Parents and youth expressed how the experience changed their perception of aloneness. Two parents noted,<disp-quote>
<p>She [her daughter] will come home [from On Belay] and say to me, “Mommy, there’s other kids whose parents have cancer, too.” Like she sees herself being normal now, not being one of the few [whose] family has cancer.</p>
<p>I think they just felt good seeing that these kids look like any other kid, and they are going through the same stuff that we’re going through, so maybe we’re more normal than we think.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The youth stated similar perceptions.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>You’re also kind of learning that a lot of the other people have gone through the same thing so we’re not alone. That’s nice.</p>
<p>[Being here] lets you know you’re not the only one in that position.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1053825913487889">
<title>People Here Understand</title>
<p>The youth described how the experience provided a common bond where everyone knew their situation, but they didn’t have to talk about it or worry what to say to people. Many stated that their friends at home did not understand their situation and were not able to empathize. One of the females noted how she had people to talk to at the program because they had gone “through the same thing” while her “other friends (from home) wouldn’t understand.” Another boy described this lack of understanding by his friends:<disp-quote>
<p>[My friends] don’t really get it. I don’t have a choice. They’re just like, “Eh, I would much rather just hang out with friends” and you’re like “Well I would too, but I don’t really have a choice because it’s my parent. I have to take care of them.” People here understand.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One parent shared that her son felt a common bond with other On Belay participants that was different from his friends at school because “everyone else knew,” which was “cool” to him, unlike at school where it was not something her son talked about because other students “wouldn’t get it.” Participants experience empathy that they don’t receive from friends at home. One parent commented, “If you are outside of that realm, I don’t think kids necessarily know how to have empathy towards one another.” A participant explained the connection between participants by saying,<disp-quote>
<p>We don’t talk about why we’re here because it’s [On Belay] a positive thing and we don’t want to talk about sad stuff, but behind every one of the faces that’s here there’s something that’s going on or went down. And they just get it. There’s like a secret alliance almost.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1053825913487889">
<title>Friendships Beyond the Program</title>
<p>The program activities build trust between the youth, helping them to gain friendships that go beyond the program day. One participant said, “I’m really close with a guy that I met here. If I’m having a bad day, he knows why. He doesn’t have to ask and stuff. I don’t have to explain everything to him.” All but two of the youth, especially the older ones, reported to have gained friends at the program with whom they continue to interact after they leave, often through social media, and use as a source of support when times at home become difficult.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1053825913487889">
<title>Helping Others Understand</title>
<p>On Belay does offer the opportunity for youth to bring a friend from home with them to the program. The youth and parents noted that when friends from home attended an On Belay program, they began to understand their friend better. One participant noted,<disp-quote>
<p>In school everyone knows about my mom and they’re like, “oh that’s the girl whose mom is dying” and stuff, and so they treat me different. And my friend [who came with me] learned that I’m not like different, that I’m still the same as I was before.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Not only does On Belay normalize the experience of the youth with ill parents, but it also normalizes the experience for their peers as well.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1053825913487889">
<title>Meeting the Needs of the Youth</title>
<p>Another theme that emerged was how the On Belay program provided an opportunity for these youth to engage in a positive experience in which they, not their parents or their parents’ illness, were the focus. Several parents commented that having their child attend On Belay felt like they were able to “give a gift” by “giving him something good.” One parent said, “It’s the one positive thing I can give my kids” during a very difficult time.</p>
<p>Most of the parents talked about the responsibilities their children took on and how the fun was “sucked out of their lives” as a result of their parent’s cancer. The experience helped the youth see that it was “okay to have fun, because other people have sick moms and dads and they’re here having fun.” The youth said many times how much fun the experience was for them and talked about On Belay being a place to escape what was going on in their lives at home. Several parents talked about the experience being a place where their children could remove their “mask” and be themselves.</p>
<p>Many of the teenagers spoke about how attending On Belay was something that they looked forward to and “needed.” One female spoke about how she was able to “recharge” at On Belay, “it’s almost like you get your fix for however long and then you’re like ‘Okay, this [attending On Belay] is going to take me until the next time.’” One mother said,<disp-quote>
<p>When it’s close to me going back to [the hospital] for all my stuff, she wants to be a part of it [On Belay]. I think it’s a safety, “Okay, let’s get in that, surrounded by that, it’s normal, it’s gonna be okay.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Parents and youth were clear how On Belay provided an opportunity for the youth to temporarily forget their circumstances, have fun with other youth, be in the spotlight for at least that one day, and feel the support of those around them.</p>

<p>The aim of most support groups is to provide a community of care for participants, as well as an environment in which the participant can focus on themselves, which On Belay groups appear to give to their participants. In addition to this, however, the intentional use of adventure activities, in comparison with more traditional support group formats, appears to provide participants with a unique experience that is geared toward success and empowerment of its participants; an important focus due to the stress and impact their parent’s illness can have on them.</p>
<sec id="section16-1053825913487889">
<title>Challenge</title>
<p>Adventure programming incorporates physically and emotionally challenging activities that appear almost impossible, however, in actuality, are possible to be achieved. In this way, the activities are used to give participants a sense of success and accomplishment after facing their fears. This component was highlighted frequently by the participants and their parents. One girl reflected, “I was braver than I thought I was, because I am scared of heights and went halfway up that rock wall.” Similarly, another adolescent commented, “I think it’s the best part when you accomplish a challenge. It’s like ‘Oh My God,’ I can’t believe I just did that. I’ve never done that before, it’s crazy, but awesome.” One mother reflected on the impact on her son, “You feel more confident . . . I think it’s that sort of ‘I did that!’ feeling.” Accomplishing these successes gave many of the participants a sense that they were stronger than they realized. One male adolescent stressed how he “learned that (he) can probably do more” than he thought he could. Similarly, one girl stated that “trying new things can help you do more . . . and be open to other things.”</p>
<p>By incorporating challenges into the support group, the youth participants were not only able to see their own strengths but also able to reflect upon how they use this strength or courage once they leave the program when they are dealing with the illness of their parent. One youth commented,<disp-quote>
<p>[Being on the challenge course helps] you get through the situation that you want to. [The situation at home] can be challenging but other people can help you with it. And you get through it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another stated that being on the challenge course “teaches you how to handle the hard situation better.” A third youth understood the metaphor of the challenge course by stating,<disp-quote>
<p>I think that the challenges that they do like the Eagle Nest is just like thinking about teamwork and the teamwork is with your whole family. When you’re with your whole family that’s teamwork.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Not only were the youth challenged and successful in accomplishing these challenges, they also learned how they might apply the skills learned to help deal with the difficult situations that they faced at home. This transfer of learning is an important focus of the use of adventure programs as part of an intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053825913487889">Sugerman, Doherty, Garvey, &amp; Gass, 2000</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section17-1053825913487889">
<title>Challenge by Choice</title>
<p>The impact of the adventure activities was not simply due to the challenges presented to the youth but was also due to the manner in which the groups were facilitated. An important element of adventure programming is the concept of challenge by choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053825913487889">Ryan, 2005</xref>) where participants choose the extent to which they challenge themselves. In this model, no one is forced to participate in an effort to make youth feel not only physically safe but also emotionally safe. The importance of choice was a significant theme throughout the comments by the youth and parents. One mother noted,<disp-quote>
<p>The way that I look at it is—they’re living a challenge. Their life is a challenge, which they have no control over. And they come here and it’s a different challenge which they do have control over it. You know they make the choice whether or not they want to try it or whether they don’t. And you know, however they succeed, even if it’s just a little bit, it’s a challenge that they’ve had control of and they’ve succeeded. I think it just kind of takes away from the challenge that’s out of control at home and they can come back feeling successful.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another mother noted,<disp-quote>
<p>They were very supportive even if she didn’t do it. [Saying] “you were an excellent supporter. You did a great job!” And she’s like, “I was a really great supporter today mom.” So, they made her feel good no matter what she chose to do, and that was huge.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This concept of challenge by choice also applied if and how the youth chose to talk about their parents’ illness. Although the activities were structured with a discussion after the activity, this discussion did not revolve around the topic of their parents’ illness, but directly related to the experience in the moment. “Not having to talk about it” was seen unanimously by all the youth and parents as a positive part of the program. This did not mean they did not talk about it, but they were in control about when and/or how to talk about it if they chose to do so.</p>
<p>In the interviews, the parents and the youth were emphatic that the use of the challenge course was an integral reason the experience was so impactful, and that other types of programs might not have had a similar impact. One father summarized it best,<disp-quote>
<p>On Belay covers several different things. You’re in a safe environment because of harnessing the techniques and experience and skill of the people doing it. [The] kids want to be with their peers or be challenged by being within a group and doing what everybody else is doing. They might have that “I don’t want to do that because I’m scared of doing it or scared of falling or scared of being embarrassed.” So it’s overcoming several different things in this format of a safe environment. Yeah, you could go out on a BMX bike or motocross or something, [but] you don’t have the same safety factor . . . I don’t think there’s anything out there comparable that you really can do.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>A diagnosis of cancer can present a variety of challenges to the parents who have cancer as well as to their children. The literature suggests that the effects on children include feelings of isolation; feeling they are alone in their situation and others do not understand their situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053825913487889">Stanko &amp; Taub, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1053825913487889">Welch et al., 1996</xref>). The parents and youth who participated in these focus groups discussed that these issues were indeed a reality in their lives. Hence, the aim of providing support groups for these youth is to address these issues and in fact attempt to normalize the experience for the youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053825913487889">Niemelä et al., 2010</xref>). According to the youth and their parents, the On Belay experience was effective at providing a community of caring in which youth could be with other youth who understood them. This was highlighted as being important because often the friends around them did not understand. In fact, bringing friends to On Belay was also effective for normalizing the experience for their friends as well. In addition, for most of the youth participants, the friendships that were created at the program continued afterward and were used as a sense of continued support for the youth, similar to the effects reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053825913487889">Call (1990)</xref>.</p>
<p>Unlike other support group models discussed, the On Belay model did not focus on educating the youth about their parents’ illness or talking about the illness in particular. In other models, providing this education around the illness has been seen as an important element of the group model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053825913487889">Heiney &amp; Lesesne, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053825913487889">Taylor-Brown et al., 1993</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053825913487889">Heiney and Lesesne (1996)</xref> reported that education was highlighted by youth as one of the most positive parts of participation in their “Quest” group. For the participants in the On Belay program, it seemed that it was equally important not to have to talk about their parent’s illness. It was noted by several parents that their children did not necessarily want to talk about it, because it was all that was talked about at home at times. Many of the youth from On Belay said that it was unnecessary to talk about it, due to the fact that everyone knew. From the parents’ and youth’s perspectives, giving the youth control of how or when they did talk about it was a unique and integral part of the On Belay experience. These findings do not mean that educating the youth and family about a parent’s illness and talking about the impact of the illness on the family are not important parts of the treatment process. The focus of these program elements, however, revolves around the parent and the parent’s illness. Based on our findings, it appears that in supporting the children whose parents have cancer, there also needs to be a space in which they, not the parent or the parent’s illness, are the focus.</p>
<p>The major difference between previous support groups for these youth and the On Belay program is the adventure component. It was unanimously agreed upon by the 21 youth and parents that the adventure component was one of the most powerful parts of the support program. The program provided a safe environment for the participants to challenge themselves physically and emotionally. It also gave the participants a sense of power and success, which was important considering how little control or triumph the youth experienced in their home lives. As one mother stated, her children rarely left their traditional support group provided by a local hospital feeling “invigorated or happy.” Many of the youth learned that they were stronger or more powerful than they had thought and were able to apply this strength toward facing the challenge of their parent’s illness. Instead of talking about their personal strengths, they were vividly shown their strengths through their physical participation in the adventure activities. In adventure programming, the use of activity is a key part of the process, because it provides immediate and concrete examples of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053825913487889">Tucker, 2009</xref>), and in this case, it provided concrete examples of the youth’s strengths. Although working with youth and exploring issues with them through traditional talk group methods is effective as shown in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053825913487889">Niemelä et al., 2010</xref>), it may be equally effective to use other dynamic and experiential methods to explore their feelings as well as develop ways of coping with their parent’s disease. According to these youth and their parents, the challenge course was the ideal way to meet the youth’s needs.</p>
