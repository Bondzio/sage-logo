<abstract>
<p>This essay documents labor market and residential segregation in Austin, Texas, in the three decades after World War Two, arguing that despite the city’s relatively progressive culture it was as racially segregated as most Northern and Southern cities during the period. In Austin, being progressive usually meant supporting New Deal policies, encouraging strong ties to the federal government, and promoting responsible, nonindustrial growth much more than fighting racial inequality or rejecting the sanctity of private property rights. Segregation, ironically bolstered by federally supported urban renewal, which undermined black property rights, helped maintain a nonindustrial image that city leaders used to market Austin as a pleasant place to live and do business for knowledge workers. The resounding defeat of open housing in 1968 maintained de facto segregation and demonstrated the fallacy of race-neutral housing policies in the South. Today, the deleterious effects of segregation and dispossession are still felt among the city’s African American and Latino residents; current economic trends mirror those from the 1960s.</p>

<p>In May 1967, the newly formed Austin Human Rights Commission (AHRC) presented a text copy of the Austin Fair Housing Ordinance to the Austin city council for approval. The AHRC, which the council formed solely to produce the document as a response to federal fair housing legislation, ran the full text of the ordinance in the <italic>Austin Statesman</italic>. The ordinance mandated that no person could be discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin when buying, leasing, or financing residential property, was printed on May 24, one week after the deciding council vote.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144213479324">1</xref></sup> It was enacted on May 27. Immediately the Austin Board of Realtors, many of whom supported the ordinance in its early stages, called for a referendum vote against it, which, realtor Nelson Puett claimed in a letter to Congressman J. J. Pickle, “is not a racial thing . . . not a civil rights thing. . . . This is just another government attempt to restrict and control your individual freedom and to tamper with the most basic human right, private ownership of property.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144213479324">2</xref></sup> Publicly, Puett and other powerful Austin realtors such as Hub Bechtol were equally as committed to defending private property rights against fair housing. Locally the ordinance was denounced as “forced public housing,” despite the fact that it did not call for any forced relocation of citizens or forced integration of any kind. Nor did it call for any new public housing. Although referendums were rarely successful in Austin, the Austin Board of Realtors chose to collect the necessary signatures to proceed with a public vote. Within ten days the petition was signed by twenty-seven thousand residents, nearly one-third of Austin’s voting-eligible population and roughly 10 percent of Austin’s entire population, including minorities and minors, in 1968. It was by far the most supported petition in the city’s history. When put to referendum, the Austin Fair Housing Ordinance was soundly defeated, leaving discriminatory real estate and lending practices difficult to prosecute in Austin into the 1970s and reinscribing municipally sponsored segregation, which was prevalent in the city for four decades, onto Austin’s emerging urban landscape. In 1969, all three liberal members of Austin’s city council, all of whom had backed the ordinance, were defeated, bringing the short-lived period of progressive racial politics in Austin to a close. The overwhelming grassroots support for institutional residential segregation reflected both national and southern trends from the period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144213479324">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Since the 1960s, urban historians have been documenting and analyzing the institutional and grassroots discrimination employed to create and maintain residential segregation in cities, and the devastating effects of urban renewal projects on inner city residents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144213479324">4</xref></sup> In the North, African American migration from the rural South during and after World War Two created pressures on urban housing markets as the number of African Americans swelled in cities. Thomas Sugrue, Arnold Hirsh, and Colin Gordon demonstrate that contrary to popular depictions of peaceful postwar liberal consensus and a rightward political turn engendered by urban riots in the late 1960s, racial battles over urban space in the North were common during the 1950s. More importantly, federal and local governments worked with private businesses to create a new suburban-focused geography that neglected central cities and their residents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144213479324">5</xref></sup> Oakland, home of the Black Panthers, similarly endured racial battles, violence, property value depreciation, tax base erosion, and white flight after 1945.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144213479324">6</xref></sup> Labor markets were not immune to the pressures of integration either as industries dispersed to rural and suburban areas and cut jobs for urban residents, particularly African Americans, in the decades following World War Two. Federal initiatives such as the GI Bill, FHA-guaranteed mortgages, and the interstate highway system facilitated white flight to the suburbs. Redlining, discriminatory lending and real estate practices, and racial covenants kept burgeoning suburbs racially homogenous as capital migrated to metropolitan peripheries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144213479324">7</xref></sup> Urban renewal programs devastated many inner cities, driving residents of means to the suburbs and forcing poor residents from their homes and into housing projects or areas of concentrated poverty. By the late 1960s, inner cities across the Midwest and East were increasingly African American, increasingly poor, and increasingly isolated, leading to the formation of what sociologist William Julius Wilson called “the truly disadvantaged,” a permanent underclass geographically and socioeconomically segregated in inner cities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144213479324">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>While Southern cities did not generally experience the heavy levels of immigration that Northern cities did, they often experienced heightened racial tensions and underwent urban renewal in the decades after World War Two even as overt racists were slowly removed from power and replaced by more business-minded political leaders. Often the circumstances of discrimination in Southern cities mirrored those in the North. In Atlanta and Miami, two Southern cities that experienced African American in-migration during the 1940s and 1950s, longstanding racial discrimination intensified after World War Two as demographic growth exacerbated racial fears among white residents and political leaders.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144213479324">9</xref></sup> In Birmingham and Richmond, younger, less overtly racist politicians removed the old guard from power, but used urban renewal projects to appease business elites with federal infrastructural assistance while maintaining segregation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144213479324">10</xref></sup> White flight occurred in every major Southern city as race-neutral ideology masked new highly structured, federally supported geographies of segregation in the growing suburbs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144213479324">11</xref></sup> While much work has been done on the structures that perpetuated racial inequality in major cities during the postwar period, a large gap still exists in the literature on smaller metropolitan areas and on emerging cities whose characteristics differed from both large industrial centers and Southern cities with more established economies.</p>
<p>Austin’s case exhibits many practices documented in both Northern and Southern cities: discriminatory lending and real estate practices, urban renewal programs that changed landscapes but rarely improved the lives of the poor, and grassroots resistance to integration. Unlike most industrial cities that attracted African Americans to mitigate unskilled labor shortages in the 1940s and 1950s, however, Austin’s business and political leaders focused on creating “industry without smokestacks” fueled by a “laboring class of cultured intellectuals.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144213479324">12</xref></sup> The University of Texas enhanced the city’s labor market by producing skilled workers that could be absorbed by research and other knowledge-based positions in an emerging military–industrial–academic complex.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144213479324">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>More importantly, however, and despite rigid segregationist practices that racially bifurcated the city in 1920s, Austin had a far more liberal political and social culture than most other Southern cities. Racial violence rarely occurred in the city and there were no major riots to speak of in Austin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144213479324">14</xref></sup> Owing in part to strong support for New Deal policies among politicians and a tolerant, open-minded university atmosphere, the area gained a reputation as a center of progressive politics in the South by the 1930s. At the behest of Lyndon Johnson and Mayor Tom Miller, both ardent New Dealers, Austin was one of the first cities to erect federally sponsored public housing in 1938. The city itself received more than $1.5 million in New Deal funding, an extremely high figure for a city its size. In the 1940s the removal of President Homer Rainey from the University of Texas and the Hemann Sweatt integration case at UT’s Law School both precipitated liberal outbursts against conservative ideologies. Emma Long and Ben White became the first two liberals on the Austin city council in the early 1950s, long before liberals won seats on most municipal councils in the South; by the mid-1960s three of the five city council members were liberals. African Americans and Latinos had a substantial, though unofficial, presence in the Austin political scene as early as the 1930s. Even conservative elements in Austin’s political culture were more like the business elites in other cities than overt segregationists who employed the language and tactics of white supremacy.</p>
<p>Yet despite this relative tolerance and a lack of racial violence endemic to many cities, Austin was one of the most segregated in the South through the 1960s. One reason for this was the lack of suburbs in Austin, which kept tax base, but also conservative whites, in the city rather than in distinct suburban municipalities. As late as 1973, more than 85% of Travis Country residents lived within the city limits. Austin also lacked the spatial pressures that characterized many older cities. But while there was always a significant liberal presence in Austin politics, racial relations reflected a more conservative tone. From the 1930s to the 1960s, being progressive in Austin usually meant supporting New Deal policies, encouraging strong ties to the federal government as a source of funding, and promoting responsible, nonindustrial growth much more than fighting racial inequality or rejecting the sanctity of private property rights. To be progressive indicated a desire to be modern, and to be modern meant building a nonindustrial city that catered to university-related growth models and suburban-style residential development. City leaders increasingly emphasized Austin’s nonindustrial, nonurban qualities and used federally sponsored urban renewal to highlight these qualities in the city’s landscape; this image of the city necessitated segregation, where “urban” elements, including industry and racial minorities, were kept out of view. Segregation thus helped to maintain a nonindustrial image that city leaders used to market Austin as a pleasant place to live and do business for knowledge workers.</p>
<p>Contextualizing the defeat of open housing in Austin with urban renewal illustrates the logical inconsistencies of the race-neutral appeal to property rights employed by Austin realtors and supported by many citizens. Even as poor minority residents were dispossessed and neighborhoods evacuated, oftentimes with no plans for relocations, opponents of open housing successfully deified private property rights. Today, the deleterious effects of segregation and dispossession are still felt among the city’s African American and Latino residents and current trends mirror those from the 1960s. Despite widespread and consistent economic and demographic growth in Austin, African Americans and Latinos household income in 2010 was roughly half of Anglo income, the same percentage as in 1970.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144213479324">15</xref></sup> Despite its relatively robust economy, Austin’s poverty rate in 2010 was more than 18 percent, almost 4 percent higher than the national average.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144213479324">16</xref></sup> Although the City of Austin grew by 76 percent between 1990 and 2010, its real African American population has grown by only 12 percent during that period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144213479324">17</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Skilled Labor Market and Growth Paradigms in Austin</title>
<p>Just before and during World War Two, Austin, like some other Southern cities, experienced an influx of federal capital based on wartime production needs and the federally sponsored program of decentralizing war-related industries. In Austin, this investment followed a series of federally funded hydroelectric dams that modernized and stabilized the region while also creating lakes that would potentially attract tourist revenue after the war. The shift in the geography of production had an immediate impact on many cities, and a literature of urban competitiveness quickly appeared that Austin business leaders adopted. For the chamber of commerce and the city council, this influx of capital engendered wholesale programs of urban marketing designed to attract diverse sources of investment after the war ended and emboldened businessmen who could potentially profit from faster growth. Although certain elements of the city had promoted growth in the past, the community usually chose moderate, state-driven growth (because of the university and the state government) and actively eschewed industrial growth because of its potentially deleterious effects on Austin’s quality of life. This view changed by war’s end as it became increasingly clear that agricultural employment, whose labor force dropped by three million people throughout the South during the war years alone, would continue to decline rapidly and that the region needed to remake its economy and its image. In the aftermath of the war, business and academic leaders realized that economic growth could be generated by state-sponsored research and development. For Austin, creating the scientific infrastructure to take advantage of the university’s skilled labor pool was paramount to creating a robust economy that was not dependent on heavy industry or unskilled labor. To growth advocates, this nonindustrial paradigm kept the ills of larger cities out of Austin while maintaining the natural landscape and quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144213479324">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The University of Texas and its ability to reproduce skilled labor power quickly became the centerpiece of Austin’s growth model. In the aftermath of the war, a new national discourse emerged that emphasized science and engineering. Scientific knowledge was increasingly viewed as a commodity, and people who commanded that knowledge were increasingly attractive as forms of human capital. A pamphlet produced by consulting engineers that chamber of commerce member Walter E. Long received in 1946 entitled “Planning of Research and Development Work” was indicative of the growing importance placed on knowledge. The pamphlet asserted that the need for efficiency during the war effort brought together planning and research for the first time; but the greatest change that the war created in terms of business was that “the key productive unit in Research is the scientist.” Their social capital also increased markedly, as technical jobs in the private sector, academia, and directly with the federal government flourished and cities sought to create incentives to attract skilled workers. In the immediate postwar period, the dearth of American scientists and engineers was viewed by many as the most critical issue in terms of human capital, and universities across the country, as well as the federal government, rapidly began prioritizing research-based science and engineering. As urban planner Richardson Wood wrote in 1948, in Austin a business’s suitability is determined by “the character of their personnel rather than the material field of interest. . . . [B]usinesses that have a large professional and skilled element [are preferable] to businesses that have a large unskilled or semi-skilled element.” While many Southern cities were beginning to enter the industrial and manufacturing market after World War Two, Austin’s focus was increasingly on personnel. In the emerging atomic culture of the postwar period, the knowledge economy, economic and industrial decentralization, and place production were becoming increasingly intertwined. Cities with an abundance of well-coordinated technological and human resources were thus primed to prosper—particularly cities that were not considered major targets for attack.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144213479324">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Massive federal investment in research and development drove the early information economy at universities around the country. Between 1940 and 1944, the federal budget for industrial research grew by over 1,000 percent in an effort to achieve technological dominance for the war effort. After the war ended, federal spending for military research and development grew even more quickly and was increasingly funneled into research universities; in 1948 the federal government was responsible for more than 53 percent of organized research at U.S. universities. Engineering and other defense-related disciplines grew rapidly at research universities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144213479324">20</xref></sup> In Austin, defense-based research was viewed as an economic engine that could stimulate urban growth while maintaining the city’s reputation for quality of life and natural beauty. By 1957, the University of Texas Board of Regents had determined that the university’s growth should focus on improving its status as a research institution; dramatic increases in enrollment were already a virtual certainty because of demographic growth in Texas and around the country. By focusing efforts on growth at the university, city leaders found that they could mitigate risk and get the federal government to sponsor early technological accumulation. Public investment in research and development could then stimulate private sector growth emanating from new labs, scientists, and engineering departments at the university.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144213479324">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Austin’s early research and development economy flourished as university and city leaders anticipated, by taking advantage of federal defense money and generating private development from it. The Balcones Research Center (BRC), an off-campus research facility donated to the university by the Surplus Property Administration in 1946, became the centerpiece. Directed by Professor J. Neils Thompson, who also served as the vice president of economic development for Austin’s chamber of commerce, the BRC grew rapidly throughout the 1950s to become the premiere public research facility in the Southwest by 1960. Thompson initially envisioned the BRC as the space where the dual purpose of sponsored research and advanced graduate and undergraduate training could unfold and as an asset for attracting a suitable portion of the available research capital that many aggressive universities were sure to court. He also saw that the BRC could provide something that most other universities’ facilities could not: research partnerships with private firms that found the space and materials at the BRC attractive. The city’s payrolls and the university’s funding and prestige could grow together if the BRC was properly organized and administered. And the BRC could further the public good in Texas by assisting with the state’s industrial expansion as well as providing a surplus of skilled labor that would fill the needs of private industries as Austin’s technological and research economy grew. Above all, Thompson clearly understood that technical knowledge was increasingly at the root of competitiveness and productivity, both in the public research domain and in the private industrial arena. Austin, unbound by fordist-style production facilities and a glut of unskilled labor, and boasting a continuous flow of skilled graduates and now the BRC, was in a prime position to take advantage. The center had grown to nineteen laboratories by 1951, fifteen of which were performing defense-related research. By 1952, the BRC was financially self-sustaining through research contracts, meaning that its operations required no tax-supported assistance from university coffers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144213479324">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>By 1960, dozens of small research and development and precision manufacturing outfits dotted Austin’s economic landscape. White Instrument Laboratories, Lacoste and Romberg, and Texas Nuclear Corporation, all of which had ties to university engineering departments, were some of the largest and most successful. The founding of the research and development corporation Texas Research Associates (TRACOR)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144213479324">23</xref></sup> in 1955, however, best demonstrated the growing links between publicly sponsored research and private development in Austin. TRACOR built its human capital from the highly specialized defense-oriented labs at University of Texas, especially the Defense Research Laboratory (DRL) and the Military Physics Research Laboratory (MPRL), the two largest labs at the BRC. TRACOR played a large role in keeping elite, young engineering talent in Austin as it steadily grew through the 1960s. The list of senior staff at TRACOR in the early 1960s was made up almost entirely of researchers and professors who also held positions at the university. Norman Hackerman, who was recruited to UT to chair the growing Department of Chemistry in 1952, joined TRACOR’s staff as a Senior Scientist in 1956 and eventually became president of the university in the late 1960s. By 1959, all twelve senior associates at TRACOR listed in the company’s brochure had worked or were working for the DRL and many were working in other university departments. Most of TRACOR’s talent was young as well; ten of the twelve had received a BA, MA, or PhD from UT since World War Two.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144213479324">24</xref></sup> TRACOR was able to easily adapt their technologies to commercial markets when the Department of Defense downsized its electronics expenditures in the 1960s, and its leadership’s business acumen allowed the company to diversify rapidly. TRACOR’s diversification also generated a number of spinoffs, and the type of development TRACOR initiated went on to define Austin’s successful high-tech businesses by the 1980s. In terms of human capital, the university quite literally engendered the private research and development market, and later semiconductor and other electronics production, in Austin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144213479324">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like much of the Sunbelt, Austin’s economic and demographic growth throughout the 1950s was brisk, consistent with other Texas cities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144213479324">26</xref></sup> In the 1960s, however, Austin began to demonstrate growth patterns that outstripped the region. In 1965, <italic>U.S. News and World Report</italic> listed Austin as one of the fourteen most desirable cities in which to live, based largely on its nonurban qualities such as public parks and schools. The city quickly began incorporating the honor into its marketing discourse. In 1967, the Bureau of Labor Statistics ranked Austin as the least expensive metropolitan area in the United States. By 1967, Austin had also moved ahead of the oil refining region Beaumont-Port Arthur as Texas’s fifth largest economy after attracting IBM, its first major high-tech relocation. Texas Instruments came in 1968. The de facto local investment provided by the university and state and government along with the new tech firms kept Austin’s unemployment among the lowest in Texas during the 1960s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144213479324">27</xref></sup> In Travis County, population grew by a robust 39 percent (from 212,000 to 296,000 residents, more than 83,000 people) between 1959 and 1969 (the national average was 17 percent); close to 85 percent of Travis County residents lived in Austin proper in 1975. In 1973, more than half of Travis County’s population had not lived in the area in 1963. The city was also getting bigger geographically. Between 1960 and 1973, Austin almost doubled in size, from roughly fifty to ninety square miles as population expanded out of the central city and into new residential developments near the urban periphery and growing subdivisions in the west and northwest portions of the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144213479324">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>With the population increase came an equally dramatic rise in income and employment: between 1959 and 1969 Austin’s per capita income rose by 41 percent and family income rose even further from $5,795 to $8,459, an increase of 46 percent. The number of total jobs in Austin grew just as sharply: from 79,000 in 1959 to 132,000 in 1969. Vic Mathias, Manager of the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, wrote that the economy was so robust that there were “job opportunities for all who want to work” in 1969.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144213479324">29</xref></sup> Throughout 1968 and 1969, Austin’s unemployment rate was projected to remain below 2 percent, far below the Bureau of Labor Statistics’s threshold for full employment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144213479324">30</xref></sup> The Federal Reserve Bank’s business activity index determined Austin had the fastest-growing economy in Texas in 1968 and 1969, and between 1968 and 1969 Austin’s manufacturing sector grew by nearly 24 percent, largely because of the growth of electronics production firms like TRACOR and IBM. Despite the growth in manufacturing, Travis County still ranked in the lowest 1 percent of manufacturing employment among counties with more than 100,000 residents, indicating a paucity of blue-collar jobs. In spite of a minor national recession, however, job growth was robust and consistent in the late 1960s as well, averaging a 6 percent annual increase. Between 1968 and 1969, retail sales increased 7 percent in Austin, indicating major increases throughout the 1960s as well as a general increase in surplus consumption throughout the decade.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144213479324">31</xref></sup> At one major bank in Austin, total available capital rose more than 300 percent between 1963 and 1968, from roughly $24 million to $73 million, a sign of intense economic activity in the city. Between 1958 and 1968, retail sales in Travis County increased by 84 percent to more than $400 million, and bank deposits grew by 177 percent to $675 million. The sharp increase in both population and personal income also had profound effects on the city’s tax rolls and budget. In the four years between 1965 and 1969, Austin’s city budget grew from $47 million to $75.5 million, an increase of nearly 60 percent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144213479324">32</xref></sup> By all statistical accounts, accumulation increased expeditiously in Austin during the 1960s and into the 1970s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144213479324">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>Surplus capital generated by economic growth and relocations was also increasingly reinvested in the secondary circuit of real estate, which underwent the most intense boom of all capital investments in 1960s Austin. Although Austin was only the sixty-seventh largest U.S. city in 1968, it ranked sixteenth in value of construction permits, with a total value of more than $131 million spread throughout 4,600 total permits. Both amounts broke building records set in 1967, indicating a sustained output of new construction in Austin during the decade.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144213479324">34</xref></sup> Employment in the construction sector rose 19 percent in just one year, reaching 8,000 workers in early 1968, roughly one in twenty adults living in Austin. Much of the building was generated by a large increase in the geography of government institutions surrounding the capital; between 1959 and 1968 six new buildings were built on the capital complex just north of downtown, totaling $15.7 million.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144213479324">35</xref></sup> In terms of residential building, Austin saw heavy competition for middle- and upper-income structures, but the market for families with low moderate income had “practically disappeared” according to a 1971 report.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144213479324">36</xref></sup> For minority residents segregated on the city’s Eastside, however, the city’s economic boom only exacerbated conditions of inequality that they had endured for decades.</p>

<title>Bifurcated City: The Physical and Mental Geography of Segregation</title>
<p>Racial relations in Austin from the early twentieth century until the 1950s were characterized mainly by exploitation, oppression, and segregation. Austin’s 1928 Master Plan, the first planning initiative for Austin since the city’s founding in 1839, laid the foundation for subsequent growth. Prepared by the Dallas engineering firm Koch and Fowler, the master plan’s main focus was land use, through zoning, in an effort to maintain the nonindustrial, nonurban qualities that characterized Austin in the city’s residential districts on the Westside. Keeping downtown and West Austin as pastoral as possible meant relocating residents and industries that did not fit the city’s desired image; thus, the initial purpose of the city’s Eastside, at the time relatively integrated space, was to hide undesirable but necessary components of the city’s fabric as well as racial minorities. The master plan bluntly stated that “there has been considerable talk in Austin, as well as other cities, in regard to the race segregation problem. This problem cannot be solved under any zoning law known to us at present. Practically all attempts at such have proved unconstitutional.” At the time, according to the master plan, African Americans lived in small pockets throughout all the city’s neighborhoods, with concentrations in Wheatsville and Clarksville,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144213479324">37</xref></sup> just to the northwest of downtown, and in the area just east of East Avenue adjacent to downtown. To sidestep the constitutional issues posed by institutional segregation, Koch and Fowler recommended that the city simply relocate segregated facilities, which were legal at the time, to one district and cut off facilities to minorities in all other parts of the city. Thus by locating African American schools, parks, and other municipal necessities in just one area, the segregation problem would take care of itself. They referred to this method of forced relocation as “an incentive to draw the negro population to this area.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144213479324">38</xref></sup></p>
<p>The policy implementations were swift and effective. City records demonstrate that almost all African Americans were relocated to the designated Eastside location by 1932. The African American school in Wheatsville, which had been operating for sixty years, closed in 1932. Although Latino segregation was not mandated in the plan, similar forces coalesced to push the vast majority of Austin’s Mexican American population into the neighborhood just south of the African American one, including the City of Austin building the first public housing units in the United States, Santa Rita Courts, which housed only Latinos. Latinos did, however, remain more dispersed throughout areas in South Austin and on the outskirts of the city, but very few lived in white West Austin. Racially restrictive covenants kept both African Americans and Latinos out of Anglo neighborhoods in West Austin. Additionally, the city cut African Americans and increasingly Latinos off from the centers of Austin’s collective pride and memory. The state government and the University of Texas, Austin’s centers of employment, knowledge, and power, stood also as symbols of discrimination to the disenfranchised Eastside community. Barton Springs Pool, the city’s recreational centerpiece and increasingly a symbol of Austin’s environmental movement, remained segregated well into the 1960s, as did Austin’s early system of streetcars and later buses. De facto segregation developed in shopping districts, movie theatres, and most other public areas, consistent with urban life in the American South during the Jim Crow era.</p>
<p>Most accounts of African American and Latino life in Austin from the 1930s through the 1950s portray a generally positive period marked by high levels of community cohesion and a relatively vigorous economic life defined by small businesses and networks of familial and neighborhood support. Despite municipal negligence in nearly every aspect of life, segregation brought minority communities together and kept relatively high levels of economic diversity in Eastside neighborhoods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144213479324">39</xref></sup> In hopes of creating additional incentives to force minorities to the Eastside, the city improved segregated facilities during the 1930s, including funding a large public park, building a library, and improving Johnston High School.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144213479324">40</xref></sup> Although public housing in Austin was strictly segregated and, because its function was more to demonstrate support for New Deal policies than to assist poor minorities, was not intended to house the city’s poorest residents, it was welcomed by minorities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144213479324">41</xref></sup> Yet major disparities in quality of life still existed between East and West Austin, and the Eastside was consistently subject to poorer, more dangerous living conditions, had less access to jobs and education, and was generally not considered part of mainstream economic, political, or social discourse in Austin. Aside from parks and beautification projects designed to attract tourists and businesses, the City of Austin was, like many Southern cities, reluctant to invest in managerial-type infrastructure. Amazingly, all sidewalks in Austin were privately funded until 1969. As of 1958, only forty-five percent of Austin’s surface streets were paved; a higher percentage of streets were unpaved in South and East Austin where concentrations of minorities existed. Eastside residents complained in letters about dangerous conditions in their neighborhoods from dilapidated infrastructure or municipal negligence. In 1955, the sewers became so clogged in one Eastside neighborhood that sewage backed up into the street for days before the city acted. When the University of Texas let out for summer, many of the city’s bus routes stopped running, which obviously had deleterious effects on residents without access to automobiles.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144213479324">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>African American and Latino residents suffered everyday forms of subtle and overt racial discrimination that ranged from contentious to dangerous. As of 1956, the City of Austin did not employ African American bus drivers, even on routes that went through large sections of East Austin.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144213479324">43</xref></sup> The municipal government hired few minorities at all outside of janitorial work. Numerous impoverished African American citizens felt mistreated by welfare agency personnel, some going so far as to forego their assistance checks rather than dealing with the agency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0096144213479324">44</xref></sup> One domestic worker wrote her congressman for assistance after the Travis County Welfare Agency would not help her when her disabled husband used an entire social security check, leaving her and three children to fend for themselves.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144213479324">45</xref></sup> In the transitioning neighborhood of Windsor Park, one man wrote to Senator John Tower, “I would greatly appreciate it if you could tell me if there is no way that treason by a nigger can be handled” after an unspecified incident.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144213479324">46</xref></sup> In some cases, overt forms of racism could have deadly consequences. During the 1950s at Brackenridge Hospital, the closest hospital to East Austin, white nurses were not required to care for black patients, who could easily be left unattended in any kind of medical condition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144213479324">47</xref></sup> Black doctors were not allowed to practice at the hospital either. Discrepancies in access to health care were often simply facts of life, and unfortunately death, for even prominent African Americans in Austin. In the early 1950s, Dr. Carl Downs, president of Samuel Huston College, died from an appendicitis after not having access to an emergency room at Brackenridge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144213479324">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>Austinites living east of East Avenue, particularly in the African American and Latino designated zones, had a much lower standard of living than Westside residents throughout the 1950s as well.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144213479324">49</xref></sup> The Mexican American majority area bounded by East Avenue on the west, First Street on the south, Springdale Avenue on the east, and Seventh Street on the north had the highest percentage of dilapidated housing in the central city, over 56 percent. “Dilapidated” was the worst classification of housing available according to Austin’s Urban Renewal Agency, indicating that the structure was not habitable and should be torn down. The majority Latino area just to the south and the African American neighborhood to the north did not fare much better; along with the downtown they were the only neighborhoods in the 41–55 percent dilapidated category. No neighborhood in South or West Austin had over 25 percent dilapidation, and a vast majority had fewer than 10 percent. A 1948 report by the Housing Authority of Austin found that roughly 75 percent of all dwellings between First Street and Nineteenth within one mile of East Avenue (roughly 1.5 square miles of virtually all African American and Latino residents) lacked a private bathroom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0096144213479324">50</xref></sup> The central Eastside had a far greater percentage of social and health problems than the rest of the city as well. Approximately two-thirds of all juvenile delinquency cases in Austin occurred in the central eastern neighborhoods, despite the fact that the area comprised less than 25 percent of the city’s population. Upwards of 75 percent of major crimes (aggravated assault, murder, rape, robbery) were reported in central East Austin. Often, clear cases of white-on-black violence were dismissed by police or victims were purposely deemed unreliable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144213479324">51</xref></sup> The area also made the vast majority of calls to the police, indicating a high rate of minor crime and other daily municipal problems. Central eastern neighborhoods also saw a rate of tuberculosis far greater than the rest of Austin, perhaps owing to a severe lack of health care professionals on the Eastside and legalized discriminatory practices among physicians in other areas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0096144213479324">52</xref></sup> Finally, slumlords were prevalent in central East Austin. In one 1962 study of 1,057 homes in a heavily dilapidated section of central East Austin, 96 percent of residents were either African American or Latino, while more than 55 percent of the real estate was owned by whites. Evidence suggests that the rate of home ownership in much of central East Austin actually declined between 1949 and 1962. Housing conditions were exacerbated by a de facto municipal policy that ignored zoning requirements on much of the Eastside. Poor renting conditions were another fact of life for marginalized East Austin residents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0096144213479324">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beginning in the late 1950s, the passive disinterest that the city had shown toward the Eastside took on a new, aggressive tone as urban renewal spread across cities around the country. From a community perspective, it appears obvious that East Austin was accustomed to institutional and often overt individual discrimination from the city and some white residents as well as a lower overall standard of living. Despite segregation, minority communities appear to have had a relatively high degree of autonomy and both formal and informal networks of resistance when oppression became intolerable. But as in many other American cities, urban renewal represented an entirely new and more damaging framework for race and class oppression. Segregation in Austin was for the most part a social phenomenon engrained in the landscape of the city and its collective consciousness. Urban renewal brought an overtly economic aspect into segregation; its policies encouraged politicians, university officials, developers, financiers, and contractors to profit from redeveloping large portions of minority areas to create jobs for white workers and stimulate the economy by improving infrastructure and the beauty of the central city.</p>
<p>In Austin, the powerful University of Texas was also a major factor in urban renewal. Administrators and regents viewed renewal as an opportunity to expand the cramped main campus in an era of skyrocketing enrollment, a new focus on research and expanded research facilities, and rapid urbanization around the campus. They viewed the university as entrepreneurial in the sense that it increasingly functioned like a business—not just in terms of research contracts or allocations for profit-making departments and facilities but also in terms of real estate and physical expansion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0096144213479324">54</xref></sup> In 1965, the state legislature institutionalized this aspect of university entrepreneurialism by granting the board of regents the right of eminent domain. Thus, urban renewal represented a regulatory aspect of capitalist development under the welfare state regime of accumulation: already profiting from widespread development on the urban periphery, power brokers in Austin now had carte blanche to imagine an inner city landscape based on the needs of capital and sanctioned by federal investment. This new landscape, of course, came largely at the expense of the dispossessed and minority residents living in East Austin.</p>
<p>Although legally urban renewal in Austin did not begin until 1962, the groundwork was set in motion by Title One of the Federal Housing Act of 1949, which provided for urban slum clearance and redevelopment funded largely by the federal government. The cleared sites were then given to private developers who created new housing, often at tremendous profit. In Austin, Title One precipitated a study of East Austin by a private consulting firm, which found an alarming amount of substandard housing. A plan to create additional public housing for African Americans on a plot of land just outside the city limits in Northeast Austin that was currently being used as an orphanage for black children was discussed, but the proposal was struck down because the land could be developed for white use. African American community leader Everett Givens discouraged the public housing project, arguing that it would damage race relations by attempting to integrate too quickly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0096144213479324">55</xref></sup> In 1954, a second housing act was passed that made renewal more enticing to developers by offering FHA-guaranteed mortgages. The 1954 act prompted the city council to continue studying the housing market in East Austin. For this task, the council appointed the city’s first committee dedicated to the area east of East Avenue, the Greater East Austin Development Committee, which was charged with studying the area almost exactly analogous to the designated African American and Latino neighborhoods on the Eastside. In 1957, the city created its own urban renewal department, which was then adopted under Texas state laws by a contentious referendum in 1959, which few minorities were able to vote in, creating the Austin Urban Renewal Agency.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0096144213479324">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>Partly as a reaction to the impending certainty of urban renewal and partly in anticipation of continued urbanization, in 1953 the city council also voted to fund an updated professional master plan for the city. Although the city carried out some smaller studies in the 1940s and 1950s, particularly regarding business development, no comprehensive plan had been developed since 1928. In 1953 the city council revised the city charter, providing for a planning commission that could make and amend master plans, make zoning recommendations, and establish general parameters for development that could be continually amended. Published in 1958 after five years of research, the plan imagined a geography that facilitated multiple forms of industrial production and knowledge work as well as altering the existing residential and commercial landscape of the city through zoning and urban renewal. The plan recognized that as national economic surplus increased and the economy diversified drastically during the postwar economic expansion, people and businesses would make locational decisions based on “the attractiveness of the community.” This entailed an “orderly removal and replacement of those areas that have become obsolete and fallen into disrepair.” Creating these conditions would not only be an attractive feature to prospective businesses, residents, and tourists, it would also create a landscape “of which the people are proud.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0096144213479324">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>To provide for the attractiveness of the community while simultaneously encouraging economic growth, the master plan proffered industrial development away from areas planned for retail and residential development or public areas. The first industrial area, which conformed to the rough parameters of the BRC tract and its environs to the Northwest of residential and commercial areas, appeared as a research and development facility that would be central to Austin’s informational cluster. This area would provide the centerpiece for accumulation via knowledge work while retaining a low profile away from civic and public centers yet in proximity to Austin’s growing middle- and upper-middle-class subdivisions. Another industrial zone was planned for the area near the Perimeter Loop (now Highway 71) and the East Avenue expressway, far to the south in an undeveloped area of the city. Finally, the third major industrial area was bounded by First Street, East Avenue, Seventh Street, and Loop 183. This area conformed to the majority Latino neighborhood on the Eastside, which contained the highest concentration of Latinos in the city, some poor whites and African Americans, as well as the highest concentration of dilapidated housing. In the small adjacent area between First Street and the Colorado River, the master plan envisioned a public parkway separated from the industrial zone by a wide boulevard. The parkway would also displace hundreds of residents living on the river’s flood plain below First Street. Under the plan’s provisions, they would not get to reap the benefits of the Longhorn Dam, which eradicated major flooding that often occurred along the river when completed in 1960. To facilitate transportation between the research-oriented park to the north and the production facilities to the east, the plan also advocated finishing a major highway, known locally as Research Road, which circumvented the residential areas of the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0096144213479324">58</xref></sup></p>
<p>Austin’s master plan thus inscribed a geography of power and dominance onto the landscape of the Eastside, with little regard for the community. Despite an almost endless supply of undeveloped land throughout the city and on the periphery, the master plan advocated razing an entire neighborhood to centralize industrial production. The plan’s brash statement about the neighborhood envisions it as little more than space to be emptied. Industrial discourse erases people from the landscape: “Austin can take advantage of the urban renewal legislation in the industrial development of the East Area. This primary industrial area is now cut into many parcels. Approximately one-third of its area is covered by housing, much of which is substandard. The area will need to be cleared and the parcels reassembled into sizes and shapes more suitable for industry before this prime location can achieve its potential.” Under the urban renewal law passed in Texas, even homeowners whose property was deemed acceptable could not save it from eminent domain if the structure was not “consistent with the plan for the area,” indicating that an industrial district would be zoned for single use and all residents would be removed regardless of the quality of their structure. Even residents whose homes were deemed substandard were often perfectly satisfied with them and considered their communities as homes populated by families. One Eastside resident related the widespread notion that “slum clearance” indicated that urban renewal would replace minority neighborhoods with slums, not that the neighborhoods were slums in the first place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0096144213479324">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the eastern industrial zone did not materialize, it was an ongoing concern for Eastside residents who anticipated removal and dispossession based on the city’s racial history and widespread urban renewal projects initiated during the 1960s. The neighborhood did become the center of most industrial-style production in Austin, however. In place of the public park that the master plan envisioned for the north bank of Town Lake east of IH 35, in the late 1950s the city began dispossessing the mostly Latino residents on a twenty-two-acre parcel of land adjacent to the reservoir to build Holly power plant. Built during the 1960s, at its peak the plant provided 20 percent of Austin’s electricity and had a capability of 570 megawatts of power. Dozens of residents were evicted and their homes razed to make room for the power plant, the city’s largest and most centralized power-generating facility at the time. For years, the plant was a source of constant irritation for neighborhood residents because of the noise and pollution it created. Numerous times it became a dangerous environmental hazard to the neighborhood; major fuel spills occurred nine times between 1974 and 1993, some of which ignited into fires. Eastside environmental activists have claimed that the plant has caused numerous health problems among residents, including tumors and birth defects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0096144213479324">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>One major infrastructural project that urban renewal ideology facilitated in Austin was the completion of IH 35, which further institutionalized the symbolic and actual barrier between East and West Austin when it was built directly over East Avenue, for decades the line of racial demarcation between Anglo West Austin and minority East Austin. In many larger cities, federally funded expressways eviscerated existing working and middle class neighborhoods and worked in consort with other urban renewal projects to segregate poor minority residents. In Austin, the expressway, completed in 1962, reinscribed a physical and mental landscape of segregation on central Austin in a much more brutal and impassable form. East Avenue was a wide parkway with a naturally landscaped center and multiple cross streets connecting east and west. Residents on either side could enjoy the parkway and also easily view the other side. In its place rose the mammoth structure, twenty feet high in some areas, which created an actual wall between the already disparate communities. Together, IH 35 and the new Research Road around the city’s northern and eastern perimeter expedited traffic flow through and around the city, and like in many metropolitan areas, allowed for a significant increase in development around the urban periphery and along the nodes created to the north and south of town. They also inscribed a more rigid form of segregation on the landscape as race and class barriers.</p>
<p>Urban renewal projects altered the Eastside landscape dramatically during the 1960s, even as the civil rights movement crested in Austin and elsewhere. Because almost all power to determine the quality of structures, neighborhoods, or public facilities was legally given to the city, residents had almost no say in the fate of their property. Language and images distributed by the Austin Urban Renewal Agency (AURA) assuaged what little opposition to urban renewal remained among Anglo Austinites. The urban renewal agency simply needed to declare 50 percent of the structures in any given area “dilapidated beyond reasonable rehabilitation” or otherwise blighted in order to condemn the entire area. Because historically the municipal government did not consider zoning important in East Austin, and because it was extremely difficult for minorities to acquire loans to buy or improve property in East Austin, a large number of structures on the Eastside were considered substandard.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0096144213479324">61</xref></sup> All five major urban renewal projects in Austin affected some areas of the Eastside, and two focused exclusively on the Central Eastside neighborhoods of Kealing and Glen Oaks. Large tracts of the central Eastside were razed; it is unclear exactly how many acres were redeveloped or residents dislocated, but as of June 1966 nearly 1,000 acres were scheduled for clearance and/or rehab in East Austin, and at least 250 of those acres were in central East Austin which was virtually all African American.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0096144213479324">62</xref></sup> This statistic did not include the university’s proposed eastward expansion, which targeted the northwest portion of the traditional African American area.</p>
<p>The greatest conundrum for policy makers and planners was relocating displaced residents, particularly the elderly and impoverished. The Texas Urban Renewal Law specifically forbade any property acquired through urban renewal to be used for public housing, which meant that private low-cost housing would be necessary for thousands of displaced residents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0096144213479324">63</xref></sup> The urban renewal law did not, however, give any indication of how dispossessed citizens without accommodations would be handled, other than giving cities the power to “plan and assist in relocation.” While Austin was one of the first cities to construct public housing specifically for African Americans and Latinos in the late 1930s, by the 1960s they had long waiting lists. Because public housing was still technically segregated until 1968 in Austin, early victims of dispossession could not apply for relocation to white-designated public housing units. An AURA newsletter confirmed the dire situation that African Americans in need of public housing faced in 1964: the entire city only had 429 African American–designated public housing units (less than one per thirty African American residents), and only thirty-two more units were planned, despite the obvious dislocation of many disadvantaged citizens that urban renewal would create.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0096144213479324">64</xref></sup> A 1966 issue of <italic>Austin in Action</italic> claimed that most residents displaced from Kealing “had been moved to better living facilities through their own initiative,” but this claim appears spurious. Even those African American residents who found their way into segregated public housing often found unhealthy and sometimes dangerous conditions. At the Booker T. Washington homes in the eastern part of central East Austin, which contained roughly 300 low-rise units built in 1953, there were more than hundred fires reported in the first twenty years of existence. In 1960, rat infestation became so overwhelming that two local companies donated more than 1,000 pounds of poison to residents. By 1984, the entire complex was deemed unsafe for habitation and was evacuated for five years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0096144213479324">65</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the data regarding displacement is lacking, numerous vociferous members of the Eastside community voiced their displeasure with urban renewal in letters to community leaders and politicians. In response to a letter from an evicted woman whose new apartment would not be ready for months, provided one was available, Congressman J.J. Pickle admitted to a severe shortage of low-income housing in Austin, which made relocating disadvantaged citizens more difficult than anticipated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0096144213479324">66</xref></sup> Although Pickle demonstrated empathy in his letter, he voted against open housing in Washington, which would have dramatically increased available housing stock for Austin’s African American citizens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0096144213479324">67</xref></sup> Others wrote to alert Pickle that urban renewal had negatively affected many citizens in Eastside neighborhoods. Perhaps most poignantly, Frederick B. Scott noted that many African Americans, some living on a pension, were unable to purchase a home or afford a suitable apartment with the money that the government paid them for their property. To Scott, the ubiquity of African Americans who could not afford property after they were forced to sell indicated that urban renewal officials and real estate agents lied to community members about the availability of affordable housing in Austin. Efforts to redevelop sections of the Eastside were viewed as bald attempts on the part of developers and politicians to increase accumulation by further dispossessing marginalized citizens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0096144213479324">68</xref></sup> The Blackshear Residents Organization (BRO), representing one of the poorest, most dilapidated Eastside districts, fought against the $1.8 million urban renewal plan for their community. At a 1969 meeting between the city and Blackshear residents, J. E. Mosely, president of BRO, claimed urban renewal would result in “bulldozers cleaning us all out” and that redevelopment would not benefit citizens in the neighborhood. BRO was able to postpone urban renewal in Blackshear until federal funding was not renewed in 1973, preserving almost the entire neighborhood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0096144213479324">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>Compounding the issue of real estate dispossession was the virtual absence of new housing starts for low- to moderate-income families in Austin during the late 1960s and early 1970s despite the vigorous real estate market in Austin described earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0096144213479324">70</xref></sup> The paucity of new low income housing in Austin was due to a number of factors, including rapid growth in more lucrative middle- and upper-class markets. But again, institutional racism under the guise of private property rights appears to have played a significant role in home building and lending practices. Unlike other Southern and Southwestern markets, in Austin FHA 235 loans were “practically an unknown quantity” according to a 1971 report. Created under the Federal Housing Act of 1968, FHA 235 loans were designed to assist low-income citizens by allowing them to pay a set percentage of their monthly income as a mortgage payment. The government could pay a significant percentage of the mortgage interest directly as well, subsidizing monthly cost for the recipient. In Austin, however, the strong resistance to racial mobility, emphasis on personal freedoms, and the institutional framework of real estate and banking networks made securing FHA 235 loans very difficult, especially for minorities. Similarly, the apartment market maintained virtual segregation through advertising practices and racially based social networks among real estate agents and their clientele. The same 1971 report baldly stated that, “the Austin apartment dwellers (non-students) have a society that is pretty much their own. Because of this, the most effective form of advertising is word of mouth. Although they do watch newspaper ads, approximately eighty percent of people interviewed indicated that they heard about the apartment they rented from a friend.” Existing residential and social segregation thus largely determined networks for finding accommodations in Austin and contributed to ongoing physical and mental segregation for both white and minority residents.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0096144213479324">71</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Austin, urban renewal policies were obvious indicators of the status of African Americans and Latinos in the larger community, as well as examples of what David Harvey calls “accumulation by dispossession,” directly assuming control of another’s resources for a nominal price and turning that property into profit. Almost completely devoid of agency or political voice in West Austin, poor minority residents were often dispossessed at the whims of politicians, developers, and University of Texas administrators. Discrimination was sanctioned largely by a discourse, espoused by much of the business and political community in Austin, which considered urban renewal a key facet to modernizing Austin—to make it more attractive for investment and continued urbanization in a specifically nonurban mode. Ironically, real estate developers and growth-minded politicians who claimed that private property rights were sacrosanct had no problem developing land that had been acquired by the state under eminent domain and against the wishes of property owners. Despite civic leaders’ claims to the contrary, in the decades after urban renewal the central Eastside endured a sharp rise in poverty and crime, as residents of means moved further East and Northeast and poverty became concentrated. Although the neighborhood’s central location gave residents access to many other areas after segregation ended, the area actually became more economically and socially segregated from the rest of the city. Overall lack of income was endemic to historically minority neighborhoods in central East Austin. In 1977, 87 percent of central East Austin was deemed “low income” by the Community Development Block Grant application for that year.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0096144213479324">72</xref></sup> In 1970, the central Eastside had a poverty rate of 37.5 percent. By 1990, the rate of poverty had risen to a staggering 52 percent, an almost unbelievable total in a city with one of the highest rates of economic growth and employment in the United States during the 1980s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0096144213479324">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>Housing stock in Austin’s central Eastside locations did not show marked improvements in the years following urban renewal either. Unlike areas that the university annexed, parts of the Brackenridge Tract and the University East area, which demonstrated a significant decline in substandard housing by 1977, concentrated African American and Latino neighborhoods further into the Eastside had similar levels of dilapidation as they did when surveyed in the early 1960s. The historically African American community area bounded by IH 35, MLK, Airport Boulevard, and Seventh Street had 51 percent substandard housing stock according to the city’s Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) application for 1977. The two historically Latino neighborhoods to the south (together bounded by IH 35, Seventh Street, Springdale Road, and the Colorado River) separated by First Street had 53.4 and 65 percent substandard housing stock, respectively. Clearly, urban renewal projects did not target the most disadvantaged minority citizens in Austin; they were rather processes of accumulation that favored Westside business and political interests in remaking selected portions of the landscape for profit and growth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0096144213479324">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>Urban renewal must be viewed, however, within the dual framework of historical racial discrimination in Austin and the city’s decision to encourage economic growth through nonindustrial development. Austin’s rapid economic expansion during the 1960s had very little positive benefit for its minority communities, as city leaders and business people focused on attracting external workers to expand skilled labor markets in the city and especially at the university. Austin capitalists had never concentrated on producing adequate internal labor power because of the nonindustrial quality of its industries. Thus, most unskilled laborers were highly expendable because the reproduction of their labor power served little purpose in a local economy with such a paucity of heavy industry. This facet of production also helps to explain the extreme mental segregation exhibited by Austinites: unlike areas with more fordist production, which by the 1950s generally indicated some workplace integration, in Austin minority and white members of the same class rarely worked together, as each group filled specific niches in smaller industries. Not only did the growth of the 1960s remain unfulfilled for most minority Austinites, urban renewal sought to expand accumulation by taking advantage of the surplus created by the boom, which meant profiting from expanding real estate values around but not necessarily in central East Austin as well as on the urban periphery. For minority residents, discrimination actually increased: socially sanctioned residential and public segregation in the 1930s grew into aggressive socioeconomic oppression by the 1960s that included appropriating minority space for profit. Viewed through this lens, it becomes increasingly apparent that while the end of segregation may have adversely affected the cohesion of previously concentrated minority communities, the concomitant dispossession of thousands of minority residents likely had a similarly deleterious effect on the community.</p>
<p>While most narratives portray the slow improvement of race relations after the contentious battles fought over Civil Rights in the late 1950s and early 1960s, in Austin racial tension appears to have increased throughout the decade. Even in the 1970s they remained almost entirely distinct communities with little shared history or space outside of Austin’s emerging nightclub scene. School desegregation in Austin was as contentious as anywhere in the South; among other tactics, the Anglo school board attempted to appease federal judges in the 1960s by integrating African Americans with Latinos, who were considered white under Texas’s antiquated constitution. A thirteen year federal school desegregation suit that began in 1970 followed. Tension in the schools and the incredible grassroots opposition to the Fair Housing Ordinance demonstrated that a wide variety of white Austinites were hostile towards integration, not just politicians and business interests. Despite a number of liberals on the city council and a growing progressive movement emanating from the university in the 1960s, Austin’s racial tensions mirrored much of the South.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0096144213479324">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>While African Americans did begin to move out of the central Eastside in the 1960s and 1970s, their dispersal reflected an extension of segregated patterns rather than an erosion of them. Most moved further East and Northeast into new housing developments that were highly segregated. West of IH 35, only one neighborhood, unincorporated, historically African American Clarksville, which did not receive municipal services, had less than 85 percent white residents. Outside of Clarksville, only one neighborhood on the Westside had greater than 5 percent African American population in 1970, and only one neighborhood in the growing upper-middle-class neighborhoods west of Lamar was greater than 1 percent African American population. That tract was less than 5 percent African American.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0096144213479324">76</xref></sup> Minority concentration in East Austin was even more acute. In 1977, the historic African American neighborhood bounded by IH 35, MLK, Airport Boulevard, and Seventh Street was 99 percent minority. The historically Latino neighborhood bounded by IH 35, Seventh Street, Springdale Road, and First Street was 92 percent minority. That percentage increased as most of the small remaining Anglo community in the East Cesar Chavez neighborhood left during the 1970s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0096144213479324">77</xref></sup> Economically Austin was an increasingly bifurcated city by 1970 as well. The poverty rate in central East Austin, for example, was 37.5 percent, nearly double that of the rest of the city and during a period of less than 2 percent unemployment in Travis County.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0096144213479324">78</xref></sup> Wealth in Austin in 1970 was highly concentrated. Although per household income was $10,529, 33 percent of Austin households had an income of less than $5,000 and 68.5 percent had incomes less than $10,000. These data suggest that only 44 percent of Austin residents could afford to buy housing in 1971 because of the paucity of low to moderately priced residential buildings. The data also suggest that urban economies based on high-tech production in the 1960s demonstrated a high concentration at the top of the socioeconomic spectrum and a high level of economic marginalization. Many minorities were cut off from not only home ownership but also from any kind of mainstream economic life in Austin, regardless of their location. Economic data by race clearly demonstrated a highly bifurcated city in 1970 as well: African American per capita income was 52.3 percent of the average, while Latino per capita income was 59.3 percent of the average. Because minority statistics were included in the average, minority income was almost certainly an even lower percentage of the average income of Anglos in Austin. Clearly Austin had a significant economic gap during the 1960s, and that gap was highly characterized by race.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0096144213479324">79</xref></sup></p>
<p>Grassroots, race-neutral appeals to private property rights in the fight over open housing in 1968, then, rang hollow despite their enormous popularity because they rested upon the racist application of eminent domain policies and reflected the irony inherent in Austin’s growth. African American residents, dispossessed and uprooted by federally sanctioned, locally sponsored urban renewal, did not enjoy those same private property rights or share in the city’s overall economic improvements in the postwar period. In fact, they suffered the abuses of government-sponsored renewal disproportionately and saw little benefit from the accumulation generated by the improvement of their property. Ideologically, a wide chasm existed between Keynesian attitudes about the ability of the liberal state to create a better way of life and liberal social politics that sought to confer that way of life to all citizens. Rigidly segregated residential and social geography was thus also an important component of the city’s identity as nonindustrial. The focus on skilled labor markets, along with strict residential segregation, allowed <italic>Austin in Action</italic>, the chamber of commerce magazine, to boldly claim that Austin “is primarily a city of upper middle-class citizens” in an article that documented the city’s attractive features. The piece went on to quote an article from <italic>Industrial Development</italic> at length:<disp-quote>
<p>Austin can concentrate on offering the specialized facilities of an intellectual center without having to duplicate within its own limits the service functions of a large city or the large scale facilities of a heavy fabrication center. . . . This gives the city the opportunity to build up its amenities and retain the small-city convenience and flexibility that might well be lost if it were trying to push its way to the fore as an all purpose metropolitan center in its own right.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Clearly the perception that Austin was not really a city, without the major problems manifesting themselves in many American cities throughout the 1960s, was seen as a very attractive feature by Austin’s growth advocates and presumably by the “laboring class of cultured intellectuals” they wished to attract. For most minorities, however, improved standards of living and economic opportunities remained elusive in the midst of urban growth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0096144213479324">80</xref></sup></p>

<p>Clarksville, the first colony of free African Americans in Texas, remained unincorporated by the City of Austin and almost entirely African American well into the 1970s as the city literally grew around it.
