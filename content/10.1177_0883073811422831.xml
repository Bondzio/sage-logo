<abstract>
<p>Stem cell transplantation is an investigational therapy for multiple sclerosis. The authors describe a case of catastrophic demyelinating encephalomyelitis following stem cell transplantation in a 17-year-old girl. Nine months after an initial diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, she underwent stem cell transplantation in Costa Rica. Subsequently, she deteriorated and was transported back to the United States with headache and vomiting progressing to quadriparesis, locked-in syndrome, and superimposed encephalopathy. Magnetic resonance imaging and brain biopsy were consistent with fulminant demyelinating encephalomyelitis with enhancing parenchyma and leptomeninges. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis and high protein. The protracted illness required tracheostomy and gastrostomy. After methyleprednisone, intravenous immunoglobulin, and cyclophosphamide, she improved during 2.5 months to an ambulatory, functionally independent state. Subsequently, typical less severe multiple sclerosis relapses occurred. This case demonstrates that stem cell transplantation may provoke life-threatening encephalomyelitis in patients with multiple sclerosis. This highlights the need to restrict transplantation to trials with appropriate safety controls.</p>

<p>Multiple sclerosis is an incurable neuroinflammatory disease. Stem cell transplantation has shown some promise as a potential therapy to ameliorate disease in mouse and primate models.<sup>

</sup> The complete spectrum of stem cell and neuroinflammatory interaction remains to be discovered and their underlying mechanisms elucidated. Proposed mechanisms of stem cell transplantation include differentiation plasticity (cell replacement or transdifferentiation) and therapeutic plasticity via bystander effects such as immunomodulation and remyelination.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811422831">3</xref>
</sup> These effects are appealing yet incompletely understood. We present a complicated case of encephalomyelitis following stem cell transplantation that highlights the need for further clinical study to better understand this interaction to prevent serious complications.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073811422831">
<title>Patient and Methods</title>
<p>We reviewed the clinical, imaging, laboratory, and pathological data in a patient with multiple sclerosis exposed to intrathecal and intravenous stem cells without a conditioning regimen of immunosuppression in Costa Rica. The initial course of multiple sclerosis, stem cell transplantation, and subsequent illness are described.</p>
<p>A 17-year-old girl with a history of multiple sclerosis of 9 months’ duration presented for evaluation of worsening encephalomyelitis to our inpatient rehabilitation unit. The patient was initially diagnosed at another institution with multiple sclerosis following an episode of right leg paresthesia and weakness. Her initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid results were consistent with the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. She was treated with methylprednisolone for 5 days and had a resolution of her symptoms. She subsequently had 5 MRI-confirmed relapses despite treatment with glatiramer acetate (Copaxone, Teva Neurosciences, North Wales, Pennsylvania). With her various relapses, she noted either right leg numbness, ataxia, arm incoordination, or diplopia; but she recovered completely with each relapse following methylprednisolone. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed typical findings of active multiple sclerosis: several fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense lesions in the right parietal and frontal juxtacortical white matter, the bilateral periventricular white matter, the body of the corpus callosum, and bilaterally in the cerebellum. One of the periventricular white matter lesions showed contrast enhancement on T1.</p>
<p>The family expressed concern about the recurrent relapses despite medical therapy and arranged for the patient to undergo stem cell transplantation in Costa Rica. The family had learned about the center through their extensive research on the Internet. Immediately prior to her trip, the patient complained of mild balance difficulty that was similar to her previous relapses.</p>
<p>For her stem cell transplantation, a conditioning regimen of immunosuppression was not used. The patient received 4 intrathecal doses of allogenic CD 34+ mesenchymal stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, as well as 2 infusions of autologous adipose-derived stem cells obtained by liposuction. During the course of treatments, the patient developed headache, nausea, vomiting, and difficulty with ambulation.</p>
<p>The family became increasingly concerned; and the patient was urgently transported back to the United States, where she had worsening encephalopathy, bilateral papilledema, hearing loss, quadriparesis, and locked-in syndrome. She was taken to an institution other than ours, where an MRI demonstrated patterns consistent with extensive demyelination. Cerebrospinal fluid studies revealed white blood cells of 139/µL (94% lymphocytes), protein 286 mg/dL, and normal glucose. Testing for Lyme disease, syphilis, coccidiodes, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 6, and tuberculosis were unremarkable. She received an initial course of methylprednisone and intravenous immunoglobulin, which temporarily halted progression of the condition but did not reverse it. She was transferred to our institution for inpatient rehabilitation. At this stage, her neurological examination revealed minimal drowsiness with the ability to communicate by mouthing words and use of a board. She had a quadriparesis with some antigravity movement in her upper extremities and minimal movement in her bilateral lower extremities. She suffered hearing loss on the right.</p>
<p>Within 4 days of arrival to rehabilitation, the patient developed worsening weakness and cranial nerve function, followed by hypothermia and respiratory failure. She was readmitted to the intensive care unit. Neurological examination revealed eye opening to pain only, intact corneal reflex of the right cornea only, sluggishly reactive pupils, absent oculocephalic reflexes, mildly increased tone, normal reflexes, and extensor plantar responses bilaterally. An electroencephalogram to evaluate for nonconvulsive status epilepticus revealed diffuse slowing of the background in the delta range. Repeat MRI revealed florid fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities and enhancement consistent with demyelination involving the centrum semiovale, corpus callosum, brain stem, and spinal cord, as well as subarachnoid space enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811422831">Figure 1</xref>
). As compared with pretransplantation imaging, these findings were more extensive and included additional areas of involvement. Repeat cerebrospinal fluid evaluation demonstrated persistent but improved pleocytosis (white blood cells 39/µL) and a persistently elevated protein (protein 286 mg/dL). Cytology was consistent with typical lymphocytes. Brain biopsy of the affected areas in the pons and corpus callosum confirmed extensive demyelination in a pattern typical of multiple sclerosis, with relatively well-circumscribed plaques, accumulation of CD-68 positive myelin-laden macrophages, and preservation of axons. There was a mononuclear infiltrate of lymphocytes that lacked a significant T cell component (CD-3) to the inflammation. Additional testing with CD-34 immunohistochemistry failed to reveal stem cells in the lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073811422831">Figure 2</xref>
).</p>

<p>While in the intensive care unit, methylprednisone 1 gram (2 mg/kg) twice daily for 5 days followed by 5 cycles of 1:1 volumes of plasma exchanges and a single dose of cyclophosphamide (1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) were administered. Her neurological deficits required a prolonged ICU stay, and a temporary tracheostomy and gastrostomy became necessary. Gradual improvements of her overall condition ultimately ensued, and she was transferred to the inpatient rehabilitation unit.</p>
<p>At 2.5 months posttransplantation, her examination revealed normal alertness and orientation, saccadic pursuits of eye movements, and intact hearing. She remained ataxic and required a walker for ambulation. At 4 months posttransplantation, she had mildly impaired smooth pursuits and bilateral dysdiadochokinesia. She used a cane for ambulation with a wide-based gait and was unable to perform tandem gait. During the ensuing months, she had clinical relapses and increased disease activity on MRI, necessitating Natalizumab treatment; however, these relapses were not as severe as those seen following stem cell transplantation.</p>
<p>During the patient’s posttransplantation illness, her experience was posted online in stem cell patient discussion forums to bring balance to the anecdotes. This posting was subsequently removed by some of the websites.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This case illustrates severe meningoencephalomyelitis that was temporally related to and likely triggered by stem cell transplantation. To our knowledge, encephalomyeltitis has not been reported as a complication of stem cell transplantation for multiple sclerosis. We hypothesize that the severe immune reaction observed in this patient was likely secondary to the stem cell treatment and resulted from the interaction between the pre-existing neuroinflammatory milieu related to active multiple sclerosis and the transplanted stem cells. We believe that such an unexpected, dramatic immune response arises from the predisposition of her immune system to recognize potentially immunogenic antigens, otherwise inert for most individuals.</p>
<p>In animal models, certain myelin proteolipid protein epitopes have been shown to be encephalitogenic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811422831">4</xref>
</sup> Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with multiple sclerosis have shown in vitro increased immunoreactivity to these proteolipid protein peptides.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811422831">5</xref>
</sup> Moreover, the concept of an encephalitogenic reaction developing in some patients with multiple sclerosis and not in others was demonstrated during a phase II clinical trial with a myelin basic protein peptide (amino acids 83-99). An altered peptide ligand was designed as an immunotherapy for multiple sclerosis; and in a subgroup of patients, the encephalitogenic potential of this peptide led to exacerbations of the disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811422831">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Another consideration is the occurrence of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis post–stem cell transplantation. This has been reported following autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811422831">7</xref>
</sup> This report suggests that it is unnecessary for the immune system to be primed against nervous system antigens prior to stem cell transplantation for this complication to occur. Taken together with our case, we suggest that the presence of an antigenic challenge is the likely trigger, rather than the pluripotency of the transplanted cells. Conditions arguing against the use of the term <italic>acute disseminated encephalomyelitis</italic> to describe the reaction in our patient are the occurrence within 1 week of beginning transplantation, underlying diagnosis and subsequent course of multiple sclerosis, as well as clinical and radiographic worsening in spite of steroid and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy.</p>
<p>Based on neuroimaging and pathology, this patient appears to have a diffuse fulminant encephalomyelitis. The challenge is in distinguishing whether this event represents a severe exacerbation of her underlying multiple sclerosis or a superimposed acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. There is debate in the literature on distinguishing the two radiographically. None of the currently available criteria have adequate sensitivity and specificity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811422831">8</xref>
</sup> Imaging demonstrating multiple nearly continuous pericallosal lesions may be more suggestive of a multiple sclerosis exacerbation than acute disseminated encephalomyelitis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811422831">9</xref>
</sup> The brain stem lesions appear unusual for both acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and multiple sclerosis. The pathology observed in our patient may support either entity, although note is made of features favoring multiple sclerosis: well-demarcated plaque and the absence of perivascular sleeves of demyelination.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811422831">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811422831">11</xref>
</sup> Another proposed explanation for steroid-responsive white matter disease after stem cell transplantation is graft-versus-host disease. However, in the absence of systemic manifestations of graft-versus-host disease and the paucity of T cell lymphocytes on biopsy, this is unlikely.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811422831">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811422831">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>A limitation of this report is that we are unable to confirm that the inflammatory response is directly related to antigenic challenge by stem cell transplantation, in spite of the temporal association and absence of stem cells in the biopsy. Additionally, neither are we able to generalize these observations to all patients with multiple sclerosis, nor are we able to estimate the likelihood of this complication occurring in populations exposed to stem cell transplantation. However, the severity of encephalomyelitis following the intervention speaks for a massive, diffuse immune response triggered by an antigen of great encephalitogenic potential for our patient’s particular immune system, whose high reactivity is suggested by the relatively high number of clinical relapses documented since the onset of the disease. Whether the relationship between aggressive multiple sclerosis and this complication is coincidental or contributory is important, given that it has been proposed that young patients with aggressive multiple sclerosis be a target group for stem cell transplantation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811422831">14</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This case highlights the need to better understand the interaction between the immune system in multiple sclerosis and transplanted stem cells. We argue that these investigational therapies be offered only as part of well-controlled and safety-monitored studies.</p>
<p>Physicians have a pivotal role in investigating and developing therapies for incurable illnesses. With rapid, unregulated communication in the form of the Internet and ease of travel, our patients and their families are vulnerable to direct-to-consumer advertising of investigational, unregulated, and potentially harmful therapies. This poses significant challenges in educating our patients and ensuring they are making informed decisions.</p>
