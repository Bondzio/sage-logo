<p>I am grateful to all my commentators for their thoughtful and constructive reflections. Both sets of comments focus on two basic issues: (a) What is the proper definition of empathy?; (b) What is the morality of empathy?</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754073911421396">Düringer and Döring (2012)</xref> take issue with my distinction between basic and complex empathy, arguing that empathy should be limited to what we can know immediately and unmistakably about others’ intentions or feelings. Understanding <italic>why</italic> someone feels or intends what they do is beyond empathy proper, implicating knowledge of other people’s beliefs as well. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754073911421396">Zahavi (2012)</xref>, on the other hand, noting the lack of overall consensus on a precise definition of empathy, endorses the idea that “the why?” question should be considered as part of what we mean by empathy. Let me just say that one of the primary reasons I call for more ethnographic studies of empathy-like processes in context is because I agree with Zahavi that there currently exists much confusion over what it is we mean by empathy, and that we need to be familiar with the varieties of empathic expression we find throughout the world before we settle on a definition that ends up being too narrow or too ethnocentric. As I mention in my paper, from an ethnographic perspective, the semantic and behavioral boundaries of “empathy” are fuzzy rather than distinct. While I understand the advantages of having a definition that is narrow and precise, the danger is that it might blind us to aspects of empathic processes that are critical to our understanding of them or to the ways in which other types of social sentiments and knowledge affect empathic processes and are affected by them. It is also clear from an ethnographic and fieldwork perspective that even the identification of other people’s most basic emotions and intentions is never unmistakable and error free, suggesting that an interpretive process of some kind always plays a role in empathy, whether basic or complex, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754073911421396">Zahavi (2012)</xref> contends.</p>
<p>A second issue raised by my commentators regards the morality of empathy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1754073911421396">Düringer and Döring (2012)</xref> note that ethnographic evidence demonstrating how empathy can be used to harm people poses a challenge to proponents of care ethics, who often assume that “empathy is a crucial source and sustainer of altruistic concern or caring about (the wellbeing of) others” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1754073911421396">Slote, 2007</xref>, p. 15). Zahavi would agree with this point, I believe, since he too comments on the potential harmfulness of empathy.</p>
<p>From an ethnographic perspective, one of the most sobering observations about empathy is how often people around the world seem to fear or anticipate its misuse and abuse. This certainly does challenge the conception of empathy as necessarily a neutral perception or understanding, and suggests that it is important to study the ways in which societies both encourage and discourage its expression. Although we often think of empathy as a feeling, understanding, or disposition that enables people to build bridges among themselves, we must remember that one person’s bridge is another person’s boundary. Flows of empathy may facilitate in-group cohesiveness and identity, but at the same time, clearly demarcate boundaries between in-group and out-group and reinforce social hierarchies of various kinds.</p>
<p>Zahavi raises the important question of whether even the most basic, embodied aspects of empathy can be affected by moral processes and evaluations, or by other forms of social and cultural mediation and “top–down modulation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1754073911421396">2012</xref>). No doubt some would argue that by definition, basic empathy is so fast and automatic that it remains untainted by context and evaluation, and that controls on the expression of empathy cannot affect the experience of empathy per se. But from an ethnographic perspective, this should remain an open question. It may be that highly amplified, culturally and morally encouraged forms of empathy really are quite different from those that are found only in very limited contexts or directed towards only very limited targets. Only many more studies of naturally occurring behavior will tell.</p>
