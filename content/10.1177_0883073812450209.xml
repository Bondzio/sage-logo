<abstract>
<p>The authors present a child affected with diaphragmatic paralysis in the early neonatal period. Although no electroneuromyographic abnormalities were reported, the patient developed dramatic motor and respiratory impairment with impossibility to wean from mechanical ventilation. Repeated electroneuromyographic study at age 4 months revealed severe neurogenic changes and sensory nerve abnormalities with more preserved nerve conduction velocities. Genetic studies identified 2 mutations in the gene <italic>IGHMBP2</italic>. These results support the consideration of this entity as a form of sensory-motor rapidly progressive polyneuropathy rather than a primary anterior horn disease (<italic>IGHMBP2</italic>-related neuropathy). A review of the series of mutated patients in the French National Database gives new insights of the incidence of this disease in France.</p>

<p>Bilateral diaphragmatic palsy appearing in neonatal period can be the initial symptom of a severe neuromuscular disorder and requires a thorough assessment. One of the causes is the entity known as spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress, a severe and rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects newborns or young infants. We report on a child with genetically confirmed spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress presenting with severe bilateral diaphragmatic and muscular weakness at the age of one month. We describe in detail clinical, electrophysiological, and molecular features for spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress disease and report the results of a review of spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress disease patients archived in the French National Genetic Center.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>The patient was the second male child of healthy unrelated parents. Intrauterine growth retardation was noted at 32 weeks of gestation without known etiology. Fetal movements were described as normal and the child was born at 38 weeks and 2 days weighing 1810 g, with Apgar score 10/10. At day 6 a standard workup of growth retardation showed no abnormalities and, following a normal clinical exam, the patient was returned home where he was breast-fed. At one month of age, after prolonged crying at home, he presented with an episode of asphyxia, cyanosis, and loss of consciousness, from which he recovered spontaneously in a few minutes. He was admitted to the hospital and over the next week he presented several acute, transient, and self-resolving episodes of respiratory distress and finally intubation was required because of a more severe event associated with hypoxia and bradycardia. Neurological examination was reported as normal; in particular, there was no evidence of hypotonia, and skeletal muscle weakness and deep tendon reflexes were present. After a first failure for weaning the child from mechanical ventilation, fluoroscopy documented right diaphragmatic palsy. A diaphragmatic plication was performed and a second attempt at weaning was unsuccessful. Fibroscopy, cerebral and spinal magnetic resonance imaging, and thoracic and abdominal tomography were normal. Electroneuromyographic studies performed at 10 weeks of age showed normal motor conduction and normal electromyographic examination in 3 muscles (tibialis anterior, quadriceps, and biceps brachialis). Sensory responses were not obtained, although this was considered likely because of technical difficulties (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073812450209">Table 1</xref>). Spinal muscular atrophy was ruled out by <italic>SMN1</italic> analysis. He was referred to our hospital at 4 months of age because of mechanical-ventilation dependency. Physical evaluation revealed absent osteotendinous reflexes, hypotonia, decreased spontaneous movements, and amyotrophy. The amyotrophy was particularly evident in the distal lower limbs. Cranial nerves were not involved. Lingual fasciculations were not seen. Pattern of spontaneous breathing was paradoxal, with signs of diaphragmatic failure and increased use of accessory muscles. The ocular interaction was normal. Motor clinical exam impaired in the following weeks. Nerve conduction studies now revealed abnormal motor response with markedly reduced amplitudes of compound muscle action potential. Needle electromyography showed reduced recruitment and massive denervation in the tibialis anterior and the first dorsal interosseous muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812450209">Figure 1</xref>). These findings in the context of bilateral diaphragmatic weakness, the progressive course, and the clinical findings led to the suspicion of spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress. Diagnosis was confirmed by genetic analysis showing heterozygous mutation c.2611+1G&gt;T <italic>IGHMBP2</italic> and mutation c.1273C&gt;T. The child died at 5 months of age of complications of respiratory insufficiency.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Several neuromuscular diseases can present at birth with unilateral or bilateral diaphragmatic failure. These include hereditary muscle disorder as myotonic dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophies, structural congenital myopathies (such nemaline or myotubular myopathy), and congenital myasthenic syndromes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812450209">1</xref></sup> The diaphragm is usually spared in the infantile form of spinal muscular atrophy but is the hallmark of another entity initially described by Mellins and coworkers as a form of distal spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812450209">2</xref></sup> Clinically, spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress usually shows intrauterine growth retardation, progressive diaphragmatic, and muscle weakness with predominantly distal and lower-limb involvement and areflexia. In the setting of a weak and floppy baby, it is crucial to rapidly reach a correct diagnosis, especially if respiratory symptoms appear. In our case, at the age of 4 months, the clinical features were strongly suggestive of the disease and the finding of unequivocal signs of a rapidly progressive neurogenic motor and sensory processus further supported the suspicion of spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress. A surgical treatment to plicate the diaphragm was done because of the lack of consistent electrophysiological evidence for a neuromuscular disorder in the first stages of the disease. Very likely, a closer and longer follow-up with assessment by a multidisciplinary medical team would have been useful to better address management, preventing unnecessary surgery. It must be stressed that the rapidly progressive neurogenic process observed in spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress may not display abnormalities within the 8 first weeks. In the absence of initial neurophysiological abnormalities repeated electroneuromyographic studies are indicated. The presence of normal deep tendon reflexes, the absence of clinical progression, and results of electroneuromyography (normal in repeated examinations, myopathic, myotonic discharges) may help in distinguishing this condition from other diseases associating with muscular weakness and respiratory distress. It seems prudent to search for mutations in <italic>IGHMBP2</italic> gene in any newborn or young infant presenting with diaphragmatic failure and showing signs of a progressive neurogenic processus on electroneuromyography.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812450209">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812450209">4</xref></sup></p>
<p><italic>IGHMBP2</italic> gene mutations are characterized by wide allelic heterogeneity. Mutations consist in point mutations or occasionally in large gene rearrangements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812450209">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812450209">6</xref></sup> Molecular diagnosis is based on a comprehensive sequencing of the 15 <italic>IGHMBP2</italic> exons, followed by a dosage-sensitive approach (eg, MLPA, qPCR, etc) if necessary. The French reference laboratory for spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress syndrome, located in Necker Enfants Malades hospital in Paris, is responsible for all requests of <italic>IGHMBP2</italic> gene testing in France. We report the French results for <italic>IGHMBP2</italic> gene testing: 26 probands have been tested over the past 7 years, with an increase in the number of testing requests, from 2 tests in 2005 to 6 in 2011. <italic>IGHMBP2</italic> mutations were identified in 50% of the patients (14/26). The median age at diagnosis was 9 months, the youngest and oldest patients being 4 and 16 months old, respectively. Excluding patients older than 16 months or younger than 4 months (n = 6) made the mutation detection rate to drop up to 70% (14/20 patients). These data fit well with the clinical presentation previously reported of this disease, well tolerated in the neonatal period but becoming symptomatic later, in the first months of life. Apart from its diagnostic value, identification of the disease-causing mutations is of crucial importance for genetic counseling. In the absence of efficient therapy, recurrence of this serious disorder may indeed be prevented in the probands’ sibships, based on fetal DNA testing in the frame of a prenatal- or preimplantation genetic diagnosis procedure. All together these considerations argue for earlier recognition of the disease, which needs a more systematic and early genetic testing in case of clinical and neurophysiological suspicion.</p>
<p>A number of publications have appeared, particularly after the identification of the gene <italic>IGHMBP2 </italic>in chromosome 11q13.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812450209">7</xref></sup> The early and progressive involvement of the diaphragm has been well reported by radiological and electrophysiological studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812450209">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812450209">9</xref></sup> Recently, the spectrum was broadened because of description of cases with sensory nerve involvement and less severe prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812450209">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812450209">10</xref></sup> However, the localization of the disease isolated to the anterior horn has been challenged. In fact, electrophysiological studies in patients with <italic>IGHMBP2</italic> gene mutations show signs of a motor and sensory polyneuropathy rather than an isolated anterior horn motoneuron disease. Recently, Pitt et al had described 8 genetically proved cases of spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress and proposed to reclassify the clinical entity associated with <italic>IGHMBP2</italic> mutations as a severe infantile polyneuropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812450209">4</xref></sup> Moreover, histopathology supports the sensory nerve involvement since results of sural nerves biopsies showed decrease of both myelinated fibers and axons diameters in practically all patients studied. In addition, examination of spinal cords serial sections of 2 cases showed no abnormality, in particular any loss or changes in anterior horn cells or accumulation of microglia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812450209">11</xref></sup> IGHMBP2 protein colocalizes primarily with RNA-processing machinery in the cytoplasm of all tissues including axons and growth cones of motor neurons and at a low level within the nucleus but the functional significance of these localizations are yet unknown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812450209">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812450209">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812450209">13</xref></sup> IGHMBP2 protein acts as an ATP-dependant RNA helicase and associates directly with ribosomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812450209">14</xref></sup> In a murine model of spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress, Grohmann and coauthors reported that early cell death of motor neurons, which precedes degeneration of motor end plates and axons, indicates that IGHMBP2 protein is crucial for survival of these neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812450209">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Reviewing literature, few diagnoses are made before the occurrence of mechanical ventilation dependence emphasizing the difficulty of the diagnosis at the beginning of the disease and being a characteristic of the disease. Long-term invasive ventilatory support often leads to an ethical dilemma concerning ventilatory decisions and contributes to family suffering in the absence of a diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073812450209">15</xref></sup> The availability of a precise genetic diagnosis helps to offer a more straight forward process of decision. As with type I spinal muscular atrophy, in the actual medical context, management and indication of pursuing mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy need to be discussed in neonatal cases affected with <italic>IGHMBP2</italic>-related neuropathy according to the French ethical consensus.</p>
