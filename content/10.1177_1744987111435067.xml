<p>This qualitative research paper, exploring how breastfeeding support can be tailored to meet the needs of women of Bangladeshi origin living in the UK, is original in its analysis and application of public health recommendations and the WHO/UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative (BFI). It will be of interest to practitioners in this area of care, the focus on the provider (health practitioners) and user (breastfeeding women) gives insight into perceptions of what works to support Bangladeshi women to breastfeed and how these skills can be transferred to the wider community.</p>
<p>Over the last 10 years, the Government has invested significant amounts of money to implement public health strategies to improve breastfeeding outcomes, a major factor was promotion of the Public Health recommendation to implement the WHO/UNICEF UK BFI. During this time, Tower Hamlets in London, an area with a high Bangladeshi population, implemented a multifaceted approach to support local women to breastfeed, including clear leadership and local action plans to implement the BFI. Community action included; peer support, a Bengali breastfeeding telephone help line and a social marketing campaign to change societal attitudes to breastfeeding. Breastfeeding prevalence, at 10 days post partum, doubled over this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111435067">Department of Health, 2009</xref>). This research paper adds to the body of knowledge and understanding of how best to support women in complex environments to breastfeed their babies beyond the early days.</p>
<p>The study is well designed and recognises the limitation of not interviewing midwives working in a UNICEF BFI accredited unit whilst caring for Bangladeshi women. Themes are drawn from the data which are clear. The paper explores the women and their family’s perception of what support for breastfeeding means for them, requesting a ‘hands on’ approach. This is in contrast to current policy and practice which recommends more ‘practical support’ which is ‘hands off’ providing an environment where women are enabled, through practical help to ‘do it themselves’. The authors recognise that this needs further exploration for this group of women and in an environment where the BFI has been fully implemented.</p>
<p>The context is contemporary and has been developed to respond to the changing and developing landscape of what works to support women and their families in the antenatal period. This is important in the current climate where a growing body of evidence is being placed on providing a ‘bed rock’ of care to support pregnant women and their families’ in the early years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987111435067">Entwistle et al., 2011</xref>). Bangladeshi households are some of the poorest in the UK, and the effects of poverty are passed on across generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111435067">Spencer &amp; Beckhelling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111435067">Hirsche, 2011</xref>). The greatest burden of ill-health and adverse development falls on the poorest families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987111435067">Department of Health, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111435067">Field, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111435067">Allen, 2011</xref>). Supporting breastfeeding services is considered essential to reducing health inequalities in breastfeeding prevalence rates and associated health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111435067">Dyson et al., 2010</xref>).This research paper provides valuable insights into the breastfeeding experiences of Bangladeshi women in the UK and raises discussion for how best public health recommendations can utilise breastfeeding to enhance a child’s life chances and health outcomes.</p>

<bio><p><bold>Francesca Entwistle's</bold> interest in breastfeeding was consolidated through her research exploring the impact of midwifery training and women's self-efficacy on breastfeeding outcomes for women from low income groups. She recently completed a three year secondment to the Department of Health developing policy and practice in relation to Maternal and Infant Nutrition. A trustee, of the charity 'Best Beginnings' she was closely involved in the development of the DVD `from bump to breastfeeding' which was distributed free to all women in the UK. Francesca continues to work closely with important stakeholders including the University of York, Royal College of Midwives and UNICEF, to ensure the focus on improving breastfeeding prevalence in the UK continues.
