<p>This interesting introductory guide to reading the Old Testament is explicitly not a traditional “introduction,” nor a book on hermeneutics in general. It is written specifically ‘for students who want to reflect on the intersections of historical, hermeneutical, and theological concerns in a way that honors both their agency as readers and their faith convictions’ (p. xiii). The first chapter introduces various ways of reading the Old Testament that seminary students may encounter when they first enter the classroom, exploring what is at stake in scholarly debates about their strengths and weaknesses. The second chapter reflects theologically on the Documentary Hypothesis, and asks: what is ‘the significance of source criticism for a faithful reading of Scripture?’ (pp. 49-50). The author highlights significant weaknesses in the Hypothesis on the way to exhortations to honor and be grateful for the diverse witnesses of Scripture and to attend carefully to them. Chapter 3 explores issues of historicity and scriptural meaning, and chapter 4 ‘introduces students to feminist, African American, queer, and postcolonial understandings of gender, race, sexual identity, and class’ (p. xiii). The brief concluding chapter tries to bring everything together, and to lead the reader to decide upon a personal reading strategy.</p>
<p>In many ways this is an excellent book. It introduces the reader to a wide range of reading practices, making judicious use of examples and quotations along the way in order to illuminate the subject-matter. It is to a high degree inclusive and eirenical, respecting different points of view among scholars and envisaged readers alike, and evidently strives to discuss the strengths and weakness in various positions as fairly as it can. It advises everyone to <italic>think</italic> while reading their Bibles, and to listen carefully to the text and to other readers as they do so, and this is good advice.</p>
<p>At the same time, I am reminded of what G. K. Chesterton once said about H. G. Wells: ‘I think he thought that the object of opening the mind is simply opening the mind. Whereas I am incurably convinced that the object of opening the mind, as of opening the mouth, is to shut it again on something solid.’ This book contributes mightily to the opening of the mind. Having read it, the student will possess a much clearer idea of the many ways in which Old Testament Scripture is being read at present, and about the challenges involved in reading it. However, she will not be clearer about how, in this pluralistic environment, to adjudicate between reading strategies (and why), and about which kinds of readings count as acceptable Christian readings and which do not (and why). She will have formed no views on how the canon of Scripture itself might resist or embrace particular reading strategies, for the author herself does not appear to hold a view of canon that is sufficiently robust to allow for this ‘policing’ task. Lacking such guidance, I fear that she may find herself in equal measure illuminated and overwhelmed with confusion – that she will find herself inhaling intoxicating interpretive air, but possessing nothing solid beneath her interpretive feet. She is unlikely to welcome this development, for the average Protestant theological student does not get into the business of theological education hoping to answer the question, ‘what kind of Scripture reader <italic>do you want</italic> to become?’ (p. 140, emphasis partly added). She hopes, rather (and passing over the issue of how duty should relate to desire), to answer the question: ‘what kind of Scripture reader <italic>ought you</italic> to become?’ And indeed, I think that Scripture itself suggests that this is the right question to ask. This book offers only limited help to students, however, as they ponder it.</p>
