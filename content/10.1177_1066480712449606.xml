<abstract>
<p>Food addiction among children is a concerning issue. Few empirical studies have examined the relevance of food addiction among pediatric samples, but emerging evidence suggests that some children experience their eating patterns as addictive. The present review will discuss the issue of food addiction among children, and will also attend to the related concepts of binge eating and obesity. Several family factors that have been implicated as contributing to problematic eating practices among children will be discussed, including family functioning, parental modeling, parental pressure, and the impact of low socioeconomic status. Finally, implications for counselors who work with families struggling with food addiction will be presented.</p>

<body>
<p>Binge eating has been characterized as an addiction to food. Authors have discussed the behavioral components of binge eating which suggest its addictive nature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480712449606">Cassin &amp; von Ranson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1066480712449606">Merlo, Klingman, Malasanos, &amp; Silverstein, 2009</xref>) and have also reviewed evidence for the involvement of neurotransmitters in the genesis and maintenance of binge eating (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480712449606">Liu, von Deneed, Kobeissy, &amp; Gold, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1066480712449606">Volkow &amp; Wise, 2005</xref>). While the majority of research on food addiction focuses on adults, there is emerging evidence that some children experience binge eating as an addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1066480712449606">Merlo et al., 2009</xref>). Food addiction, through exerting an influence on children’s eating patterns and attitudes, may ultimately play a role in children’s weight status, viz., degree of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1066480712449606">Merlo et al., 2009</xref>). The 2007–2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey reported the following prevalence rate data for obesity among children and adolescents (<italic>N</italic> = 3,281): 10.4% of children aged 2–5; 19.6% of children aged 6–11; and 18.1% of children and adolescents aged 12–19 would meet criteria for obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1066480712449606">Ogden, Carroll, Curtin, Lamb, &amp; Flegal, 2010</xref>). These obesity rates are higher than the data reported in the 1980s and 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1066480712449606">Ogden &amp; Carroll, 2010</xref>) and are concerning due to the damaging consequences of obesity. For example, researchers found that obese children have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1066480712449606">Young, Dean, Flett, &amp; Wood-Steiman, 2000</xref>) and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1066480712449606">Valle et al., 2000</xref>). Researchers have also documented links between obesity and a range of psychological factors such as low self-esteem, increased depression, and heightened externalizing behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1066480712449606">Gibson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1066480712449606">Kimm et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the prevalence rates of obesity among children and the negative outcomes associated with childhood obesity, authors have devoted efforts to ascertain the causes of childhood obesity; one such causal factor may be food addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1066480712449606">Merlo et al., 2009</xref>). Researchers have implicated familial factors as wielding primary influences on the food addiction symptoms of children; these family dynamics include family functioning, parental modeling, parental control, and the impact of low socioeconomic status (SES) (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712449606">Campbell, Crawford, &amp; Ball, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480712449606">Czaja, Hartmann, Rief, &amp; Hilbert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712449606">Kaufmann &amp; Karpati, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1066480712449606">Zocca et al., 2011</xref>). The following review will attend to the role of the family in fostering and maintaining food addiction, in addition to outlining counseling strategies to intervene with families who are struggling with food addiction. Prior to this discussion of food addiction and the family, however, the primary features and prevalence rates of binge eating among children will be reviewed, as there is minimal research on food addiction among children. In addition, the debate around classifying binge eating as an addiction will be considered.</p>

<title>Binge Eating Among Children</title>
<p>In the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </italic>(Fourth Edition, Text Revision [<italic>DSM–4–TR</italic>]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712449606">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>), binge eating is specifically defined as the intake of a sizeable number of calories in a defined time frame and a concomitant loss of control over this eating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712449606">APA, 2000</xref>). The <italic>DSM–5</italic> revision has proposed the inclusion of binge eating disorder (BED) as a separate diagnostic category; recommended criteria include eating alone, eating until unpleasantly full, eating without being hungry, eating more hastily than is customary, emotions such as guilt following eating, distress surrounding eating behavior, and bingeing weekly for 3 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066480712449606">APA, 2011</xref>). Binge eating behavior is also part of the diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa, wherein the binge eating behavior is followed by compensatory actions such as vomiting or laxative use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712449606">APA, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Authors have noted, however, that the diagnostic criteria for BED among children may be different than the criteria which have been specified for adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066480712449606">Marcus &amp; Kalarchian, 2003</xref>). For example, children may have difficulty recalling their eating patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066480712449606">Baxter, 2009</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066480712449606">Marcus and Kalarchian (2003)</xref> concluded that, as an indicator of binge eating among children, self-reports of consuming substantial amounts of food have less research support than self-reports of feeling unable to control eating behavior. Consequently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066480712449606">Marcus and Kalarchian (2003)</xref> suggested provisional criteria for the assessment of BED among children younger than 14 years. These criteria included repeated binge eating, which was defined as pursuing food without being hungry and feeling a loss of control over eating (viz., the sense of not being able to cease eating once started). Additionally, these criteria involved binge eating occurring for 3 months and binge eating due to negative emotions; using food as a reward; and/or concealing or sneaking food.</p>
<p>Due to methodological differences in assessing binge eating among children, prevalence rates for this behavior vary across studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1066480712449606">Shapiro et al., 2007</xref>). Different assessment tools and methods have yielded disparities in prevalence rate data. In addition, some studies combine samples of children and adolescents, which create difficulty in parsing out child-specific prevalence rates. For example, using the Questionnaire of Eating and Weight Patterns–Adolescent Version, researchers found that 5.3% of overweight children (<italic>N </italic>= 112; aged 6–10) met BED criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1066480712449606">Morgan et al., 2002</xref>). Using the criteria developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066480712449606">Marcus and Kalarchian (2003)</xref>, researchers found that 29% of children (<italic>N</italic> = 55) met the symptom patterns consistent with BED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1066480712449606">Shapiro et al., 2007</xref>). In this same study, the Structured Interview for the Diagnosis of <italic>DSM-4</italic> Disorders (SCID) revealed that 9% of the sample reported pathology consistent with BED criteria. Researchers employing the Child Eating Disorder Examination found that 1% of a sample of obese children and adolescents (<italic>N</italic> = 196; aged 10–16) endorsed symptoms meeting BED criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480712449606">Decaluwé &amp; Braet, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, researchers have reported prevalence rates for subclinical forms of child BED. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1066480712449606">Morgan and colleagues (2002)</xref> found that 33% of their sample of overweight children endorsed at least one incident of feeing unable to control eating behavior. Based on the SCID assessment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1066480712449606">Shapiro et al. (2007)</xref> reported that 22% of the children in their study met subthreshold BED criteria. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066480712449606">Decaluwé and Braet (2003)</xref> found that 9.2% of their participants reported a minimum of one objective binge episode over the prior 3 months. These forms of binge eating behaviors and attitudes, while not meeting the threshold for clinical BED criteria, are still concerning. The following review will refer to both clinical BED and subclinical levels of binge eating behaviors, such as loss of control eating or eating in the absence of hunger.</p>

<title>Binge Eating as an Addiction</title>
<p>Authors have described binge eating as a food addiction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480712449606">Gold, Graham, Cocores, &amp; Nixon, 2009</xref>). The food addiction hypothesis draws from literature which postulates that behavioral, or process, addictions (such as food addiction) are signified by certain behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480712449606">Cassin &amp; von Ranson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1066480712449606">Hagedorn, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480712449606">Goodman, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1066480712449606">2001</xref>). Moreover, authors have noted that certain neurotransmitters are likely involved in food addiction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480712449606">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1066480712449606">Volkow &amp; Wise, 2005</xref>). The following sections will discuss both the developing behavioral criteria for food addiction and the involvement of the neurotransmitter dopamine in food addiction.</p>
<p>The behavioral elements of addiction involve the criteria for substance dependence as outlined by the <italic>DSM-4-TR </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066480712449606">APA, 2000</xref>), which include unintended excessive consumption, continued consumption despite negative consequences, unsuccessful attempts to curb consumption, withdrawal symptoms (such as restlessness or headaches), considerable amounts of time devoted to the behavior and its consequences, tolerance, and the loss of other activities due to the addictive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480712449606">Cassin &amp; von Ranson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480712449606">Gold et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1066480712449606">Merlo et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480712449606">Goodman (1990)</xref> specified additional behavioral criteria to classify an addiction, including a feeling of tension prior to engaging in the behavior (e.g., binge eating), a perception of a loss of control while acting on the behavior, a positive emotional consequence after engaging in the behavior, and a preoccupation with the behavior.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480712449606">Cassin and von Ranson (2007)</xref> found that 92.4% of women (<italic>N</italic> = 79) who met diagnostic criteria for BED also conformed to <italic>DSM–4 </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066480712449606">APA, 1994</xref>) diagnostic criteria for substance dependence; these authors altered the <italic>DSM-4</italic> criteria using the label <italic>binge eating</italic> rather than <italic>substance</italic>. Using the additional criteria created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1066480712449606">Goodman (1990)</xref>, 40.5% of this sample met the criteria for an addiction. Research on food addiction among children is still in its nascent stages. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1066480712449606">Merlo and colleagues (2009)</xref> studied a sample of children and adolescents (<italic>N</italic> = 50, aged 8–19) who were overweight/obese and/or were receiving treatment for conditions such as type 2 diabetes. Among this sample, 15.2% of children reported believing that they were addicted to food “often,” “usually,” or “always,” and 17.4% felt they were “sometimes” addicted to food (Merlo et al., 2009, p. 31). These authors created an eating behaviors questionnaire (EBQ), which aimed to measure symptoms of food addiction among children. In particular, the 20-item EBQ targeted symptoms such as a lack of control around food intake (i.e., attempting to cut down the food consumption), compulsive eating, continuation of eating behaviors despite negative effects, hiding food, and the time-consuming nature of eating practices. Participants’ mean score on the EBQ was 51.6 (<italic>SD</italic> = 15.6; potential range 20–120); food addiction symptoms children most frequently agreed with included compulsive use and loss of control items. These findings suggested that, for some children, certain distressing eating practices may be experienced as a food addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1066480712449606">Merlo et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the behavioral criteria which have been used to conceptualize binge eating as an addiction, authors have also discussed the neurobiological components of binge eating (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1066480712449606">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1066480712449606">Volkow &amp; Wise, 2005</xref>). The neurotransmitter dopamine has been implicated as playing a role in both substance addiction and binge eating; authors have asserted that the most “well-established commonality if the mechanisms of food and drug intake is their ability to activate the dopamine-containing link in brain reward circuitry” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1066480712449606">Volkow &amp; Wise, 2005</xref>, p. 556). Researchers found that rats which were given drugs such as ethanol, nicotine, and cocaine subsequently displayed increased levels of dopamine in two areas of their brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066480712449606">Di Chiara &amp; Imperato, 1988</xref>). Similarly, researchers reported that (after a period of food deprivation and subsequent continued access to sucrose), an intake of sucrose increased the dopamine levels in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1066480712449606">Rada, Avena, &amp; Hoebel, 2005</xref>). Authors have discussed, in detail, the empirical evidence suggesting that sugar functions as an addictive substance in studies involving rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066480712449606">Avena, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066480712449606">Avena, Rada, &amp; Hoebel, 2008</xref>). Moreover, researchers have shown that obese individuals who struggle with binge eating behaviors have irregularities in their dopamine system. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1066480712449606">Wang et al. (2001)</xref> found that a sample of obese individuals (<italic>N</italic> = 10) had diminished accessibility of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors, compared to a normal weight control group. These authors thus surmised that binge eating may be a way for individuals to increase the dopamine levels in their brains, due to the initial low dopamine levels.</p>
<p>However, authors have also noted that the conceptualization of binge eating as an addiction may not resonate for all individuals who struggle with this behavior. For example, binge eating behavior may not meet clinical levels for BED and/or may be more akin to eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia nervosa when preoccupation with body shape is prominent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066480712449606">Cassin &amp; von Ranson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1066480712449606">Rogers &amp; Smit, 2000</xref>). Additionally, as minimal research has explored the concept of food addiction as relevant specifically to children, the applicability of food addiction to the binge eating behaviors of children deserves future attention; continued empirical research and the establishment of consistent measurement tools are needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1066480712449606">Merlo et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>While the existence of food addiction has been challenged as not capturing certain eating behaviors and attitudes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1066480712449606">Rogers &amp; Smit, 2000</xref>), there is evidence that some children experience their binge eating symptoms as an addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1066480712449606">Merlo et al., 2009</xref>). Family characteristics associated with binge eating behaviors and potential food addiction among children will be discussed in the following sections. Evidence of this link is found in researchers’ efforts to underscore an association between family variables and (a) the eating behaviors of children; and/or (b) the weight status (i.e., overweight or obese) of children. Additionally, counseling implications will be provided, as therapeutic interventions can address binge eating patterns among children and optimally, mitigate the harmful physical and psychological effects of potential food addiction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1066480712449606">
<title>Family Functioning</title>
<p>Maladaptive patterns of family functioning have been associated with children’s problematic eating patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480712449606">Czaja et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480712449606">Greenfield &amp; Marks, 2009</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480712449606">Czaja, Hartmann, Rief, and Hilbert (2011)</xref> studied the manner in which dysfunctional family interactions during mealtimes were related to the eating behavior of children aged 8–13; these authors rated family interactions via videotapes of family meals. These researchers found that the families of children who exhibited loss of control eating (<italic>N</italic> = 43 families) had more problematic communication patterns (e.g., masked or indirect discussions), detrimental interpersonal involvements (e.g., distance or enmeshed involvement), and overall unhealthy family functioning compared to the families of children who did not display loss of control eating (<italic>N</italic> = 31 families).</p>
<p>Family functioning has also been examined apart from mealtime interactions. Researchers have studied parenting styles, which may be an indicator of the health of a family environment. Authoritarian parenting styles have been characterized by low parental sensitivity and emotional support and authoritative parenting styles have been characterized by high parental sensitivity and emotional support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1066480712449606">Rhee, Lumeng, Appugliese, Kaciroti, &amp; Bradley, 2006</xref>). Researchers found that, among a sample of first grade children (<italic>N</italic> = 872), authoritarian parenting styles were linked with an increased risk of a child being overweight, compared to children of authoritative parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1066480712449606">Rhee et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1066480712449606">Greenfield and Marks (2009)</xref> studied the influence of parental physical and psychological violence in childhood. Adults (<italic>N</italic> = 1,543) who reported histories of both types of violence and frequent violence in childhood had an increased incidence of obesity in adulthood. Moreover, these authors provided evidence of the mechanism by which family violence in childhood may lead to adult obesity. The use of food as a coping mechanism served as a mediator between childhood family violence and adult obesity. Authors have conceptualized binge eating as a coping strategy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1066480712449606">McCarthy, 1990</xref>), and it may be that children use food as a way to cope with the stressors of dysfunctional family patterns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1066480712449606">
<title>Parental Modeling</title>
<p>Authors have noted that family members often share dysfunctional eating and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1066480712449606">Patel, Wheatcroft, Park, &amp; Stein, 2002</xref>). For example, when parents are obese, children under 10 years old are over twice as at risk for adult obesity themselves, regardless of their obesity status as children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1066480712449606">Whitaker, Wright, Pepe, Seidel, &amp; Dietz, 1997</xref>). Given these findings, parental obesity may be a fundamental factor for predicting children’s obesity risk as adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1066480712449606">Whitaker et al., 1997</xref>). Family patterns of obesity and food addiction may be partially explained by the impact of parental modeling of eating behaviors and attitudes.</p>
<p>Researchers have found evidence that parental eating patterns are often associated with child eating patterns, in both a potentially beneficial and detrimental manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712449606">Campbell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066480712449606">Czaja et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066480712449606">Hood et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1066480712449606">Merlo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1066480712449606">Sweetman, McGowan, Croker, &amp; Cooke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1066480712449606">Zocca et al., 2011</xref>). Authors have posited that overeating may be a behavior which children imitate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1066480712449606">Merlo et al., 2009</xref>) and parental modeling may explain the connection between parental eating practices and child eating practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066480712449606">Hood et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1066480712449606">Zocca et al. (2011)</xref> reported that, among a sample of children and adolescents aged 8–17 (<italic>N</italic> = 305), maternal binge eating and maternal eating in the absence of hunger was linked (after controlling for maternal BMI) with child and adolescent eating practices. The former was linked with child and adolescent loss of control eating and the latter was associated with child and adolescent eating in the absence of hunger. Reporting similar findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066480712449606">Hood et al. (2000)</xref> analyzed data collected in a longitudinal study of 94 children (aged 3–5) at baseline and 6 years later. The results of the analyses revealed that child obesity was associated with parental eating habits. Specifically, parental disinhibited eating (i.e., unstable and uncontrolled eating patterns and weight) was linked with increased child obesity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1066480712449606">Hood et al. (2000)</xref> noted that this connection between parental eating practices could potentially be explained by parental modeling of these disinhibited eating practices. However, parental modeling can also have the opposite influence, in that parents who model healthy habits may pass these patterns onto their children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1066480712449606">Sweetman, McGowan, Croker, and Cooke (2011)</xref> studied a sample of parents of children of age 2–5 (<italic>N</italic> = 434) and found that parental reports of child vegetable intake and preference was significantly associated with the child eating essentially the same food as the parent. Similar findings were reported in an investigation carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712449606">Campbell, Crawford, and Ball (2006)</xref>, wherein 560 families (with children aged 5–6) were surveyed on their eating and food practices. These researchers found that parental modeling of eating (defined by items denoting eating the evening meal and breakfast together as a family) was associated with increased child consumption of vegetables.</p>

<title>Parental Control</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1066480712449606">May and Dietz (2010)</xref> referred to the methods parents use to feed their children as ingrained parts of their parenting styles; strategies may include “pressuring children to eat and restricting food” (p. S13). Authors have noted that the level of parental control can influence children’s weight status and food choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1066480712449606">Dreyer &amp; Egan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1066480712449606">May &amp; Dietz, 2010</xref>). Researchers have also documented such a relationship. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712449606">Campbell et al. (2006)</xref> found that increased parental pressure to eat was associated with increased caloric intake of children. In a study of 38 parents (with children aged 2–11), researchers found that mothers who reported increased control over their child’s food intake were more likely to have overweight children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1066480712449606">McCurdy &amp; Gorman, 2010</xref>). There is also evidence that these early eating patterns, perhaps influenced by parental control, may persist into adulthood. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066480712449606">Brunstrom, Mitchell, and Bagley (2005)</xref> conducted a retrospective study of adult females (<italic>N</italic> = 242; mean age = 20.1) who recalled experiences from the age of 5–10. Participants who recalled that their mothers pressured them to clean their plates reported increased current overeating.</p>
<p>One hypothesis as to the mechanism by which parental control influences child eating habits and weight status has been suggested as a disruption of a child’s internal hunger and satiety signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480712449606">Birch &amp; Fischer, 1998</xref>). Possibly, a child who is consistently pressured by a parent to eat or to restrict food loses connection with the internal cues which signal fullness or appetite and thus overeats.</p>

<sec id="section6-1066480712449606">
<title>Low SES</title>
<p>SES may be a factor in food addiction among children. Studies have found that unhealthy eating practices are common among low SES children (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1066480712449606">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). The explanations behind this association have been explored by researchers; potential reasons include the meanings given to food and the irregular cycle of food availability in low SES families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712449606">Kaufmann &amp; Karpati, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066480712449606">Kempson, Keenan, Sadani, Ridlen, &amp; Scotto Rosato, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Authors have asserted that food practices become coping strategies that are ingrained in the low-income family’s ideas about parenting and well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480712449606">Dowler, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712449606">Kaufman &amp; Karpati, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712449606">Kaufman and Karpati (2007)</xref> conducted an ethnographic study of 60 low SES Latino individuals who lived in Brooklyn, NY, and described a parenting cycle in which healthy eating was superseded by fulfilling the desires of their children. These authors noted that, for many of the study participants, managing food resources and supplying food for their children provided parents with a sense of well-being and achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712449606">Kaufmann &amp; Karpati, 2007</xref>). In this community, food represented an area of control in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. Authors have noted that keeping children fed and satisfied in a low SES environment is a preoccupying obstacle for families who strain to provide enough food for their households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1066480712449606">Dowler, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712449606">Kaufmann &amp; Karpati, 2007</xref>). Food represents a way to directly address children’s current physical hunger and needs, and in doing so, parents reported feeding their children in unhealthy ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712449606">Kaufmann &amp; Karpati, 2007</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712449606">Kaufman and Karpati (2007)</xref> noted that food is often a vacillating resource among low SES families. Parents may handle this oscillating resource by consuming food when it is accessible (e.g., at the start of the month when benefit checks arrive); this often results in overconsumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712449606">Kaufmann &amp; Karpati, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066480712449606">Kempson et al., 2002</xref>). When food availability lessens (e.g., at the end of the month when benefit money has run out), families may rely on less healthy food, increasing consumption of, for example, highly processed food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712449606">Kaufmann &amp; Karpati, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1066480712449606">Kempson et al., 2002</xref>). The cycle of food insecurity begins again at the start of the new month with new benefit checks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712449606">Kaufmann &amp; Karpati, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Counseling Practice Implications</title>
<p>As underscored by the prior review, binge eating (often leading to obesity) has been conceptualized as an addiction (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1066480712449606">Gold et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1066480712449606">Merlo et al., 2009</xref>). Binge eating symptoms among children may include patterns such as eating without being hungry, feeling incapable of controlling eating behavior, and hiding or sneaking food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066480712449606">Marcus &amp; Kalarchian, 2003</xref>). Counselors who work with children and families can address binge eating habits and potential food addiction through various means. In particular, the research evidence which has documented the role of various family variables in childhood eating practices and adiposity suggests several avenues for clinical intervention with children who may be displaying problematic eating patterns. The following section will describe potential strategies for intervention, including clinical methods which address parental modeling of eating behaviors and parental control over child eating practices.</p>
<p>Given the research findings on the transmission of parental eating patterns to children, it is plausible that counseling interventions which target parental eating habits may have a beneficial impact on child eating patterns. Authors have created intervention programs which center on parental skills and changes, such as increasing exercise, intentionally buying healthy foods, and slowing down the rate of eating (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1066480712449606">Golan &amp; Weizman, 2001</xref>). Interventions targeted to parents, however, must be undertaken with compassion and respect. Researchers have found that parents may be hesitant to make changes and may not recognize that there is a problem with their children’s eating behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712449606">Campbell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712449606">Kaufman &amp; Karpati, 2007</xref>). For example, in an ethnographic study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1066480712449606">Kaufman and Karpati (2007)</xref> chronicled the reaction of one mother (Yolanda), after a nutritionist expressed concern about her daughter’s (Maria’s) weight. Yolanda defended Maria’s body size and made comments which suggested that the nutritionist’s remarks were viewed as threatening to Yolanda’s identity as a mother. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712449606">Campbell et al. (2006)</xref> reported that increased parental belief in the acceptability of their child’s food consumption (viz., confidence that their child’s diet included fruits and vegetables and contributed to health) was associated with increased child intake of unhealthy foods (viz., sweet and savory snacks such as cake and potato crisps) and decreased intake of vegetables. Both of these studies suggest that some parents may not accept that a problem exists in regard to their child’s eating habits or weight status. Moreover, authors have noted that parents will be unlikely to change patterns when not convinced of a legitimate problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066480712449606">Campbell et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, treatment approaches which utilize motivational interviewing ([MI] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066480712449606">Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1066480712449606">Rollnick &amp; Miller, 1995</xref>) or solution-focused brief therapy ([SFBT] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480712449606">de Shazer, 1988</xref>) treatment strategies may have benefits over more direct, confrontational methods.</p>
<sec id="section8-1066480712449606">
<title>Motivational Interviewing</title>
<p>Researchers have reported on the success of MI in treating obesity among adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1066480712449606">Rieger, Dean, Steinbeck, Caterson, &amp; Manson, 2009</xref>). Evidence of the utility of MI among children is still in its early stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1066480712449606">Suarez &amp; Mullins, 2008</xref>). In a review of nine randomized clinical trials on MI with children and adolescents (targeting a range of behavioral outcomes), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1066480712449606">Suarez and Mullins (2008)</xref> noted that seven of the trials reported beneficial outcomes in the MI group, compared with the control group.</p>
<p>MI is an empathic and accepting treatment model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066480712449606">Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1066480712449606">Rollnick &amp; Miller, 1995</xref>). From the outset, MI stresses that labeling a client as having problem, such as asserting that “your child is obese and suffers from food addiction” or “your own eating habits are binge eating behaviors,” is likely counterproductive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066480712449606">Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002</xref>). MI also strives to work with clients at their current level of motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1066480712449606">Rollnick &amp; Miller, 1995</xref>), emphasizing gauging a client’s “readiness for change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066480712449606">Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002</xref>, p. 127). Clients with addictions may enter counseling at various levels of motivation; clients may not believe that a problem is present (precontemplation), may understand that there is a concern but are ambivalent about making a change (contemplation), may be dedicated to making change (preparation), may be currently working to make change (action), or may be seeking to avert relapse (maintenance) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1066480712449606">Prochaska, DiClemente, &amp; Norcross, 1992</xref>). Rather than seeking to confront the client about his or her troubling behavior, counselors who work from a MI perspective seek to delve into the client’s current level of motivation and the client’s ambivalence about change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066480712449606">Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1066480712449606">Rollnick &amp; Miller, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>For example, a mother may enter counseling in the contemplation stage, with the awareness that her child may be somewhat overweight and that she (the mother) personally struggles with binge eating. Yet, this client is not convinced that a change is necessary, asserting that her child “really doesn’t overeat” and “I really doubt that my own eating habits influence my daughter.” In this case, the parent is having an “ambivalent conflict,” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066480712449606">Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002</xref>, p. 14). A counselor working from a MI perspective would assist this parent in investigating this ambivalence, perhaps by drawing attention to these conflicted feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066480712449606">Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1066480712449606">Rollnick &amp; Miller, 1995</xref>). A counselor may also employ the MI technique of having the client argue the point of making a change. In this scenario, the counselor plays the role of an individual not wanting to change (i.e., no change in the parent’s eating habits) and the client must verbalize why a change is necessary (i.e., modeling healthy eating). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1066480712449606">Miller and Rollnick (2002)</xref> noted that a client may bristle when a specific change is prescribed but may be open to selecting one change out of a variety of options. For example, the client in the previous example may be opposed to the idea of not buying binge foods but may be open to the idea of regular family meals with prepared vegetables.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1066480712449606">
<title>Solution-Focused Brief Therapy</title>
<p>SFBT may also be useful in addressing family eating patterns in a gentle, empathic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1066480712449606">McFarland, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1066480712449606">Peterson, 2005</xref>). SFBT, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480712449606">de Shazer (1988)</xref>, asserts that change is constant; the role of the therapist is not to instigate change in the client’s life, but rather to enter a partnership with the client and to assume that change is already occurring. Counselors working from an SFBT paradigm use language in an intentional manner in order to set up this assumption of the constancy of change; for example, a counselor may employ the technique of searching for exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480712449606">de Shazer, 1988</xref>). A counselor may inquire into the client’s memory of “the last time you were able to sit down and have a healthy meal as a family.” An SFBT model may be especially beneficial for a parent who is threatened by the notion that his or her child is overweight or engaging in problematic eating. Such counseling strategy highlights client strengths (e.g., exceptions) and is careful to not rely on the language of pathology when referencing client concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480712449606">de Shazer, 1988</xref>). This may be more amenable to a parent who sees his or her child’s obesity as a personal failure and consequently does not want to acknowledge that it is a problem. Moreover, highlighting areas where the client is succeeding through exception questions sets up the framework wherein homework assignments can be based on extending and maintaining these areas of exceptions, rather than assignments which prescribe brand new changes to parental eating habits and family food patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066480712449606">de Shazer, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Counselors may also intervene to develop the self-regulation skills of children; counselors may work to educate children on how to recognize their internal hunger cues. This type of intervention is drawn from the suggestion that parental control over eating practices may disturb children’s ability to tune into their hunger and satiety cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066480712449606">Birch &amp; Fischer, 1998</xref>). An intervention described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1066480712449606">Johnson (2000)</xref> included creative psychoeducation strategies about the meaning and manifestations of hunger, fullness, and overeating (through the use of a skit and a video). This intervention also utilized dolls with removable stomachs, to indicate an empty, full or very full stomach. Children practiced identifying the various levels of hunger versus fullness on the dolls and then applied these identifiers to their own stomachs. In addition to improving these children’s ability to self-regulate their food intake, this intervention may have diminished the impact of parental modeling. Following the intervention, children seemed less susceptible to parental modeling of eating; mother and child disinhibited eating was no longer correlated. Such an intervention may address parental control over eating and parental modeling of eating.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Researchers have found that some children feel that they are addicted to food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1066480712449606">Merlo et al., 2009</xref>). Food addiction may manifest in symptoms of binge eating among children, such as loss of control eating, eating without being hungry, and concealing food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1066480712449606">Marcus &amp; Kalarchian, 2003</xref>). The prior review underscored several family variables which have an influence on child eating patterns, including (a) dysfunctional patterns of family interaction; (b) parental modeling of detrimental eating practices; (c) parental control over child eating practices; and (d) the significance attributed to food and food instability among low SES families. Counselors can intervene with families to address some of these variables and optimally, reduce food addiction among children. MI, SFBT, and education about self-regulation may be beneficial in working with children and families around food addiction.</p>
