<p>This article explores the relationship between terror, power and the rule of law. First, tracing Burke's use of the term terror back to ancient Greek usage, I argue that being terrified is incommensurable with the experience of acting together with others. In this way, terror and power are distinct. However, most acts of terror aim to terrify some people while inoculating others from terror. Witnesses to the terror of others may feel empowered by the destruction of the power of others. Second, the rule of law and terror seem incommensurable because causing terror often involves violating the law. However, modern political thought is founded on the idea that the law itself ought to be terrifying. That the terror of non-state actors appears random and the terror of the law has hardly been noticed in recent commentary on terrorism indicate that the rule of law produces an interesting audience effect. In order to sustain power and legitimacy while practising terror, governments use the rule of law to divide audiences up into terrified criminals and innocent witnesses. The practice of terror as an ‘open secret’ also produces similar audience effects. Finally, despite these connections between power, terror and the rule of law, I argue that terror is always technically out of power, even when practised by states. Terror is the true weapon of the weak because it always admits a failure to foster human connections with certain people and groups. Nonviolence is a weapon of the weak in the sense that it instantiates new, unencumbered power.</p>

<p>In some ways, the attacks of 11 September 2001 were neither unique nor momentous. They were nowhere near the high-water mark of human destructiveness in terms of the number of people killed or the property destroyed. In the perspective of human violence more generally, or even in the perspective of attacks by insurgent and rebel groups on governments, the attacks were relatively small. Academic studies in the wake of the attacks mostly affirm that the events of 9/11 were one example of a practice with a long history,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1474885111417776">1</xref></sup> or a type of action that falls into an established legal category,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1474885111417776">2</xref></sup> or a specific kind of psychological phenomenon.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1474885111417776">3</xref></sup> Political scientists and international relations scholars in the behaviouralist tradition have approached the event by trying to delineate a universe of similar cases.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1474885111417776">4</xref></sup> Among political theorists and moral philosophers the attacks have inspired a conceptual debate about the meaning of terrorism, with some arguing for the political and moral utility of a narrow and restrictive definition and others for a more expansive one.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1474885111417776">5</xref></sup> Yet all agree that the attacks fall into the category of terrorism.</p>
<p>This article affirms the idea that terror is a distinctive phenomenon that plays an important role in politics. However, one way to exacerbate the feeling of terror others experience is to do something that does not seem to fit into any class of action and defies our usual reference points. We miss something of the significance of the attacks on 9/11 unless we understand them as, in some ways, unique and unprecedented. I do not mean that ‘everything changed’ on 9/11, that the pre- and post-9/11 worlds bear little resemblance to one another<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1474885111417776">6</xref></sup> or that the suffering of the victims of the 11 September attacks deserves pride of place among instances of suffering in the world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1474885111417776">7</xref></sup> I mean that the attacks displayed extraordinary human inventiveness that could hardly be believed. We can be more certain that the events were distinctive now that a decade has passed and their political meaning still remains up for negotiation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1474885111417776">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The 9/11 attackers did things that had never been done and produced images that had never been seen for a worldwide audience. The terrifying aspects of the attacks were enhanced by the fact that no one had been terrified in exactly this way.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1474885111417776">9</xref></sup> But there was also another sense in which the attacks were unprecedented. They were the most visually spectacular and symbolically significant attacks that have ever been levelled against a major world power by a relatively small group of people. The observation is only true if we emphasize ‘by a small group’. At first it seems like a somewhat inconsequential qualification. What should it matter if spectacular violence is carried out by a group that is large or small? The attacks of 11 September fit into a category if we consider other supremely creative acts of violence with potent symbolic or shock value. The destruction of important monuments or buildings has a long history, such as the burning of the White House by the British in 1814 or the Tuileries Palace by the Paris Commune in 1871. Other instances of spectacular violence combine potent images with much higher death tolls. After taking Isfahan, the 14th-century ruler Timur had some 50 pyramids built from thousands of human heads<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1474885111417776">10</xref></sup> and the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed many thousands of people while producing the indelible images of mushroom clouds and ‘shadows’ of disintegrated persons on walls.</p>
<p>However, the number of people involved in the attacks becomes crucial as an indication of the power of Al Qaeda. Definitions of power are nearly as ubiquitous as definitions of terrorism but for the purposes of this article I will rely on Hannah Arendt's conception.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1474885111417776">11</xref></sup> Arendt defines power as people acting in concert with one another.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1474885111417776">12</xref></sup> Though not reducible to the number of people involved, organizations become more powerful as more people actively participate in them. As much as (or more than) the number of people involved, Arendt suggests the quality of the action matters: people may obey the specific requests of an organization, or consent to its rule more generally, or they may enthusiastically participate in and influence the character of an organization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1474885111417776">13</xref></sup> When people stop participating in an organization it loses its power or disbands altogether. The claim that the attacks of 11 September were unprecedented depends on the idea that it was carried out by people who were relatively powerless – in proportion to the destructive capacity that the organization demonstrated on that day, Al Qaeda had a relatively small number of people in it who were enthusiastic and active participants.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1474885111417776">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>From this vantage point, we can begin to explore the various and surprising ways terror and power intersect. The idea that terrorism is distinguished by its status as a ‘weapon of the weak’ has a certain common-sense appeal to it and I will argue that terror and power do sit in uneasy relationship to one another. But three facts seem to undermine the idea that terror and power are incommensurate. First, the attacks of 11 September may have been carried out by a relatively weak group, but they seem to have increased the power of Al Qaeda by inspiring people to join or imitate the organization. This is a complicated claim because, while the attacks themselves may have inspired people by showing Al Qaeda to be a capable and vanguard organization, the fact that the attacks provoked such an extraordinary violent response from the United States may have been even more important in growing its power. This raises the question: how does terror create power and is the power it creates sustainable? Also, can terror destroy power and, if so, how?</p>
<p>Second, the words terrorism and terrorist were introduced into the lexicon in commentary on the Reign of Terror<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1474885111417776">15</xref></sup> and, more recently, the 20th century certainly bears out the fact that the use of spectacular, horrific violence for the purpose of inducing fear among publics is among the toolset available to governments. These facts unsettle the ubiquitous idea that terrorism, by definition, is something practised by non-state actors. Can terror sustain the power of states? In particular, what is the relationship between terror, the rule of law and legitimacy in liberal democracies?</p>
<p>Finally, the other political technique most commonly associated with the phrase ‘weapon of the weak’ is nonviolence. Causing terror and practising nonviolence <italic>are</italic> incommensurable. If Arendt is correct in her claim that nonviolence is power in its ‘pure state’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1474885111417776">16</xref></sup> than perhaps terror and power are opposites. But how can we make sense of the fact that both techniques are associated with the weak? Why is it that the downtrodden and oppressed are perceived as being best served by such diametrically opposed methods?</p>
<sec id="sec1-1474885111417776"><title>The mutually exclusive aspects of terror and power</title>
<p>The most famous critical commentary on the excesses of the Reign of Terror introduces the term into the modern English lexicon, but it refers to an earlier source. In <italic>Reflections on the Revolution in France,</italic> Edmund Burke describes feeling a visceral and ‘natural’ moral aversion to the events of 6 October 1789, a ‘day of confusion, alarm, dismay and slaughter’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1474885111417776">17</xref></sup> Burke writes that when Parisian women marched on Versailles and forced the King to come to Paris:
<disp-quote>
<p>We are alarmed into reflexion; our minds (as it has long since been observed) are purified by terror and pity; our weak unthinking pride is humbled, under the dispensations of a mysterious wisdom. – Some tears might be drawn from me, if such a spectacle were exhibited on the stage. I should be truly ashamed of finding in myself that superficial, theatric sense of painted distress, whilst I could exult over it in real life.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1474885111417776">18</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>As Clark's edition of <italic>Reflections</italic> notes, Burke refers here to chapter 6 of the <italic>Poetics</italic>, where Aristotle defines tragedy as an imitation of an action that is ‘serious and also, as having magnitude, complete in itself … with incidents arousing pity and fear (φόβος), wherewith to accomplish its catharsis of such emotions’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1474885111417776">19</xref></sup> Though sometimes translated as fear, Burke's translation of <italic>phobos</italic> as terror is consistent with its ancient usage in most contexts.</p>
<p>For instance, in the <italic>Illiad</italic>, <italic>phobos</italic> usually refers to the moment in battle when the fear of one's opponent becomes so overwhelming that it induces panic or flight. Although Homer's use emphasizes the physical reaction of fleeing, this feeling of extreme fear is not just an autonomic reaction but has a psychological component.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1474885111417776">20</xref></sup> A skilled army or leader ‘devises’ (µήστωρ) to inspire <italic>phobos</italic> in the minds and bodies of their opponents in order to produce a rout.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1474885111417776">21</xref></sup> Likewise, great warriors and stalwart armies can resist it if they are mindful of their own strength.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1474885111417776">22</xref></sup> Diomedes is adept at both inspiring and resisting <italic>phobos</italic> and is able to persuade armies to retain mental balance and not panic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1474885111417776">23</xref></sup> Plato also says <italic>phobos</italic> is a mental state – ‘the expectation of pain’ – and has the Athenian stranger in <italic>The Laws</italic> argue that the common opinion of a city about how to manage this expectation (best formed by reason) is what we call law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1474885111417776">24</xref></sup> The term also appears in Plato's <italic>Phaedo</italic>, where it indicates a brand of fear akin to doubt.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1474885111417776">25</xref></sup> So Burke's emphasis on the aspect of terror or panic that disorients and yet inspires thinking seems warranted.</p>
<p>In addition, the experience of such extreme fear and its psychologically overwhelming aspects are associated in Homer with the divine. For instance, he uses the term <italic>phobos</italic> to indicate the authority and awe-inspiring capacity of the gods. When Apollo hovers over and leads the Trojans in battle his aegis is ‘awful, gleaming, bright’ in order to induce <italic>phobos</italic> among the Acheans.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1474885111417776">26</xref></sup> Phobos is personified and paired with another word for and personification of terror, Deimos, both of whom are the sons of the war god Ares.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1474885111417776">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is surprising that no extant analyses of terrorism have noticed Burke's use of Aristotle or the use of terror in ancient texts more generally. However, in Jeremy Waldron's post-9/11 reflections on the topic he describes terrorism is ways consistent with <italic>phobos</italic>. Though Waldron considers a number of different definitions of terrorism and insists that he does not want to define it, he moves steadily away from the idea that terrorism consists of the use of fear to win immediate concessions from certain actors and towards the idea that terrorism aims to create a ‘psycho-social state’. Waldron introduces the term ‘Ψ’ to avoid offering a hard and fast definition of this psycho-social state but then defines it quite precisely, saying that certain actions leave us in ‘a state of shock’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1474885111417776">28</xref></sup> ‘a state of panic’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1474885111417776">29</xref></sup> and ‘work more or less to short-circuit deliberation’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1474885111417776">30</xref></sup> by making us ‘mindless with terror’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1474885111417776">31</xref></sup> While ordinary fear may allow for informed decisions, terror does not leave room for and does not intend to ‘leave room for rational calculation on the part of the victim’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1474885111417776">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Samuel Scheffler writes that ‘the word “terrorism” is morally suggestive precisely because “terror” is its linguistic root … if we define the term in a way that effaces of even breaks the connection between terrorism and terror’ we are liable to miss its moral salience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1474885111417776">33</xref></sup> The same is true of its political salience. If we take inciting terror to be the distinguishing feature of terrorism, then it is a subset of or partner to physical violence. Physical violence does not necessarily work by way of fear, let alone terror. Physical violence, defined as ‘the use of another's body in order to submit or destroy their will for some purpose’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1474885111417776">34</xref></sup> can theoretically be effective through simply adjusting the character of the material world. For instance, violence can be used to physically remove people from a piece of land or kill and thereby eliminate an individual or group whose interests conflict with our own. However, because violence is always accompanied by the possibility (which is not to say certainty) of inspiring fear in those who witness it, it is both rare and foolish to use violence without considering how the fear it inspires might affect a given political dynamic.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1474885111417776">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>The kind of fear implied by the term terrorism has a particular character. By referencing Aristotle's definition of tragedy, Burke highlights the performative aspect of terror. Terrorism is a distinctive form of violence because it anticipates an audience for violence and aims to heighten and then leverage its potential for fear to the point where it may produce a physical reaction in people: awe, trembling, panic, flight, bewilderment. Waldron emphasizes that terror not only influences people's decision-making by imposing or threatening costs but hampers people's ability to make decisions at all by producing an affective response that overwhelms everything else.</p>
<p>The most important result of this, from a political standpoint, is that terror destroys power. As described by Arendt, power requires an immediate, if tenuous and minimal, degree of trust and predictability. We cannot act with others without a modicum of shared principles and assumptions, even if this only means agreeing to meet in a particular place. Power cannot be ‘stored up and kept in reserve for emergencies, like the instruments of violence’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1474885111417776">36</xref></sup> instead it is ‘dependent upon the unreliable and only temporary agreement of wills and intentions’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1474885111417776">37</xref></sup> This temporary agreement of wills and intentions ‘preserves the public realm and the space of appearance, and as such it is also the lifeblood of the human artifice’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1474885111417776">38</xref></sup> The most powerful movements and organizations are enlivened by the active participation of many thousands or even millions of people. Governments are powerful because their citizens find it worth their while to invest their time and energy in common projects or in disagreeing with one another about common projects. A lively public sphere is a realm of uncertainty and plurality but markets and meetings, gatherings and committees, are only possible among people who trust one another enough to appear in one another's presence in the first place and then, perhaps, act together.</p>
<p>Terror is not a <italic>means</italic> for destroying power. Experiencing terror is the opposite of experiencing power (or, the opposite of what we usually call being ‘in power’). Terror quite literally makes it impossible for us to act with others. The experience of terror shatters the tenuous and temporary agreement of wills and intentions. Fear causes us to isolate ourselves, which makes our common projects founder. People rarely gather together or appear in public if they are terrified and if they are terrified while in public they cannot act together. Usually, they attempt to flee, thereby destroying the realm of appearances. Summarizing passages in the <italic>Origins of Totalitarianism</italic> Waldron writes that ‘radical and panic-stricken mistrust [reduces] opportunities for both public deliberation and private conversation [and this] effects a radical isolation of individuals from one another, leaving what were once citizens as helpless, terrified, isolated animals’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1474885111417776">39</xref></sup> The aim of terror ‘is not to cow people into doing any one set of things rather than another; but just to produce a human population that is cowed (tout court)’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1474885111417776">40</xref></sup> Terror disintegrates power by eroding any sense of trust and thwarting the possibility of even minimal agreement by causing panic, disorientation and a high degree of uncertainty. The upshot is the ‘attenuation of large-scale social interaction’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1474885111417776">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is often said that terror is produced by acting in ways that are ‘random’. Michael Walzer writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>The systematic terrorizing of whole populations is a strategy of both conventional and guerilla war, and of established governments as well as radical movements. Its purpose is to destroy the morale of a nation or a class, to undercut its solidarity; its method is the random murder of innocent people. Randomness is the crucial feature of terrorist activity … Death must come by chance … until they feel themselves fatally exposed and demand that their governments negotiate for their safety.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1474885111417776">42</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>However, Walzer's own analysis demonstrates that the idea that terror is random is not quite correct. Since causing terror requires a concern with audience, terror has a subjective element that relates to <italic>particular</italic> cultural mores and aesthetic sensibilities. Walzer writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>However the political code is specified, terrorism is the deliberate violation of its norms … In its modern manifestations, terror is the totalitarian form of war and politics. It shatters the war convention and the political code. It breaks across moral limits beyond which no further limitation seems possible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1474885111417776">43</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>If terror means disintegrating, challenging or discombobulating common-sense understandings of legitimate uses of violence then destroying certain targets can efface the order of the day and amplify an audience's sense of insecurity. The destruction of places that hold symbolic significance, people who occupy positions of authority or garner respect and admiration, or any other person or object understood to be beautiful, sacred or important erodes our sense of cultural, social and legal stability. Destroying certain things and people can predictably produce terror. None of this is ‘random’. In fact, it requires being highly attuned to particular circumstances, attacking and destroying very particular things, and doing so in very particular ways.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1474885111417776">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, by keeping an audience in mind, people can make violence <italic>appear</italic> random and indiscriminate. That is, the members of a particular audience for terror believe ‘it could have been me’ and their sense of fear is heightened by their inability to predict and control the violence. In addition, violence that attacks things or persons that are important in a given political culture may appear random to the target audience because monuments and offices represent the orienting values of that culture or the common assumptions of a particular configuration of power. Destroying critical things or persons is disorienting. Terror impedes a group's ability to function by breaking social bonds and sowing a sense of insecurity. The experience of acting with others – being willing to appear and act in public – and the experience of feeling terrified and morally disoriented are to a large extent mutually exclusive.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1474885111417776"><title>Specifying audiences for terror, or, destroying and inspiring power with terrorism</title>
<p>Burke writes that the terrifying events of 6 October 1789 would have made him weep ‘if such a spectacle were exhibited on the stage’ but the fact that the events were part of ‘real life’ makes him ashamed of his ‘superficial, theatric sense of painted distress’. However, even while suggesting a distinction between theatrical performances that elicit terror and the real-life events of the French Revolution, Burke links the term terror to performance. Indeed, despite the fact that the events took place in real life, Burke notes that the moving of the King to Paris did not produce terror among Revd Richard Price or his congregation<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1474885111417776">45</xref></sup> and Burke sets out to convince us that we ought to be as terrified as he is.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1474885111417776">46</xref></sup> What I have described thus far can be understood as a first order or phenomenological analysis of power and terror. Terror, or the experience of dread and panic, does not sit well with power, or people acting with one another in the public sphere. However, even at this level of analysis, the relationship between power and terror is more complicated.</p>
<p>If terror aims at an audience and is enhanced by violating certain norms or destroying certain people or objects, then the same acts may be more or less terrifying to different groups of people. To some extent, terrorism is in the eye of the beholder, as the old cliché that ‘one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter’ suggests. Terrorists can and, as a consequence of human plurality, to some extent must play to multiple audiences at once. Actions meant to induce terror may speak to and construct audiences of remarkably varying sizes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1474885111417776">47</xref></sup> On the high end, certain actions may have terrified all of humanity, for instance, the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1474885111417776">48</xref></sup> In the middle range, most terrorism terrifies some people but not others. In both the character of the action and the post-hoc explanation for the action, people usually aim to induce terror among audiences comprised of, for instance, particular nationalities, political parties, religions, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, classes or races. On the low end, some acts aim to induce terror among a small group of people or even in a single person.</p>
<p>Consider assassination. Walzer argues that assassinations should not be understood as acts of terrorism, because they are not and do not appear to be random.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1474885111417776">49</xref></sup> However, if we stick to the idea that terrorism involves uses of violence that are calibrated to amplify the sense of fear to the point of dread in one's audience, it become clear that assassinations usually are terrorism. The difference between assassination and other forms of terror is in the size of the target audience. The possibility of wide variation in the character of the audience, even just among different kinds of assassinations, is instructive. The meaning and political import of a particular assassination is highly contingent, so much so that it affects who and how many people feel terrified by the event. Some assassins aim to shock a large group of people by demonstrating that even their most powerful or revered leaders, comrades, compatriots or citizens are vulnerable to attack. The assassination of Prime Ministers and Presidents, leaders of opposition parties and credible bargaining partners, can dampen a people's will to pursue their ends and hamstring their ability to come to agreement and take collective action. If terrorist actions that ‘randomly’ target civilians (in a certain place or of a certain type) give people the sense that their government, organization or group cannot protect them, assassinations demonstrate that the leaders of the group or government cannot protect themselves.</p>
<p>However, other assassinations aim to instil terror among a more narrowly circumscribed group. During the 10th and 11th centuries, the Niziri, a minority group of Shia Muslims, developed a network of assassins and infiltrators for the purpose of ensuring the survival of their community and checking the interests of the dominant political culture. They aimed to inspire a general sense of ‘terror among rulers’ and were at times able to effect policy changes by simply threatening assassination.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1474885111417776">50</xref></sup> This raises the possibility that assassination will not produce terror among citizens or subjects at all. It might even have the opposite effect. The strategy of communist, anarchist, anti-colonial, nationalist and fascist assassins since the 19th century has been to show that a specific group of rulers is vulnerable. If citizens do not identify with those rulers, but view them as oppressive or corrupt, assassins may draw people to their cause. By demonstrating the ability to terrify rulers it may make ordinary people <italic>less</italic> afraid and, specifically, less afraid to meet with one another and join in common purpose. Terror experienced by rulers can make room for, or even inspire, new power among the ruled while dissolving the old.</p>
<p>Here we have found a critical aspect of the relationship between terror and power. Even as actors aim to terrify a particular audience, they may also play to or create another, second audience: those who witness the terrorists terrorizing the terrified. Terror may destroy or fray the ability of the primary, terrorized, audience to think or act together. That is, it may destroy power among certain people. At the same time, terror may instantiate power among this second audience of witnesses. Watching others experience terror can embolden and empower those who witness it. The use of terror for political purposes usually speaks to multiple audiences at once and with different messages.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1474885111417776">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>Consider the following examples. For the French aristocracy and some aristocratic observers abroad, the forced removal of the King from Versailles to Paris was terrifying, but for many ordinary Parisians challenging decorum and refusing to honour the monarchy was a step towards liberation. The Allied bombing of Dresden was indiscriminate and terrifying from the standpoint of the residents of the city. Who died or lived was largely ‘random’ in that it did not matter whether or not one supported Hitler, or whether one was even old enough to know who Hitler was. To the peoples of the Allied governments, who died was quite specific and purposeful: Germans. Similarly, the informality, arbitrariness and unrestrained brutality of the practice of lynching in the United States was meant to inspire terror among the African American community. But for racist whites, lynchings inspired curiosity, togetherness and a sense of moral rectitude.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1474885111417776">52</xref></sup> By selecting certain people or objects to destroy, electing to violate particular mores or norms, acts of terror instil fear in some and not in others.</p>
<p>Perceiving a second audience for terror introduces the possibility that terror is not entirely at odds with deliberation and thinking. Although a terrified audience may not be able to deliberate, in the passage cited Burke draws on Aristotle in emphasizing that those who witness others being terrified <italic>are</italic> made to think. ‘We are alarmed into reflexion’ writes Burke. Our minds ‘are purified by terror and pity’. Our ‘unthinking pride is humbled, under the dispensations of a mysterious wisdom’. This is what Kropotkin called the ‘propaganda of the deed’. Waldron notes that this can work even if those who witness terror condemn it. A ‘conversation which proceeds explicitly on the basis that a worthy end cannot justify terrorist means, nevertheless involves its participants in discussion about the end – and that itself may be a major achievement for a previously obscure political group’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1474885111417776">53</xref></sup> Reactionaries and revolutionaries agree that terror is food for thought, even while they agree that the other side is unthinking in their practice of terror or their reaction to it.</p>
<p>The difficulty of sorting through whether or not terror disables or inspires deliberation and thinking in a particular instance or among a particular group of people is a consequence of the fact that, in most instances, the distinction between the two audiences I am describing here is not hard and fast. Though most acts intended to cause terror have in mind an audience that will experience terror ‘first hand’ and another audience that will witness others being terrified ‘second hand’, the plurality of every human group and the need to create the appearance of being unrestrained can make it hard to delineate who is part of which audience. Some people may experience extraordinary violence first hand and not feel terrified. In fact, unless they are kept in a state of perpetual terror, members of terrified audiences eventually become, in effect, witnesses to their own terror retrospectively. The reactions they have may not be what those who inspire terror imagine they ought to be. Likewise, it may be that for those who do not technically experience extraordinary violence first hand, just hearing about or seeing mediated versions of horrific violence may produce panic or knee-jerk reactions. Audiences are fickle and some terrorist performances are not properly calibrated to the audience meant to witness but not be disoriented by an action. Members of the two groups I have described here can be the same persons at different times. At any rate, the potential for acts of terror to both inspire and destroy power as well as inspire and destroy our ability to deliberate and think – in one fell swoop – turns on how actors construct and play to their audiences.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1474885111417776"><title>Terror and the rule of law</title>
<p>From what has been said thus far, it would seem that terror and the rule of law must be opposed to one another. Terror plays to an audience by breaking rules and subverting norms and the law must be first and foremost among these for a given society. In particular, the rule of law in liberal political theory involves the creation of predictable, known standards that are applied by uninterested parties. This seems to be the opposite of unpredictable, confusing and arbitrarily applied actions that inspire terror. Indeed, Waldron argues that terrorists cause a psycho-social state outside the range of what a ‘government wants or needs or can tolerate in its subject population’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1474885111417776">54</xref></sup> He argues that even if terrorism first and foremost produces a certain affective condition, that reaction can be leveraged: a ‘government might be coerced by the loss of something it values very highly – indeed, something indispensable for its status as government – namely the ability to command and mobilize a large civilian population’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1474885111417776">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet it is not the case that law, and even the rule of law as formulated by liberalism, is entirely opposed to terror in theory and practice. What follows is a cursory history or, more accurately, a series of chronologically arranged windows into what modern political thought has to say about the relationship between terror and the rule of law. Irreconcilable contradictions among different thinkers in the tradition are apparent. However, I will suggest that such a history at least allows us to make the following, rather modest, claims: 1) establishing the rule of law creates the potential for acts of terror; 2) The rule of law cannot thrive on terror alone.</p>
<p>At the dawn of modern political thought in the West, Machiavelli observes something remarkable and surprising. It is possible to simultaneously terrify <italic>and</italic> win over an audience. When Cesare Borgia chopped in half the cruel minister that he himself had appointed and placed him in the public square, Machiavelli reports that the heretofore unruly people of the Romagna were ‘at once stunned and satisfied’ and that the duke ‘now found himself powerful’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1474885111417776">56</xref></sup> Borgia is able to achieve the most difficult but desirable combination of sentiments from the public: they both fear and love him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1474885111417776">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>The action has a curiously ambivalent relationship to the law. After years of corrupt and oppressive leaders who had not so much ruled as plundered, the people of the province were divided against one another – ‘full of robbers, feuds, and lawlessness of every description’. Borgia's cruel minister, Remirro de Orco, re-established order. Cognizant of the hatred that his minister had inspired, Borgia first set up a civil court ‘with an excellent judge and a representative from each city’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-1474885111417776">58</xref></sup> Killing de Orco may have suggested to the people that Borgia was responding to their complaints before the court. Yet when Machiavelli recounts the incident in his diplomatic legations of 1502 he says that: ‘Nobody feels sure of the cause of [de Orco's] death, except that so it has pleased the Prince, who shows that he can make and unmake men as he likes, according to their desserts.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-1474885111417776">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>To convey simultaneously that one is unrestrained and arbitrary and yet not without a sense of justice is an impressive move. Although the terms terrorism and terrorist were a product of commentary on the French Revolution, the word terror was already closely associated with law in the Anglophone philosophy of the 17th century. The extent to which this has been overlooked in analyses of terror amounts to a kind of collective amnesia and the oversight is especially surprising when it occurs among political theorists. For instance, Scheffler writes that, for Hobbes, the ‘establishment of society offers relief from fear’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-1474885111417776">60</xref></sup> Waldron notices that Hobbes's preferred government utilizes fear but writes that Hobbes's conception of freedom ‘[strains] the fabric of his philosophy’ because it means we might be able to disobey the law, which is after all ‘just one fear … among many’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-1474885111417776">61</xref></sup> He wonders if perhaps Hobbes does not consider the possibility that ‘there might not be some threats which loom so large’ that they preclude the kind of rational deliberation Hobbes seems to prize.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-1474885111417776">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>A plain reading of Hobbes shows that he thinks the best governments systematize the evocation of extraordinary fear that Machiavelli sees in Borgia's actions. At the foundation of the social contract tradition is the idea that the sovereign must retain the right to absolute and arbitrary physical force and that the law must be terrifying. Hobbes writes that ‘without the terror of some power’ to cause the laws of nature to be observed they are quickly overrun by the interests and passions of individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-1474885111417776">63</xref></sup> He names his commonwealth Leviathan to indicate that our natural right to do anything and everything pursuant to our preservation in the state of nature has been transferred to government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-1474885111417776">64</xref></sup> Terror instilled by the law is <italic>legitimate</italic> terror because it is founded upon the agreement of wills. Yet while Hobbes certainly argues that every rational person should see the benefit of trading our fear of the arbitrary will of every other person for the terror of law made by the arbitrary will of a single decision-maker, the advantage of such a Leviathan in practice lies precisely in its capacity to ‘keep them all in awe’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-1474885111417776">65</xref></sup> He hopes to create a ‘Mortal God’ that ‘hath the use of so much power and strength conferred on him that by terror thereof he is enabled to conform the wills of them all’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-1474885111417776">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>Liberal and democratic thinkers who come after Hobbes temper or refute the connection between terror and the rule of law. Montesquieu writes that the despot becomes ‘the law, the state, and the prince’ and a ‘timid, ignorant, and faint-spirited people [under tyranny] have not occasion for a great number of laws’. Instead, since the spring of action and the principle that animates despotism is fear, ‘politics, with its several springs and law, must here be very much limited’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-1474885111417776">67</xref></sup> For Montesquieu, the rule of law is specifically not excessive, arbitrary and terrifying – it metes out punishment that is consistent with and proportional to the crimes committed. Living in a free society with the rule of law means not fearing for one's life and not being afraid of one's own government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-1474885111417776">68</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, John Locke argues that freedom ‘from Absolute, Arbitrary Power, is so necessary to, and closely joined with a Man's Preservation, that he cannot part with it’ without violating the law of nature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-1474885111417776">69</xref></sup> The purpose of human law is to end the arbitrary and biased use of our enforcement power and create a ‘settled, known <italic>Law</italic>’ and set up a ‘<italic>known and indifferent Judge</italic>, with Authority to determine all differences according to the established law’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-1474885111417776">70</xref></sup> Locke refutes the legitimacy of Hobbes's sovereign by arguing that neither the natural law, nor any human law, endows a government, let alone an individual, with arbitrary and absolute enforcement powers. Instead, our natural enforcement power in the state of nature is to repair and restrain those who violate the law of nature and the social contract gives that power – and only that power – to government.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-1474885111417776">71</xref></sup> To endorse Hobbes's view is ‘to think that Men are so foolish that they take care to avoid what Mischiefs may be done them by <italic>Pole-Cats,</italic> or <italic>Foxes,</italic> but are content, nay think it Safety, to be devoured by <italic>Lions</italic>’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-1474885111417776">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>In part, however, Locke's attempt to separate the rule of law from terror and violence involves a rather suspect conceptual trick. Definitions of terrorism frequently exclude the possibility that states could practise terror. Indeed, some have argued that the very fact that ‘the deliberate production of fear’ is an ‘essential means of legitimate government’ means that the element of fear and terror should be excluded from definitions of terrorism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-1474885111417776">73</xref></sup> The root of the claim can be found in Locke's definition of violence as something that, by definition, is only practised by people who are not part of a legitimate government:
<disp-quote>
<p>[A] criminal, who having renounced reason, the common rule and measure God hath given to mankind, hath, by the unjust violence and slaughter he hath committed upon one, declared war against all mankind, and therefore may be destroyed as a lion or a tyger, one of those wild savage beasts, with whom men can have no society nor security: and upon this is grounded that great law of nature, <italic>Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-1474885111417776">74</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>That the term ‘unjust’ is used to modify ‘violence’ raises the possibility that there might be such a thing as ‘just violence’. However, Locke never uses the term in that way. If retributive and reparative forms of justice are not, by definition, violations, reactive force does not really destroy sentient, reasonable human beings. Whether a bloody act can be called violence involves determining whether it is done <italic>to</italic> a relatively beastly body (in which case it is not violence) or <italic>by</italic> a relatively beastly body (in which case it is).</p>
<p>In this way, the term violence in Locke's work does not hinge on the character of the action (i.e. its material and affective consequences and characteristics) but <italic>who performs</italic> the action. It is this definition of violence that currently informs those definitions of terrorism that associate it with particular actors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-1474885111417776">75</xref></sup> Walzer remarks that such definitions are ‘a small victory for the champions of order, among whom the uses of terror are by no means unknown’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-1474885111417776">76</xref></sup> In the current political climate, it seems like a very large victory. Instead of understanding terror as a particular kind of violence, terror has become a pejorative term for describing acts of violence by certain people and groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-1474885111417776">77</xref></sup> Inoculating certain actors from the possibility of practising terror and making others carry the label irrespective of the character of their actions is a useful rhetorical technique for governments interested in controlling how and when audiences feel terror.</p>
<p>At times, Locke seems to offer a way out of this problem, but at other times he further exacerbates it. On the one hand, Locke emphasizes that sometimes governments <italic>claim</italic> to be using legitimate force consistent with the rule of law but their actions in fact exceed the natural law and amount to violence. He warns that governments will often try to grasp for arbitrary and absolute power and, when they do, are no longer governments. Monarchs or legislatures can become criminal beasts like any other murderer, slave master or thief.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-1474885111417776">78</xref></sup> On the other hand, Locke offers an exception to his otherwise hard and fast rule that governments can never hold any individual in their absolute power. He says that if a person meets another on the battlefield and spares their life, she or he may enslave the prisoner of war. While in the <italic>Second Treatise</italic> Locke seems to understand such circumstances as highly circumscribed,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-1474885111417776">79</xref></sup> his role in writing the passages legalizing slavery in the Carolina Constitutions suggests a considerable blind spot.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-1474885111417776">80</xref></sup> In these contradictory tendencies we see that Locke attempts to decouple terror and legitimacy but that he does not entirely succeed.</p>
<p>A number of governments have contemplated the possibility of retaining legitimacy even while instilling terror in their own citizens. They have sought to do so not only for a time, as did Cesare Borgia, and not only ambivalently, as we see in liberalism, but as a principle of governing. In the 20th century, the attempt to integrate the disintegrative effects of terror into government reached an apex. Arendt argues that the cost of such attempts is power:
<disp-quote>
<p>Nowhere is the self-defeating factor in the victory of violence over power more evident than in the use of terror to maintain domination, about whose weird successes and eventual failures we know perhaps more than any generation before us. Terror is not the same as violence; it is, rather, the form of government that comes into being when violence, having destroyed all power, has not abdicated but, on the contrary, remains in full control. It has often been noticed that the effectiveness of terror depends almost entirely on the degree of social atomization. Every kind of organized opposition must disappear before the full force of terror can be let loose.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-1474885111417776">81</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Citizens in totalitarian societies cannot trust their neighbours and any meetings or associations not authorized by the state are suspect or destroyed. According to Arendt's definition of power, the organization of a society based on the principle of terror would be nearly impossible insofar as it would seem to exclude the possibility of power as vibrant, concerted action. Arendt remarks that every government requires <italic>some</italic> power, if only in the form secret informers,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-1474885111417776">82</xref></sup> but terror seems fundamentally incompatible with power.</p>
<p>Yet former and present totalitarian societies have achieved much more than the minimal power of a network of informers. While not exactly power as Arendt describes it, some sizeable portion of the citizens in totalitarian societies are not only terrified and socially isolated but enthusiastic participants in terror. Whether it is in the thrill of discovering something to tell the authorities about one's neighbours or the elation of participating in mass rallies and the public harassment and belittling of minorities, foreigners and dissenters, it is possible for citizens to feel terrified and terrifyingly powerful. People can at once be subject to and identify with violence that manages to be both transgressive and legitimate. It even seems possible to have these experiences all at once, or at least in very close proximity to one another.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-1474885111417776">83</xref></sup></p>
<p>The liberal argument that the rule of law is distinct from terror and the arbitrary rule of the sovereign has come under attack from other quarters as well. Giorgio Agamben's updating of Carl Schmidt's claim that the law only functions in the state of emergency and exception,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-1474885111417776">84</xref></sup> Foucault's critique of liberalism's brand of punishment and warfare,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-1474885111417776">85</xref></sup> historical analyses of Locke and Mill's colonial activities,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-1474885111417776">86</xref></sup> and studies of executive power and notions of prerogative in liberalism<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-1474885111417776">87</xref></sup> all suggest that the arbitrary and unrestrained exercise of sovereign power can be made consistent with liberalism in practice and perhaps in theory. Others have suggested that, at the very least, a political economy of fear is part and parcel of the way the rule of law works in liberalism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn88-1474885111417776">88</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps the most trenchant analysis of the ways violence and the law are intertwined is the line of thought that runs from George Sorel's <italic>Reflections on Violence,</italic> continues with Benjamin's <italic>Critique of Violence</italic> (<italic>Zur Kritik der Gewalt</italic>) and was picked up most recently by Jacques Derrida in <italic>The Force of Law</italic> (<italic>Force de Loi</italic>). Sorel understands why his pacifist socialist contemporaries are repulsed by the memory of the French Revolution, but he argues that the syndicates should embrace violence anyway. Just as the ideals of liberalism were sustained by the ‘epic of the wars which had filled the French soul with an enthusiasm analogous to that provoked by religions’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn89-1474885111417776">89</xref></sup> unions should employ the general strike ‘which will appear more and more terrifying as violence takes a greater place in the mind of the proletariat’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn90-1474885111417776">90</xref></sup> Benjamin and Derrida are less willing to openly embrace violence let alone terror, but they both find Sorel's argument compelling in certain respects. Benjamin creates a typology of the various kinds of violence Sorel describes and argues that violence destroys, preserves and founds the law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn91-1474885111417776">91</xref></sup> He notes that the police in democracies (as opposed to absolute monarchies) hold the potential for the ‘greatest conceivable degeneration of violence’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn92-1474885111417776">92</xref></sup> For this reason, the ‘“great” criminal, however repellent [arouses] the secret admiration’ of a public that both authorizes and is subject to the police.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn93-1474885111417776">93</xref></sup> Derrida writes that the German term <italic>gewalt</italic> connotes authoritative and legitimate violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn94-1474885111417776">94</xref></sup> He affirms and amplifies Benjamin's analysis by arguing that the police not only found and enforce the law but are the being of the polis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn95-1474885111417776">95</xref></sup></p>
<p>How can this be squared with the ideas of Locke and Montesquieu? Does the rule of law in liberal democracies rely on terror or does it require a definitive rejection of it? Arendt argues that the combination of power, the rule of law, and terror is tenuous or unsustainable, yet she warns we should not underestimate the potential for the appearance of such political supernovas. Liberal democratic societies are certainly not immune from the appeal of terror. It was not a government founded on fascist, Marxist or Islamic ideas that first tried to combine terror, power and the law in the modern era. It was Robespierre, an advocate of liberty, equality and fraternity, who said ‘Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible; it is therefore an emanation of virtue.’ Even if success is relatively rare,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn96-1474885111417776">96</xref></sup> we know that campaigns of terror can engulf the domestic politics of particular states and even lead to the establishment of new governments.</p>
<p>Samuel Scheffler tries to clarify the relationship between terror and the rule of law by distinguishing between state terror, which stabilizes extant orders, and terrorism, which is conducted by non-state actors and is revolutionary or destabilizing. The labels ‘state terror’ and ‘terrorism’ are particularly unhelpful because, even in Scheffler's own examples, whether or not an organization is a state has surprisingly little to do with the character of its interests in causing terror. For instance, Scheffler calls what the Ku Klux Klan did in supporting segregation ‘substate terror’ since it was intended to conserve the existing order,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn97-1474885111417776">97</xref></sup> but ‘substate’ here simply means not a state. Likewise, he says that states may use terror to destabilize other societies (or in the domestic context ‘to create a certain limited degree of instability’),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn98-1474885111417776">98</xref></sup> which makes what they are doing more like terrorism than state terror by his rendering. However, despite the terminological missteps, the observation that terror (by whatever kind of organization) can both support and undermine existing orders is critically important. Scheffler's analysis puts a point on much of what has already been said. How can it be that undermining social relations, sowing fear and mistrust, and imposing arbitrary and unpredictable punishments can <italic>reinforce</italic> the law?</p>
<p>Let us take the example of the United States’ War on Terror. Like Borgia, it seems that the United States government keeps its right to terror an ‘open secret’. Torture and sexual humiliation as pseudo-policy at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib, the CIA's programme of extraordinary renditions to black sites and the use of drones that kill suspected terrorists in sovereign countries but also kill innocent civilians,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn99-1474885111417776">99</xref></sup> are all examples of state-directed terrorism. In each case, the President acts more or less unilaterally and with little regard for domestic or international law or perhaps winks at subordinates and then looks the other way. In each case, it is not the official policy of the United States to terrify people, but the effect of the policies is to do just that.</p>
<p>The United States government reserves the right in times of emergency to go beyond the rule of law as described in the Constitution and as set up in its own statutes. The executive can use terror if necessary, but for the purposes of preserving the legitimacy of the law (and the very capacity to carry out terrifying transgressions of it), the status of the actions is either entirely ‘off the books’ or legal but also perfunctory, superficial or questionable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn100-1474885111417776">100</xref></sup> Here the issue of audiences and power return. Terror used by a government without the support of its people, especially in a liberal democracy, threatens to unravel the legitimacy of the law. Terror used in ‘secret’ with the tacit support of a vengeful and ethnocentric citizenry<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn101-1474885111417776">101</xref></sup> may be sustainable. As is the case with Machiavelli's example of Cesare Borgia, the arbitrary will and terrifying actions of the government may exceed the law but also momentarily coincide with the will of the people, under the cover of not knowing exactly who did it.</p>
<p>By keeping terror an <italic>open</italic> secret powerful organizations can produce interesting audience effects. On the one hand, organizations with a modicum of power already have the ability to speak to large audiences. Established and powerful organizations do not want to undermine their legitimacy by soiling their public face with blood. On the other hand, if a powerful organization feels threatened it may be difficult to distinguish which members of its audience are disobedient troublemakers. By keeping open secrets, powerful actors try to have it both ways: appear benign to one's larger audience and terrifying to those who might try to reconfigure power.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn102-1474885111417776">102</xref></sup> Terror intended to conserve power attempts to destroy or discourage a small number of audience members through consolidating the hold on the larger audience.</p>
<p>The manner in which the United States government killed Osama Bin Laden had many of these features. It was a spectacular act of violence both in the dramatic invasion of the compound in Pakistan and in the reported shooting of Bin Laden in the face. The operation was carried out in secret with dubious international legal authority. The outcome was met with wide public approval in the United States. Attentive to the possibility of eliciting sympathy for Bin Laden from some audiences, the Obama administration decided to not release pictures of Bin Laden's body and dispose of it at sea. Along with keeping terror an open secret, another way to navigate these tricky audience effects is to externalize arbitrary and unbound sovereignty. The idea that ‘the control of external intercourse was “executive”’ in its nature – that foreign matters require flexible human judgement and cannot be regulated by law – has a long history of supporters ranging from Quincy Wright and Louis Henkin to Locke, Montesquieu and Blackstone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn103-1474885111417776">103</xref></sup> In this way the use of terror by democratic governments has historically divided its audience along the lines of national boundaries. However, the internal/external distinction in the United States’ War on Terror has been partially undermined by certain provisions of the Patriot Act, the spectre of domestic surveillance, the implementation of a new, extensive regime of procedures at airports and the fact that the Bush administration claimed the prerogative to declare any American citizen an enemy combatant. The Obama administration, while jettisoning the phrase ‘War on Terror’, has left most of these aspects of the Bush administration's response intact, reportedly even ordering the assassination of an American citizen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn104-1474885111417776">104</xref></sup></p>
<p>If liberal democracies periodically violate the rule of law by preserving arbitrary power for executives, is terror at least inconsistent with the rule of law in and of itself? Scheffler argues that the rule of law requires fear but this is not ‘genuine fear’ because most people in stable societies under the rule of law do not feel terror.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn105-1474885111417776">105</xref></sup> It would seem that terror is ‘arbitrary’ and the ‘rule of law’ is specific and delimited. However, the rule of law and its attendant claim to legitimacy from the point of view I am developing here can be understood as simply another way to divide up the audience for terror. Criminals feel terror; innocents do not.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn106-1474885111417776">106</xref></sup> As Derrida notes, the law paradoxically gains its transcendent quality from the fact that it is an immediate, ‘performative act’. It can be ‘violent and non-violent because it depends only on who is before it’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn107-1474885111417776">107</xref></sup> By delimiting the target of terror, governments create various audiences and attempt to retain legitimacy among ‘the innocent’. Moreover, since the exercise of power requires some understanding of how we ought to act when we are together, the rule of law can quite literally instantiate power – and terrifying configurations of power at that. Those who act and interact with others according to the rules are part of the protected, innocent, sphere of power. Those who break the rules are outside the bounds of power and subject to its exercise. In this way, the rule of law attempts to prohibit the exercise of certain forms of power and conserves or expands the power of those who act in accordance with it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn108-1474885111417776">108</xref></sup></p>
<p>Consider the death penalty. The death penalty is ritually administered at midnight and can be stopped by the whims of a particular governor and in these ways maintains its status as a terrifying and somewhat arbitrary exercise of violence. But it is also legal. Montesquieu writes that a person tried and hanged in a state where the rule of law prevails ‘would have much more liberty than a pasha enjoys in Turkey’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn109-1474885111417776">109</xref></sup> The basis of his claim is that liberty inheres in our opinion of our security. That is, Montesquieu writes that we have liberty when we do not <italic>feel</italic> afraid and when people see that the rule of law is in operation they learn to feel secure. In states where power is balanced, citizens who are put to death can be certain that it is not an arbitrary death. We need not be afraid of the law, as long as we are among those who obey it. Every despot, on the contrary, lives in fear, even as they impose their arbitrary will on others.</p>
<p>However, there are at least two problems with this argument. Racial biases, the related controversy over its constitutionality and the ritual aspects mentioned ensure that the death penalty in the United States is akin to arbitrary executive terror. However, even if it was practised in a way that perfectly conformed to liberal theories of the rule of law, we might ask whether the officious aspects of the death penalty make it less or <italic>more</italic> terrifying. The prospect of being electrocuted or injected with deadly drugs, not by a person who hates me or because of a biased justice system, but as a consequence of the fair and impartial judgment of a jury of my peers seems particularly terrifying in its cold reasonableness. Paradoxically, bureaucratic and impersonal killing, specifically designed to routinize and cleanse the administration of death, gives the law extraordinary affective charge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn110-1474885111417776">110</xref></sup> Those who argue that the death penalty has a deterrent effect reveal that the purpose of enforcing the law in this way is to support certain configurations of power by encouraging the ‘innocent’ to think about the terrifying killing of those who fail to maintain their innocence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn111-1474885111417776">111</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is puzzling that Waldron falls prey to the idea that terrified populations and governance are at odds. His own description of terror is drawn in part from Arendt's analysis of totalitarianism and it seems that liberal government and the rule of law can also be made consistent with terror, at least for a time. Neither Burke's use of the term terror nor the ancient term <italic>phobos</italic> connotes non-governmental actors. Burke argues that the French Revolutionaries ‘will hold power by arts similar to those by which [they have] acquired it’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn112-1474885111417776">112</xref></sup> and that their ‘laws are to be supported only by their own terrors’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn113-1474885111417776">113</xref></sup> Even if one believes there is a brand of liberalism that precludes the sort of policies Robespierre implemented, to entirely separate the rule of law from terror requires a vigorous critique that no liberal thinker has yet been able to muster.</p>
<p>Completely separating terror and the rule of law is probably not possible. The creation of a rule must involve excluding or proscribing some action. The rule therefore creates two <italic>possibilities</italic> for terror. First, in demanding conformity to the rule, it necessarily threatens those who do not conform. Second, promulgating a rule implies the possibility of breaking it. In and of itself making a rule does not create terror, the potential for terror is only activated to the extent a rule is understood as legitimate and supported by power. With power, a rule becomes terrifying to those who would break it and those who do break it, especially if they do so in dramatic and public ways, will terrify the powerful. One way to understand the rule of law is as a standard configuration of power or a minimal set of expectations that make power possible. The rule trumps the needs and interests of individual persons in a given time and place, which can mean either that the law is in the public interest or that it stifles the possibility of new configurations of power that might better serve the public interest. Either way, establishing the rule of law opens up possibilities for terrifying enforcement and terrifying disobedience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1474885111417776"><title>Weapons of the weak</title>
<p>From what has been said thus far, it is clear that terror can be combined with power and the rule of law. Yet I want to maintain that the observation that terror and power are phenomenologically distinct means something for politics. Terror is always ‘out of power’ in that, even when used by governments, and even when used by liberal governments to enforce the law, it reflects an inability to find common ground with certain people. Using terror is an admission that one has failed to muster the necessary power to achieve one's goals, maintain one's rule or establish the kind of world for which one hoped. It suggests that the best one can do with respect to a particular person or group of people is try to prevent them from becoming powerful by terrifying them. Terror lies at the limits of power, where the rule of law is not based on mutual consent and good will, and therefore threatens to unravel.</p>
<p>By targeting different audiences, governments and other organizations try to calibrate and delimit terror in order to preserve what power they have while destroying it among criminals, oppressors or enemies. I have mentioned that powerful organizations may use terror in a way that tries to preserve extant legitimacy and power through the method of keeping open secrets. In contrast, revolutionary terror relies on publicity in order to produce the reverse effect. Without great numbers, a group which uses terror is much more interested in sowing ‘chaos’ in order to terrify a large audience. At the same time, an impressive public feat may draw a few more members to their small number. Small groups that do not have much power simply want to <italic>have</italic> a public face, even if it has blood on it. Terror is useful to relatively small and weak groups because it makes everyone else weak for a time, allowing the group to operate on a more level playing field. If governments or other powerful groups use coercion and terror at the outer limits of their power, those who cannot muster the cooperation of their fellow human beings to begin with may prefer everyone to be unorganized and disoriented. Unless the group consists of anarchists and nihilists, the hope is that from this chaos a new and preferable configuration of power will arise.</p>
<p>One of the peculiar aspects of the United States’ response to the 9/11 attacks is that the government steadfastly refused to place alleged terrorists within any existing legal framework. In fact, to say ‘alleged terrorists’ is claiming too much because the Bush administration determined that it did not have to allege anything to anyone about the people it associated with the attacks and that it had the power to hold them indefinitely and to do with them as they pleased. The response was peculiar because the attacks were so clearly a violation of a number of domestic and international laws.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn114-1474885111417776">114</xref></sup> One might think that in response to the disordering and disintegrative effects of the attacks, the government would aim to shore up the rule of law at home and demonstrate that violations of the laws governing the rules of war, many of which were put in place by the United States in creating the post-Second World War international institutions, would not be tolerated. Instead, those who the administration believed committed or assisted in the planning of the attacks were neither criminals nor enemy soldiers, but ‘enemy combatants’ – a category created by the Bush administration to designate people who were outside of both domestic and international law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn115-1474885111417776">115</xref></sup> In conjunction with the formulation of the Bush Doctrine and the invasion of Iraq, the response to the attacks seemed calibrated not to shore up the domestic and international order but to further destabilize it with ungeneralizable policies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn116-1474885111417776">116</xref></sup> ‘[T]he ramifications of saying that the United States can take military measures against Al Qaeda <italic>everywhere</italic> threaten to upset greatly not only the human rights of those targeted for rendition or killing but global public order more generally.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn117-1474885111417776">117</xref></sup></p>
<p>The response was also peculiar because conservatives a generation earlier had resisted the idea that terrorists be considered anything other than common criminals. In 1987, Paul Bremer said in a speech to the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco:
<disp-quote>
<p>So the rule of law, which treats terrorist acts as criminal acts and terrorists as criminals is beginning to work. But precisely because they fear the rule of law, terrorists have often tried to slip away from being called criminals by claiming to be warriors instead … But even the internationally accepted rules of war provide no hiding place for terrorists. The Geneva conventions on the rules of war outlaw nearly every act of terrorism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn118-1474885111417776">118</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>After 11 September, the government often represented itself as an individual in a lawless world as opposed to a bureaucracy that wields organized and legitimate force. President Bush's ‘cowboy rhetoric’ was not only an attempt to show that he was tough, but a reference to popular fantasies of the Wild West as a place where Americans fended for themselves against criminals, Indians and other non-whites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn119-1474885111417776">119</xref></sup> During the 2004 election, Dick Cheney renounced the idea that terrorism was a matter of law enforcement and chided John Kerry for thinking it was.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn120-1474885111417776">120</xref></sup></p>
<p>Is it possible for a relatively small group of people to use terror to erode and sow such uncertainty among great powers that those powers essentially dismantle themselves? What are the prospects for growing power and establishing a new rule of law internationally? Assaf Moghadam argues that Al Qaeda, using the 11 September attacks as a springboard, has made significant headway in globalizing martyrdom. He argues that the proliferation of suicide bombings around the world is not only the spread of a particular tactic, but indicates that many thousands of people are now participating in a worldwide movement that, while in some ways diffuse and diverse, shares a religious ideology and particular interpretation of Islamic law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn121-1474885111417776">121</xref></sup> The common Western perception that terrorism ‘is the antithesis of the rule of law’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn122-1474885111417776">122</xref></sup> and that Al Qaeda in particular is unconcerned with moral or legal standards is belied by attempts to make suicide attacks consistent with Islam, Al Qaeda's self-understanding as a vanguard for the umma, concerns within the organization and among its affiliates that terror not be overused<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn123-1474885111417776">123</xref></sup> and the constellation of discursive meanings that constitute martyrdom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn124-1474885111417776">124</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps the most important and interesting aspect of Al Qaeda's strategy has been the way it has enlisted the United States government in assisting its growth and influence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn125-1474885111417776">125</xref></sup> At present, the citizens of Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan are subject to and the primary audience for a seemingly endless stream of terrifying bombings by Al Qaeda or affiliated organizations. But the terrifying presence of the United States military in the region and the extraordinary violence that military has unleashed triangulates their meaning: they are attacks <italic>on</italic> ordinary Iraqis, Afghanis and Pakistanis but also <italic>for</italic> ordinary Iraqis, Afghanis and Pakistanis because they often aim to kill some of the occupying Americans and their local sympathizers as well. Studies suggest that suicide bombers are socially marginalized individuals for whom terrorist organizations provide a sense of social solidarity and togetherness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn126-1474885111417776">126</xref></sup> However, people who become martyrs are not generally poor or lacking in education, even if they tend to come from societies with a lack of economic opportunity. This is perhaps best explained by the fact that terrorist organizations can afford to be selective<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn127-1474885111417776">127</xref></sup> because terrorism in the name of Islam is attracting a lot of enthusiastic supporters. The 9/11 terror attacks were remarkable because a relatively small group of people showed that the kind of extraordinary terror governments in the 20th century wielded towards one another could be used by non-state actors to alter the character of international politics. Al Qaeda could not compete with states in terms of the number of people killed, but it demonstrated just how useful terror could be for the relatively powerless as a way of both undermining powerful actors and organizations and building organizational capacity and legitimacy.</p>
<p>Obviously, Al Qaeda has not succeeded in overturning the international order. In the Muslim world alone, Al Qaeda's use of terror has produced many detractors. Public approval of Al Qaeda in the Middle East has plummeted and, as Dana Villa notes, it does not seem to be inspiring a genuine mass movement.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn128-1474885111417776">128</xref></sup> The organization has many formidable competitors for both religious authority and political power, not the least of which are states. In addition, there are real obstacles to squaring Al Qaeda's actions with the Quran and Islamic tradition, including the various non-violent meanings of the term jihad, the fact that jihad is not one of the Five Pillars and the explicit prohibition against suicide in the Quran. Al Qaeda's potential for combining terror with power and legitimacy within the Middle East, let alone the world, remains an open question. Their success has been in undermining certain norms and principles, provoking others to follow suit, and proliferating new ideas about the rule of law at least among their burgeoning group of followers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the United States has struggled to argue that midnight house raids, drone attacks, torture, extraordinary rendition and civilian casualties as part and parcel of the invasions of the US and its allies are for the benefit of the people of Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Yemen. Some Americans find such arguments persuasive. Perhaps many of the Iraqis and Afghanis who have volunteered for their new national police and army are persuaded as well.</p>
<p>At the same time, many in the United States and, more strikingly, the military have been keen to point out that power and legitimacy can be eroded by the use of violence and terror and that the US and the governments it supports in the region cannot ultimately succeed without power and legitimacy. Empirical studies suggest that terrorist tactics by non-state actors rarely achieve their political objectives but military and police responses to such tactics also rarely destroy organizations willing to use them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn129-1474885111417776">129</xref></sup> As Samantha Power remarks, the Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual ‘practically screams out’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn130-1474885111417776">130</xref></sup> that the military alone cannot combat the use of terror by insurgent forces. The United States has shown an extraordinary ability to combine power, legitimacy and terror in wars past. Now, the government and people of the United States are continuing and calling that legacy into question.</p>
<p>The fact that terror and power are phenomenologically distinct means that terror cannot be the sole basis for the rule of law. This returns us to the issue of numbers. Terror seems more likely to be the animating principle of societies that are ruled by only one individual or a small group of people. Even the mob usually raises up a demagogue. Montesquieu explains this by arguing that institutionalizing multiple legitimate decision-makers has a moderating effect on governance because power is checked and balanced.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn131-1474885111417776">131</xref></sup> Attentive to the delicate balance between terror and power, Machiavelli notes that the support of the people helps inoculate rulers against assassins because aspiring rulers realize it will be difficult to rule after killing and replacing someone who has cultivated an active citizenry.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn132-1474885111417776">132</xref></sup> Arendt argues that power is ‘never the property of an individual’ and that when a person is in power ‘we actually refer to his being empowered by a certain number of people’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn133-1474885111417776">133</xref></sup> In fact, the only limitation on power
<disp-quote>
<p>is the existence of other people, but this limitation is not accidental, because human power corresponds to the condition of plurality to begin with. For the same reason, power can be divided without decreasing it, and the interplay of powers with their checks and balances is even liable to generate more power, so long, at least, as the interplay is alive and has not resulted in a stalemate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn134-1474885111417776">134</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Over time, the elements of conformity and obedience in organizations that embrace terror undermine power because only freedom and a plurality of perspectives can invigorate collective action and politics. Besides, when terror is combined with power and the rule of law it holds the potential for quite literally consuming itself, imploding by way of its exponentially greater capacity to destroy the people who are the very foundation of its existence.</p>
<p>If terror always threatens to destroy power, it is no wonder that many ordinary people in the Middle East feel disenfranchised. They have been cowed by corrupt authoritarian regimes, military intervention from the West, and religious zealots. How can power reassert itself when so many influential actors embrace the use of terror? At the outset, I noted that both terrorism and nonviolence are associated with the weak. Terror is a weapon of the weak in the sense that governments and other organizations that embrace it cannot muster the sufficient co-acting of people in their common cause. Nonviolence is the weapon of the weak for the opposite reason: all it has is people acting together with one another. The people at the bottom of society always have the numbers, but they may not have the degree and quality of organization that makes those ‘above’ them powerful. Nonviolence concerts the action of the downtrodden. Often, the most difficult aspect of such organizing is convincing people to not be afraid of one another or extant, armed power. Using nonviolence means rectifying the problem of weakness by building power straight away.</p>
<p>If those who are using the methods of nonviolence simultaneously withdraw their cooperation from existing power structures, it may terrify those who are ‘in power’. However, nonviolent methods specifically set out to mitigate and dampen fear as power is reconfigured. By renouncing the use of weapons, nonviolence does not have the physical strength of those who embrace their use and it does not directly threaten the physical life of others. One of the reasons governments often feel threatened by nonviolent movements is that the organizational capacity such movements build <italic>can</italic> be co-opted and used to exercise violence. But nonviolent methods such as civil disobedience, peaceful strikes, speeches and conscious suffering are ways of exercising power without any accoutrements. Those who use nonviolence are usually ‘weak’ in terms of their capacity to exercise force and violence in comparison with states or other organizations that retain not only the cooperation of a certain number of people but a complement of weaponry.</p>
<p>Nonviolence is the direct, perhaps more difficult, but certainly more enduring, way to build power because it requires convincing people that their needs and interests can be served by engaging in a common project. Nonviolence is power unalloyed with terror in the sense that it is self-sufficient and self-sustaining as opposed to the sort of power that, when exercised, plants the seeds of its own destruction. When its aims are stated clearly and direct action is carried out in a disciplined fashion it is nearly the opposite of acting to incite terror. By renouncing weapons, nonviolence is calibrated to reduce mistrust, encourage compromise and negotiation, and promote human togetherness. Though nonviolence may reconfigure power it does not destroy it. It leaves open the possibility for others to join with those who are newly organized and often leaves existing configurations of power intact even while undermining them or challenging them to adapt.</p>
<p>These are the hallmarks of the Arab Spring, particularly as practiced by the Egyptian organizers who toppled Hosni Mubarak by occupying Tahrir Square. The April 6th Youth Movement managed to create a space that drew people from all walks of life together.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn135-1474885111417776">135</xref></sup> The organizers convinced people to steel their courage in the face of decades of police repression. They resisted the temptation to create an armed encampment when plainclothes thugs paid by the regime attacked them. They adeptly embraced and simultaneously neutralized the military, sometimes literally sleeping on tanks to show solidarity with the military while also preventing them from deploying.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn136-1474885111417776">136</xref></sup> By removing the Mubarak regime without the use of bombings or assassinations, the movement showed it was possible to refuse to be cowed by a corrupt autocrat with a history of torturing opponents and simultaneously reject the use of extremist tactics of resistance.</p>
<p>Perhaps the fact that nonviolence is the opposite of terror and instantiates new power helps explain the empirical evidence that nonviolent revolutions are more likely to succeed and survive than violent ones.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn137-1474885111417776">137</xref></sup> However, success is by no means guaranteed. For instance, in October 1999, an estimated 13 million Columbians participated in anti-war marches, decrying the kidnappings of left-wing insurgent groups as well as the terror of the government and right wing militias.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn138-1474885111417776">138</xref></sup> But the peace movement in Columbia was derailed in large part by the hope that President Uribe, with the help of the United States, could win a decisive military victory. As I write, the nascent Arab Spring faces powerful, armed actors with vast resources. Sclerotic power combined with terror can hold out against nonviolent movements for a time (as we have seen in Syria and Yemen), disperse new power by producing fear and hopelessness (as we have seen in Bahrain), or turn an unarmed insurrection into a civil war (as we have seen in Libya). New leaders may also undermine the aims of the movement (as the military is attempting to do in Egypt). However, nonviolence at least provides people with a chance to reconfigure political reality without corroding the character of it.</p>

Mill writes: ‘It is one of the undisputed functions of government to take precautions against crime before it has been committed, as well as to detect and punish it afterwards. The preventative function of government, however, is far more liable to be abused, to the prejudice of liberty, than the punitory function; for there is hardly any part of the legitimate freedom of action of a human being which would not admit being represented, and fairly too, as increasing the facilities for some form or other of delinquency.’ John Stuart Mill, ‘On Liberty’, in (1993) <italic>Utilitarianism; on Liberty; Considerations on Representative Government; Remarks on Bentham's Philosophy,</italic> pp. 164–5.

<fn id="fn83-1474885111417776"><label>83.</label><p>Note that even for those who do <italic>not</italic> support the regime or wish to actively resist it, terror has a particular allure in such contexts. This holds true for both totalitarian governments that attempt to elicit the active participation of their citizens and tyrannical governments that want nothing more than obedience and submission: the assassin is the people's corollary to the tyrant. Under tyranny, the citizens are held in check by the knowledge that the tyrant might kill anyone at anytime. The invention of the assassin levels the playing field and checks the tyrant's will by demonstrating that the tyrant or dictator may be killed by anyone at anytime. In the same way, the use of terror by non-state actors in the latter half of the 20th century is perhaps best viewed in relation to the embrace of terror by states in the world wars and the nuclear age. The military technologies of the 20th century appeared to give states the upper hand over all other forms of human organization in terms of the capacity to instil terror. In the world wars, this was only possible when military technologies were combined with power and legitimacy – which both the Axis and Allied governments employed. Nuclear weapons require the resources of a cutting edge scientific community and a military-industrial complex. Terrrorism by non-state actors is a refusal to acknowledge that states have cornered the market, as are their efforts to obtain chemical and nuclear weapons.</p></fn>

However, given what I am arguing here about audience effects, whether or not such attacks are considered accidental may play a role in determining whether or not they are of benefit to the military. See Gross (n. 5), pp. 187–8. Regarding drone attacks, a newspaper in Lahore, Pakistan, estimated that between Jan. 2008 and April 2009 drones had killed 687 civilians and 14 Al Qaeda leaders. Neither the Air Force nor the CIA counts civilian deaths and others give a much lower estimate of the total number of people killed and the ratio of Al Qaeda to innocents. However, we do know that the Air Force operates well over fifty drones, with hundreds more on order, and that they have often killed civilians. Some CIA officers have objected to the drone policy because of its potential for use in Al Qaeda and Taliban recruiting and an investigator from the United Nations Human Rights Council has raised questions about the legality of drone attacks.

By annihilating everything in the name of justice, divine violence exercises pure power over mere life for the sake of the living and expiates the guilt of mere life.

There is good reason to believe that Al Qaeda's elevation to a major player in world politics and status as a serious threat to the United States is in very specific ways a self-fulfilling prophesy on the part of the US government – from the development of Al Qaeda as a bulwark against the Soviets to the issuing of fatwas elicited by the FBI. See Joseba Zulaika (2009) <italic>Terrorism: The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy.</italic> Chicago: University of Chicago Press.

There is strong evidence suggesting that, in dealing with terrorist tactics, this is almost always the case. Not only do ‘terrorist campaigns rarely work, but … counter-terrorism campaigns tend to breed even more terrorism’. Abrams (n. 125), p. 78. The empirical evidence on the first score is strong, the empirical evidence on the second score is still forthcoming. See also Bueno de Mesquita (n. 126). One study found a correlation between civilian casualties caused by the US military and insurgent violence in Afghanistan, but it does not find such a correlation in Iraq. Luke N. Condra et al.
