<abstract>
<p>Management researchers habitually invoke analytical categories of difference – whether they be based on gender, race, or sexual identity – in responding to issues of systemic inequalities in organizational life. Poststructuralists and other critically orientated scholars have cited the myriad of trajectories through which analytical categories of difference reinscribe dichotomous modes of thinking and, therein, ignore the idiosyncrasies in human identification and human behavior. Extending from a poststructuralist standpoint, this article uses the question of sexual identity to advocate for the astute mobilization of ‘strategic essentialism’. Strategic essentialism serves as a means by which management scholars can tentatively engage with the research and the discourse that is reliant upon identity binaries, yet without reifying ideologically bifurcated identity classes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Numerous management scholars have sought to conceptualize how gender, race, sexual identity and other visible and invisible stigmas continue to operate as sources of systematic disenfranchisement within organizational life (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0018726711432183">Bell and Nkomo, 2001</xref>). As such, researchers have identified a plethora of intra-organizational trajectories – including salary differentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0018726711432183">Auster and Drazin, 1988</xref>), promotion and appraisal bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0018726711432183">Landau, 1995</xref>), and encounters with harassment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0018726711432183">Berdahl and Moore, 2006</xref>) – through which individuals occupying one or more of these denigrated categories experience social and economic marginalization in the workplace. While offering promising insights into the antecedents and the consequences of systemic organizational discrimination, current research in this field – at least in the forms that have appeared in American management journals – has primarily developed from a positivist logic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726711432183">Fournier and Grey, 2000</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0018726711432183">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In spite of the fact that positivism has acquired ‘intellectual hegemony’ in some geographical centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0018726711432183">Willmott, 1993</xref>: 681), poststructuralists and related critical thinkers working within management disciplines have forwarded excellent critiques of how various social identities discursively manifest within organizations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0018726711432183">Bradshaw, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0018726711432183">Collinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726711432183">Harding, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726711432183">2008</xref>). With few exceptions, much of this stream of research has adopted a form of interpretive – or an otherwise critically-orientated – methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726711432183">Lee, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0018726711432183">Prasad, 2005</xref>), which intuitively refrains from reifying and, at times, actively subverting essentialist, and what are ultimately false, dichotomies of ‘female’/‘male’, ‘black’/‘white’, and ‘homosexual’/‘heterosexual’ (for excellent conceptual critiques of these dichotomies see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726711432183">Broadbridge and Hearn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726711432183">Hird, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0018726711432183">Pringle, 2008</xref>). This is not surprising insofar as such methodological approaches readily cohere with the ontological and epistemological assumptions underlying the poststructuralist tradition, which fundamentally proclaims the lack of essence in social reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0018726711432183">Ritzer and Goodman, 2002</xref>). In other words, what surfaces in the present poststructuralist literature from management scholars is, on the one hand, philosophical alignment between ontology, epistemology, and methodology so described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0018726711432183">Morgan and Smircich (1980)</xref> and, on the other, resistance toward attempting to capture Cartesian ideals of objective truth. While I concur with the latter suggestion in that I believe that objective truth, should it exist, is outside the matrix of human consciousness (Morgan, personal communication, 2007), I diverge from Morgan and Smircich’s reading of research paradigms that posits a necessary unity between ontology, epistemology, and methodology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0018726711432183">2</xref></sup> In sum, researchers espousing certain ontological and epistemological assumptions should not, without critical appraisal at least, deny themselves or be denied methodological approaches that do not neatly complement their theoretical orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726711432183">Lee, 1991</xref>). This argument gains purchase when exploring poststructuralist potentials for engaging in organization research on inequality stemming from analytical categories of difference.</p>
<p>Poststructuralist theory has rich and diverse origins. It is the corollary of intellectual traditions – including feminism, psychoanalysis, literary theory, and anthropology – which sought to destabilize the unitary corpus of Enlightenment thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726711432183">Agger, 1991</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0018726711432183">3</xref></sup> As Flax observes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726711432183">1990</xref>: 7), it came in response to the disintegration of the ‘grand ideas that structured, legitimated, and lent coherence to so much of Western science, philosophy, economics, and politics since the eighteenth century’. As critics of the Enlightenment found discourse to be pivotal to the reification of these systems, language became central to poststructuralist analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0018726711432183">Scott, 1994</xref>; for excellent discussion of this point from an organizational perspective see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0018726711432183">Westwood and Linstead, 2001</xref>). Indeed, as Scott (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0018726711432183">1994</xref>: 283) explains, language elucidates ‘how social relations are conceived – because understanding how they are conceived means understanding how they work – how institutions are organized, how relations of production are experienced, and how collective identity is established’. In sum, within poststructuralist theory there is, ‘a breakdown in the metanarrative of Enlightenment’ and, more broadly, a deconstruction of the universalizing ‘grand ideas’ that sustains contemporary hegemonic power relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0018726711432183">Flax, 1990</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>In repudiating metanarratives, poststructuralists recognize the perils of essentialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726711432183">Alvesson and Deetz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0018726711432183">Kilduff and Mehra, 1997</xref>). For example, in studying the analytical category of ‘race’, Miles and Torres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0018726711432183">2007</xref>: 68) argue that by appropriating the vernacular of false binaries, critical scholars not only fail to conceptualize the vicissitudes and the nuances of the phenomenon being investigated but, by extension, a set of implications emerge that are counterproductive to the redress of inequality. They explain that in invoking the language of the binaries scholars risk reifying, and perhaps inadvertently legitimating, public assumptions of the existence of its fixed reference points, and of its opposing but mutually-reinforcing ideological positions. They further contend that in focusing academic and philosophical inquiry on the study of analytical categories of difference scholars overlook the discursive processes that produce these differences and, thus, fail to holistically appreciate the etiology of cultural disenfranchisement. Through the very processes of researching them, ideas of ‘black’ and ‘white’ – and, analogously, ‘woman’ and ‘man’ and ‘homosexual’ and ‘heterosexual’ – become further understood as being stable, unproblematic and determined a priori (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0018726711432183">Miles and Torres, 2007</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726711432183">Broadbridge and Hearn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726711432183">Gamson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726711432183">Hird, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726711432183">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the poststructuralist critique, identities prevail as an intrinsic part of our existential phenomenology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0018726711432183">Ashforth and Mael, 1989</xref>). So while poststructuralists may problematize, negate, or otherwise undermine the saliency of analytical categories of difference, identity politics is maintained as a system for self-awareness and social demarcation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0018726711432183">Moya, 2001</xref>). This quite logically, then, prompts the question: how can poststructuralists who seek to identify and rectify tangible social inequalities that have been enacted by one identity group to the disenfranchisement of a fabricated relational opposite, engage in a discourse of diversity without reinscribing the dichotomous ethos of essentialism?</p>
<p>A tentative response to this query comes in the form of the postcolonial-feminist concept of ‘strategic essentialism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0018726711432183">Spivak, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0018726711432183">Spivak and Grosz, 1990</xref>). Strategic essentialism ‘promotes reclaiming the essential identity of a group as a temporary strategic gesture in the interest of agency for struggle, no matter how dispersed the identities of the members’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726711432183">Calas and Smircich, 1999</xref>: 662). This concept is particularly useful in organization research, and serves as an answer to the provocative question posed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0018726711432183">Linstead and Brewis (2004)</xref> cited in the introduction of this article. Indeed, organization researchers are offered agency through strategic essentialism inasmuch as it allows them to use analytical categories of difference, while simultaneously confounding the underlying assumption that renders classes of difference as being metaphysically constituted. As Alcoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0018726711432183">2001</xref>: 319) advises in her account of the concept, ‘[w]e should use identity categories only in ways that will work ultimately to subvert them’.</p>
<p>In sum, the aim of this article is to utilize poststructuralist thought to illuminate how strategic essentialism can be integrated into contemporary organization research. On this front, I contend that strategic essentialism can realize two mutually enabling objectives: i) it can serve as a salient tool in the poststructuralist endeavour to transgress from delimiting essentialisms; and, ii) it can appropriate and cautiously deconstruct the discourse of the essentialist. In this way, I move against the current of what is now <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0018726711432183">Lorde’s (1984)</xref> famous line: ‘The master’s tools can never dismantle the master’s house’. Indeed, following from Spivak, I believe that a strategic engagement with the discourse of essentialism, which would provocatively expose the inherent fallacies of essentialism, is precisely what is necessary to dislocate the locus of essentialism’s oppressive power that functions as the means by which to maintain contemporary injustices within organizations.</p>
<p>The focus of the present article is on sexual identity, for which there are two important reasons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0018726711432183">4</xref></sup> First, the study of sexual identity, relative to that of race or gender, is an inchoate focus of research within the field of organization and management studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711432183">Brewis and Linstead, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726711432183">Fleming, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0018726711432183">McQuarrie, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0018726711432183">Pringle, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0018726711432183">Ward and Winstanley, 2003</xref>). Accordingly, it is at an important juncture. As this field develops, critical thinkers have the opportunity to partake in the debates around sexual identity within organizations and, in so doing, redefine its meaning, its parameters, and its undergirding assumptions. Thus far, the extant management literature has treated sexual identity either as an essentialist disposition or as a discursive component of intra-organizational power and control. While this nascent topic has already generated promising insights for the study of such phenomena as workplace discrimination and managerial politics, it remains crucial for critical organization researchers to engage with broader sociological theory on sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726711432183">Broadbridge and Hearn, 2008</xref>) and illustrate rigorously how naturalized ideas of the ‘homosexual’ and the ‘heterosexual’ are socially contrived concepts and underscore sexuality’s fluid disposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726711432183">Butler, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726711432183">Foucault, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726711432183">Hird, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0018726711432183">Zita, 1994</xref>). This will not only better honor individuals who are studied through a more holistic understanding of the multi-faceted dynamics of their lives, but it will also contribute to a greater appreciation among management scholars as to the fluidity and the nuances within human identity and human behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726711432183">Alvesson et al., 2008</xref>). In doing so, it permits the field to transcend dualistic and essentialist thinking, which far too often silences marginalized voices and neglected identity claims.</p>
<p>Second, while historically strategic essentialism has been employed in social movements for gender equality, the study of sexual identity is particularly ripe to benefit from its application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726711432183">Bernstein, 1997</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0018726711432183">5</xref></sup> Sociologists have long noted that sexual identity has been obstinately perceived, by many, to be rooted in ontological fixity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726711432183">Gamson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726711432183">Hird, 2006</xref>). As such, while many individuals can accept the argument that race and gender are socially constructed, there is far greater resistance to the assertion that sexuality is equally constituted by social precepts. Through an account of the socio-religious outcry against homosexuality, and the subsequent rejoinder that came from the activist community, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0018726711432183">Smith and Windes (1997)</xref> provide some insights into why this might be the case. In discussing the foundation of political and religious backlash against homosexuality, they write:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Denunciation begins in the definitional premise that homosexuality is an acquired behavior rather than an innate orientation. Homosexual behavior then becomes ‘perversion of the highest order. It is against God, against God’s word, against society, against nature’ [James Robison quoted in Lienesch 84]. This view remains current. (1997: 31)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Within this statement, same-sex desire is postulated as an (immoral) <italic>choice</italic>. In response, and quite understandably then, community activists for lesbian and gay rights, as Smith and Windes further explain, made their case for equality by (strategically) declaring sexual identity to be an essentialist trait. Indeed, the claim that an individual’s sexual identity is determined a priori, by nature, and not by autonomous choice, significantly derails the legitimacy of the opposition’s discriminatory ideological stance against lesbians and gays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0018726711432183">Smith and Windes, 1997</xref>). The codification of this essentialist view in popular culture – which, again, was most vigorously propagated by social activists – rendered the cultural construction of sexual identity relatively difficult to discern. It is within this historical backdrop that the promise of strategic essentialism is amplified. That is, given that the early demands for equality based on sexuality was premised on fixed ontological claims, strategic essentialism can be utilized to engage in a less provocative – and, institutionally less threatening – discourse by which the culturally inscribed and inherently liminal attributes of sexual identity are allowed to emerge.</p>
<p>The remainder of this article is organized into four substantive sections. First, I provide an overview of the concept of strategic essentialism, focusing particularly on how the term has developed within feminist theory. Second, I illustrate the problematic ways in which the notion of sexual identity has been studied as an analytical category of difference by management scholars thus far. Drawing on a mixture of theoretical literature – broadly spanning poststructuralist, feminist, and queer thought – I critique the underlying ontological assumptions that appear to permeate management scholarship on sexual identity. Third, I discuss how strategic essentialism can operate as an idea that emancipates critical scholars from eschewing the positivist temptation for essentialist categorizing, while concurrently allowing them to engage with the discourse of the ongoing debates. Finally, in the fourth section, I conclude this article by identifying how strategic essentialism can inform four current sites of organizational debate.</p>

<title>Conceptualizing ‘strategic essentialism’</title>
<p>By the late 1980s, feminist theory was in a crisis of its own making. Members of the feminist community occupying multiple categories of marginalization accused second-wave feminism of negating their lived realities by promoting and reflecting the interests of western, white, middle- and upper-class, heterosexual women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0018726711432183">Mann, 1994</xref>). As such, new repertoires of criticism against second-wave claims of universal womanhood and women’s symmetrical experiences with gender oppression emerged. Indeed, Black feminists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0018726711432183">hooks, 1984</xref>), postcolonial feminists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0018726711432183">Mohanty, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0018726711432183">Spivak, 1988</xref>), Chicana feminists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0018726711432183">Anzaldua, 1987</xref>), and lesbian feminists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0018726711432183">Rich, 1980</xref>), each addressed – either explicitly or implicitly, and from their respective socio-cultural positions – the tendency of second-wave feminism to present a monolithic class of ‘woman’, which effectively relegated their own unique experiences to the periphery of feminist theorizing. Synthesizing much of this critique, at the end of the decade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0018726711432183">Crenshaw (1989)</xref> coined the term ‘intersectionality’, which posited women’s social reality to reside at the idiosyncratic nexus between race, gender, class, and other identity categories. In sum, during this period, there was sustained admonition against analysing gender in isolation of other social identities that were believed to pose different material consequences to different women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726711432183">Gopaldas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0018726711432183">McCall, 2005</xref>). In commenting on the basis for the social rifts that fermented during this juncture within feminism, hooks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0018726711432183">1997</xref>: 485) states: ‘The idea of “common oppression” was a false and corrupt platform disguising and mystifying the true nature of women’s varied and complex social reality. Women are divided by sexist attitudes, racism, class privilege, and a host of other prejudices’.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this fragmentation coincided with and, indeed, symbiotically informed the emergence of, influential theoretical paradigms that espoused an ethos of anti-essentialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0018726711432183">McCall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0018726711432183">Stone, 2004</xref>). Anti-essentialism, which was at the crux of critical theories that gained currency during this period – such as postmodernism and poststructuralism – was suggested, at least by some constituents from the feminist community to compromise their mandate for gender egalitarianism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726711432183">MacKinnon, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0018726711432183">Nussbaum, 1999</xref>). Indeed, it was viewed that conceptual paradigms that relied upon anti-essentialism much too hastily sought to destabilize or deconstruct categories of ‘female’ and ‘male’, and this, in course, was seen to prevent feminist practice from responding to gender-specific realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726711432183">Bristor and Fischer, 1993</xref>). In sum, anti-essentialist thought was accused of effectively reducing women’s experiences with patriarchy and misogyny to esoteric theory and, by extension, it was argued that it failed to properly understand the social conditions and the institutional environments that systematically oppress women (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726711432183">MacKinnon, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0018726711432183">Nussbaum, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Feminist concerns over imprudently relinquishing the agency of essentialism engendered renewed interest and debate on the function of essentialism in endeavours for cultural change. Among the most notable commentators of the day, Fuss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726711432183">1989</xref>: 39), insightfully remarked, ‘in our [feminists] well-intentioned efforts to unmask and to denounce essentialism as a dangerous fallacy, we may have too quickly and perhaps too uncritically embraced constructionism as necessary or only corrective’. Drawing on Spivak, she further elaborates that, ‘in the hands of the dispossessed themselves, essentialism can be a powerful strategic weapon’ (p. 40). Fuss perhaps recognizes that, ‘[f]ixed identity categories are both a basis of oppression and the basis of political power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726711432183">Gamson, 1995</xref>: 391; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0018726711432183">Bernstein, 1997</xref>). Fuss’s advocacy for this ‘weapon’ was further mobilized through the scholarship of postcolonial-feminist theorist Gayatri Spivak, under the rubric of, what she would refer to as, ‘strategic essentialism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0018726711432183">Spivak, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0018726711432183">Spivak and Grosz, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>For Spivak, feminists can tentatively invoke a monolithic identity of <italic>woman</italic> for the purpose of attaining their political objectives; however, without solidifying a permanent or salient feminine ontology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726711432183">Calas and Smircich, 1999</xref>). In other words, Spivak illuminates how strategic essentialism, while inherently being a problematic concept, can be a mechanism through which the feminist project for gender egalitarianism is realized. Indeed, as she writes: ‘Feminisms return to the problem of essentialism – despite their shared distaste for the mystifications of Woman – because it remains difficult to engage in feminist analysis and politics if not “as a woman”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0018726711432183">Spivak, 1993</xref>: 2). Braidotti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0018726711432183">1994</xref>: 169) has echoed this argument, by drawing on the phallogocentric economy as formulated by Irigaray (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0018726711432183">Braidotti, 1993</xref>: 10), to assert that, ‘extreme affirmation of sexual identity is a way of reversing the attribution of differences in a hierarchal mode’, and is a decisive system that ‘empowers women to act’. In appealing to a fixed class of <italic>woman</italic>, Braidotti elucidates a coherent feminine identity as being a form of political subjectivity – one that she, nevertheless, indicates is ultimately in liminal transgression.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0018726711432183">6</xref></sup> This class of woman is useful in disrupting androcentric thought, which endemically privileges masculinity, and in establishing a temporal sense of community (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711432183">Frye, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0018726711432183">Oseen, 1997</xref>). Neither Spivak nor Braidotti are metaphysical realists; accordingly, neither would contend that gender is naturally affixed to a corporeal ontology (for a critique of this relationship see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726711432183">Hird, 2000</xref>). As such, their position on essentialism is <italic>strategically</italic> rhetorical rather than being literal. They do not afford credence to the ontology of sexual difference beyond the political ends that it may serve.</p>
<p>Extending from this, it ought to be underscored that while Spivak endorses strategic essentialism, she does not, in any way, succumb to the notion of biological determinism. Within Spivak’s conceptual framework, these two ideas are wholly disparate. Spivak explicated that strategic essentialism should ultimately be a temporary tool to achieve a new praxis – more specifically, to bridge the disjuncture between feminist theory and feminist practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0018726711432183">hooks, 1994</xref>). An essence of <italic>woman</italic> is thus a means to an end, and should never be integrated into either the end project itself or into the foundation upon which the project is built. Namely, as Spivak realizes, it is imperative for those feminist projects that strategically invoke the ontological assumption of <italic>woman</italic> to ensure that such an ontology will be discarded with at some point within the feminist revolution.</p>
<p>Feminist scholars who have applied strategic essentialism into their work have all too often ignored Spivak’s integral point regarding the temporality of strategic essentialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711432183">Danius and Jonsson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0018726711432183">Stone, 2004</xref>). An example of this can be found in a qualitative study on feminist organizational communication by Paige <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0018726711432183">Edley (2000)</xref>. While acknowledging its potential dangers, Edley attests that, ‘strategic essentializing can be used as a political move . . . to achieve desired outcomes’ (p. 279). She finds that strategic essentialism accomplishes three objectives in the organization that she studies: i) ‘organizational members discursively constructed the group of women as special’; ii) ‘they essentialized negative communicative behavior in very traditional, stereotypical ways to suppress and avoid conflict’; and, iii) ‘[they] essentialized themselves as a form of resistance’ (p. 287). She rationalizes her informants latent recourse to essentialism by invoking the customary logic for strategic essentialism – that is, a feminine subject must be identified for feminist theorizing and social change. However, Edley imparts no suggestion indicating when the homogenous construction of <italic>woman</italic> can be dismantled. In other words, there is no theorization explaining at which point within the feminist revolution can and should feminists depart with their ontological utilization of <italic>woman</italic>. Rather, it appears as though the <italic>woman</italic> becomes discursively embedded within the political project, whereby, assumptions of sexual difference are confirmed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0018726711432183">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Such misappropriation of strategic essentialism has led some constituents from the feminist community to dismiss the analytical utility of the concept in advancing feminist projects. For instance, Kobayashi and Peake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0018726711432183">1994</xref>: 236) identify several concerns they have with the term and conclude that ‘[g]iving into [strategic] essentialism, however promising the short-term goals, may retard the process of finding more effective solutions’. Similarly, cultural theorist Stuart Hall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0018726711432183">1996</xref>: 475) writes that, ‘[t]he [strategic] essentializing moment is weak because it naturalizes and dehistoricizes difference, mistaking what is historical and cultural for what is natural, biological, and genetic’. Spivak herself carries this line of critique further by drawing upon an interesting metaphor to describe her worry with the frequent misuse of her concept:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>When . . . the statement ‘the personal is political’ came into being, given the socio-intellectual formation, it really became quickly ‘<italic>only</italic> the personal is political’. In the same way, my notion just simply became the union ticket for essentialism. As to what is meant by strategy no one wondered about. (Spivak, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0018726711432183">Danius and Jonsson, 1993</xref>: 35)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>She elaborates elsewhere that: ‘[L]ooking at the way in which this phrase was used, I found that the word “strategy” was not seriously taken up. Strategy is something that is situation-specific’. Spivak’s concerns are rooted in her observation that, ‘[m]ost of the so-called “strategic uses of essentialism” seemed to want to take this up as a lasting practice, rather than something that was called forth by some situation or other’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0018726711432183">Flanagan et al., 2007</xref>: 17). While Spivak’s frustrations with feminist misappropriations of her concept are certainly understandable, strategic essentialism should not be hastily relinquished as an analytical concept owing to its uncritical conceptualization or misapplication in prior scholarship. Indeed, when strategic essentialism is deftly mobilized it offers, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726711432183">Calas and Smircich (1999)</xref>, an important option for critical scholars in organization and management studies. This certainly includes a lens from which critical researchers can approach the study of sexual identity.</p>
<p>Thus far, poststructuralist students of sexuality studies have yet to consider the potential utility of strategic essentialism. This might be explained, at least in part, by the unique dispositional characterization of sexual identity – versus other categories of difference – in organization research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0018726711432183">Pringle, 2008</xref>). As already mentioned, while many individuals accept the argument that gender and race are socially manifested, there is far greater resistance to apply the same logic to understand sexual identity. Indeed, sexual identity often succumbs to the popular assumption that it is a phenomenological attribute that is ontologically fixed within the ‘homosexual’/‘heterosexual’ binary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726711432183">Hird, 2006</xref>). This dichotomized view is precisely what renders the efficacy of strategic essentialism. Namely, when identity is bifurcated into two monolithic classes, like that of the ‘homosexual’ and the ‘heterosexual’, strategic essentialism is a powerful mechanism by which to consolidate group cohesion under the disenfranchised category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0018726711432183">Calas and Smircich, 1999</xref>) and, from there, to elucidate the nuances <italic>within</italic> binary thinking. This follows cohesively from Borgerson and Rehn’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726711432183">2004</xref>: 458) assertion that, when dualisms are conceived semiotically they are functional in that they ‘play a crucial role in calling attention to subordination and oppression, provoking an awareness of hierarchy’.</p>
<p>It is also worthy to mention that there exists a contextual element to strategic essentialism. That is, the usefulness of strategic essentialism is inherently dependent upon the category of difference under investigation. It is invoked and rationalized, here, owing to sexual identity’s dichotomized treatment in extant literature and in popular culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0018726711432183">Sedgwick, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0018726711432183">Smith and Windes, 1997</xref>). However, as Linstead and Pullen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0018726711432183">2006</xref>: 1300) explicate, ‘[t]he existence of a binary or dyadic system always creates a system of latent conflict but the entry of a third term creates a new dynamic’. The introduction of a ‘third term’ indicates strategic essentialism’s limitations or the necessity for more sophisticated understandings of the concept – than how originally conceived by Spivak – when studying particular identity projects. As such, strategic essentialism cannot be employed symmetrically to de-essentialize race, religion, class or various other identity systems. While I am certainly not negating strategic essentialism’s value as an analytical tool when conducting organization research on various other identity systems, it is crucial for scholars to be conscientious and mindful of how specifically their deployment of the concept will confound essentialized identities.</p>
<p>In the following sections, I discuss the ontological themes under which organization research on sexual identity has, thus far, been largely conducted. Thereafter, I explain how strategic essentialism can be applied as a technique by scholars addressing social inequalities within organizational life.</p>

<title>Sexuality in organization research</title>
<p>Organization researchers have only recently begun to explore the question of sexual identity in the workplace with any consistency. Existing research within this domain has been largely bifurcated along two ontological perspectives. In the first perspective, emerging mainly from the American tradition, organization scholars have premised their argument on foundational assumptions of ‘homosexuality’ and ‘heterosexuality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726711432183">Clair et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0018726711432183">Ragins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0018726711432183">Ragins et al., 2007</xref>). Contrary to the poststructuralist position, sexual identities within this framework are viewed as a dispositional rather than a situational corollary. In the second perspective, represented predominantly in European journals, organization researchers have approached sexuality through its discursive relationship with power in the workplace (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0018726711432183">Brewis and Linstead, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726711432183">Fleming, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0018726711432183">Riach and Wilson, 2007</xref>). In this view, sexuality serves as a heuristic by which to conceptualize organizational politics and the systems of inequality and marginalization embedded within it. Through a few specific examples, I critically assess the extant literature in terms of how sexual identity has been tacitly defined by each of these perspectives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0018726711432183">8</xref></sup> I then discuss how sexual identity is discerned by poststructuralist writers.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, this section merits a precautionary word on the central identity constructs. Although in this article I critically appraise the ontological implications of invoking concepts of ‘homosexuality’ and ‘heterosexuality’, it is important to acknowledge that this vernacular may be used for its consistency with various organizational and civil rights discourses. Indeed, because civil rights for sexual minorities is fraught in ‘conflicts over the nature of identity [and] the relationship between sexuality and identity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0018726711432183">Creed et al., 2002</xref>: 493), many scholars and activists find it useful to apply essentialist and perhaps overly simplified labels to engage with rights discourse. As suggested in the introduction, sexual identity as an essentialist trait was invoked, more or less strategically, by gay rights activists as part of an endeavour to combat anti-gay rhetoric and, from there, to make the case for equal rights and social justice for sexual minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0018726711432183">Smith and Windes, 1997</xref>). Given how ‘homosexuality’ and ‘heterosexuality’ has been previously deployed, it appears only logical that such terms be utilized in organization and management scholarship. My concern remains, however – extending from the critique of ‘race’ presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0018726711432183">Miles and Torres (2007)</xref> – that without discursively elucidating the inessential or liminal nature of sexual identity, this subject will develop an essentialized ontology much akin to how meanings of ‘female’ and ‘male’ and ‘black’ and ‘white’ have come to be rendered concrete in many approaches to the study of gender and race. As such, critical scholars in the field should proactively thwart any process that reifies polarized assumptions of sexual identity.</p>
<sec id="section4-0018726711432183">
<title>Essentialist inquiry into sexual identity</title>
<p>With the aim to apportion recognition to sexual minorities in the workplace, the first perspective explores the myriad dilemmas of <italic>coming out</italic> and hinges on conventional categorizations of this diverse group. For example, Ragins and colleagues have used stigma theory to investigate the likelihood of sexual identity ‘disclosure’ among non-heterosexuals at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0018726711432183">Ragins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0018726711432183">Ragins et al., 2007</xref>). They empirically explore the antecedents and the implications of disclosing for this group. Notwithstanding their conclusions or their motivations for pursuing this line of study, the implications emerging from the discourse in which they engage should be critically appraised. The sample for the study was comprised of 534 lesbian, gay, and bisexual employees drawn from three national gay rights organizations. Respondents of a survey were asked to identify themselves into categories of sexual orientation including heterosexual, gay, lesbian, and bisexual. However, as the authors claim, because the aim of the study was to understand fear and disclosure of ‘gay identity’ at work, heterosexuals were excluded from the sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0018726711432183">Ragins et al., 2007</xref>: 1109). Herein, the bifurcation between the heterosexual and the non-heterosexual becomes apparent – indeed, ‘gay identity’ is covertly defined as an umbrella concept that encapsulates those individuals whose sexual identity is outside the mainstream purview of ‘compulsory heterosexuality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0018726711432183">Rich, 1980</xref>). Likewise, because the study surveys one group’s experiences and explicitly demarcates it from a socially circumscribed relational opposite, the cultural presumption of sexual identity as being dichotomous is reified (akin to how ‘race’ is reified according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0018726711432183">Miles and Torres, 2007</xref>) – monolithic ideas of the heterosexual and the non-heterosexual become markers that serve as analytical categories of difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726711432183">Foucault, 1990</xref>). Indeed, what the respondents are prompted to disclose is an essentialized and unproblematic meaning of their sexuality; in this context, the act of disclosing effectively proves the very stability of the identity categories that many critical theorists question. The poststructuralist concern is that such categories overlook the fluidity and the contingency within sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726711432183">Gamson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726711432183">Hird, 2006</xref>), which various organizational constituents may embrace; namely, the temporal idiosyncrasies between and among these essentialist identity categories are rendered unavailable and, therein, silenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0018726711432183">Sedgwick, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This point is tangentially related to a hypothetical situation posed by Ragins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0018726711432183">2008</xref>: 197):</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Consider the example where a lesbian worker is assumed to be heterosexual by her colleagues. This assumption essentially forces her to make an immediate decision: she may avoid the issue and not correct her coworkers’ assumptions, or she may disclose her identity even though she may not feel safe or comfortable sharing it with her coworkers at that time. Although she may desire to keep her sexual identity private, her coworkers’ assumptions about her sexuality makes her identity an issue by forcing her to make a decision between disclosing her identity or allowing the assumption of a false identity to continue, thus putting her in the position of ‘passing’ as heterosexual.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In discussing the implications of denying a stigmatized identity, Ragins explains how it can engender pejorative consequences on the psychological well-being of an individual. In Ragins’s hypothetical the worker’s sexual identity is ensconced in a stable foundation; that is, the subjective position of the worker is conflated with the essentialist idea of the lesbian. The concept of ‘lesbian’ becomes (onto)logically juxtaposed with the concept of the ‘heterosexual’ – however, these two value-laden ideas are culturally demarcated by the fact that the former is considered abnormal whereas the latter is inferred as the norm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726711432183">Hird, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0018726711432183">Spradlin, 1998</xref>). Because it is only the non-heterosexual who must choose to disclose, or not, there is an underlying cultural presumption of heterosexuality among researchers in the field (on the latter point see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0018726711432183">Pringle, 2008</xref>). Indeed, scholars rarely discuss ‘disclosure’ within the context of heterosexual identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0018726711432183">Button, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0018726711432183">Clair et al. (2005)</xref> echo Ragins’s sentiments by further asserting that organizational members with invisible stigmas must choose whether or not to disclose. For them, non-heterosexual individuals are in one of three classes: ‘in the closet’ (no one is aware of the identity), ‘partially out’ (select others are aware of the identity), or ‘out of the closet’ (everyone is aware of the identity) (pp. 81–2). The pervasive metaphor of the closet is quite informative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0018726711432183">Woods and Lucas, 1993</xref>). The proverbial closet negates the possibility of transgression within sexual identity through its denial of social agency – indeed, the closet ensures a concrete sexual identity that may either be hidden (to be ‘in’) or revealed (to be ‘out’). Moreover, this metaphor silences various dimensions of culture that symbiotically interact with and therein create the dynamics of human sexual identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0018726711432183">Sedgwick, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The hypothetical situation as well as the reference to the closet are further problematic in that they are predicated largely on assumptions of rationalist decision-making and, thus, fail to account for the elements outside of rationality that are involved in disclosure decisions. While psychological and organizational factors are often considered within the conceptual frameworks emerging from this body of literature, there is little attention paid to the emotional – or, the traditionally classified ‘non-rational’ or ‘irrational’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726711432183">Ashcraft and Trethewey, 2004</xref>) – components that may contribute to an individual’s decision to disclose. As a rationalist outcome, then, disclosure is implicitly classified as a form of ‘intentional, reasoned, goal-directed behavior’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0018726711432183">Mumby and Putnam, 1992</xref>: 469). Following from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0018726711432183">Mumby and Putnam’s (1992)</xref> poststructuralist feminist reading, it is integral to begin to overtly incorporate noncognitive dimensions and emotional experience – ‘feelings, sensations, and affective responses to organizational situations’ (p. 471) – that underlie and substantively inform disclosure decisions. In sum, to commence holistic understandings of disclosure decisions scholars might more seriously integrate into their analyses the ‘emotionality of rationality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0018726711432183">Mumby and Putnam, 1992</xref>: 480) and, therein, open up the scope of organizational ‘irrationality’ within the context of sexual identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0018726711432183">Ashcraft and Trethewey, 2004</xref>). A developing strand of research from critical organization researchers has tangentially moved away from underlying assumptions of rationality by studying sexuality as a cultural aspect of power.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0018726711432183">
<title>Sexuality and power</title>
<p>Critical organization researchers have contextualized sexuality within a broader discourse of power in the workplace. Extending from analogous arguments on the discursive gendering of organizations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0018726711432183">Acker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0018726711432183">Ashcraft and Mumby, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0018726711432183">Kanter, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0018726711432183">Mills, 1988</xref>), these researchers contend that sexuality is embedded within workplace practices in ways that it becomes a source of systemic power that sustains inequitable social relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0018726711432183">Macalpine and Marsh, 2005</xref>). Where this power has its most pronounced impact is in the fabrication of organization environments that revolve around a heterosexist ideology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726711432183">Broadbridge and Hearn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0018726711432183">McQuarrie, 1998</xref>); this ideology is, of course, vested in and reinforced by the external societal culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0018726711432183">MacKinnon, 1979</xref>). Indeed, as Broadbridge and Hearn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726711432183">2008</xref>: S41) note, ‘(hetero)sexual arrangements in private domains generally provide the base infrastructure for organizations and management’, which can only be achieved through ‘women’s associated unpaid labor’. Considering its etiology, it is not all too surprising that while masculinity is an implicitly sanctioned gender identity in the workplace, femininity continues to be relegated within most work settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0018726711432183">Ashcraft, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0018726711432183">Riach and Wilson, 2007</xref>). The symbiotic nexus between gender and sexuality, suggests that the subversion of men’s power will undermine the institutional edifice upon which the heterosexist ideology is maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0018726711432183">Hearn and Parkin, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0018726711432183">Pringle, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0018726711432183">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are several excellent examples that empirically illuminate how power traverses organizations so as to sustain them as (hetero)sexualized spaces. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0018726711432183">McQuarrie (1998)</xref>, for instance, discusses how management classrooms are institutional spaces that are tacitly marked by heterosexual norms. She elaborates further that, through the Othering process, organizations apportion ‘higher status’ to heterosexuality, and ostracize constituents belonging to other sexual identity categories. McQuarrie highlights a social corollary of this process: ‘The act of labeling an associate as homosexual [is] a means through which males strengthen their own (perceived) heterosexuality and make the labeled individual less desirable as a participant in organizational events’ (p. 164). Hence, the manifestation of sexuality within organizations – defined, here, by the intransigent differentiation between ‘homosexuality’ and ‘heterosexuality’ – is a mechanism by which intra-organizational solidarity is maintained.</p>
<p>More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0018726711432183">Fleming (2007)</xref> vividly elucidated the intimate nexus between sexuality and power in a richly nuanced article on how sexual identity is invoked to realize various organizational objectives. In a qualitative study of an organization with a high commitment culture, Fleming investigates the overt entrenchment of sexuality within the workplace and identifies how the organization promoted sexual expression, both homosexual and heterosexual, through a rhetorical and procedural culture predicated on notions of acceptance and diversity. However, in critically appraising the tension and ambivalence that appeared in the comments from some of the informants, Fleming concludes, drawing on Foucauldian terminology, that the discourse of sexuality – represented by claims of openness and empowerment – are a source of bio-power insofar as they are invoked by management to engender a more productive and efficient workforce. In this way, the ‘re-eroticization of work relations’ is a ‘labor process [that] absorbs sex and lifestyle’ and renders it as a component of, and subject to, managerial control (p. 251).</p>
<p>McQuarrie and Fleming both assume the laudable task of explicating how sexual identity harbors meanings of discursive power. Not only do these works provide many constructive insights into the study of sexuality in organizations, but they also offer intellectual space and opportunity to extend the frame of analysis so as to broaden the definitional scope of sexual identity and, in so doing, to understand its fine idiosyncrasies. One such opportunity emerges from poststructuralist theory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0018726711432183">10</xref></sup> Indeed, poststructuralist thought serves as a way by which to conceptualize the nuanced complexities of sexual identity and expression.</p>

<title>A poststructuralist critique</title>
<p>At the most rudimentary level, poststructuralism may be typified by what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0018726711432183">Lyotard (1984)</xref> famously expressed as its <italic>incredulity towards metanarratives</italic> (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0018726711432183">Alvesson and Deetz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0018726711432183">Kilduff and Mehra, 1997</xref>), or what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726711432183">Fraser and Nicholson (1997)</xref> describe as grand theorizing of social macrostructures. Akin to other critical traditions, it is ‘explicitly historical, attuned to the cultural specificity of different societies and periods and . . . inflected by temporality, with historically specific institutional categories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726711432183">Fraser and Nicholson, 1997</xref>: 143–4). The aim of the poststructuralist mandate is to critique metanarratives and, from there, to define human consciousness and social existence through engagements with contextualized subjectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726711432183">Agger, 1991</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0018726711432183">11</xref></sup> To appreciate this idea, it is important to understand how metanarratives are problematically situated within, and are informed by, socially constructed identity binaries, be they along the fault lines of gender (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726711432183">Butler, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726711432183">Hird, 2000</xref>), race (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0018726711432183">Gilroy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0018726711432183">Miles and Torres, 2007</xref>), or sexuality (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0018726711432183">Zita, 1994</xref>). Indeed, poststructuralist critique, such as Derrida’s conjecture of <italic>difference</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0018726711432183">Mumby and Putnam, 1992</xref>), illustrates how the preservation of the privileged identity (‘white’, ‘man’, ‘heterosexual’) is existentially dependent upon a corresponding relegated identity (‘black’, ‘woman’, ‘homosexual’) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0018726711432183">Tyler and Cohen, 2008</xref>); or, to posit it in Butlerian (1991) phrasing, heterosexuality presumes the <italic>being</italic> of homosexuality. Working from the same current, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0018726711432183">Harding (2003)</xref> extends this idea through consideration of the central dyadic relationship in management; she notes that every individual in the western workforce is identified as a worker or as a manager and that the identity of the latter is wholly contingent upon the binary existence of the former. Elsewhere, again assuming a poststructuralist position, Harding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0018726711432183">2008</xref>: 44; emphasis in original) explains that identities ‘cannot be resolved into an essence or into a coherent whole’; rather, they are ‘<italic>post hoc</italic> impositions of a seemingly unified [label] upon a disparate and disconnected population’. As such, the central aim of the poststructuralist is to repudiate deterministic and binary logic by drawing attention to the discursive processes that culturally (re)produce social realities and the dichotomous modes of thinking embedded within them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726711432183">Butler, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0018726711432183">Calas, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>In terms of sexual identity, poststructuralists disrupt the very constitution of sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726711432183">Butler, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726711432183">Hird, 2000</xref>) and gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0018726711432183">Calas and Smircich, 1992</xref>). Often classified under the label of ‘queer theory’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726711432183">Gamson, 1995</xref>), these scholars draw on Foucauldian analysis to observe how ‘homosexuality’ and ‘heterosexuality’ are cultural productions that intersubjectively inform the meaning of one another (for an informative discussion on the cultural pervasiveness of these mutually dependent ideas see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0018726711432183">Sedgwick, 2008</xref>). Indeed, for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0018726711432183">Foucault (1990)</xref>, heterosexuality becomes privileged through its juxtaposition with a denigrated homosexuality, and these meanings are subsequently reified through various social discourses. Citing Foucault, Brewis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0018726711432183">2005</xref>: 497) summarizes this process:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>[T]he ways in which sex was put into Western discourse from the end of the 16<sup>th</sup> century onwards, the proliferation of sex during the 18<sup>th</sup> century and the modern incitement to discuss sex in endless detail have simultaneously established heterosexuality as the unassailable norm and constituted other sexualities as abnormal.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Tangentially related to the Foucauldian reading of sexuality, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0018726711432183">Katz (2004)</xref> offers a genealogical investigation into how heterosexuality was invented and came to be ideologically defined from the late 19th-century onwards. Katz writes that because ‘the concept of heterosexuality is only one particular historical way of perceiving, categorizing, and imagining the social relations of the sexes’, it ought to be studied with the purposeful aim to dislocate its socio-cultural privilege as being the ‘normal’ and the ‘natural’ form of sexual expression (p. 69). Given its socially manifest ‘nature’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726711432183">Butler (1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726711432183">1993)</xref> contends that heterosexuality is perpetually at risk and must continually engage in a set of repetitive, or what she calls parodic, practices – such as, heterosexual sex – which functions to stringently affirm the hegemonic ideals of femininity (passive) and masculinity (active). Incidentally, the very redundancy of these parodic practices function to consolidate the discursive authority and cultural stability of heterosexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0018726711432183">Butler, 1991</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726711432183">Butler’s [1993]</xref> writing on ‘performativity’).</p>
<p>A related stream of poststructuralist-inflected scholarship reveals how sexual identities that are predicated on ontological sexual difference produce heteronormativity, which can be described as the ‘the normative idealization of heterosexuality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726711432183">Hird, 2004</xref>: 27) or ‘the centrality of heterosexual norms in social relations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0018726711432183">Pringle, 2008</xref>: S111). While feminists have long critiqued the tacit and the explicit claims of ontological sexual difference, essentialist definitions of ‘female’ and ‘male’ continue to prevail in popular culture and in certain academic disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711432183">Frye, 1996</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0018726711432183">12</xref></sup> On this point, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726711432183">Hird (2004)</xref> adopts a position in feminist science studies to develop a substantive critique into how the ontology of sexual difference is often rendered concrete in research propagated by the ‘natural’ – and particularly, the ‘biological’ – sciences (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0018726711432183">Martin, 1991</xref>). The influence of ontological sexual difference within and outside of academia, lends credence to Broadbridge and Hearn’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0018726711432183">2008</xref>: S39) recent observation that, ‘[s]ex and sex differences are still often naturalized as fixed, or almost fixed, in biology’.</p>
<p>It is equally important to note, here, that the alchemy of ontological sexual difference is wholly dependent upon the patriarchal conflation of ‘biological’ sex and ‘cultural’ gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726711432183">Hird, 2004</xref>). As Pringle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0018726711432183">2008</xref>: S112; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0018726711432183">Borgerson and Rehn, 2004</xref>) notes, ‘[g]ender [does] not avoid the oppositional duality embodied in the concept of sex, but reflect[s] the interdependent relationship of masculinity and femininity’. This reflection pivots on genital determinism, which declares that males <italic>naturally</italic> embrace masculinity while females <italic>naturally</italic> embrace femininity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726711432183">Bornstein, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0018726711432183">Hird, 2000</xref>). This initial conflation of sex and gender leads to the conventional model of heterosexuality, which dictates that a man will ‘desire-to-be’ a male and will ‘desire-for’ a female, while a woman will ‘desire-to-be’ a female and will ‘desire-for’ a male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0018726711432183">Sinfield, 2002</xref>: 126). It is precisely these corresponding relationships whereby the ‘heterosexual matrix’ is constructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0018726711432183">Butler, 1990</xref>). According to Butler, this matrix serves as the ‘grid of cultural intelligibility through which bodies, gender, and desires are naturalized’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0018726711432183">Ringrose, 2008</xref>: 511).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0018726711432183">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Repudiating essentialist readings, poststructuralists interpret sexuality and sexual identity as inessential or, put another way, in a state of unremitting ‘becoming’ (for a sample of critical-orientated scholars who have described identity as a process of ‘becoming’ see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0018726711432183">Alvesson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0018726711432183">Ashforth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0018726711432183">Harding, 2007</xref>). Within this framework, sexual identity is conceived of as a process within social reality that is contingent upon its ceaseless interaction with other dynamics of culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0018726711432183">Berger and Luckmann, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0018726711432183">Hatch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0018726711432183">Smircich, 1983</xref>) – they are ‘constructed in relation to ongoing, multilayered, and fragmented discourses’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0018726711432183">Tracy and Scott, 2006</xref>: 11). Hence, for poststructuralists, sexual identity should be ‘treated as historically variable . . . and not foundational’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0018726711432183">Parker, 2002</xref>: 151). Accordingly, ‘[s]exual identities . . . are always invitations to dismemberment: as they are declared, so something enters in to disrupt them, to suggest an identification with something else, or an origin somewhere else’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0018726711432183">Frosh, 1997</xref>: 238).</p>
<p>The uneasiness that organizational scholars whose ideas are inflected by poststructuralist thought have with researchers that simplistically invoke sexual identity as an analytical category of difference is that it fails to recognize the vicissitudes of human sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726711432183">Hird, 2006</xref>). Even the notion of sexual orientation presumes an unproblematic, a priori sexual identity that is indifferent to the saliency of time and space – not to mention that it entirely disavows the availability of human agency to do and redo identity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0018726711432183">Butler, 1993</xref>). Poststructuralists raise important questions about sexual identities that do not fit the ideology of heteronormativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726711432183">Hird, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0018726711432183">Pringle, 2008</xref>). This may be presented in the form of seemingly paradoxical expressions such as female masculinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0018726711432183">Halberstam, 1998</xref>), male lesbianism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0018726711432183">Zita, 1994</xref>), homosocial cuckoldry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0018726711432183">Sedgwick, 1985</xref>) or other diverse ‘queer’ identities that remain outside the purview of essentialism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0018726711432183">Bowring, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726711432183">Hird, 2006</xref>). As suggested above, management researchers have all too often, and much too uncritically, depoliticized and dehistoricized sexual identity when offering it as an analytical category of difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0018726711432183">Newton, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0018726711432183">Parker, 2002</xref>). Namely, sexual identity in organization research appears to be tacitly defined as a subject’s <italic>present, concrete</italic>, and, at times, <italic>rationalist</italic>, sexual desires for members of the same-sex, the opposite-sex, or sometimes, both-sexes (for a related discussion see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0018726711432183">Bornstein, 1994</xref>). Accordingly, this research does not account for subjects’ past sexual experiences that they may no longer identify with, and it further negates possibilities of future desire that may deviate from present socio-sexual choices. Moreover, it wholly ignores, as queer theorists have long explained, sexual acts – certainly some ‘heterosexuals’ engage in sex acts traditionally associated with ‘homosexuals’ and vice-versa – and focuses entirely on the bodies that are engaged in sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0018726711432183">Katz, 2004</xref>). It might, therefore, be useful for organization researchers to return to Gore Vidal’s provocative statement:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>There is no such thing as a homosexual or heterosexual person. There are only homo- or heterosexual acts. Most people are a mixture of impulses if not practices, and what anyone does with a willing partner is of no social or cosmic significance. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0018726711432183">Katz, 2004</xref>: 77)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It is in eschewing and denouncing the assumption of essentialist sexuality, as Vidal so articulates in his proclamation, that strategic essentialism holds much promise for organization research.</p>

<title>Strategizing organization research</title>
<p>It goes without saying that essentialist identities have positively contributed to the social causes for various marginalized segments of society. Conceptually they have been used to interpret how networks of systemic power unjustly benefit one group at the expense of another; in terms of practice, they have been part of a useful strategy in processes of early community building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711432183">Frye, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0018726711432183">Fuss, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0018726711432183">Oseen, 1997</xref>). As Frye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711432183">1996</xref>: 1006) describes, ‘[t]he strategy of concretely constructing a positive category of women . . . was implicit in the practice of forming and promoting women’s consciousness-raising groups and women’s caucuses within political organizations, unions, and professions’. It is not surprising, then, that theorists seeking the redress of inequality have habitually made recourse to an essentialist identity, though often prefacing their arguments with the note that bifurcated identity categories are manifest in everyday social structures, which need to be understood and deconstructed. Within the feminist literature, for instance, several prominent thinkers have alluded to an ontological sexual difference as a means to respond to discursive gender inequities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0018726711432183">Gilligan, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0018726711432183">MacKinnon, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, and as the article has illuminated thus far, poststructuralist thought amplifies the pitfalls of essentialism, which include, among other things, the denial of idiosyncrasies in identification processes and behavioral practices. By emphasizing the liminal flux in identity, poststructuralists seek to disrupt fixed reference points in dichotomous modes of thinking and caution against totalizing narratives that claim universal validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0018726711432183">Fraser and Nicholson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0018726711432183">Ritzer and Goodman, 2002</xref>). The criticism of this approach is that it reduces identity to a series of problematic discourses rather than comprehensively working through its entrenchment within social conditions. That is, poststructuralism is accused of prematurely deconstructing identity instead of using it as a tool to combat the very cultural oppressions that has its origins rooted in identity politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0018726711432183">Bristor and Fischer, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726711432183">Gamson, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Strategic essentialism can be astutely mobilized so as to allow poststructuralists to maintain – somewhat paradoxically – its undergirding ethos of anti-essentialism and deconstruction, while still addressing important social phenomena such as the embeddedness of identity and the systematic oppression of a particular group. Critical engagements with the essentialist’s discourse have the potential of unveiling how identity ultimately harbors an inessential disposition. Positing this claim within the domain of empirical inquiry returns us to the question: how can organizational scholars that ascribe to poststructuralist thought utilize strategic essentialism in their research?</p>
<p>Consistent with the original purpose of strategic essentialism, it is fruitful to invoke the concept as a means to open up the present discourse on sexual identity in organizations. Engaging prudently with sexual identity as an analytical category of difference affords critical researchers a lens through which to conceptualize, problematize, and apprehend the variability between homosexuality and heterosexuality; and, in tandem, to ascertain the inherent flux in human sexual expression. Herein lays the central project for the poststructuralist utilizing strategic essentialism. That is, to draw out, through various methodological frameworks, the diverse expressions of sexual identity among organizational members. This can be realized through both qualitative and quantitative approaches to social research. While a myriad of traditions within either of these research approaches may be adopted to illuminate diverse expressions of sexual identity, for the purposes of this article I offer one example from each approach as way of illustration.</p>
<p>Qualitative analysis, as a method for gleaning insights into the ‘meanings’ and ‘understandings’ that are culturally associated with social phenomena, is the logical approach for conducting research on systemic discrimination in organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0018726711432183">Thurlow et al., 2006</xref>: 217). While there is rich diversity in the methodologies that fall within the rubric of qualitative research, its interpretive traditions especially offer novel techniques for organization researchers to use strategic essentialism in an endeavour to unveil the endemic and essentialist contradictions in sexual identity as an analytical category of difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0018726711432183">Prasad, 2005</xref>). An exemplar of this is a recent study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0018726711432183">Ward and Winstanley (2004)</xref>, which utilizes a storytelling methodology to investigate the discursive articulation of sexual identity within organizational settings. Drawing upon the earlier work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0018726711432183">Boje (1995)</xref>, the authors observe that, ‘[p]eople do not just tell stories: they tell stories to “enact” an account of themselves and their community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0018726711432183">Ward and Winstanley, 2004</xref>: 223). Ward and Winstanley engage in popular discourses regarding the social identity of <italic>lesbian</italic> and <italic>gay men</italic>; however, through storytelling, they discern how sexual identities are constituted and reconstituted endogenous of organizations and how such identities can be ‘displayed’, ‘hidden’, or, importantly, be in a mode of ‘changing’.</p>
<p>Quantitative analysis has fewer exemplars of acknowledging the poststructuralist fluidity in sexual identity. This is perhaps owing to its ontological and epistemological alignment with positivism that has historically sought to attain objective truths rather than to understand subjective processes. Notwithstanding this, there are a few promising examples of how quantitative scholarship can employ the categories of ‘homosexuality’ and ‘heterosexuality’ while still honoring the existence of sexual identities that are not captured by these binary posts. For instance, in a study that used survey data of constituents from various segments of the lesbian community, its authors allow respondents to claim ‘lesbian’, ‘bisexual’, ‘straight’, or ‘other’ sexual identity, with the latter category prompting respondents to self-define (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0018726711432183">Levitt and Horne, 2002</xref>). While largely remaining within the nexus of essentialist thinking, the nuances of ‘other’ identities are allowed to emerge. This category creates uncertainty amidst the orthodox conception of sexual identity and encourages for new inquiries that will move toward explaining its respondents.</p>
<p>In both of these examples, the vernacular of essentialism is sustained insofar as it permits critical scholars to engage with mainstream discourses regarding sexual identity. This essentialism has been, purposefully or otherwise, deployed in a strategic manner. Namely, there are interstices within the methodology of this research that reveal the tenuous nature of the bifurcation between ‘homosexuality’ and ‘heterosexuality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0018726711432183">Hird, 2004</xref>). These references are merely two examples of how poststructuralists working within various methodological streams in the field of organizational behavior and theory can invoke strategic essentialism in an endeavour to begin to show how sexual identity is not grounded in an a priori foundation. By appropriating the discourse of essentialism they can engage with the ongoing mainstream dialogue on sexual identity in organizations; however, by strategically diverting away from essentialism, through sophisticated methodologies, they move toward more holistically (re)presenting the idiosyncratic sexual identities of the individuals that they study.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that these admittedly cursory examples concerning the deployment of strategic essentialism are merely intended to catalyse interest, and identify the viability, of the concept for empirical study. As the concept acquires currency among scholars in the field, more refined examples of how to engage strategic essentialism within empirical research will surely surface. While I have purposefully provided examples of a qualitative (interpretive-orientated) and a quantitative (positivist-orientated) study in an effort to indicate strategic essentialism’s analytical breadth, there is also much potential for the concept to move toward bridging the interpretive/positivist divide within organization research. Commenting on the philosophical divide two decades ago, Lee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726711432183">1991</xref>: 351) provocatively asked: ‘How . . . might the two approaches be integrated so that organizational researchers can simultaneously enjoy the benefits of both, rather than just one or the other?’ In an effort to respond to his own question, Lee analyses an empirical case so as to illuminate how through careful research design and implementation ‘the two different approaches are mutually supportive, not mutually exclusive’ (p. 363). As I have indicated above, as a theoretical construct for empirical work, strategic essentialism allows for researchers to invoke identity binaries while simultaneously confounding the coherency of the identity categories’ ontological foundation. That is to say, strategic essentialism provides agency for researchers to discern the complexity – indeed, the nuances and the idiosyncrasies – of and within sexual identity yet without fully relinquishing the analytical value of essentialist labels. In this way, strategic essentialism is analogous to how Mumby and Putnam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0018726711432183">1992</xref>: 468) describe the power of Derrida’s <italic>differance</italic>: ‘Deconstructing binary opposites in texts through <italic>differance</italic> creates the space of middle voice; that is, dismantling the apparent fixed meaning of a text opens possibilities for alternative meanings to emerge’.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The study of sexual identity has been a largely unexplored terrain within organizational research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0018726711432183">Ward and Winstanley, 2003</xref>). In the last decade, however, there has been growing interest in conceptualizing how sexual identity issues manifest within organizational life. Poststructuralists and other critical thinkers have a timely opportunity. They can utilize strategic essentialism in an endeavour to engage with the ongoing mainstream debates in the field, while still remaining in accords with their own ontological and epistemological commitments. They can not only question the ‘content of collective identities’ but also the ‘<italic>unity, stability, viability, and political utility of sexual identities</italic> – even as they are used and assumed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0018726711432183">Gamson, 1995</xref>: 397; emphasis in original). In doing so, the idea of sexual identity, far from being reified within an essentialist dichotomy, can be interpreted as being in constant fluidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0018726711432183">Hird, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0018726711432183">Zita, 1994</xref>); that is, there can be new recognition of the great diversity available to human sexual phenomenology.</p>
<p>Beyond the study of sexual identity per se, the deployment of strategic essentialism has much potential for future organization research. In concluding this article, it is worth noting four promising trajectories. First, strategic essentialism’s analytical purview is not limited to the efforts of disenfranchised groups. That is to say, it can operate as a functional mechanism by which individuals in privileged positions can de-center the locus of institutional and systemic power within organizations and within organization studies. It is precisely the concern over the academy’s preoccupation with the center of power that leads Hearn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726711432183">1996</xref>: 612) to declare the need for the ‘deconstruction of the dominant, in this context the dominant of organization(s)’. Thus, for Hearn, scholars are charged with the salient responsibility to study those individuals whose voices have been systematically silenced or, in extreme cases, completely erased within hegemonic organizational discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0018726711432183">Prasad, 2009</xref>). This responsibility certainly implicates the role of individuals who occupy positions of social privilege, though admittedly such a task remains problematic. Indeed, while they have an ethical duty to de-center power so as to remedy the marginalization of the Other, to do so would be antithetical to their own interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0018726711432183">Hearn, 1996</xref>). Notwithstanding this, those privileged individuals who acknowledge the inequities stemming from being afforded, and (unwittingly) assuming, statuses of power for the mere fact that they occupy certain demographical and identity categories can invoke strategic essentialism to destabilize the discursive unity of the center. They can essentialize their own identity with the strategic aim to reveal the concealed privilege that their group embodies – be it based on their whiteness, their maleness, or their heterosexuality. Accordingly, through strategic essentialism they can move toward unpacking the proverbial backpack of invisible privilege (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0018726711432183">McIntosh, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the recent interest among organization diversity scholars on, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0018726711432183">McCall (2005)</xref> labels, the ‘complexity of intersectionality’ is testimony of the currency that poststructuralist and other critical perspectives have acquired in research on social identity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0018726711432183">Gopaldas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0018726711432183">Styhre and Eriksson-Zetterquist, 2008</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0018726711432183">14</xref></sup> Indeed, organizational analyses of social identity are being increasingly pursued along the dual assumptions underlying intersectionality, which contend that: i) there exists ‘mutually constitutive relations among social identities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0018726711432183">Shields, 2008</xref>: 301); and, ii) ‘each social division has a different ontological basis, which is irreducible to other social divisions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0018726711432183">Yuval-Davis, 2006</xref>: 195). As such, a growing number of scholars perceive sexual identity to be a single element of an intersectional phenomenon, which can only be holistically understood by accounting for how it traverses with a subject’s race, gender, class, and other social identities. Notwithstanding its theoretical purchase within organization studies, and within the social sciences more broadly, theorists from this paradigm have noted how intersectionality is fraught with a host of new methodological challenges for conducting empirical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0018726711432183">McCall, 2005</xref>). The central concern remains that by studying a particular phenomenon along a multitude of diversity categories results in ontological incommensurability, which renders approaching research questions empirically a rather difficult methodological task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0018726711432183">Prasad and Mills, 2010</xref>). On this front, prudent engagements with strategic essentialism – admittedly, conceptualizations that are more refined than how the concept is presented here – have the potential to advance critical organization scholarship on analytical categories of difference by mollifying intra-group differences through the evocation of coherent social justice projects. McCall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0018726711432183">2005</xref>: 1773) herself observes that some forms of intersectional complexity ‘requires that scholars provisionally adopt existing analytical categories to document relationships of inequality and changing configurations of inequality along multiple and conflicting dimensions’.</p>
<p>Third, strategic essentialism begins to respond to the predicament of postmodernist – and, by extension, poststructuralist – theory within organization studies. In his polemical critique of postmodernism published more than 15 years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0018726711432183">Parker (1995)</xref> summarizes this predicament. Parker raises important concerns about philosophical claims that pivot on the hasty rejection of modernity and the uncritical acceptance of relativism, which he notes are central to various critical theories. Among Parker’s discomfort with postmodernism is – akin to the arguments presented by feminist writers already mentioned, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0018726711432183">MacKinnon (1990)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0018726711432183">Nussbaum (1999)</xref> – the embrace of the most extreme version of relativism, which he contends thwarts, if not entirely stupefies, the process and phenomenon of truth and knowledge construction. Thus, while rejecting postmodernism and related critical theories that are antithetical to the production of knowledge and truth, Parker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0018726711432183">1995</xref>: 554) resists ‘falling into the trap of naïve positivism or empiricism’ by declaring himself a ‘critical modernist’. While I concur with one commentator in that Parker fallaciously construes a form of postmodernist theory that functions as a straw man – as a sort of parody for his own philosophical affirmation – which is readily open for dissection (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0018726711432183">Carter, 1995</xref>), I equally believe that Parker’s argument has much resonance with researchers within the field and ought to be addressed by scholars, especially those whose ontological orientation is inflected by the postmodernist or poststructuralist ethos. Contextualized within this debate, strategic essentialism highlights the idea that as critical theorists, or otherwise as researchers who seek to embed critical theory into our work, we need not relinquish all analytical tools that are proffered by paradigmatic frameworks of essentialism and modernity. Indeed, poststructuralist scholars can adopt strategic essentialism while never departing from the fundamental assumptions of its theoretical foundation. In fact, strategic essentialism can be empirically used for the dual but interrelated objectives of identifying the fluid aspects of social reality and of showing the culturally fabricated nature of essentialist binaries.</p>
<p>Finally, strategic essentialism has the potential to further revisit the stringent demarcation between research paradigms as delineated in Burrell and Morgan’s influential work, <italic>Sociological Paradigms and Organizational Analyses</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0018726711432183">1979</xref>). Indeed, it extends the critique that scrutinizes the text’s underlying assertions regarding the unitary nature of paradigms, which has been rigorously debated by prominent organization theorists since its publication. For example, while acknowledging the meteoric contribution of Burrell and Morgan’s arguments to subsequent organization research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0018726711432183">Willmott (1993)</xref> is suspicious of whether it substantively encourages theory development or whether it challenges philosophical boundaries and conventional thinking. Willmott’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0018726711432183">1993</xref>: 682) speculation rests in the fact that the ‘[the text] assumes, and strongly endorses, a restriction of analysis within the confines of four, mutually exclusive “ways of seeing”’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726711432183">Deetz (1996)</xref> reiterates this concern by arguing that Burrell and Morgan tenaciously described their four paradigms as oscillating on a subjective/objective duality and, in so doing, represented them as being inherently incommensurable. Thus, in following Burrell and Morgan’s framework, researchers must unnecessarily and, at times, uncritically accept the reified versions of the acclaimed paradigms, which disavow any possibility of paradigmatic transgression or amalgamation. In applying essentialism strategically, which fundamentally disrupts the deterministic coherence of philosophical and methodological boundaries, strategic essentialism subverts the assumption that paradigms must be ontologically separable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0018726711432183">Lee, 1991</xref>). In this way, strategic essentialism can serve as a liberating move toward epistemological ecumenicism; that is, to borrow the words of Deetz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0018726711432183">1996</xref>: 203), to further impart ‘pluralism’ and ‘complementarity’ to the field of organization studies.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0018726711432183">Fournier and Grey (2000)</xref> observe that non-positivist research has much greater purchase in Europe than in the USA. They elaborate further:</p>
<p>It is still the case that US sociology is dominated by positivist methods and that publication in the top journals requires conformity to this. Given the rigors of the university tenure systems, the capacity for developing critical sociology is limited. The same arguments apply, perhaps even more strongly, in the management field. (p. 14)</p>
<p>Indeed, in terms of empirical research on diversity published in the premiere American outlets for organization scholarship – <italic>Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly, Journal of Applied Psychology, Organization Science</italic>, and <italic>Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes</italic> – the vast majority of studies have historically been, and continue to be, positivist in orientation.</p></fn>

<p>As poststructuralist theory is informed by a myriad of disciplines, it has been deployed in a plethora of different ways within social sciences and humanities research. For the purposes of this article, I mainly consider how feminists and management scholars have appropriated (and extended) poststructuralism to achieve their various projects. However, it ought to be equally noted that what joins scholars from different disciplinary affiliations to poststructuralist theory is their commitment against unitary epistemological claims engendered by Enlightenment philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0018726711432183">Agger, 1991</xref>).</p></fn>

<p>While this article focuses on sexual identity, for brevity the majority of my discussion is dedicated to the study of sexual categories of ‘homosexuals’ and ‘heterosexuals’.

In her excellent article on the ‘gay’ and ‘lesbian’ social movement in the USA, Bernstein develops a model to conceptualize the three analytic dimensions of identity as they have manifested within the movement – identity for empowerment, identity as goal, and identity as strategy. She concludes that ‘identity strategies will be determined by the configuration of political access, the structure of social movement organizations, and the type and extent of opposition’ (p. 539).</p></fn>

<p>This article does not deeply engage with the ontological or the metaphysical nuances that prevail in the works of different feminist writers that have approached the question of strategic essentialism. A thorough reading of Braidotti’s work, <italic>Nomadic Subjects</italic> (1994), for example, reveals some significant distinctions in her conceptualization of strategic essentialism versus that of Spivak’s. Braidotti appears to be most interested in invoking essentialist thought to amplify sex differences, which is in direct contrast to Spivak who appears to situate her thinking on the subject more explicitly within the domain of the political. Hence, Braidotti heavily relies on Irigaray’s construction and cultural reification of ontological sexual difference to elucidate the utility of essentialist theorizing. As she says, Irigaray’s decision to ‘[equate] the feminine with women and the masculine with men’ is a source of ‘mimesis’. She goes further to explain that, this ‘apparent mimesis is tactical, it aims at producing difference; Iragaray argues that there is no symmetry between the sexes, and that therefore attributing the women the right – and the political imperative – of voicing their “feminine” amounts to deconstructing any naturalistic notion of a female “nature”’ (p. 184). Essentialism, here, is understood as an avenue by which to illuminate differences so as to articulate feminine selves that are neither situated within nor contingent upon androcentric binaries. While Spivak and Braidotti predicate their consideration of essentialism on different ontological foundations, it ought to be noted that both scholars develop their claims from the assumption that essentialism can contribute to the project of gender egalitarianism.</p></fn>

<p>It ought to be clarified that I do not suggest that Edley is an essentialist. However, she does not satisfy the criteria of strategic essentialism as delineated by Spivak. Indeed, while the concept of strategic essentialism is quite applicable to analyse her ethnographic data, Spivak asserts that the researcher is also charged with the task to identify how and when the ontology of ‘woman’ can be relinquished. It is, here, within the strategic essentializing political project that Edley’s analysis falls short.</p></fn>

<p>In this article, my objective is certainly not, in any way, to negate the contributions of prior organization research on sexuality. Indeed, until about a decade ago, there was a significant dearth of literature on sexuality in the field. As such, the scholars whose work I discuss in this section have laudably and profoundly contributed to challenging the workplace ethos of heteronormativity and to recognizing the existence of organizational members from sexual minority communities. Indeed, it was largely Ragins’ pioneering research efforts on the subject that introduced discourse on sexual identity into leading North American management journals. In this article, my aim is to extend the present literature in the field; specifically, to demonstrate, using poststructuralist theory, how organization scholars can further problematize research on sexuality by which the diversity within human sexual expression can be better ascertained.</p></fn>

<p>Pringle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0018726711432183">2008</xref>: S111) contends that organization research in the field has, thus far, ‘separated the concepts of gender and sexuality’. Citing Ingraham, Pringle underscores the utility of the concept of ‘heterogender’, which brings into direct scope the intimate relationship between gender and heterosexuality. As she states, ‘gender and sexuality, specifically [within the context of] heterosexuality, are intertwined’. Concurring with Pringle’s point, I believe that organizational scholars ought to substantively integrate consideration of how gender and sexuality inform one another. Intersectionality research, which I discuss in the conclusion of this article, offers an excellent analytical paradigm from which to conceptualize how such identity categories collectively produce social realities and systems of discrimination (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0018726711432183">McCall, 2005</xref>).</p></fn>

He explains that poststructuralism ‘is a theory of language’, while postmodernism ‘is a theory of society culture, and history’. Notwithstanding this (perhaps cursory) demarcation, Agger acknowledges that there is ‘substantial overlap between poststructuralism and postmodernism’ (p. 112). In this article, while I invoke the label of poststructuralism, I draw on literature from both theoretical streams to develop my conceptual arguments on sexual identity.</p></fn>

<p>Through critical engagement with the theoretical arguments presented by Simone de Beauvior and Luce Irigaray, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0018726711432183">Frye (1996)</xref> provides a thorough analysis of the contrasting approaches to ontological sexual difference that feminist theory has adopted since its inception. She touches upon the problematic debate within feminist theory discussed in the first section of this article concerning the analytical utility of feminists invoking an ontological category of woman/women. What is particularly interesting about Frye’s argument is how she engages the theoretical insights that have been developed from feminists working within complex conceptual terrains such as existentialism (Beauvoir) and the Lacanian symbolic order (Irigaray) with a critical analysis of a timely debate (the well publicized incident of Lorena Bobbitt castrating her husband and the legal battle that ensued). Through this discussion, Frye insightfully reveals how central to the Bobbitt case, and particularly the various opinions adopted by different constituents, was the discursive meanings attributed to the concept of <italic>woman</italic>. Through her analysis, Frye develops an excellent opportunity for scholars to engage the ‘public’ by postulating the debate over ontological sexual difference beyond the parameters of the academy.</p></fn>

Brewis explains how her research pursuits effectively ‘marked’ certain gendered and (hetero-)sexualized inscriptions onto her body (p. 498). This experience, which alludes to the cursory conflation between one’s research interests and external perceptions of one’s socio-sexual desires, once again illuminates the cultural pervasiveness – indeed, the hegemonic authority – of the heterosexual matrix to <italic>authorize</italic> or attribute certain socio-sexual choices onto subjects.</p></fn>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0018726711432183">McCall (2005)</xref> distinguishes three perspectives within the paradigm of intersectionality, each defined by its distinct approach to social identity: inter-categorical, intra-categorical, and anti-categorical. The anti-categorical perspective, which McCall traces to coincide with feminist philosophical critiques of modernity and increasing disgruntlement among feminists of colour regarding how the second-wave defined the movement, fundamentally deconstructs analytical categories and is marked by claims that social life is much too fluid for fixed categories to capture. It is precisely this view within intersectionality that I suggest, following from McCall, lends credence to poststructuralist understandings of social identity.</p></fn>
