<abstract>
<p>To evaluate whether a therapeutic garden can improve the quality of life of aged care residents with dementia and their carers, objective instruments as well as interviews with residents, staff, and family members were employed.</p>
<p>Residents' mean quality of life scores increased by just over 10%, mean depression scores decreased similarly and mean agitation scores decreased by almost half. Resident, staff and family member interviews elicited positive feedback including observations that it had improved the quality of life for residents and decreased staff and family stress levels. In sum, qualitative and quantitative pre and post findings indicate that an environmental change such as a therapeutic garden can improve the lives of aged care residents with dementia, and their formal and informal carers.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1471301211435188"><title>Dementia in Australia</title>
<p>There are currently around 245,000 people with dementia in Australia. By mid-century, there will be over 1.13 million Australians diagnosed with dementia. Dementia is already the leading single cause of disability in older Australians and will become the third greatest source of health and residential aged care spending within about two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211435188">Access Economics 2009</xref>). Given these statistics, strategies for providing quality environments for people with dementia who are currently in aged care facilities and for those of the ageing population who will need future institutional dementia care are being given increasing attention, not only in Australia but also in most of the ageing first world (WHO, 2004).</p>
<p>Over the last 20 years a considerable amount of research has been carried out to identify the essential components of good design for dementia-specific facilities. Marshall (2001) reviewed the literature on designing dementia-specific facilities and listed a number of design features that need to be incorporated in a facility to provide quality accommodation for people living with dementia. The list included amongst other things the following features:
<list id="list1-1471301211435188" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>domestic and home-like;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>scope for ordinary activities such as kitchen activities, hanging out washing, and garden sheds;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>a safe outside space.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>A comprehensive survey of Special Care Units (SCUs) in Minnesota showed that SCUs for people with dementia could be distinguished from other types of aged care by the presence of certain characteristics including social spaces for various activities and secure outdoor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211435188">Grant, Kane, et al., 1995</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211435188"><title>The effect of going outside on agitation and pacing, aggression and disruptive behaviour</title>
<p>The beneficial effects of being able to go outside on levels of agitation in people with dementia have been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211435188">Matteson &amp; Linton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211435188">Namazi &amp; Johnson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211435188">Taft, Delaney, Seman &amp; Stansell, 1993</xref>). Visiting an outdoor garden has been shown by Cohen-Mansfield to reduce agitation in nursing home residents who pace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211435188">Cohen-Mansfield &amp; Werner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211435188">Cohen-Mansfield &amp; Werner, 1999</xref>). Access to well-designed gardens may encourage walking and decrease pacing and wandering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211435188">Joseph, Zimring, Harris-Kojetin &amp; Kiefer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211435188">Mooney &amp; Nicell, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The longitudinal study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211435188">Mooney and Nicell (1992)</xref> also found that the use of exterior environments reduced incidents of aggressive behaviour, and contributed significantly to a risk management program. Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211435188">Mather, Nemecek and Oliver (1997)</xref>_ENREF_26 suggests that individuals who spent more time outdoors engaged in less disruptive behaviour. They theorized that gardens or outdoor space can reduce the sense of confinement that people may feel in a secure environment, giving residents the opportunity to move more widely and feel and experience less frustration, less need for pacing and lower levels of agitation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211435188">Mooney and Nicell's 1992</xref> study was conducted in five dementia care facilities, and found that the facilities with outdoor spaces adjacent to the unit had less agitation and disruptive behaviour than did the facilities with no outdoor space. They suggest that increased space for walking and freedom of movement can ‘reduce frustrations and anxiety that characterize all dementias' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211435188">Mooney &amp; Nicell, 1992</xref>, p. 24).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211435188"><title>Pleasure and the importance of staff interaction in the use of gardens</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211435188">Cooper Marcus and Barnes, 1999</xref> described four case studies of healthcare facility gardens in California. They compared two mood shifts (a pleasing drop in energy level, and spiritual uplift) in garden visitor groups, which included staff, patients, and visitors. The research included a visual analysis of the physical site, systematic nonintrusive behavioural observation, and interviews with garden visitors. The interview data revealed that after spending time in the gardens, over 75% of visitors reported feeling more relaxed and calmer, and 25% felt refreshed and rejuvenated. They found that visitors were most likely to experience a pleasing drop in their energy level (i.e., visitors were more relaxed, or their stress level went down), and patients were more likely to report a spiritual uplift.</p>
<p>An Australian study was the first to demonstrate empirically an increase in pleasure associated with being in a landscaped garden for people with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211435188">Cox, Burns &amp; Savage, 2004</xref>). This study examined how effective two types of multisensory environments were in improving the wellbeing of older individuals with dementia. The two multisensory environments were a Snoezelen room and a landscaped garden. These environments were compared to the experience of the normal living environment that did not include a garden or Snoezelen room. Although feelings of pleasure increased while the 24 participants with dementia were in the garden, the authors concluded that in terms of the relative effectiveness of each environment in improving wellbeing of participants, the quantitative data indicated few differences between them. Qualitative data obtained by interviewing staff and caregivers indicated that ‘no matter which of the three environments was being spoken of, it was the opportunities of a one-to-one relationship, quality time, and to feel closer, that was valued' (Cox, Burns &amp; Savage, p. 43).</p>
<p>This finding was supported by Lovering, et al. (2002) who found staff commitment and support of the use of outdoor space essential. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211435188">Wood, Harris, Snider and Patchel (2005)</xref> also found that interaction with others to be a crucial factor, and that the presence of a pleasant, safe outside space had no effect that could be attributed to it that was not secondary to the impact of the relationships with the staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1471301211435188"><title>Gardening as an activity for people with dementia</title>
<p>Environmental psychologists and horticultural therapists argue that access to activities involving plants and gardening can serve as sources of stimulation for people with dementia and can spark memories of earlier pleasurable experiences with gardens and gardening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211435188">Cohen &amp; Weisman, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211435188">Haas, Simson &amp; Stevenson, 2003</xref>). These are among the reasons to encourage caregivers, whether family members or staff members of long-term care facilities, to include more outdoor activities in gardens or the natural environment into the daily routine of people with dementia. Although this seems to make intuitive sense there are few studies confirming this assertion. There is, however, some theoretical support for this idea.</p>
<p>In people with dementia, functional ability and retrieving previously learned information can be preserved as resources through which contact with the outdoor environment can be maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211435188">Carman, 2002</xref>). Familiar activities help to draw on both explicit and implicit memories of earlier life and keep residents actively involved in their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211435188">Sabat, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211435188">Zeisel &amp; Tyson, 1999</xref>). Horticulture is one of the most common and enjoyed leisure pursuits of older adults and can be used to alleviate symptoms of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211435188">Haas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211435188">Hill &amp; Relf, 1982</xref>). In fact gardening, according to one study, may be attributed to a lower risk of developing dementia: in a study in France in 1995 gardening was one of the activities associated with lower risk for dementia among older people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211435188">Fabrigoule et al., 1995</xref>). The authors suggested that the protective effect of gardening and other complex activities like knitting could be due to stimulation of a variety of cognitive functions including planning, organization of motor function, and the like.</p>
<p>Therapeutic horticultural activities are appropriate for older adults with dementia because the activities are familiar and meaningful to most and provide opportunities for reminiscing as well as for exercising competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211435188">Jarrot, Kwack &amp; Relf, 2002</xref>). In addition, horticultural activities are creative, result in tangible end-products, provide exercise for a wide range of physical and cognitive skills, and enhance social interaction. The continuity of familiar activities supporting a sense of competence and self-esteem may help in coping with a progressive loss of abilities. Plants provide sensory, but non-confrontational, stimulation for all the senses through colours, structures, scents, tastes, forms and sometimes by sounds. Sensory stimulation is important for people suffering from dementia since it can improve orientation, trigger memory, prevent emotional outbursts and facilitate connectedness in individuals with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211435188">Haas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211435188">Carman, 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211435188"><title>Sleep</title>
<p>Exposure to natural light is another potential benefit of access to gardens for people with dementia. Although it is clear that there are many factors that contribute to poor sleep in nursing home residents, a critical determinant of sleep is human circadian rhythms. A major determinant of human circadian rhythms is exposure to bright light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211435188">Czeisler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211435188">Duffy, Kronauer &amp; Czeisler, 1996</xref>). There is observational data that most nursing home residents experience very limited bright light exposure(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211435188">Ancoli-Israel et al., 1997</xref>), and that the light they receive is too weak for circadian entrainment. There is extensive evidence that suggests spending time outdoors may result in improved sleep as a result of increased exposure to sunlight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211435188">Campbell, Dawson &amp; Anderson, 1993</xref>; Campbell et al., 1996).</p>
<p>A very well-constructed RCT involving a comparison between morning and evening bright light sessions with similar exposure to dim red light and normal, baseline light exposure showed that the effect of light treatment on sleep and circadian activity rhythms in people with Alzheimer's Disease suggest that increased bright light exposure, whether in the morning or in the evening, consolidates night-time sleep by lengthening the maximum sleep bouts during the night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211435188">Ancoli-Israel et al., 2003</xref>)</p>
<p>A one-year pilot study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211435188">Connell, Sanford &amp; Lewis, 2007</xref>) randomly allocated nursing home residents with dementia to outdoor or indoor activity program groups. Sleep and behaviour disturbance were assessed over a 10-day period at baseline (usual activity conditions, which were expected to include little or no time spent outdoors) and at intervention (daily structured activity program offered outdoors or indoors). Sleep was assessed with wrist actigraphs with photocells, which also allowed for monitoring of light exposure. Behaviour disturbance was assessed with the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory. The outdoor activity group experienced significant improvements in maximum sleep duration. Both groups showed significant improvements in total sleep minutes. There also was a significant improvement in verbal agitation in the outdoor activity group.</p>
<p>A study conducted by Calkins et al. in three nursing homes (<italic>n</italic> = 17), used actigraphy, validated proxy measures of sleep and agitation and direct observation to explore the impact of increased time outdoors on sleep and agitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211435188">Calkins, Szmerekovsky &amp; Biddle, 2007</xref>). The repeated measures design assessed residents with dementia under four conditions: winter/no activity, winter/inside activity, summer/no activity and summer/outside activity. Results suggested that increased time spent outdoors resulted in a modest improvement in sleep, and mixed or immeasurable impact on agitation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211435188"><title>Recent studies on therapeutic garden design for dementia residents</title>
<p>The effect on resident behaviours of adding a wander garden to an existing dementia facility was investigated in 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211435188">Detweiler, Murphy, Myers, &amp; Kim, 2008</xref>). Thirty-five male residents were observed for 12 months before and after opening the garden. Behaviours were assessed using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory Short Form (CMAI), incident reports, need for medication and surveys of staff and residents’ family members.</p>
<p>Final CMAI scores and total PRNs employed were lower than baseline values with a trend for residents who used the garden more often to have less agitated behaviour.</p>
<p>Final CMAI scores for residents were significantly improved over baseline CMAI scores with the final CMAI median being five points lower than the baseline median. When the dementia residents were divided into high and low garden use groups based on median number of visits for the year, there was a significant correlation between the final CMAI score and the total days in the wander garden for both resident groups.</p>
<p>Within a sample of 34 participants, the percentage of residents not requiring any PRNs increased from 35.4% to 55.9% during the wander garden observation year.</p>
<p>Behavioural incidents were coded to four levels with Level 1 involving inappropriate language and Level 2 including inappropriate touching or grabbing, pushing, resisting or chasing. A Level 3 incident involved a resident striking out with no injury to the target and a Level 4 incident was the most serious and involved a resident causing physical harm to self or others. There were no significant differences for the numbers of incidents of Levels 1 through 3 but Level 4 incidents increased significantly. The authors suggest that this may have been because of the poor design of the garden; for example, locked wander garden doors, heavy doors. They also suggest that resident incident findings would benefit from re-examination using a control group.</p>
<p>Staff and family members felt that the wander garden decreased inappropriate behaviours and improved mood and quality of life of the dementia residents. The authors conclude that the study design characteristics and garden management may have affected behaviours both positively and negatively and that additional studies are needed to explore the benefits of wander gardens for dementia residents.</p>
<p>Much of the recent literature on the use of therapeutic gardens for people with dementia has been concerned with design and accessibility. The incorporation of accessible outdoor living elements in residential design can actively encourage the utilization of the outdoors. York emphasizes establishing environments that reduce architectural, programmatic, and attitudinal barriers and provide support to individuals with neurologic impairments that promote the improvement of functional abilities and thus reduce quality of life barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211435188">York, 2009</xref>). Consideration of what makes outdoor spaces inviting such as comfort, visual appeal, security, encouragement of physical activity, and intuitive use can increase the use of outdoor spaces that are so often underutilized in residential settings. According to York, design of outdoor spaces using these universal design principles makes the environment usable by everyone.</p>
<p>In summary, the beneficial effects of being able to go outside on levels of agitation in people with dementia have been well documented. There is also extensive evidence that suggests spending time outdoors may result in improved sleep as a result of increased exposure to sunlight. There are, however, very few studies that have evaluated the effects of gardens in an actual setting, and there is no empirical research on the effect of the inclusion of a specifically designed sensory garden on the quality of life of aged care residents with dementia.</p>
<p>In 2009, UnitingCare Ageing's Starrett Lodge on the NSW Central Coast designed a therapeutic garden for residents with dementia and evaluated the effect of the garden using both qualitative and empirical methodologies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1471301211435188"><title>The Starrett Lodge garden</title>
<p>In 2009, Starrett Lodge on the NSW Central Coast completed an extensive literature review and used the results to create a therapeutic, interactive, sensory wander garden and an adjoining atrium/sunroom. The atrium overlooks the rest of the garden and can be partly opened to the air, smells and sunlight from the garden.</p>
<p>The garden incorporates in its design many of the components thought to elicit pleasurable explicit and implicit memories and encourage engagement including memory boxes, a tinka car, a mural of the local headland, a viewing platform overlooking the Australian bush, a finch aviary, a woodpile, a quiet area with a water feature and raised growing beds where residents can dig and pick produce (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1471301211435188">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1471301211435188">Photographs 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1471301211435188">7</xref>).

<sec id="sec10-1471301211435188"><title>The measures</title>
<p>The Dementia Quality of Life Instrument (DEMQOL and DEMQOLProxy), The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (SCDD) and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) were used to measure the quality of life of 12 residents three months before the new garden and atrium was constructed and three months after the new garden and atrium construction. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used to assess the level of dementia of each resident at baseline._ENREF_6</p>
<p>The Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory is a caregivers’ rating questionnaire consisting of 29 agitated behaviours in patients with cognitive impairment. The agitated behaviours can be generalized into wandering, physical aggressions, inappropriate vocalizations, hoarding items, sexual disinhibitions and negativisms. The scale ranges from 1, the participant never engages in the specific agitated behaviour to 7, the participant manifests the behaviour several times an hour on average. Ratings pertain to the two weeks preceding the administration of the CMAI. Responses are based on observation of caregiver.</p>
<p>The DEMQOL system consists of two interviewer-administered instruments. DEMQOL (28 items) is completed by the person with dementia; DEMQOL Proxy (31 items) is a proxy report of the person with dementia's quality of life completed by the main carer (score range from 31 to 124, with a higher score indicating better quality of life). DEMQOL has acceptable psychometric properties for people with mild to moderate dementia (defined as a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of ≥10) while DEMQOL Proxy can be used for mild, moderate, or severe dementia.</p>
<p>The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) is a clinical test used to determine the symptoms and signs of depression in individuals suffering from dementia. Observation of the patient and an interview with the patient and the patient's caregiver are conducted to calculate the CSDD. The interview is conducted in five separate sections: mood-related signs, behavioural disturbance, physical signs, cyclic functions and ideational disturbance. The CSDD consists of 19 questions with each response scored from 0 where the symptom is absent to 2 where the symptom is severe.</p>
<p>The Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) is a brief, structured test of mental status that takes about 10 minutes to complete. Introduced by Marshall Folstein and others in 1975, the MMSE tests global <italic>cognitive</italic> function, with items assessing <italic>orientation</italic>, word recall, attention and calculation, language abilities, and <italic>visuospatial ability</italic>. Scores on the MMSE range from 0 to 30, with scores of 25 or higher being traditionally considered normal. Scores less than 10 generally indicate severe impairment, while scores between 10 and 19 indicate moderate dementia. The Mini-Mental State Examination is the most commonly used instrument for screening cognitive function.</p>
<p>All instruments were chosen because they are well accepted validated, reliable measures for use with people with dementia. Information on the validity and reliability of each measure can be found in the following references (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211435188">Alexopoulos, Abrams, Young &amp; Shamoian, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211435188">Brod, Stewart, Sands &amp; Walton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211435188">Cohen-Mansfield, Marx &amp; Rosenthal, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211435188">Folstein, Fosltein &amp; McHugh, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>The Depression and Agitation scales were administered by facility staff after they received training in correct pre- and post-administration of the scales. If the resident was assessed according to the MMSE as having mild dementia they completed the Quality of Life Scale themselves with a trained staff member assisting, otherwise a family member assessed their quality of life with the assistance of a staff member trained in the administration of the DEMQOL Proxy.</p>
<p>A log sheet was used over a 12-day period during the three months prior to construction to record how often the residents, staff and visitors used the old garden area (in autumn) and again during a 12-day period with similar weather conditions at three months post-construction (in the following spring). Staff members were also asked to observe the use of the new atrium/sunroom during the three months after construction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1471301211435188"><title>The interviews</title>
<p>Staff were interviewed three months after construction of the garden and atrium using open-ended questions designed to elicit their impressions about the new environment and whether it had improved the quality of life for residents as well as decreased staff stress levels and improved the staff caregiving experience. Family members and carers were interviewed using open-ended questions designed to elicit their impressions about the new environment and whether it had improved the quality of life of their loved ones as well as decreased their own stress levels and improved their visiting experience.</p>
<p>Informed consent to take part in the research was received from the ‘person responsible' for each resident, the residents themselves (where residents were assessed as having mild dementia) and the staff and family members who were to be interviewed and surveyed.</p>
<p>The research protocol conformed with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and ethics approval was received from UnitingCare.</p>

<p>Two residents were lost to the study due to transfer to high-care facilities, leaving a sample of 10 residents three months post-garden construction.</p>
<p>The sample included seven residents diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease, two with dementia of unspecified type and one resident with mixed dementia. At baseline four residents had severe dementia, three had moderate dementia and three had mild dementia. Nine of the study members were female and one was male, with residents' ages ranging from 79 to 90 years.</p>
<p>There were significant improvements in all measures with residents’ mean quality of life score increasing by 12.8% (<italic>t</italic> = 4.57, df = 9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001), their mean depression score decreasing by 13.3% (<italic>t</italic> = 2.4, df = 9, <italic>p</italic> = .02), and their mean agitation score decreasing by 46.7% (<italic>t</italic> = 7.48, df = 9, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001). The number of times residents used the garden during the respective 12-day periods increased from 91 times for the old garden to 111 for the new garden, an increase of 22%. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1471301211435188">Table 1</xref> shows residents' mean outcome scores at baseline and three months post-garden construction.

<p>All 10 residents reduced their agitation levels after the garden and atrium were built, seven of the 10 also reduced their depression scores and eight of the 10 increased their quality of life scores.</p>
<p>Observational evidence showed almost 100% voluntary migration of residents from the television room to the new atrium/sunroom during leisure time. This movement has not been transitory and has remained stable for 12 months (at the time of writing) with residents now preferring to eat their meals in the atrium. The atrium has no television and staff report that residents are much more likely to interact with each other than they were previously.</p>
<p>Staff, family members and resident interviews elicited consistently positive feedback concerning the new environment, including observations that it had improved the quality of life for residents as well as decreasing staff and visitor stress levels.</p>
<p>From one family member:<disp-quote>
<p>I can't say how much of a difference the garden has made for xxx. Today I have taken her up on the viewing platform and we wrote a letter, she talked about the birds, she loves animals. It's relaxing for us both to be out here. It has definitely improved xxx's quality of life and I enjoy coming more too.</p></disp-quote>One staff member said,<disp-quote>
<p>Residents are easier to manage, especially if they are sun downing. We can bring them out here just to relax. They often come at other times to water the garden or look at the fish, smell the herbs, pick the cherry tomatoes. There is a lot more for them to do. It is more fun to come to work as well. They're happier and so are we.</p></disp-quote>And from a resident:<disp-quote>
<p>I like it all. The fountain, the fish, the memory boxes – everything. The table and chairs in the sunroom came from my lounge room at home, you know. We all sit around it and talk.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The facilities manager when asked to comment on what aspects of the garden work best replied,<disp-quote>
<p>It really depends on the resident. For example XXX spends a lot of time in the tinka car and I think perhaps he liked to drive when he was younger. XXX spends some of every day looking at the memory boxes and talks about parts of her own life that relate to what she sees in the boxes. She says ‘Í have a teapot like that, you know’. Quite a few of the residents enjoy feeding the birds every day or watering the garden. It gives them a sense of purpose and ownership and I also think they enjoy the feeling of looking after the birds and plants instead of being the ones to be looked after all the time; after all most of them were nurturers of some description in their former lives.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The facility's general practitioner commented,<disp-quote>
<p>This garden has improved the quality of life of the residents here to the point that I don't have to come as often. I know this is a big statement with such a small sample but I really believe that the new environmental changes have had an impact on the residents' physical and emotional wellbeing. It would be great if all facilities could provide environments like this.</p></disp-quote></p>

<p>Although the aged care residents in this study represent a very small sample of dementia residents they were quite varied on several dimensions. Their dementia diagnosis ranged from mild to severe and they varied in age, gender, type of dementia and length of residency. Despite these variations, all 10 residents benefited from the new environment with every resident reducing their agitation levels after the garden and atrium were built, seven of the 10 also reduced their depression scores even though in this particular facility baseline depression scores varied widely with many being very low at baseline, and eight of the 10 increased their quality of life scores. The increase in use of the new wander garden compared to the old garden of 22% was not as large as management had hoped during the data collection period but staff reported that this improved as the garden became more familiar and residents felt safer to venture out on their own.</p>
<p>The migration of residents to the sunlit atrium with no coercion has pleasantly surprised the staff and residents' families. The atrium is part of the garden and can be partly opened so that residents can feel the breeze and experience the sunlight and the aromas emanating from the garden. The increase in interaction between residents in this area may be partly because there is no television in the atrium and so may not be directly attributable to the atrium itself but staff consider lack of a TV a positive design component in the new environment.</p>
<p>The highly statistically significant improvements in residents' mean agitation scores and the fact that every resident improved their agitation score may indicate that it may not be necessary for residents to actually wander through the garden in order to reduce their agitation. It may be enough to be able to just sit and be able to take in the view, the smells and the sunlight. This is consistent with the findings in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211435188">Detweiler 2008</xref> study which found that agitation scores did not return to baseline levels in the group of residents who rarely used the garden probably because of daily exposure of the residents to the sight of the wander garden through a large window in the activity/dining room (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211435188">Detweiler, Murphy, Myers &amp; Kim, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211435188">Mather et al. (1997)</xref> also noted that dementia residents spent more time looking out the window in the winter months when they had no access to the wander garden and that large windows overlooking the garden appeared to diminish the perceived separation of the resident from the garden itself, in turn reducing the agitation of confinement.</p>
<p>The Starrett Lodge general practitioner's perception that the residents had better physical health after the introduction of the garden is supported by the Detweiler study which found that most residents required significantly less total medication after the wander garden was introduced.</p>
<p>It is not possible to generalize these findings with a sample of 10 or prove causation without a control group. It may well be, as other researchers have found, that the improved environment encouraged staff to interact more with residents as they enjoyed taking them outside and this in turn decreased residents’ agitation and depression and increased their quality of life. It may also have been the lack of TV that encouraged interaction in the atrium. The study did not control for family members coming more often because they had a nice garden to take their loved ones to. There are a myriad of psychosocial factors that changed in the facility once the building of the garden and atrium began, some predictable, some not. For example, it was predicted that there would be a period of resident unrest while the old garden was being torn down and the new garden and atrium were being built. Instead the residents moved their chairs to the back windows of the facility so they could avidly watch the building progress every day. The increase in interaction between residents began even before the project was completed as they talked about the changes. The expected increase in agitation because of construction noise and disruption to daily activities did not occur.</p>
<p>Identifying the multitude of individual factors in the new environment that contributed to the positive outcomes for residents and carers and controlling for possible confounders was not deemed important for this study with a limited budget for the evaluation of AUD5000. What was deemed important was that the new environment was constructed using the available evidence on appropriate environmental design for people with dementia. We know from the qualitative interviews that the residents and carers liked and used the garden and atrium, and this led to greater interaction among residents and we know from the empirical measures that residents’ quality of life improved after the garden environment was introduced. These were the outcomes that the funding body and the facility management and staff were hoping for.</p>
<p>It can be argued that the garden promoted more interaction between staff and residents and also between visitors and residents and that this is the important factor and not the garden itself. The argument that therapeutic gardens are the environmental change that best promotes the increase in these interactions and thus are pivotal to residents’ quality of life can be equally argued. Very few facilities would have the resources or the number of residents required to do a large controlled trial to tease out the individual factors that contribute to the positive outcome for their residents.</p>
<p>It is very rare for dementia facilities to systematically evaluate environmental changes in terms of outcomes for their residents, staff and visitors. When evaluation studies are undertaken, very few studies incorporate quantitative measurement into the evaluation. To get statistically significant results from such a small sample is very exciting. What is more exciting are the words of the residents, the staff and their families, that describe in a way that statistics fail to do, just how profoundly an environmental change such as a therapeutic garden and atrium can improve the lives of aged care residents with dementia.</p>
