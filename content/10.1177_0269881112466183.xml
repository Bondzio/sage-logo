<abstract>
<p>Cognitive impairments can be observed in the majority of diseases with disturbed dopamine transmission. They are considered as core symptoms of schizophrenia, a disorder in which they appear to be particularly pronounced. Their neurobiological background is not yet sufficiently investigated, but dopaminergic systems are believed to play a crucial role. The aim of this single-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study was to examine the effects of subchronic antidopaminergic treatment on cognitive functions in healthy subjects. In total, 72 healthy volunteers, randomised into four groups, received one antidopaminergic substance (aripiprazole, haloperidol or reserpine) or placebo, respectively, for 7 days. A comprehensive neurocognitive assessment was conducted at baseline, 24 h after the last medication intake and 7 days later. In the Digit Symbol Substitution Test a distinct, statistically significant improvement was measured in the second session in the placebo but not in the medication group. A significant group*time interaction for reaction times in three subtests of the Test battery for Attentional Performance (TAP) was also found. Our findings indicate that modulation of dopaminergic systems affects primarily speed of information processing, attention and learning. Absence of effects on other functions, differing from previous reports, may be an expression of a sufficient counter-regulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Numerous investigations have revealed evidence that dopamine is involved in cognitive functions such as attention, planning and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269881112466183">Cools and Robbins, 2004</xref>). Previous research has shown disturbed cognition in diseases in which dopamine transmission is altered, such as Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia or attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269881112466183">Owen et al., 1997</xref>). However, it still remains difficult to answer the question about the actual contribution of dopamine to cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269881112466183">Nieoullon, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Cognitive impairments are particularly pronounced in schizophrenia, occurring in the majority of patients with this disease. They often persist after successful treatment of positive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881112466183">Gray and Roth, 2007</xref>) and they seem to be much better predictors of functional outcome than indices from any other domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269881112466183">Green, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Three neurotransmitter systems are thought to be implicated in the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunctions in schizophrenia: the dopaminergic, the cholinergic and the glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269881112466183">Buchanan et al., 2007</xref>). Among these, the role of the dopaminergic system has been investigated most extensively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269881112466183">Goldman-Rakic et al. (2000)</xref> suggested that the dopamine function in the prefrontal cortex follows an ‘inverted-U’ dose–response curve, whereby an increase or decrease from an optimal level results in cognitive impairments. Repeated investigations showed that carriers of the high-activity allele of cathecol-O-methyltransferase, an enzyme involved in dopamine metabolism, display lower performance in various cognitive tasks compared with carriers of the allele that is associated with higher concentration of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269881112466183">Goldberg and Weinberger 2004</xref>). Clinical studies have suggested a relationship between low cerebrospinal fluid homovanillic acid, a measure reflecting low dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex, and poor performance at tasks involving working memory in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269881112466183">Kahn et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0269881112466183">Weinberger et al. 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the medications of first choice for schizophrenia are antipsychotics, which primarily reduce dopaminergic neurotransmission. In a recent study with 498 patients with schizophreniform disorder or first-episode schizophrenia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269881112466183">Davidson et al. (2009)</xref> reported that treatment with antipsychotic medication was associated with moderate improvement in cognitive test performance. The magnitude of improvement did not differ between patients treated with haloperidol and those treated with second-generation antipsychotics. In a long-term study over 12 months reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269881112466183">Rémillard et al. (2008)</xref> neither conventional nor atypical antipsychotic medications improved neurocognitive functioning significantly. Analysing the dataset from 410 participants of the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials in Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) trial, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269881112466183">Sakurai et al. (2012)</xref> found a significant association between neurocognitive function and the estimated D<sub>2</sub> occupancy levels. Neurocognitive functions, including vigilance, were especially impaired in subjects who showed D<sub>2</sub> receptor occupancy levels of more than 77%. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0269881112466183">Uchida et al. (2009)</xref> in their clinical positron emission tomography (PET) study demonstrated a negative correlation between attentional performance and the D<sub>2</sub> receptor blockade. They found lower attention scores in patients with schizophrenia who experienced 75% or higher D<sub>2</sub> receptor blockade by risperidone.</p>
<p>The complex relationship between alterations of dopaminergic transmission and cognitive performance indicates the need for further investigations independently of any defined pathological condition. A prerequisite for the understanding of such elaborate correlations in particular diseases is a more precise insight into these correlations in healthy people. A profound gain in understanding of the role of dopamine in cognition is only possible by investigating healthy people without underlying pathology.</p>
<p>The objective of our study was to contribute to a better understanding of the impact of dopamine hypofunction on some of the primary cognitive domains defined by the MATRICS (Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia) conference to be crucial for developing targets for the treatment of cognition in schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269881112466183">Marder and Fenton, 2004</xref>). A separate investigation dealt with the effects on psychopathology, motor symptoms and prolactin concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0269881112466183">Veselinović et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269881112466183">b</xref>).</p>
<p>So far, only a small number of studies have targeted cognitive functions in a psychopharmacologically induced hypodopaminergic state in healthy subjects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881112466183">Saeedi et al. (2006)</xref> demonstrated a negative influence of a single dose of haloperidol on cognition, within the domains of sustained attention, reaction time and speed of information processing, with the effect on sustained attention reaching statistical significance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881112466183">Ramaekers et al. (1999)</xref> reported a negative influence of a 5-day treatment with haloperidol on all assessed cognitive functions (divided attention, sustained attention, choice reaction time and information processing). They also observed less pronounced negative effects with amisulpride. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0269881112466183">Vernaleken et al. (2006)</xref> found impairments of sustained attention after 3 days of treatment with haloperidol. Notably, the former authors focused on an acute modulation of dopaminergic systems, for example after a single (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269881112466183">Saeedi et al., 2006</xref>) or maximum of five (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269881112466183">Ramaekers et al., 1999</xref>) applications of antidopaminergic substances. These short-term hypodopaminergic states reflect only to a very limited extent the chronic disturbances of neurotransmission which presumably underlie the pathogenesis of mental diseases.</p>
<p>The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of prolonged, subchronic dopaminergic hypofunction on neurocognitive parameters in healthy subjects. We hypothesised that a 7-day antidopaminergic intervention would impair cognitive function. Furthermore, differences between three antidopaminergic mechanisms were assessed. Based on the reported property of atypical antipsychotics to improve cognitive performance or to affect it less than typical antipsychotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0269881112466183">Yang et al., 2004</xref>), we hypothesised that impairments will occur under treatment with reserpine and haloperidol, but less so with aripiprazole. Further, we expected the strongest impairments in the group receiving reserpine, because of dopamine depletion that will result in under-stimulation of both D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>1</sub> dopamine receptors.</p>

<title>Experimental procedures</title>
<p>This single-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group study was conducted in the Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics of the RWTH Aachen University Hospital, Aachen, Germany between April 2009 and August 2009. The study was approved by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) and the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of RWTH Aachen University. It was conducted in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269881112466183">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Eligible participants were healthy subjects aged 20–50 years who were recruited through advertisement. Prior to inclusion they were screened for mental (using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269881112466183">First et al., 1997</xref>) and physical health. Exclusion criteria included use of psychotropic drugs (prescription medication and illegal drugs), regular or excessive consumption of alcohol and smoking of more than five cigarettes per month prior to inclusion into the study, as well as presence or history of psychiatric (specifically depression) or any medical diseases known as absolute or relative contraindications for the chosen drugs.</p>
<p>All subjects were required to have a negative screening (urine) for drugs of abuse before participating in the study. Electrocardiography, electroencephalography, routine laboratory parameters, physical and neurological examination were without pathological findings. The participants were instructed to abstain from alcohol and active traffic participation during the study. They also affirmed not to take part in other clinical studies in this time period. For female participants, a negative pregnancy test and safe contraception were required. Females without regular hormonal contraception could participate only in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Women using hormonal contraception were included in the period of stable intake of combined oral contraceptive pills or constant use of a vaginal ring. All participants gave written consent after the study protocol was explained in detail. During the study, the participants were under the strict supervision of well-trained and responsible scientists, being accessible round the clock.</p>
<p>Some 72 volunteers (mean age 26.3 ± 6.2 years) were included: 34 males (mean age 24.9 ± 4; range 22–43) and 38 females (mean age 27.5 ± 7.5; range 20–50). Demographic data for each group are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269881112466183">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Antidopaminergic intervention</title>
<p>Participants were randomised in four groups and received either placebo or one antidopaminergic substance. Three substances with different mechanisms of action were chosen: aripiprazole, haloperidol and reserpine. For the purpose of better tolerability, the doses were gradually raised (aripiprazole: 1<sup>st</sup> day: 5 mg, 2<sup>nd</sup> day: 10 mg, 3<sup>rd</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> day: 15 mg; haloperidol: 1<sup>st</sup> day 1 mg, 2<sup>nd</sup> day: 2 mg, 3<sup>rd</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> day: 3 mg; reserpine: 1<sup>st</sup> day: 0.25 mg, 2<sup>nd</sup> day: 0.5 mg, 3<sup>rd</sup> to 7<sup>th</sup> day: 1.0 mg).</p>
<p>Aripiprazole is a relatively new antipsychotic. It is characterised by its partial agonism at several G protein-coupled receptors (especially D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, and D<sub>4</sub>, and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and 5-HT<sub>7</sub>) and its antagonistic action at others (especially 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>6</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269881112466183">Davies et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Haloperidol is a prototypic first-generation butyrophenone antipsychotic with a high affinity to D<sub>2</sub> receptors. The binding to other receptors is negligible, with the exception of alpha-1B adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269881112466183">Roth et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Reserpine, an alkaloid from <italic>Rauwolfia serpentina</italic>, was used for the treatment of psychosis at the beginning of the neuroleptic era. It has been shown that reserpine acts by blocking the vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) on monoamine neurons. Consequently, the extracellular concentration of dopamine in brain areas containing dopaminergic nerve terminals markedly decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269881112466183">Kannari et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>For randomisation, a computer-generated random number list was used, prepared by an investigator with no clinical involvement in the trial. The control group received white placebo tablets – one on the first day, two on the second day and three from the third till the seventh day. The medication intake was conducted in presence of the investigators. Hospitalisation during the treatment period was not required.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0269881112466183">
<title>Clinical assessment</title>
<p>Expert ratings were based on established psychiatric rating scales and clinical interviews. The trained rater was blinded to the group affiliation of the participants. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were assessed using the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269881112466183">Barnes, 1989</xref>) and the Simpson–Angus Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269881112466183">Simpson and Angus, 1970</xref>). In order to determine the drug concentrations in serum, venous blood samples were collected on day 8. The methodology and results of clinical assessment and drug monitoring are reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0269881112466183">Veselinović et al., 2011b</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269881112466183">
<title>Visual Analogue Scale</title>
<p>In order to take account of subjective factors potentially influencing cognitive performance, a visual analogue scale (VAS) was applied. This is a commonly used method for uncomplicated assessment of subjective ratings in research and clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269881112466183">Marsh-Richard et al., 2009</xref>). Usually, a VAS is a straight 100 mm horizontal line. Its end anchors are labelled as the extreme boundaries of the sensation, feeling, or response to be measured. A VAS is scored by measuring the distance, usually in millimetres, from one end of the scale to the subject’s mark on the line. In our study, the participants were asked to assess their level of fatigue (between ‘not at all’ and ‘worst I can imagine’), their ability to concentrate, their general well-being as well as their motivation and their drive to perform any activity (between ‘worst/lowest imaginable’ and ‘highest/best I can imagine’). The scales were applied four times: on day 0 (before the first drug intake), day 5, day 8 (24 h after the last drug intake, with allowed tolerance of 2 h) and on day 15 (7 days after the last medication intake).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0269881112466183">
<title>Neurocognitive tests</title>
<p>Neuropsychological test sessions were scheduled on 0 (session 1), day 8 (session 2) and day 15 (session 3). In order to evaluate different cognitive domains previously reported to be associated with the dopaminergic system, the following tests were chosen.</p>
<sec id="section9-0269881112466183">
<title>Trail-Making Test</title>
<p>The Trail-Making Test (TMT) is an often used test because of its high sensitivity to the presence of cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269881112466183">Kortte et al., 2002</xref>). The test has two parts. In Part A the participant is required to draw a line connecting 25 numbers consecutively as quickly as possible. In Part B, the participant must draw a line alternating between numbers and letters in consecutive order. Performance is assessed by the time taken to complete each trial correctly. The TMT reflects a combination of several cognitive functions, measuring complex visual scanning with a motor component, motor speed and agility. Part B is particularly sensitive for cognitive flexibility and executive function.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0269881112466183">
<title>Letter-Number Span</title>
<p>In the Letter–Number Span (LNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269881112466183">Gold et al., 1997</xref>) the tester verbally presents increasingly longer sequences of intermixed numbers and letters at a rate of one per second. After each sequence, the participant is asked to repeat the numbers in ascending order first, and then the letters in alphabetical order. The letter–number sequences range from two up to a maximum length of seven stimuli. Four trials are presented for each length of sequence. The test is discontinued when the subject fails four consecutive trials of the same length. One point is scored for each correctly repeated sequence (maximum total score is 24 points). This test measures working memory performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269881112466183">
<title>Digit Symbol Substitution Task</title>
<p>The Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST) is a subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0269881112466183">Wechsler, 1997</xref>). It primarily quantifies the speed of processing. Participants are asked to pair symbols to numbers and write them into blank squares as quickly as possible, referring to a digit symbol key outlined at the top of the examination sheet. Scoring is based on the number of correct substitutions made in 90 s.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0269881112466183">
<title>Tests for Attentional Performance</title>
<p>Four tests from the Tests for Attentional Performance (TAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0269881112466183">Zimmermann and Fimm, 1993</xref>) were used: Alertness, Optical Vigilance, Go-No Go and Divided Attention.</p>

<sec id="section13-0269881112466183">
<title>Alertness</title>
<p>This test measures reaction times (RT) with or without an acoustic warning signal (WS). Subjects are required to press a button as rapidly as possible when a cross (2 cm) appears in the middle of the screen. Two blocks without and two blocks with a warning signal are presented. The interval between the warning and the imperative stimulus varies randomly between 300 and 700 ms. A total of 80 trials are given. The main outcome variable is the reaction time without warning signal (RT without WS) and reaction time with warning signal (RT with WS).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0269881112466183">
<title>Go/no-go task</title>
<p>We used the ‘2 of 5’ stimuli version of the go/no-go task. In this version a 3 × 3 cm square appears in the middle of the screen. There are five different patterns in the square. Two patterned squares serve as target stimuli. The subject has to press the button when a target stimulus is presented and not press it when non-targets are shown. A total of 60 trials (24 targets and 36 non-targets) are given. Main outcome parameters are reaction times for correct responses, number of false reactions and number of omissions. This task design is a choice reaction time experiment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0269881112466183">
<title>Divided attention</title>
<p>In the divided attention (DA) test two simultaneous tasks (one visual and one acoustic) are given. The subjects are required to press a button after perception of two (of four) visual symbols or after acoustic sequence of two high or two low sounds. During 3 min and 25 s, 175 visual and 287 acoustic signals are presented with 20 target signals in each category. The outcome variables are reaction times, number of omissions and false reactions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0269881112466183">
<title>Optical vigilance/ sustained attention</title>
<p>The version with low frequency of stimuli was used for the Optical vigilance/ sustained attention test. A horizontal bar moves regularly up and down with a 1.8 cm oscillation in the centre of the screen. The subject has to press the button when the bar shows a larger oscillation (approx. 3.5 cm). During 30 min, 2800 stimuli are presented; 18 of them are target stimuli. Main parameters are reaction times for correct responses, number of omissions (lack of response to target stimuli) and false reactions (responses to non-target stimuli).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0269881112466183">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were conducted with the SAS statistical analysis software package (SAS Version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). In the repeated-measures analyses of variance the mixed model was used to minimise the effects of missing data (Proc Mixed). An alpha level of &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All tests were two-tailed. Factors in the models were group, time, and group*time interactions. To account for the influence of age, this variable was included as a covariate.</p>
<p>Graphical representations were created by use of the SigmaPlot Software (Version 10.0.1; Systat Software, Inc; San Jose, USA).</p>
<p>For the first analytical step, all participants randomised to receive an active substance were considered as part of one group (verum group). To compare the verum group with the placebo group a three-way repeated measures analysis of variance (repeated measures ANOVA) was carried out in order to investigate the effects of the group (group factor: 2 levels – placebo/ verum), time (equal to the number of observations, 3) as well as time and group interaction on each measured item. Only in case of a statistically significant effect obtained in the global F-test, post-hoc <italic>t</italic>-tests were performed for multiple pair-wise comparisons. In case of significant differences detected between the placebo and verum groups the next analytical step was conducted in order to compare the differences among the three different drugs. In this repeated-measures ANOVA a group factor with four levels was used.</p>
<p>Further correlations between outcome parameters in the second session (conducted 24 h after the last intake of medication) and scores from the EPS ratings, as well as the serum drug concentrations and scores rated on the VAS scales on day 8 were explored.</p>
<p>To account for the problems arising from multiple testing an alpha-adjustment was carried out using Bonferroni correction.</p>

<title>Dropouts and missing data</title>
<p>Seven (four males and three females; mean age 24.29 ± 2.06) out of 18 participants (38.9%) randomised to the haloperidol group terminated the study participation between day 3 and day 4. In these subjects the second test session and the second clinical observation were conducted 24 h after the last medication. The third test session and observation 1 week after finishing the medication intake was not conducted.</p>
<p>For logistical reasons, the DSST was not included in the test battery in the first eight participants (two from each group).</p>

<p>No statistically significant correlations were found between the outcome in any test in the second session and serum drug levels. Furthermore, no significant correlations between test outcomes and EPS severity scores could be detected.</p>
<p>In order to investigate the influence of the subjective well-being on the neurocognitive performance in the second test session, we analysed the correlation between the measured scores in the neurocognitive tests and the subjective ratings using the VAS scale. We found statistically significant correlations between the performance in the some tests (TMT Task, DSST, LNS, reaction time and omissions from the go/no-go task, vigilance task and divided attention task) and the subjective ratings of fatigue, motivation, drive, concentration and general well-being (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0269881112466183">Table 4</xref>). However, the significance level of these correlations did not withstand Bonferroni correction.</p>

<title>Impairments observed after antidopaminergic intervention</title>
<p>Seven days of antidopaminergic treatment led to impaired processing speed and attention in healthy volunteers. Differences among the three active drugs were not detected.</p>
<p>Performance in the DSST was significantly impaired after the antidopaminergic intervention. This coding task is used to evaluate psychomotor and processing speed, which are expected to affect many higher cognitive operations – perceptual processes, encoding and retrieval operations, transformation of information held in active memory, and decision processes as well as attention, working memory and planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881112466183">Dickinson et al., 2007</xref>). Poor performance in the DSST has been assessed in various psychiatric and neurological disorders, particularly in such involving disturbances of dopaminergic systems as schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease. The DSST has been found to be sensitive in detecting impairments early in the course of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269881112466183">Hill et al., 2004</xref>). Coding task deficits were also shown in relatives at high risk for developing illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269881112466183">Hawkins et al., 2004</xref>). An association between the premorbid outcome in the DSST task and the probability of developing schizophrenia in persons at risk has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269881112466183">Niendam et al., 2003</xref>). The coding tasks involve very different sub-processes, which require the rapid and smooth coordination of a complex assembly of elementary operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269881112466183">Dickinson et al., 2007</xref>). This complex devolution appears sensitive to alteration of the dopaminergic balance, resulting in decreased performance on the DSST in our study.</p>
<p>The impaired DSST performance cannot be explained by simple motor deceleration, which is also indicative of hypodopaminergic states. Performance on the TMT, which also reflects motor speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269881112466183">Schear and Sato, 1989</xref>), was not impaired. Further, there was no correlation between performance in the second session in any test and severity of EPS. Likewise, in patients with schizophrenia the impairments in the DSST seem to be not due to motor or visual acuity problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269881112466183">Royer et al., 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results are in concordance with a recent meta-analysis reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269881112466183">Knowles et al. (2010)</xref>, indicating a substantial effect of antipsychotic dose on severity of impairment on the DSST in schizophrenia. The authors similarly could not demonstrate such effect for other cognitive measures (TMT A and B, letter and category verbal fluency tests or Wisconsin Card Sorting Test).</p>
<p>Negative effects of the antidopaminergic intervention were also noted in attention, specifically in reaction time prolongation for three subtests of the TAP battery. The findings imply primarily impairments of attention speed, which could be prerequisite for more complex and capacity demanding components of attention selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269881112466183">Sturm et al., 1997</xref>). This concurs with previous studies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269881112466183">McCann et al. (1993)</xref> found impaired attention after dopamine depletion with alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT), while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269881112466183">Schück et al. (2002)</xref> reported improvement in alertness and in information processing speed after application of a dopamine agonist.</p>
<p>The effects of the subjective impairments on the cognitive performance during the antidopaminergic modulation cannot be neglected. Participants receiving antidopaminergic medication complained frequently about loss of motivation, indifference, and decreased interest in surroundings and commitments. The observed attention deficits in the verum group could thus be also a consequence of reduced effort to perform the tasks. Several participants reported that their performance in the second session was diminished by a lack of ambition. Interestingly, we primarily find negative correlations between the different aspects of subjective well being and the TMT-B Task scores. However, the results from this task did not significantly differ between the placebo and the verum group. Furthermore, the RT and the omissions rate in three TAP subtests (go/no-go, divided attention, vigilance) also showed negative correlations with different aspects of subjective self-rating. Despite the fact that the observed correlations between the cognitive performance and the self-ratings did not withstand Bonferroni correction, the association between these domains seems plausible. In a recent study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269881112466183">Kim et al. (2011)</xref> showed that mental side-effects of antipsychotics are associated with D<sub>2</sub> receptor blockade in the associative and limbic subdivisions of the striatum, which are also considered to play a crucial role in cognition and reward motivation.</p>
<p>However, this association between the subjective impairments due to the medication and the performance in the cognitive tasks does not include the most severe adverse effects in the haloperidol-treated participants, who were not able to continue intake of the medication and required acute treatment. Their cognitive performance, as well as their subjective condition, was acquired after treatment of the adverse effects.</p>
<p>Notably, in the placebo group we observed a significant improvement in some tests in the second session, which failed to appear in the verum group. This could be explained by the absence of learning effects in the verum group caused by inhibition of dopaminergic neurotransmission. This finding supports the role of dopamine in learning processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0269881112466183">Wise, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-0269881112466183">
<title>Cognitive domains not impaired by antidopaminergic modulation</title>
<p>Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find impairments of working memory despite the very well-established acceptance of the role of dopamine in this cognitive domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269881112466183">Goldman-Rakic, 1996</xref>). Also, other tests previously reported to reliably detect cognitive impairments related to dopaminergic dysfunction (e.g. in schizophrenia) did not reveal any worsening after prolonged pharmacological intervention in our study.</p>
<p>To account for these findings diverging from our prediction, several aspects should be discussed. First, it is possible that the timing of the examinations, with the second session being conducted 24 h after the last medication intake, was suboptimal to detect impairments. This time schedule was chosen based on the pharmacokinetics of the used substances. PET studies have clearly documented that D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>3</sub> dopamine receptors are occupied for much longer than 24 h after the last administration of aripiprazole and haloperidol, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269881112466183">Gründer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269881112466183">Nordström et al., 1992</xref>). Also, the depletion of synaptic vesicles containing monoamines persists for several days after cessation of reserpine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269881112466183">Henry et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore we expected to record effects on cognition also 24 h after the medication intake.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is noteworthy that the majority of our participants were students, so that the estimated verbal crystallised premorbid intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269881112466183">Lehrl, 1995</xref>) in this group was on a higher level than in the average population. Considering that the applied tests were quite easy to accomplish, a ceiling effect could be one of the main reasons for the predominantly negative results in some of the cognitive domains.</p>
<p>Third, the negative results could be due to an upregulation of dopamine receptors induced by the antipsychotics. This phenomenon, usually associated with long-term treatment with antipsychotics, could be demonstrated in vitro even after a 6-day intervention with haloperidol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269881112466183">Deslauriers et al., 2011</xref>). The extended treatment duration and the stepwise dose increase may have been favourable for this adaptation. In previous studies in which cognitive impairments due to antidopaminergic agents were detected, the treatment duration was restricted to a single or only a few doses. These interventions were possibly too short to initiate effective adaptive mechanisms. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the impact of a dopaminergic hypofunctional state, which was sustained for 7 days, was examined in healthy subjects. Most likely due to those adaptive mechanisms several cognitive domains assessed in our study were not impaired after 7 days of medication. However, the baseline level was not completely restored by the adaptation, resulting in impaired reaction times and processing speed. Notably, the DSST is acknowledged to be very sensitive to disturbances in dopaminergic transmission.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we did not find differences between the individual treatment groups in any of the applied tests. This could be due to the rather small sample size. On the other hand, in previous studies advantages of any single class of antipsychotics concerning cognition in schizophrenia could not be demonstrated uniformly.</p>
<p>Moreover, the association between cognition and the dopaminergic systems cannot be observed without inclusion of the role of non-dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems. Currently there is effort to detect new drugs for the treatment of cognitive impairments targeting the cholinergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic systems, and GABA neurotransmission, neurosteroids and sigma receptors have also been investigated (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269881112466183">Gray and Roth, 2007</xref>). Our findings that the induction of a hypodopaminergic state results in a limited extent of cognitive impairments suggest that such a state may not be decisive for poor cognitive functions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269881112466183">Gründer et al. (2009)</xref> suggested deconstructing schizophrenia into various phenomenological components, which should be targeted independently with separate molecules or specifically designed multitarget drugs. Cognition could be a phenomenological component with an exigency for further investigation of neurobiological substrates.</p>
<p>Finally, our inability to detect extensive impairments after antipsychotic treatment could be due to lack of sufficient statistical power.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-0269881112466183">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The main limitation of the present study is that effects of decreased dopaminergic transmission were examined only on the behavioural level. Functional imaging could show the levels of prefrontal activation needed to compensate for the disturbed neuronal information processing. Further studies combining these complementary techniques would be more informative in the attempt to explain the role of dopamine on different cognitive domains. Such examination would probably also reveal functional differences between heterogeneous dopamine-decreasing mechanisms, which were not found on the behavioural level.</p>
<p>Another methodological weakness was the single-blinded design. The raters and the persons conducting the neuropsychological tests were blinded concerning the medication. The blinding of the participants was not ensured because the original drugs were not encapsulated. However, the participants were not informed which substance they were actually receiving. They were also asked not to try to find this out (e.g. on the basis of the shape and colour).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a large number of subjects randomised to the haloperidol group terminated the study ahead of schedule. It is difficult to draw definite conclusions about this particular medication. However, the dropouts were also tested 24 h after the last drug intake and the test results were carried forward to day 8 (last observation carried forward).</p>
<p>Further limitations concerning the different factors which potentially led to a lack of measurable effects on cognitive performance are discussed above. In particular, the high base intelligence level of our participants may be considered as a kind of selection bias.</p>
<p>Methodologically, pooling of the three groups with different antidopaminergic interventions also appears problematic because of the numerical inequality of the compared groups. Further, the design with multiple testing remains problematical. However, the results may be considered as an approximate approach requiring further proof through more sensitive methods.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>After psychopharmacological intervention of 7 days’ duration aiming to induce a hypodopaminergic state, we found impairments in information processing speed, attention and learning in young healthy volunteers. Results concerning processing speed remained statistically significant even after applying Bonferroni correction. The absence of effects on other functions, differing from previous reports, may be an expression of a sufficient counter-regulation.</p>
<p>Despite limitations, our findings have important clinical implications. We were able to demonstrate that antidopaminergic intervention may cause relevant cognitive impairments, although they were less pronounced than expected. In this context, the effects on motivation and subjective well-being also are not to be neglected. Although we could not find specific differences in cognitive performance between the three groups receiving different substances, it has to be emphasised that intolerable side-effects, requiring additional psychopharmacological treatment and leading to discontinuation of participation, occurred solely in the group receiving haloperidol.</p>
<p>These aspects should be considered in clinical daily routine, on the one hand concerning the choice and the doses of antipsychotics, and by avoiding polypharmacy. On the other hand, these findings are important in regard to the rising trend of an off-label use of antipsychotics for patients who are not suffering from schizophrenia. Interest in this topic has increased in recent years. Several investigators have reported strong evidence for an elevated risk of adverse events with off-label use of antipsychotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269881112466183">Maher and Theodore, 2012</xref>). In a recent systematic review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269881112466183">Maher et al. (2011)</xref> identified increased risk of death, stroke, EPS and urinary tract symptoms as the most common adverse events in the elderly. In non-elderly adults, adverse events included weight gain, fatigue, sedation, akathisia and EPS. Interestingly, negative effects on cognition resulting from off-label use of antipsychotics in non-schizophrenic patients still do not attract a great deal of attention, despite several reports of negative cognitive effects of antipsychotics on cognition in healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269881112466183">Barrett et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269881112466183">de Bruijn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0269881112466183">Vernaleken et al., 2008</xref>). Our results once again emphasise this association, which requires consideration in prescribing practice (particularly in elderly patients with cognitive disabilities), and also indicate the need for further investigation.</p>
