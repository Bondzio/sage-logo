<p>This issue marks the end of my tenure as an editor of the <italic>International Journal of Music Education: Research</italic>. As such, it has given me pause, and I hope you will indulge me as I spend a little time reflecting on the changes the journal has gone through over the past twelve years.</p>
<p>The first blind review research issue I was a part of was number 39. We were able to accept six very nice research reports in the eighteen months of refereeing prior to that printing. The Editorial Board consisted of ten very dedicated and long-standing ISME members.</p>
<p>In 2004 ISME contracted with Sage to take over the publication of the journal. That same year the rotation of publication changed from one research issue per year to three issues per year, but we remained with only one being research. We also changed the numbering system. Volume 22 was the volume we used, and ISME then published the three issues as Research, Showcase, and Practice.</p>
<p>This system continued until 2007 when, with volume 25 the Showcase edition became a second Research issue. From that time on, IJME has had two Research editions each year. That was more formally established in 2008, when the rotation went to Research/Practice; an alternating issue every three months. The other big change that occurred in 2007 was that Research added a co-editor – Beatriz Ilari.</p>
<p>For the last six years, Beatriz and I have shared the editorial duties associated with the journal, and it has truly been a pleasure growing this fine publication with such an outstanding scholar. I cannot imagine having had a greater partner these last six years. During that time, our submissions have grown from twenty-five to over sixty-five a year. Our Editorial Board has likewise grown, and now numbers twenty-four, and the journal itself has become a primary destination for many scholars’ best work. I am extremely proud of what has been built here. I most sincerely hope that you, the readership, also find this work worthy of the efforts so many people have contributed to it.</p>
<p>In these reflections, I am hesitant to name names, as I am almost certainly going to leave out some important people. On the other hand, so many people have made contributions, and deserve my best efforts to acknowledge them. The Publication committee, and most notably the Chair of the Committee, Wendy Sims, cannot be thanked enough. The committee was instrumental in the growth of IJME, the relationship ISME now has with SAGE Publications, and has always been supportive when the journal had needs.</p>
<p>Further, the University of Kansas has always been supportive in providing the journal with Graduate Student help. Acknowledgment and appreciation of this contribution is important. This support has made possible the enormous efforts of the students who have worked through the countless details, making the journal run smoothly. Over the past dozen years, Erin Stewart, Linda Schroeder, Leigh Giglio, Valerie Slattery, Anne Marie Robins, and Melissa Brunkan have kept everything straight, and made it all work. They all have my deepest gratitude.</p>
<p>As I step away from this position, I am sure Beatriz and her new co-editor will work hard to continue improving the journal. Although always behind the scenes, I know that every day they will be making decisions regarding the direction of the journal and how to best provide dissemination and access for all the scholars in our profession. And I know they have many ideas about how to make the journal even better. I very much look forward to seeing what happens next.</p>
<p>At any given time, the best way to judge the health of a scholarly journal is to read it. I am thrilled to end my tenure with this current issue. We feature seven articles, emanating from four different continents. We have theoretical/philosophical, historical, descriptive, and experimental investigations. In many ways, this is as diverse as any issue we have ever published. I very much hope you enjoy these reports, and I hope you continue to support the fine work of ISME and all those involved with the <italic>International Journal of Music Education: Research</italic>.</p>
