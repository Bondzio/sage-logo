<abstract>
<p>Heat generated during implant osteotomy might lead to osteonecrosis and delayed bone repair, thus resulting in impaired early osseointegration and fixation of bone-anchoring devices. In this study, we proposed to overcome heat-induced injury to bone by fabricating core-shell polymeric biodegradable microspheres encapsulating a mitogenic factor, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and a differentiation factor, simvastatin, in a simultaneous or sequential release profile. Microspheres encapsulating bovine serum albumin (BSA), PDGF, simvastatin, PDGF-in-core with simvastatin-in-shell, and simvastatin-in-core with PDGF-in-shell were delivered to fill standardized osteotomy sites on edentulous ridges of rat maxillae under irrigated or non-irrigated conditions. In the absence of irrigation, significant reduction of cell viability and increase in inflammation and sequestrum formation without evidence of osteogenesis were observed. Both PDGF and simvastatin deliveries facilitated cell viability and reduced osteonecrosis. Localized osteogenesis was seen under simvastatin treatment, while generalized but primitive osteogenesis was noted in PDGF-treated osteotomy sites. In addition, sequential PDGF-simvastatin delivery further augmented osteogenesis and promoted bone maturation. The results suggested that sequential PDGF-simvastatin delivery was an effective modality to prevent heat-induced complications and facilitate bone apposition after implant osteotomy, potentially favoring the early fixation of bone-anchoring devices and oral implant osseointegration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Thermal injury is one of the major complications involved in intramedullary nailing or dental implant installation. Heat is primarily generated from the frictional force between the drill bit and bone and can be further augmented by increasing mechanical cutting and local contact pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512445194">Pape and Giannoudis, 2007</xref>). Overheating can block local microcirculation and trigger bone marrow macrophage activity, thus leading to osteonecrosis when temperatures exceed 47°C for 1 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512445194">Eriksson and Albrektsson, 1984</xref>). In addition, further denaturation of alkaline phosphatase occurs at 56°C. As such, the necrotic tissue is less differentiated and more susceptible to bacterial infection. Clinically, heat-induced osteonecrosis causes intense post-operative discomfort and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512445194">Schroeder <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Overheating may also lead to loosening of implants by immediate bone resorption after implant installation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512445194">Sener <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Several approaches have since been introduced to overcome thermal damage, including internal or external irrigation to reduce temperature and bacterial load, and increasing the drill bit size incrementally to prevent over-drilling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512445194">Barone <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512445194">Pape and Giannoudis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512445194">Seiberling <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). However, these modifications may interfere with the surgical field of view and increase the complexity of surgical procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512445194">Flanagan, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The regenerative potential of heat-injured bone is reported to be hindered in the early stage of bone healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512445194">Eriksson and Albrektsson, 1984</xref>). Temporal increases in osteoclastic and apoptotic cells as well as decreases in osteoblastic cells over a certain temperature were demonstrated within 3 wks of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512445194">Yoshida <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Regeneration appeared to resume in the later stages but was slower and inferior compared with that of the control.</p>
<p>Osteogenesis involves a cascade of events, predominantly cell recruitment in the early stage and osteogenic differentiation in the later stage. Delivery of bioactive molecules mimicking osteogenesis appears to be a feasible approach to improving osteogenesis under compromised conditions. Mitogenic factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and differentiation factors, such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) or simvastatin, have been evaluated in relevant peri-implant or periodontal defect models, with reports of successful osteogenic regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512445194">Wikesjö <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512445194">Jin <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512445194">Dunn <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512445194">Lee <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512445194">Chang <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In accordance with the demonstrable effects of bioactive molecules on bone regeneration, we proposed delivering PDGF and/or simvastatin in an encapsulated biodegradable microsphere with a distinct core-shell structure facilitating simultaneous or sequential releasing profiles by a technique previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512445194">Chang <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>) to overcome heat-induced bone necrosis. Our results indicated that either simvastatin or PDGF could reduce osteonecrosis, and sequential release of PDGF-simvastatin could further augment bone apposition.</p>

<sec id="section3-0022034512445194">
<title>Microsphere Fabrication and Characterization</title>
<p>The microspheres were fabricated by the co-axial electrohydrodynamic atomization (CEHDA) technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512445194">Nie <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Briefly, 10% poly-D,L-lactide (PDLLA, core matrix) and 10% poly(D,L-lactide-<italic>co</italic>-glycolide; PLGA, shell matrix) in dichloromethane solution were transferred to the co-axial needle controlled by two programmable syringe pumps, and the sizes and shapes of microspheres were controlled by an electrical field. The hydrophobic biomolecules (simvastatin) were dissolved directly, whereas the hydrophilic agents (PDGF or BSA) were dissolved in de-ionized water and transferred to the corresponding matrix solution. Five types of PDLLA-PLGA microspheres were fabricated: (i) BSA-in-core-shell (BB), (ii) PDGF-in-shell (XP), (iii) simvastatin-in-core and BSA-in-shell (SB), (iv) simvastatin-in-core and PDGF-in-shell (SP), and (v) PDGF-in-core and simvastatin-in-shell (PS).</p>
<p>The sizes and surface morphologies of microspheres were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to observe the distribution of coumarin-6 to confirm the core-shell structure. We examined encapsulation efficiency by dissolving the microspheres in dichloromethane and PBS, and the aqueous phase was collected after centrifugation at 9,000 rpm. We examined the <italic>in vitro</italic> release profile by loading the microspheres in PBS under consistent shaking (120 rpm) at 37°C and collecting the incubated medium at days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14. The concentration of PDGF was evaluated by ELISA, and simvastatin by HPLC.</p>

<title>Animal Models and Study Designs</title>
<p>Thirty-six four-week-old (weight about 75-90 g) Sprague-Dawley male rats were used according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National University of Singapore (NUS), and sample size was determined by power analysis. All instruments were autoclaved prior to procedures. Bilateral maxillary first molars (M1) were removed. After 4 wks of socket healing, a cylindrical osteotomy (2.6 mm in diameter and 1 mm in depth; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512445194">Fig. 1</xref>) was created by means of a customized low-speed drill under 3,000 rpm for 1 to 2 min and filled with microspheres. The following 6 modes were examined in the randomly selected osteotomy sites: sterilized saline irrigation during drilling and defect filled with BB (control); and no irrigation with BB, SB, XP, SP, or PS filling. After the delivery of microspheres, the wound was closed with a cyanoacrylate gel. Animals were given antibiotics for 7 days and euthanized for harvesting of the maxillae at days 10 and 14 (n = 6 <italic>per</italic> time-point).</p>

<title>Micro-computed Tomography (Micro-CT) and Index of Sequestrum</title>
<p>The harvested maxillae were examined by means of an x-ray generator with an 80-W tungsten anode, 30- to 80-kVp variable focus x-ray source, and a 165-mm detector. Scans were acquired at 2x2 binning, exposure time of 950 ms <italic>per</italic> projection, and 56-kVp anode voltage to achieve an effective pixel size of 19.54 microns. Images were reconstructed according to the Shepp-Logan algorithm, and the threshold of image was determined by a standardized local edge detection algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512445194">Burghardt <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The entire osteotomy site was selected as the region-of-interest (ROI) (Appendix). The extent of osteonecrosis was presented by a customized index of sequestrum (Appendix Table 1). Only specimens without sequestrum presenting were selected for the calculation of volumetric bone fraction (mineralized area/ROI) (Appendix).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022034512445194">
<title>Histological Staining and Quantitative Measurements</title>
<p>After micro-CT scanning, specimens were decalcified with 12.5% EDTA (pH 7.4) for 3 wks, embedded in paraffin transversely, and cut into 5-µm-thick sections in the mid-root level. All sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and images were acquired by means of an image capture system. Bone resorptive activity and apoptotic cellular profiles were further determined by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining in all 14-day specimens. Quantifications for inflammatory and TUNEL-positive cells were performed in 5 randomly selected areas within the defect at 400x magnification, and results were presented as a percentage of cells with positive signals relative to the total amount of cells. For bone resorptive cells, the number of TRAP-positive cells was counted in 5 randomly selected areas at the front of osteogenesis under 400x magnification.</p>

<sec id="section7-0022034512445194">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>For micro-CT and quantitative histological measurements, an unpaired <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare non-irrigated and irrigated BB separately from the other treatment groups. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to analyze the index of sequestrum. Results were presented as the mean±SD of measurements, with a p value less than 0.05 being considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Characteristics of Microspheres</title>
<p>The PDLLA-PLGA hybrid microspheres with distinct core-shell structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512445194">Fig. 1B</xref>) were successfully fabricated by the CEHDA technique with a tight control of particle sizes in the range of 15 to 20 µm (Appendix Fig. 1). The encapsulation efficiency was 80 to 92% in the core and 52 to 72% in the shell (Appendix Table 2). The <italic>in vitro</italic> release profile was varied according to the molecules and distribution in microspheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512445194">Figs. 1C-1F</xref>). A burst initial release of PDGF was noted in all the PDGF-in-shell-encapsulated microspheres (<italic>i.e.</italic>, XP, SP), and the release was nearly completed at day 7. In the microspheres encapsulating simvastatin-in-core (<italic>i.e.</italic>, SB, SP), a relatively constant rate of simvastatin release was observed, whereas half the simvastatin still remained in the microspheres at day 14 (Appendix Table 3). The releasing profiles differed according to the respective dual biomolecule encapsulating modes. Sequential release of PDGF and simvastatin was achieved in the SP set-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512445194">Fig. 1E</xref>), and in the PS set-up, PDGF and simvastatin were released in a parallel profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512445194">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>Micro-CT Assessments</title>
<p>At day 10, sequestrum occasionally presented in non-irrigated specimens without significant differences among groups, and there was no sign of bone formation in any of the specimens (data not shown). At day 14, the formation of sequestrum was increased in the non-irrigated condition, and 4 of 6 specimens under BB microsphere treatment demonstrated nearly 100% coverage of the defect border by sequestrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512445194">Fig. 2A</xref>). Groups containing either simvastatin or PDGF, or combination, showed a significant reduction in the amount of sequestrum compared with BB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512445194">Fig. 2B</xref>). While osteogenesis was still largely reduced in the non-irrigated condition, the volumetric bone fraction appeared to recover with PDGF delivery (XP, SP, and PS). Sequential PDGF-simvastatin (SP) release showed significantly augmented osteogenesis compared with the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022034512445194">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>

<title>Histological Observations</title>
<p>At day 10, the osteotomy sites of all specimens were occupied by granulation tissue with inflammatory infiltration (Appendix Fig. 2). Abscess formation with liquefaction degeneration was noted in some specimens, mostly in the non-irrigated conditions. There was no sign of osteogenesis in any specimen (data not shown).</p>
<p>At day 14, primitive bone formation accompanied by abrupt reduction of inflammation was demonstrated in the control group. However, under non-irrigated conditions, the osteotomy filled by BB exhibited significant osteonecrosis and persistent inflammation without any new bone formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512445194">Figs. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512445194">3B</xref>). With SB treatment, localized bone formation from the border of osteotomy was observed, and the front of osteogenesis was close to the residual microspheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512445194">Fig. 3C</xref>). As such, the neogenic bone formed a homogeneous inner ring from the border of osteotomy in XP-treated specimens, and a densely packed fibrous tissue was present between the front of osteogenesis and remaining microspheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512445194">Fig. 3D</xref>). Osteogenesis appeared to be more prominent in combinational PDGF-simvastatin delivery, especially in the SP group, demonstrating a generalized osteogenesis with the active front of osteogenesis close to the remaining microspheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512445194">Fig. 3F</xref>), whereas evident osteogenesis was localized only in the PS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022034512445194">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>

A significant increase of bone resorptive cells was observed after PDGF or simvastatin delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512445194">Fig. 4C</xref>), and the response was even more evident in BS and SP groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022034512445194">Fig. 4E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>With advancements in tissue engineering, delivery of bioactive molecules has emerged as a promising alternative for the treatment of compromised wounds, including diabetic ulcers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512445194">Mulder <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), large segmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512445194">Kolambkar <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), or ischemic osteonecrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512445194">Vandermeer <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Heat-injured bone also revealed impaired microcirculation, deficiency in stem cells, and inferior cellular viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512445194">Pape and Giannoudis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512445194">Yoshida <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). Since bone apposition from the native periphery of osteotomy is one of the prerequisites of osseointegration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512445194">Berglundh <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), suppressed regenerative capability of thermal osteonecrosis may diminish primary implant stability and delay secondary biological fixation of implants, potentially causing treatment failure. However, because of technical limitations, no real-time temperature was recorded in the model studied here. Compared with previous investigations under non-irrigated conditions, more evident sequestrum formation and extensive inflammation were seen in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512445194">Eriksson and Albrektsson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512445194">Yoshida <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), implying that the extent of heat injury was greater and might not be equivalent to the osteotomy in clinical settings. The extensive trauma in this model might also minimize effects from pre-existing factors (<italic>i.e</italic>., stem cells, growth factors). Thus, this model is capable of demonstrating the scientific evidence of heat injury and is suitable for the study of tissue recovery.</p>
<p>This is the first study utilizing bioactive molecules to treat heat-injured osseous tissue. PDLLA and PLGA had been utilized as promising means to deliver bioactive molecules. According to the hydrophilicity of carried molecules, our group had successfully introduced PDLLA-PLGA microspheres encapsulating 2 medications in a distinct core-shell structure with simultaneous or sequential release profile as in previous investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512445194">Nie <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512445194">Ranganath <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). We had successfully incorporated PDGF and simvastatin into PDLLA-PLGA microspheres and demonstrated favorable biological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512445194">Chang <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>), and the improvement of cellular viability with the subsidization of inflammation by either simvastatin or PDGF treatment was further confirmed in this study. In the osseous defect, release of PDGF in the first wk promoted cell recruitment, thus mimicking the early mitogenic stage in wound healing. Simvastatin released after day 7, in contrast, might facilitate osteogenic differentiation and maturation. Our results demonstrated that regenerative capability could be recovered by the introduction of either early (<italic>i.e</italic>., PDGF) or late bioactive molecules <italic>(i.e.</italic>, simvastatin).</p>
<p>Based on the osteoinductive properties of simvastatin, <italic>de novo</italic> osteogenesis took place and resulted in visible bone formation close to the microspheres encapsulating simvastatin. In the XP group, due to no direct involvement of PDGF signaling in osteogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512445194">Kumar <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), a certain distance existed between microspheres and the front of osteogenesis. However, generalized osteogenesis was seen in the XP group but only scattered osteogenesis under SB treatment, presumably due to the promotion of stem cell recruitment from the native bone by PDGF. Those hypotheses were further confirmed in the set-up of sequential PDGF-simvastatin delivery, whereby generalized osteogenesis surrounding remaining microspheres was significantly greatest in the SP group. Localized woven-type bone presented in PS group indicated that osteogenesis was still initial in the set-up of simultaneous PDGF-simvastatin release. This might be due to the prolonged expression of PDGF, which might interfere with osteogenic differentiation and potentially inhibit the maturation of bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512445194">Kieswetter <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512445194">Hsieh and Graves, 1998</xref>). Expression of TRAP, a marker of bone resorption to initialize bone remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512445194">Neves <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), was reduced at the front of osteogenesis in the PS group. This also indicated that the parallel release of PDGF with simvastatin potentially interfered with the remodeling of bone. Taken together, without recruiting stem cells, the osteogenic differentiation factor (<italic>i.e.</italic>, simvastatin) induced only scattered osteogenesis in the heat-injured wound. PDGF played a crucial role in cell recruitment but might prevent maturation of newly formed bone. Thus, restricting PDGF expression in early stages was needed. In the combinational PDGF-simvastatin delivery, only sequential PDGF-simvastatin release could further facilitate osteogenesis and bone maturation in the heat-injured osseous wound.</p>
<p>Despite the limitations of this study, we concluded that delivering PDGF or simvastatin might enhance the recovery of heat-induced bone injury encountered during implant site preparation or intramedullary reaming. Sequential release of PDGF-simvastatin could further augment osteogenesis and promote the maturation of bone, thus accelerating the process of osseointegration. Future studies should investigate the long-term effects under relevant clinical conditions and clarify the interaction between the delivered molecules and local cytokines as well as bacterial profiles in heat injury.</p>
