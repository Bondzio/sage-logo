<abstract>
<p>Calcific myonecrosis is a rare late complication of limb trauma characterized by liquefaction and dystrophic calcification of muscles in the single compartment, usually in the leg. This occurs many years after the trauma and is probably due to chronic compartment syndrome. We report 2 cases of calcific myonecrosis involving the anterior compartment of the leg that presented to us in an advanced stage of multiple sinuses discharging calcific material. Incision and drainage had been attempted at a local hospital prior to presentation at our hospital resulting in a non healing wound. Both patients had a history of antecedent trauma to the leg a few years ago. Patients were treated by thorough debridement of the involved muscles in the anterior compartment. Limited access dressing (LAD) was used to manage the dead space left after debridement. After application of the LAD, the wound was covered with split skin grafting. In both patients, healing of the cavity following debridement was facilitated by application of limited access dressing. While the wound completely healed, the disability due to extensive debridement of anterior compartment of the leg persisted. At the latest follow-up, the patients were asymptomatic without any recurrence. Thorough debridement of the compartment involved and application of LAD may be another option of treating calcific myonecrosis of the leg, which was initially considered a “do not touch” lesion. Morbidity due to surgery and need of repeated surgeries for recurrences should be kept in mind and regular follow-up should be considered.</p>

<p>Calcific myonecrosis is a rare late complication following trauma to the limb where a single muscle or muscles in single compartment are replaced by a fusiform mass with central liquefaction and peripheral calcification. Anterior compartment of the leg is known to be affected commonly but the involvements of foot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613479382">1</xref></sup> and upper extremity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734613479382">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734613479382">3</xref></sup> have also been reported. Chronic compartment syndrome, which progresses slowly over a period of many years, is believed to be inciting factor. Although the exact cause is not known, posttraumatic muscle ischemia and cystic degeneration are believed to cause these lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734613479382">4</xref></sup> The resulting mass may expand with time because of recurrent intralesional hemorrhage into the chronic calcified mass.</p>
<p>Treatment is difficult and options range from incision and drainage, repeated aspiration of the lesion, observation of the intact compartment to debridement of the mass, and covering the defect with a muscle flap. We report 2 such cases initially treated outside presented to us in an advanced stage of multiple sinuses in the leg, discharging calcific materials. We also illustrate the use of limited access dressing (LAD) in the management of empty space left after thorough debridement.</p>
<sec id="section1-1534734613479382">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>A 50-year-old man presented to our outpatient department with multiple discharging sinuses over the right leg of 2 weeks’ duration. The patient had noticed swelling and pain over the right leg following an insignificant trauma 3 months ago. This was treated later by incision and drainage in a local hospital, following which he developed multiple discharging sinuses. He had sustained an injury to the same leg 20 years ago, which was treated by native splints and bandages. Following this, he was able to bear weight with pain and limping, which lasted for about a year. The patient was apparently symptom free following this episode except restriction of movements at the ankle. Clinical examination revealed an edematous and shiny right leg with multiple sinuses over the right leg discharging chalky white gritty material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734613479382">Figure 1A</xref>). The distal neurovascular examination was normal. The movements of the right ankle were restricted whereas that of the knee was normal.</p>

<p>Laboratory investigations showed normal hemogram except for erythrocyte sedimentation, rate which was 30 mm/h. Serum calcium, phosphorous, and alkaline phosphatase levels were within normal limits. The patient was found be positive for HBsAg but asymptomatic. X-ray of the right leg with ankle taken 3 months ago before coming to our hospital showed evidence of old malunited fractures of the tibial plateau and medial malleolus. Linear and irregular calcification over the anterolateral part of the whole tibia was also visualized. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed intramuscular collection over anterior aspect of mid-leg communicating with fistulous opening in the skin with linear and irregular calcification over the anterolateral muscular plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734613479382">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734613479382">B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The patient was treated by extensive debridement of anterior compartment of the right leg. Intraoperative findings revealed thickened deep fascia and the entire tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus muscles were necrosed and pale. Chalky white deposits were present throughout the anterior compartment. Erosions were present on the lateral surface of the tibia without intramedullary involvement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734613479382">Figure 1B</xref>). After thorough debridement, the wound was closed with tension sutures with the cavity being kept open. Tension sutures were tightened on alternate days, but removed on the 10th postoperative day because of marginal necrosis of the wound.</p>
<p>As the cavity was persisting, LAD (negative pressure suction dressing) was employed. After washing the wound with saline, it was covered with an ethylene oxide–sterilized plastic bag and suction tube. This was sealed and connected to the ward suction machine (Leonex &amp; Co, Kolkata, India). A negative pressure suction of 125 mm Hg was used intermittently for 4 cycles. Negative pressure was applied for 30 minutes once in 4 hours with the rest period of 3.5 hours. Daily saline wash of the wound was done. Each cycle consisted of 4 days separated by 2 days of suction-free interval. After each cycle, LAD was removed and regular dressing was done. Patient was mobilized with full weight bearing with splints between cycles. At the end of 4 cycles, wound closure was achieved with healthy granulation tissue, over which split skin grafting was done (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534734613479382">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534734613479382">B</xref>).</p>

<p>Histopathological examination revealed areas of amorphous calcification and necrotic areas within the muscle. Pyogenic culture had grown <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> sensitive to cloxacillin.

<title>Case 2</title>
<p>A 55-year-old man presented with wound over the right leg discharging chalky white material of 3 weeks’ duration. The patient sustained minor trauma to the right leg and developed pain and swelling. Incision and drainage was attempted in the local hospital before presenting to our department. Patient sustained right distal femoral fracture with vascular injury 6 years ago and was treated with multiple surgical procedures. Routine laboratory investigations were within normal limits. Linear and irregular calcification in anterior compartment of the leg surrounding areas of liquefactive necrosis of the muscles was detected by the X-ray and MRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1534734613479382">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Aggressive debridement of the anterior compartment of the right leg was undertaken. Intraoperative findings showed thick deep fascia and necrosed tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus muscles with calcific deposits throughout the compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1534734613479382">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1534734613479382">B</xref>). LAD was used as in case 1 for 3 weeks followed by split skin grafting over a healthy granulation tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1534734613479382">Figure 6A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1534734613479382">C</xref>). Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen was suggestive of calcific myonecrosis. Culture did not grow any organism. The patient was put on broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics for 3 days. At the last follow-up of 18months, the lesion has completely healed with no recurrence. Written informed consent was obtained from both the patients in our study.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Calcific myonecrosis is a very rare complication of limb trauma. Calcific myonecrosis was initially described by Gallie and Thomson in 1960.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734613479382">5</xref></sup> Liquefaction and calcification are rare late posttraumatic complications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734613479382">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734613479382">6</xref></sup> that occur commonly in the fifth decade.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734613479382">6</xref></sup> Nearly 40 cases have been reported in the English literature. Trauma predating myonecrosis by many years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734613479382">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734613479382">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734613479382"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734613479382">9</xref></sup> history of ischemia, compartment syndrome, or neurovascular sequelae,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734613479382">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734613479382">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734613479382">10</xref></sup> and gradual progression are consistent features of calcific myonecrosis. The common peroneal nerve is the most common peripheral nerve injury associated with calcific myonecrosis. Muscles supplied by the common peroneal nerve are most commonly involved, that is, anterior and peroneal compartments of the leg, followed by the deep posterior compartment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734613479382">11</xref></sup> Lesions in the upper limb have also been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734613479382">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The exact mechanism involved in the development of calcific myonecrosis is unclear, but compartment syndrome and ischemia are believed to play a role. Initial compartment syndrome causing necrosis of the muscles appears to be the initiating factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734613479382">6</xref></sup> Repeated intralesional hemorrhage causes the mass to enlarge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734613479382">11</xref></sup> Late focal enlargement of the mass may be due to herniation through muscle fascia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734613479382">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Radiographs typically show a fusiform mass with peripherally oriented plaque-like amorphous calcifications. The calcifications are usually linear in orientation and are within the entire muscle or compartment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734613479382">6</xref></sup> MRI shows well-circumscribed mass with heterogeneous signal on T2-weighted sequences and a homogeneous intermediate signal throughout the central fluid region on T1-weighted images. The liquid center has a high signal on T2-weighted sequences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734613479382">11</xref></sup> Radiological differential diagnoses are myositis ossificans, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, calcification of hematoma, and calcified soft tissue neoplasms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613479382">1</xref></sup> Myositis ossificans can be differentiated by its characteristic zonations wherein calcification begins peripherally and progresses centrally, which completes by 6 weeks’ duration. Although chronic hematoma mimics a similar picture, involvement of the entire muscle mass has not been reported. Soft tissue tumors are more aggressive showing non peripheral calcification and does not confine to the single mass. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are systemic diseases causing subcutaneous calcification. Larger calcifications are seen in the intramuscular plane. Localized involvement of single muscle or muscles in the single compartment differentiates calcific myonecrosis from these systemic disorders of connective tissue. Microscopically, it appears as amorphous peripheral calcification with granular inflammatory cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734613479382">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Treatment is difficult and surgical intervention is associated with a high rate of complication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734613479382">11</xref></sup> Treatment options include conservative management in asymptomatic patients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613479382">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734613479382">6</xref></sup> repeated aspiration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734613479382">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734613479382">12</xref></sup> aggressive debridement, and soft tissue coverage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734613479382">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734613479382">12</xref></sup> Primary closure of the wound may be considered in all possible cases followed by application of compressive dressing. In case primary closure is not possible, empty space can be filled with viable tibial muscle or rectus abdominis muscle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734613479382">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734613479382">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Both our patients had history of trivial inciting trauma to the leg before presenting to us whereas the second patient had vascular injury during initial trauma. The presence of ischemia of the extremity in both the cases associated with chronic compartment syndrome might have led to the development of myonecrosis. Both patients were symptomatic after trivial trauma. This suggests that the trauma could trigger symptoms in the presence of calcific myonecrosis. Probably a fresh bleed or herniation through muscle fascia could be the underlying cause. The dystrophic calcification observed in our patients could be due to trauma itself. But the presence of thickened and tight deep fascia suggests that the myonecrosis was probably due to chronic compartment syndrome. Dystrophic calcification can develop in the metabolically impaired or dead tissue in the presence of normal serum calcium and phosphate levels.</p>
<p>In both our cases, incision and drainage was attempted at a local hospital, which resulted in chronic discharging sinus. This could have led to secondary infection of the wound. So it would be ideal to do imaging studies such as MRI to find the extent of involvement and to approach the patient with thorough debridement and soft tissue coverage of the wound in the first place itself. In both our cases, aggressive debridement of the lesion was done in an effort to achieve complete removal of the abnormal tissue. As the cavity was persisting, LAD was applied and intermittent suction dressing was done followed by wound closure by means of split skin graft.</p>
<p>Limited access dressing involves application of topical negative pressure to the wound after initial wound debridement. This is accomplished by covering the wound in a sterile polyethylene bag that is connected to a suction apparatus through tubing. Negative pressure applied for 30 minutes once in 4 hours with a pressure of 80 to 125 mm Hg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734613479382">14</xref></sup> LAD combines the principles of moist wound healing and topical negative pressure therapy. The moist environment provides protection to exposed structures such as bone, tendon, and neurovascular bundles from desiccation. Negative pressure acts by removing excess of interstitial fluid from wound thereby reducing bacterial proliferation and wound infection. LAD facilitates wound healing by accelerating granulation tissue formation by increasing blood flow to the area adjacent to the wound. LAD does not require change of dressing as in negative pressure therapy where sponge or gauge is used and needs to be changed once every 2 to 3 days. The leeching effect of LAD effectively controls infection, reduces edema, and promotes earlier physiotherapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734613479382">15</xref></sup> As described by Kumar and Sharma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734613479382">15</xref></sup> we have not performed repeated debridement of the wound in our cases. LAD also reduced the number of debridement, anesthetic requirements, and provided faster wound coverage.</p>
<p>We partially agree with O’Dwyer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734613479382">7</xref></sup> that calcific myonecrosis should be considered as a “do not touch” lesion. We also feel that biopsy should not be attempted without proper evaluation because it leads to devastating results as seen in our cases. Development of secondary infection after biopsy resulting in chronic discharging sinus has been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613479382">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734613479382">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734613479382">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734613479382">10</xref></sup> Amputation following secondary infection of calcific myositis has also been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734613479382">10</xref></sup> However, if the patient demands surgery, extensive debridement of the calcific myonecrosis and coverage of the defect should be considered.</p>
<p>Limited access dressing used in our cases appears to be well tolerated by our patients and can be used as an alternative to other soft tissue covering procedures to fill the wound cavity. Thorough debridement of the compartment involved and application of LAD may be another option of treating calcific myonecrosis of the leg, which was initially considered to be a “do not touch” lesion. Morbidity due to surgery and need of repeated surgeries for recurrences should be kept in mind and regular follow-up should be considered.</p>
