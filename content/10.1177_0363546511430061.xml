<p><bold>Dear Editor:</bold></p>
<p>We read with great interest the article by Naal et al titled “Surgical Hip Dislocation for the Treatment of Femoroacetabular Impingement in High-Level Athletes.”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511430061">5</xref></sup> In this article, the authors describe return to play and midterm follow-up of a cohort of high-level athletes after undergoing surgical hip dislocation for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). We commend the authors for critically evaluating the outcome of surgical hip dislocation in their high-level athletes. We also agree that this represents a unique patient population that is highly motivated to return to full sporting activity and is unlikely to be able to maintain performance at this elite level if significant symptoms persist. We do, however, have several concerns we would like the authors to comment on.</p>
<p>Both open and arthroscopic management of FAI have been reported to result in significant pain and functional improvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546511430061">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546511430061">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511430061">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546511430061">7</xref></sup> As the authors correctly point out, arthroscopic surgery has not yet been established as a superior surgical treatment because prospective, randomized studies directly comparing the 2 techniques do not exist to our knowledge. However, we believe arthroscopic surgery does have several potential advantages when performed by skilled arthroscopic hip surgeons.</p>
<p>While the authors report no complications in this series of patients, nonunion or malunion of the trochanteric osteotomy is a well-described risk inherent to surgical hip dislocation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546511430061">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546511430061">10</xref></sup> Moreover, rehabilitation protocols are frequently designed to limit abductor strengthening in this setting to protect the osteotomy while healing occurs. Our experience is that abductor strength is critical to hip function and delaying its rehabilitation slows the return to sports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546511430061">8</xref></sup> Additionally, the need to remove hardware used to secure the trochanteric osteotomy (20% in this series) is minimized by the authors in this series. While it may not represent a complication of surgery, it can delay the return to sports and carries some magnitude of additional cost and inconvenience for professional athletes. Each of these drawbacks can be avoided using arthroscopic techniques.</p>
<p>The authors also conclude that speculation suggesting surgical hip dislocation might interfere with the full return to professional sports is unfounded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546511430061">5</xref></sup> To make this conclusion, a comparison is made with a series published from our institution of 45 professional athletes treated arthroscopically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546511430061">6</xref></sup> It was not noted, however, that 47% (21/45) of this cohort required a microfracture procedure, whereas microfracture was required in only 26.7% (8/30) of the current study. Therefore, it may not be reasonable to compare the return to sport rates of these cohorts simply because of the difference in articular injury magnitude. Furthermore, the authors report outcomes were comparable with those of Bizzini et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546511430061">1</xref></sup> after surgical hip dislocation. It should be noted, however, that while all were able to return to sports in this article, only 60% (3/5) were able to return to their previous (national level) level of sport.</p>
<p>Perhaps a more applicable comparison could be made with a series of 28 National Hockey League (NHL) players treated arthroscopically for FAI reported from our institution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546511430061">9</xref></sup> In this series, all athletes were able to return to the NHL at an average of 3.8 months and demonstrated a significant improvement between preoperative and postoperative modified Harris Hip Scores. The average patient satisfaction score for this cohort was 10 (scale range, 0-10), indicating all were very satisfied with their postsurgical outcome.</p>
<p>By contrast, the current series includes a mixed group of high-level athletes including soccer, floorball, table tennis, and hockey. This group was able to return to sports between 4 and 6 months. The time necessary to return to sports is difficult to compare between these studies, however, because the ability to return to professional table tennis or semiprofessional floorball may be dissimilar to the NHL. It is also important to note that while 21 of 22 patients remained professionally active in the reported series, several of these patients returned to a lower competition level or participated in semiprofessional sports.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we agree that a superior technique for the management of FAI in athletes has not been clearly delineated. We do, however, continue to believe that arthroscopic techniques, when performed by experienced surgeons, provide excellent outcomes, accelerate rehabilitation, and eliminate potential complications inherent to surgical hip dislocation. We also believe it remains important to compare similar cohorts of patients as experience increases with each surgical technique.</p>

<p><bold>Authors’ Response:</bold></p>
<p>In their letter, Drs Philippon and Gaskill seem to be making 2 related assertions regarding the open treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) by surgical dislocation. The first is that the arthroscopic method, in the right hands, has “several potential advantages,” and the second is that there remain “potential complications inherent to surgical dislocation.” The letter also points out that our patient groups are dissimilar and suggests that this weakens our conclusions regarding the safety of surgical dislocation.</p>
<p>Our study was not intended to be a comparison with arthroscopic treatment of FAI. As Drs Philippon and Gaskill state, this question can be addressed only by controlled studies of matched patients.</p>
<p>Our study was not intended to be a comparison with arthroscopic treatment of FAI. As Drs Philippon and Gaskill state, this question can be addressed only by controlled studies of matched patients.</p>
<p>We are aware that open surgery is viewed by them as traumatic and more prone to complications when compared with hip arthroscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511430061">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511430061">11</xref></sup> Their contentions that the arthroscopic approach is “less invasive”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546511430061">11</xref></sup> and has “less postoperative morbidity”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546511430061">10</xref></sup> and that the risk of malunion/nonunion of the trochanteric osteotomy is an “inherent” part of the open procedure are serious, and this is why we addressed the issue in the Discussion section of our article. We stand by our conclusion that the approach is not demonstrably detrimental to the hip. The safety of surgical dislocation, which is apparent in our reports, was recently confirmed in a large multicenter study from the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511430061">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>We do not understand the statement that hip arthroscopy will “eliminate potential complications inherent to surgical dislocation.” Arthroscopy is a different procedure with its own set of complications including compartment syndrome from fluid pressure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546511430061">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546511430061">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546511430061">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546511430061">16</xref></sup> perineal lacerations/necrosis, broken instruments, damage to the articular surfaces, and lesions of the ischial nerve. To date, dislocations,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546511430061">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546511430061">9</xref></sup> neck fractures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546511430061">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546511430061">13</xref></sup> osteonecrosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546511430061">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546511430061">15</xref></sup> and vascular injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546511430061">6</xref></sup> have been reported only with arthroscopy but could complicate either surgery. Others, such as heterotopic bone formation and nerve injuries, are common to both and no less problematic if they occur with one or the other operation. To us, it seems unreasonable to group screw removal with any of these.</p>
<p>We acknowledged the frequent need for screw removal, which can be done under local anesthesia. Perhaps, because of differences in insurance and league schedules, our athletes do not report this as a hardship. We do not consider hardware removal a significant complication because it is expected and does not alter the recovery or result of the operation. We suggest that when procedures are compared, all “complications” should be graded by their true significance, as they were in the report by Sink et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546511430061">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>As Drs Philippon and Gaskill infer, the individual surgeon’s skill, training, personal experience, and judgment are critical. For this reason, it makes no sense to compare “potential” complications of surgical dislocation with their personal results with hip arthroscopy.</p>
<p>In this light, we did not have nonunions of the osteotomy. Although nonunion has been considered a risk in surgical dislocations, the reported rate is higher in individuals older than the typical athlete, and many of the reported cases occurred in a small study from Korea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546511430061">18</xref></sup> Furthermore, the senior author has introduced a stepped osteotomy that virtually eliminates nonunion in the FAI patient population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546511430061">3</xref></sup> Our incidence of heterotopic bone formation was minimal, as it is in arthroscopic series when nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) prophylaxis is employed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546511430061">12</xref></sup> But, of course, this is the experience at our institution, and we are not saying that everyone can master this procedure.</p>
<p>It is true that the trochanteric osteotomy done with the stepped osteotomy must be protected for 4 weeks. We doubt, however, whether this period of protection actually makes recovery from surgical dislocation significantly slower than that after arthroscopy. At 5 to 6 weeks, the typical dislocation patient has a supple and pain-free joint. The disciplined athlete will regain reasonable abductor strength in another 6 weeks. After that, the principal variables are conditioning and sports-specific training.</p>
<p>Any advantage for abductor rehabilitation after hip arthroscopy seems modest at best. Side-lying straight-leg raising is usually not begun immediately after arthroscopy but is instead delayed for 10 days to 3 weeks, depending on the hip’s irritability. Unlike the typical open surgery patient, arthroscopy patients often develop iliopsoas irritation, which demands curtailment of active flexion, sometimes for weeks, lest it develop into full-blown tendinitis.</p>
<p>The complications of postoperative femoral neck fracture and hip instability after hip arthroscopy may be rare but are catastrophic. It seems possible that 4 to 6 weeks of protection for the trochanteric osteotomy may also allow time for capsular healing and bone remodeling because these complications have not been reported after surgical dislocation. In our surgical dislocation technique, the capsule is anatomically repaired and requires no special bracing to prevent attenuation in the immediate postoperative period.</p>
<p>As the treatment of FAI has developed, the percentage of patients with labral repairs and microfracture has generally increased. (The incidence of labral repair is a major difference between our older series of hockey players<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546511430061">5</xref></sup> and the current study.) Many arthroscopy centers use extended periods of toe-touch weightbearing in both these circumstances. As with many aspects of hip-preserving surgery, the period of protection ideal for labral and cartilage healing is unknown. The professional hockey players in Drs Philippon and Gaskill’s series used protected weightbearing for 8 weeks after microfracture. As they point out, almost half of the athletes in their initial series underwent microfracture. Therefore, all of these patients were on crutches longer than one would be for an osteotomy.</p>
<p>The article on National Hockey League (NHL) players was published a month after our article was submitted into the review process, and we therefore did not have an opportunity to comment on this impressive series. However, it appears that only 5 of 28 players in this series had microfracture. All had labral repairs, but this was not an indication for partial weightbearing. These factors can explain the accelerated rehabilitation program possible with this group.</p>
<p>Again, we agree that a direct comparison of patients from different centers, who play different sports, and who may have a different spectrum of injury is inappropriate. This is certainly true when considering return-to-play decisions. The fact that NHL players return after an average of 3.9 months could reflect factors other than the surgical approach. Similar to the situation with screw removal, our players may not feel the same pressures to return to full action, especially when the philosophy of their surgeon is basically conservative. For example, we now repair or reconstruct the labrum in most patients with unstable tears and are convinced by the clinical data suggesting that this makes a large difference in ultimate clinical improvement. If labral repair is worthwhile, then healing of that repair is also critical, and no one has proven that early return to full activity is safe in this regard.</p>
<p>We fear that a focus on the superiority of one surgical technique may do unintended harm. First of all, suggesting that a procedure is “traumatic” with “inherent” complications does nothing to encourage a balanced evaluation by other surgeons, patients, and payers. In an ideal world, clinical trials of these procedures should be done side by side, and we should do all we can at this point to maintain objectivity and discourage bias. It may turn out that each procedure has different indications and that centers that treat FAI patients need to accept both in order to provide the best care.</p>
