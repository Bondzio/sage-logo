<abstract>
<p>This article deals with conceptual questions regarding claims to the effect that humans and animals share artistic abilities such as the possession of music. Recent works focusing on animals, from such as Hollis Taylor and Dominique Lestel, are discussed. The attribution of artistic traits in human and animal contexts is examined by highlighting the importance of issues relating to categorization and evaluation in cross-species studies. An analogy between the denial of major attributes to animals and a form of racism is drawn in order to show how questions pertaining to meaning can impact on our understanding of animal abilities. One of the major theses presented is that the question of whether animals possess music cannot be answered by a methodology that is uninformed by the way concepts such as music or art function in the context of human life: the ascription of music to humans or non-humans is a value-laden act rather than a factual issue regarding how to represent an entity. In order to see how humans and animals share a life in common, it is necessary to come to the reflective realization that how human beings understand themselves can impact on their perception and experience of human and non-human animals.</p>

<p>L’article s’intéresse aux problèmes conceptuels que soulève l’afffirmation que les humains et les animaux partagent des capacités artistiques telles la musique. Des travaux récents centrés sur les animaux, tels ceux de Hollis Taylor et de Dominique Lestel, sont étudiés. L’attribution de traits artistiques dans les contextes humain et animal est examinée en mettant l’accent sur l’importance des questions relatives à la catégorisation et à l’évaluation dans les études inter-espèces. Une analogie entre le déni d’attributs majeurs pour les animaux et une forme de racisme est mise en lumière afin de montrer comment les problèmes du domaine du sens peuvent avoir un impact sur notre compréhension des capacités animales. L’une des principales thèses présentées est qu’on ne peut pas répondre à la question de savoir si les animaux possèdent la musique par une méthodologie qui ne prend pas en compte la façon dont les concepts tels que la musique ou l’art fonctionnent dans le contexte de la vie humaine: l’attribution de la musique aux humains ou aux non-humains est un jugement de valeur plutôt qu’une question factuelle quant à la manière de représenter une entité. Dans le but de voir comment les humains et les animaux partagent une vie en commun, il est nécessaire d’en venir à réaliser que la manière dont les êtres humains se comprennent eux-mêmes peut avoir un impact sur leur perception et leur expérience des animaux humains et non-humains.</p>

<p>A recent article in the <italic>Guardian</italic> declares: ‘Elephants are the Barry Whites of the animal kingdom, research has shown. They produce their own version of the legendary soul singer’s seductive bass tones – only much, much deeper’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0539018413477748"><italic>Guardian</italic>, 2012</xref>). Putting aside the highly metaphorical reference to Barry White, it is not entirely clear what kind of research can establish the claim that elephants can sing, not to mention the possession of music. A look at the article from <italic>Science</italic> that is the source of this information reveals that a group of scientists has managed to recreate and observe elephant vocalization through the use of an excised elephant larynx. In the original article, they conclude that ‘the elephant larynx constitutes a vibrating system that behaves in a fashion similar to that known in humans and other mammals, showing that flow-induced vocal fold vibration offers a physiologically and evolutionarily efficient means to produce the very intense low-frequency sounds used in elephant long-distance communication’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0539018413477748">Herbst et al., 2012</xref>: 589). It is notable, however, that no reference has been made to any alleged musical quality of the sound elephants make.</p>
<p>Research findings that show similarities between humans and a non-human species might perhaps excuse the journalist’s over-excitement. Still, the question regarding what is common between humans and non-human animals is important to scientists and non-scientists alike. Without a doubt, scientific notions such as evolution and dominant models of scientistic explanation have influenced our understanding of human and non-human species. In another recent news article, it is claimed that: ‘if you want to hear the clear, piercing voice of a soprano, don’t bother with the opera. Just listen to a gibbon. Giving gibbons helium to breathe and studying its effect on their calls provides evidence that the apes call to each other using similar mechanisms to trained human sopranos’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0539018413477748">Marshall, 2012</xref>). Although one need not find gibbon songs a good substitute for a night at the opera, the comparison between how gibbons sing and how sopranos sing seems to be an integral part of the research conducted by a group of Japanese scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018413477748">Koda et al., 2012</xref>). The need to understand a form of primate vocalization with reference to an age-old singing technique seems to suggest that the boundary between human and non-human is not always sharp and distinct.</p>
<p>This article examines some conceptual issues involved in the attempt to study common characteristics shared by humans and animals. It takes as a premise the idea that music is fundamentally a social concept. This implies that an adequate understanding of music has to take into account the multifarious ways music functions in human societies. In particular, the discussion will highlight the connection between music and the self-conception of human beings, and the way in which values are involved when the decision to classify something as music is called for.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0539018413477748">1</xref></sup> As a starting-point, this article uses the recent study on the Australian pied butcherbird carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018413477748">Hollis Taylor and Dominique Lestel (2011)</xref>. The discussion then moves on to compare the attribution of artistic traits in human and animal contexts with the aim of highlighting the importance of issues of categorization and evaluation in cross-species studies. The attribution to animals of qualities such as intelligence or musicality involves an understanding of the role of such qualities in both the contexts of human life <italic>and</italic> animal life. This indicates that the possibility of recognizing that animals possess a given ability can impact on the way humans perceive themselves. A further implication is entailed as well: an approach that strives for objectivity and holds an aversion to anthropomorphism is incapable of dealing with the question of the presence of important qualities among non-human animals. In addition to the fact that animals and humans inhabit the same physical space, they can also be said to share a life in common through their participation in a <italic>conceptual space</italic> mediated by complex notions such as musicality, art and intelligence.</p>
<sec id="section1-0539018413477748">
<title>Birdsongs and human music</title>
<p>The very term ‘birdsong’ suggests that some species of birds sing, and this is not disputed. Nevertheless, the attribution of ‘music’ to birds is a more controversial matter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0539018413477748">2</xref></sup> In their article ‘The Australian pied butcherbird and the natureculture continuum’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018413477748">Taylor and Lestel (2011)</xref> attempt to demonstrate that there is a lot in common between the birdsongs of the Australian pied butcherbird (<italic>Cracticus nigrogularisi</italic>) and human music. With the aid of recordings, sonographic examination and musical notation, Taylor and Lestel argue that the birdsongs of the Australian pied butcherbird contain elements that are common and essential to human music: in addition to having repeated melodic phrases, it is found that the birdsongs are made up of what are best characterized as moments of variation, improvisation, transposition, fragmentation (cut-and-paste), harmonization, changes in dynamics and so on. Even more remarkable is the observation that the Australian pied butcherbird has the ability to interact with not just their own species but also other natural and human-made sound systems. This signals that Australian pied butcherbirds do not content themselves with ensembles of various sizes, some go beyond their own species and take inspiration from alien sources. The complexity and variety discerned in the birdsongs, Taylor and Lestel argue, cannot be explained in terms of innate abilities alone. Australian pied butcherbirds therefore possess a <italic>culture</italic> in which the way they sing is transmitted and modified across generations. This claim finds further support in the birds’ apparent tendency to engage in ‘practice’ and ‘warming-up’.</p>
<p>Despite a collection of prima facie evidence which shows that the type of birdsongs studied contain various elements of music, Taylor and Lestel appear ambivalent towards the claim that birdsongs should be considered to be a form of <italic>music</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>Eurocentric and anthropocentric musical assumptions and preoccupations have resulted in a paucity of studies of other species’ sonic constructs and concomitant behaviour by musicologists. It is not central to our argument that birdsong, even with its striking commonalities with human music, be considered music, ‘music’, or even proto-music. We feel a strong case can be made for musicologists to participate in birdsong research because of the skills and sensibilities they bring to the tasks at hand, and we believe zoömusicologists will play an increasingly significant role in the analysis of animal song. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018413477748">Taylor &amp; Lestel, 2011</xref>: 78)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Part of this ambivalence can be explained with reference to the very nature of the question. They write:<disp-quote>
<p>Ultimately, the divisive question ‘Is birdsong music?’ is not the only line of questioning that can be pursued. The questions we find compelling are ‘What can musicologists tell us about birdsong?’ and ‘What does birdsong tell us about the human capacity for music?’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018413477748">Taylor &amp; Lestel, 2011</xref>: 78–79)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The desire to avoid the ‘divisive’ question of whether birdsong should be seen as music is understandable: as I try to demonstrate below, to classify something as music is not simply a descriptive act, it can also contain evaluation and value-judgements. To the extent that the ascription of music to something is value-laden, the decision to call something music can easily trigger deep-seated values and emotions.</p>
<p>Taylor and Lestel seem to believe that one can avoid potentially divisive questions related to the notion of music by refocusing on less loaded questions, namely: What can musicologists reveal about birdsongs and what does birdsong tell us about human musicality? While these questions seem perfectly legitimate and worthy of intellectual engagement, the question of whether birdsong <italic>is</italic> a kind of music is never far away. In inviting musicologists to study birdsong, there is the implicit assumption that birdsong is potentially an object of inquiry by musicologists. The inclusion of birdsong in this category contains the implicit assumption that birdsong is to some extent musical in nature, for many entities in the world are excluded from this category. In this way, the presence of pollutants in the oceans is not a topic for musicologists qua musicologists, while compositions inspired by seas and oceans are. The <italic>descriptive</italic> claim that birdsong is an object of inquiry for musicologists functions as an <italic>evaluative</italic> statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0539018413477748">Carroll, 2009</xref>: 93–101). The readiness to describe recorded birdsongs in musical terms such as motifs, ostinatos, chords and so on also betrays the acknowledgement that birdsong is a kind of music. The claim that songbirds possess a culture regarding their practice of singing is another indication that birdsong is musical: since human music is a cultural phenomenon which contains distinct musical cultures within itself, the ability to demonstrate that songbirds exhibit their own birdsong cultures makes the view that birdsong is music more palatable.</p>
<p>From this perspective, it is not surprising that the study of birdsong (and perhaps the possession of music among other non-human animals) can have far-reaching consequences. When birdsong is studied in common musical terms, it can impact on our understanding of music. The awareness that birds possess music, however unspoken it is, can also affect human beings’ self-conception as musical creatures. The commonplace but disputable view that only humans possess music is not only a description of ourselves, it is also a means for human beings to define themselves. By contrast, the realization that, in addition to human beings, some other creatures could be classified as ‘featherless bipeds’ is not going to challenge our identity. For, being ‘featherless bipeds’ seems to be an incidental, rather than essential quality to what it means to be human. To the extent that being musical is seen to be closer to an essential quality of being human, the claim that songbirds are musical can sound radical. As Taylor and Lestel acknowledge in their paper:<disp-quote>
<p>Birdsong may be relevant to inquiries into a range of issues on the natureculture continuum, including memory; music cognition, perception, and auditory processing; music’s evolutionary origins and biological basis; the search for universals; and the comparison of the faculties of music and language. <italic>The study of birdsong could give us alternative models to reconceptualise music and even language</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018413477748">Taylor &amp; Lestel, 2011</xref>: 78; emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Radical consequences that follow from an alternative model of music which firmly accepts the contribution of birdsong are not difficult to find. Having participated in making (improvising) music with actual songbirds, David Rothenberg makes the following remark:<disp-quote>
<p>After playing with the birds, Pestel and I went to a jazz concert, a hip group from New York. They were good, going through all the changes, the usual moves. But we didn’t hear anything we didn’t expect. ‘These guys are good,’ we agreed. ‘But they’re not birds,’ added Pestel. ‘What they do just doesn’t seem … necessary.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0539018413477748">Rothenberg, 2003</xref>: 124)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0539018413477748">3</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One conclusion can be drawn from the above discussion. If birdsong or any other musical practice among non-human species is studied <italic>as</italic> music, as opposed to being a form of mating behavior or other survival strategies, one must take into consideration characteristics internal to music and other cultural connotations associated with music in the context of human life. While this observation may appear tautological, it carries the important implication that an approach that takes an ‘objective’ detached perspective on birdsong or other phenomena is bound to be inadequate. Music, whether it is practiced by human beings or birds, demands some level of participation. To understand music implies the ability to perceive objects and phenomena from a musical perspective. For example, to hear a sequence of notes as a musical phrase is not simply a mechanical process: it requires a form of <italic>judgment</italic>. At the same time, one has to form some idea as to what are <italic>excluded</italic> as musical phrases, and be equipped with an understanding of what amounts to paradigmatic cases of musical expression in human societies. This explains why a study of elephant vocalization that does not employ musical concepts can never reveal anything musical about elephant songs. Once it is acknowledged that music is a social concept, studies that focus on musical phenomena among humans or non-human animals will be complicated by other social concepts associated with music. It is therefore easy to see that claims to the effect that animals possess language, reason or morality have to be grounded in a sound understanding of <italic>what it means</italic> to possess language, reason or morality. In other words, a proper study of language, reason or morality in human or non-human contexts requires the utilization of one’s understanding of such notions (however rudimentary or unsophisticated); they cannot be substituted by or reduced to other notions. As there is no independent, observable basis to ascertain the possession of music on the part of animals, the study of birdsongs as a musical phenomenon has to rely on existing human musical concepts: how one understands human music determines one’s view on bird music.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0539018413477748">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Taylor and Lestel rightly point out that, while biologists or ethologists can bring in their own expertise in their study of birdsong, musicologists can also participate in this area and offer their contribution. While this scenario seems inevitable, it creates some uneasy feelings: are biologists, ethologists or musicologists simply looking for <italic>what they want to find</italic> in the object of their study? As Mary Midgley observes, since the theory of evolution has gained wide currency, studies on animals seem to have a default mechanism to ascribe some survival value to their behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0539018413477748">Midgley, 1995</xref>: xx). There seems to be the danger that the inquirers, who have their own theoretical and conceptual apparatus, are simply approaching their objects of research through the same theoretical and conceptual apparatus. In the cases of studies on animals where notions such as music, language or morality are involved, it seems more difficult to avoid this danger. For, there seems to be no alternative other than simply employing one’s existing understanding of music, language or morality when one is conducting research. The aversion to bringing one’s own ‘subjective’ understanding or concepts into research has no doubt given rise to reductionism, wherein a complex entity is reduced to its simpler component parts. But as the above discussion suggests, the attempt to reduce notions such as music to something else (free from the human, ‘subjective’ elements) offers us little hope.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0539018413477748">
<title>Animal–human differences compared with racism</title>
<p>Some conceptual work regarding what it means to attribute music to animals is needed here. The denial of music (or other similar attributes) to animals has its parallels in the denial of major attributes to human beings in various contexts. The examples are numerous. Non-Western art and music have been seen as ‘primitive’ or simply attenuated in some way. Philosophy, one of the human activities par excellence, was once considered <italic>unique</italic> to Western civilization: while it is said to have originated in Ancient Greece, other civilizations such as those of the Egyptians and the Chinese possessed only ‘religion’ or ‘ethics’. Women and other ‘races’ of the human population were also thought to have suffered from a lack of ‘reason’. Even in the context of language, not all human languages are considered equal: this has been shown by the equation of not being able to speak Greek with being barbarous.</p>
<p>Attempts to set human beings apart through denial can proceed in an unexpected manner. Take the example of the documentary <italic>Whose Is This Song?</italic> (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.der.org/films/whose-is-this-song.html">www.der.org/films/whose-is-this-song.html</ext-link>). In her quest to track down the origin of a song (i.e. a tune) which can be found across a number of Balkan countries including Turkey, Greece, Macedonia and Bulgaria, director Adela Peeva eventually finds out that although <italic>the same tune</italic> is actually shared by different nationalities across borders, each nationality claims the tune as their own, refusing to acknowledge any claim to the tune’s foreign origin. This curious case shows that the apparently simple fact of a common possession can take on a very different meaning once it enters the human world. In fact, the possession of a <italic>common</italic> tune can fuel the intense desire to assert one’s <italic>differences</italic> from others.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that this far from generous tendency can be found among human beings, the fact that birdsong has been denied the status of music should come as no surprise. If the denial of important attributes to animals bears resemblance to the denial of important attributes to humans, then we may learn something significant if we can grasp the nature of denying attributes to humans.</p>
<p>In what follows, I discuss a form of racism identified by the philosopher Raimond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0539018413477748">Gaita (2003)</xref>. If this particular form of racism bears structural similarities to the human tendency to deny animals qualities such as musicality and intelligence, it can enable us to understand our relationship with animals from an alternative perspective.</p>
<p>While racism can be expressed in ways that range from bigotry and prejudice to murder and genocide, it is noteworthy that not all forms of racism involve overt actions. Gaita identifies a form of racism that can be characterized as a form of ‘meaning-blindness’. He writes: ‘I knew a woman when she was grieving over her recently dead son. She said of Vietnamese mothers she saw on television grieving over their children, killed by American bombing, “It’s different for them, they can just have more”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0539018413477748">Gaita, 2003</xref>: 167; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0539018413477748">Gaita, 2000</xref>: 57–72). This woman, whom Gaita called ‘M’, can acknowledge the fact that a group of human beings (or a ‘race’) can suffer misfortune. However, despite the reality of their suffering, the <italic>meaning</italic> of their suffering to this group and to M herself is different. So, while both M and this group of people may suffer due to the loss of a child, M perceives that her own suffering is more real, while the mother from this group can simply have another child and forget the loss. Gaita emphasizes that it is perfectly conceivable that M can accept that this group of people are similar to her own group in many ways: M can believe that they are intelligent, rational, emotional and vulnerable to disasters. In other words, concerning the general <italic>fact</italic> of whether the group of people possesses qualities typically found among human beings, M’s opinion is no different from that of other human beings. Gaita believes that this shows how racism need not always be the product of some factual or empirical error, because the example of M indicates that a racist attitude may lie in the flaw of failing to see how <italic>meaning</italic> surfaces in human life.</p>
<p>If someone like M can fail by refusing to acknowledge a ‘common humanity’ shared between themselves and the debased group, it seems equally possible for a human being to accept that there are musical elements and characteristics in birdsong while at the same time denying that birdsong should be considered as music. This attitude could be illustrated as follows: while songbirds ‘improvise’ and ‘compose’ songs, human beings improvise and compose songs. In the case of both M and the denial of music to songbirds, the attitude need not hinge on any fact grounded in science or an empirical approach: the disagreement lies not in facts but in meaning.</p>
<p>An obvious disanalogy between the case of M and the denial of music to birdsong seems significant. Although we have some reason to say that M’s attitude towards the group of humans seems to be morally flawed, it is not clear whether there is any failing, moral or otherwise, in the case where birdsong is denied the status of music. One may say that the failure to see birdsong <italic>as</italic> music is a form of meaning-blindness. However, it can also be said with some force that to see birdsong as music actually signals an inability to discern the <italic>difference</italic> between birdsong and human music. Either way, it appears that nothing of great ethical significance seems to depend on the claim that birdsong is a form of music. What is even more significant is that there seems to be no empirical fact (the kind produced by natural scientists) that can help one to decide whether birdsong is music or not. The question here seems to be one of meaning.</p>
<p>Conceding that the question we are facing pertains to meaning need not lead to the conclusion that it is necessarily less important. Gaita has used numerous examples to demonstrate how issues of meaning can throw light on what it is to live a human life. He believes that, by avoiding the conflation of issues of facts with issues of meaning, we may be able to understand the basic form and shape of human existence from a conceptual space appropriate to their study. Consider his example of washing a spider down the sink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0539018413477748">Gaita, 2003</xref>: 117–139). If a person is reproached for being cruel when washing a spider down the drain, what can she say in reply? A number of people may say that she could point out that a spider is merely a ‘mechanical’ being with limited sensation and certainly no self-awareness. With this claim she can then defend herself by arguing that washing the spider away does not really matter because the likelihood of it suffering is slim. This direction of response will no doubt raise the question of whether spiders are creatures which can feel pain and suffer; and this will probably create the feeling that the answer ultimately lies in some form of scientific inquiry which can settle the question as to whether spiders have sensations.</p>
<p>Gaita has his own alternative response to this sort of scenario. He points out that it is not necessarily the case that the alleged wrongness of washing the spider down the sink has to be based on some empirical fact. Instead, he draws attention to our <italic>imaginative</italic> ability to see the spider (or other creatures) as beings that ‘have a life’ and are vulnerable to misfortune. From this perspective, the possibility of discerning the cruelty of the act is dependent on one’s imaginative understanding of what it means to be a vulnerable creature. What is noteworthy here is that vulnerability and susceptibility to misfortune are not qualities that can be discovered with references to ‘facts’: they are concepts internal to a <italic>perspective</italic> on life wherein notions such as struggle, harm and loss figure in a prominent way. If a person cannot perceive that a spider is losing its life when it is washed down the sink, the scientific claim to the effect that spiders can feel pain can only add mystery to the situation. To Gaita, the ability to understand the meaning of an act requires ‘a rich conception of the surface’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0539018413477748">Gaita, 2003</xref>: 126–127). In opposition to the scientific mentality, which tends to uncover deep causal mechanisms, ‘a rich conception of the surface’ is an exercise of the imagination wherein meaning emerges from what can be discerned immediately. Gaita’s position echoes Wittgenstein’s remark that what is ‘hidden’ is of no concern to human beings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0539018413477748">5</xref></sup> In what follows, I try to recover the meaning of music in the context of human life by recalling some important roles of music. There is the paradoxical possibility that, since music performs certain roles for us continuously, human beings may lose sight of them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0539018413477748">
<title>Music, meaning and identity</title>
<p>With this emphasis on meaning and surface in mind, we may reassess the claim that birdsong is a form of music. Needless to say, we ought to resist the idea that only some kind of empirical findings can help us decide whether birdsong is a form of music. Instead, we should examine the question by focusing on the meaning of music in human life.</p>
<p>In addition to being a term that <italic>refers</italic> to musical works and practice, it is necessary to remind ourselves that the term ‘music’ can have an honorific sense (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0539018413477748">New, 1999</xref>: 3–5). This means that when one applies the word ‘music’ to objects or practices, it can certainly be seen as a neutral act of classifying entities. In addition, this term can also function in an evaluative sense: the acknowledgement that a work or a practice is considered to be music carries the implication that it is something of value. In this sense, evaluation is already involved in applying the label ‘music’ to something. One may therefore say that students of music and amateurs make ‘music’, while great musicians create music (in the honorific sense). This aspect regarding the usage of the term can be overlooked under the dominant view that ‘subjective’ feeling regarding values should be avoided in public ‘scientific’ discourse regarding a practice. Despite this hesitation to voice value judgments, it is hard to eliminate evaluation in relation to music. Arguably, the selection of works and practices to be studied under the discipline known as music already involves some evaluation. In the context of education and allocating resources for the development of what is considered to be music, it is inevitable to deal with questions of evaluation. A question arises, therefore, as to the implications of accepting birdsong as music: Is this simply an act of description in the neutral sense or does it signify value judgments? As we have seen in the example of Rothenberg above, it is possible to evaluate birdsong against established genres of human music.</p>
<p>Throughout history, human beings have used their rationality, linguistic abilities and cultural achievements to distinguish themselves from the Other. This construction of a separate identity can take place intra-species or be used to reinforce species boundaries. Consider the following view:<disp-quote>
<p>Animals do not have language; and they do not have literature and they do not have art and they do not have music; and there is not much point in raising questions of moral praise or blame in connection with them. Take away these things, and you take away what we mean by ‘human life’ altogether. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0539018413477748">Pianalto, 2011</xref>: 289; citing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0539018413477748">Rhees, 1999</xref>: 194)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Taken in a literal way, this passage could be seen as a statement concerning the fact that animals lack certain abilities that are essential to human beings. As a statement of fact, one could expect that empirical findings should have the potential to lead to revision of such a fact. The discovery that at least some animals possess language or music would therefore cast doubt on the view that ‘animals do not have language …’. However, this literal way of looking at the claim is not the only possibility. This apparent statement regarding animal abilities can also express what are considered to be important <italic>human</italic> characteristics, with the implication that the absence of such characteristics <italic>in the context of a human life</italic> would make such a life unrecognizable. The alternative reading here suggests that the passage functions as a (partial) <italic>definition</italic> of human life. Although this definition employs ideas related to animals, its status as a definition need not hinge on the alleged truth that animals lack language, literature and so on. For, in the face of contradictory empirical findings to the effect that animals do possess language or art, it is always possible to hold on to the definition by making ad hoc qualifications on the extent to which animals can be adequately seen as possessing language. So, in response to conflicting evidence, one may insist that animals possess language or art only in an attenuated sense. This kind of move suggests that what is really at issue is the self-conception of human beings: empirical findings regarding animal abilities are of secondary importance.</p>
<p>In this context we can see that the way human beings perceive language, music or art can matter to their self-conception and their sense of identity. This self-conception or identity is not merely a facade imposed on or adopted by human beings, it can actually give meaning and purpose to a human life. How human beings see themselves helps them to answer the question ‘Who am I?’ And a sense of who one is can position one in a narrative context. In other words, the kind of being one identifies oneself with suggests what one should do and hence gives a sense of purpose. The loss of an identity would therefore undermine one’s sense of what is meaningful and of importance. It comes as no surprise to see that the readiness to see oneself as a mere object in the universe, for example, has the most likely outcome of creating a nihilistic worldview.</p>

<title>The challenge to the human concept of art</title>
<p>The above discussion suggests that the willingness to apply human concepts to animals will depend to a large extent on how such concepts function in the context of human life. In this section, I look at how the concept of art fares when it is used in the disputed context that involves non-human animals.</p>
<p>Since scientific research on primates such as chimpanzees began, there have been attempts to ‘teach’ human languages and other skills to them. These kinds of projects have their root in the recognition of a human–animal continuum, and are an indirect consequence of the theory of evolution. If it is true that human beings maintain their identity through some distinctions between themselves and non-human animals, research that attempts to find commonalities between humans and animals will predictably generate uneasy feelings around the self-conception of human beings.</p>
<p>The case of the possession of art by animals is no exception. Erica Fudge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0539018413477748">2002</xref>: 113–158) discusses scientific studies on the chimpanzee’s ability to create ‘art’ or ‘paintings’. Although such studies did not manage to produce chimpanzee artists able to create artworks that are indistinguishable from existing artworks created by human beings, it is still possible for such research to impact on our understanding of art and what it is to be human. The most important point concerns the interpretation of chimpanzee paintings. Two tendencies can be detected here. On the one hand, some interpret the paintings of chimpanzees as proto-art: chimpanzees are at the stage where they ‘struggle’ to create what can be seen as real paintings. On the other hand, it seems possible to acknowledge in a straightforward way that chimpanzee paintings <italic>are</italic> works of art. Due to the fact that the concept of art is one of the most fluid and controversial in human culture, it seems that there is little chance of any objective and indisputable definition emerging. In this situation, human beings who care to think about chimpanzee art are caught in a dilemma. If chimpanzee paintings are seen as works of art only in an attenuated sense, the charge of speciesism seems likely. If chimpanzee paintings are accepted as art, this can also lead to some conceptual challenges. Fudge reports:<disp-quote>
<p>If a human work of art ‘is a thing created by a process whose aim is to confer on it a special aesthetic presence’, then monkey painting is somewhat different. Lenain writes, ‘it is not aimed at creating a tangible object that will have a continuing visible presence after the act of producing is over. Monkeys are totally indifferent to their paintings the moment they are finished.’ Later in his study Lenain argues that ‘monkey art is primarily an aspect of play. It provides a classic example of those activities termed by Desmond Morris as “self-gratifying”, and characterized by being triggered without any very definite stimulus and ceasing without the achievement of any particular goal (beyond the play activity itself).’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0539018413477748">Fudge, 2002</xref>: 155)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Putting aside the question of how to decide which particular ways of understanding chimpanzee paintings are more defensible, the association of artistic concepts with chimpanzee paintings alone generates a number of puzzles. If one is prepared to accept the view that their paintings are predominantly a form of play, there is little chance for chimpanzee paintings to be viewed on a par with human works of art, which are created as objects for aesthetic contemplation. The alternative idea that chimpanzee art is on the threshold of becoming art proper does not fare much better. This process of becoming seems to presuppose <italic>some</italic> level of conscious effort: if chimpanzees do not display their agency in the creation of their paintings, one may need to admit that chimpanzee painting, as an activity, is no more than an experiment imposed on the chimpanzees by human beings.</p>
<p>Misgivings about attributing the term ‘art’ to the creations of animals are conceptually related to a number of ideas integral to our practice of evaluation. To say that an act or a work succeeds in qualifying as something of value presupposes the presence of a purpose. For example, since it wasn’t Mozart’s purpose to further rocket science through creating musical works, it does not make sense to say that Mozart failed as a rocket scientist. The notion of purpose itself implies the ability to make choices: one can be said to have failed or succeeded only if one chooses to become part of the process that leads to success or failure. The crux of the matter lies in the claim of whether choice surfaces in the lives of animals. Consider the following claims:<disp-quote>
<p>‘He was faced with a very difficult choice.’ That is something you never would say of an animal. Neither would you say that the animal showed weakness or strength in making a choice … We might say that an animal’s life does not go one way rather than another. It just goes on. (The animal may be comfortable or uncomfortable. It may suffer much or little. But you cannot talk of a direction, because you cannot talk of goals, or of success or failure, in its life, or of progress or degeneration.). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0539018413477748">Pianalto, 2011</xref>: 289; citing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0539018413477748">Rhees, 1999</xref>: 167–168)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0539018413477748">6</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In response to the above claims, one may insist that an animal’s life can have a direction and that they have their own goals in life. One may say that an animal’s direction in life has changed ‘for the better’ or an animal’s well-being amounts to its goal in life. While these can be apt characterizations of an animal’s life, it does not seem to be Rhees’s intention to deny them to animals. Perhaps what Rhees has in mind is the kind of choice a human being makes when facing a moral dilemma or when far-reaching consequences are at stake: like the war-time decision of whether to use an atomic bomb or not. My claim here is this: Given that moral concepts are involved in a decision and to the extent that moral concepts are not fully grasped by animals, animals cannot be said to be facing a difficult choice in the same way that a human being might. Note that this is not meant to be a claim to the effect that there is any <italic>lack</italic> or <italic>deficiency</italic> on the part of animals: the fact that animals do not face difficult choices is a <italic>conceptual</italic> consequence that follows from the meaning that emerges from the interplay between agency, knowledge, decision and consequence. To argue that, due to their inability to partake in moral decisions, animals are therefore morally inferior or less worthy of humane treatment is a conceptual confusion. Consider this: ‘having interior angles that add up to 180 degrees’ is a quality of the triangle that is conceptually inseparable from it; the mere fact that a fish or a human being lacks this quality indicates nothing about the ethical treatment of fish or human beings.</p>
<p>Difficulties involved in applying the term ‘art’ to animals can also be understood from a cultural viewpoint, and this pertains to the uncertainty involved in categorizing chimpanzee paintings or ‘art’. Although the human concept of art has undergone radical transformation in the past decades, it is noteworthy that categorization of entities into ‘art’ and ‘non-art’ is always done in a particular context. From this perspective, radical works such as Duchamp’s <italic>Fountain</italic> and Cage’s <italic>4’33”</italic> are never created or received in a cultural vacuum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0539018413477748">Carroll, 2009</xref>: 95–96). Despite the challenges they posed to the art establishment, they are the products of human beings who are part of an artistic culture, no matter how eager they are in their wish to break away from it. The case of chimpanzee painting poses a challenge to the way humans think about art <italic>not</italic> because of any inherent defect in the paintings qua object. The reluctance or uncertainty as to whether to ascribe the status of ‘art’ to such paintings results from the absence of an artistic culture wherein chimpanzee paintings or other forms of animal art are readily incorporated into what is known as art. Interestingly, this kind of tentativeness towards animal art has its parallel in human artistic culture. When new works of art that repudiate established ideals first emerged, there were attempts to resist the inclusion of such works on the part of critics and art-lovers. This peculiar phenomenon regarding human artistic practice should alert to us the fact that what is or isn’t seen as art has a lot to do with what kind of <italic>relationship</italic> human beings form with such objects.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0539018413477748">7</xref></sup> This is especially true in what some would call a ‘postmodern’ cultural climate where ready-made objects and performance art have the potential to be seen and appreciated as art.</p>
<p>From this perspective, it remains an open question as to whether chimpanzee paintings or birdsongs should be considered art. While the concept of art with its cultural and historical background may not be readily applicable to the creations of chimpanzees and songbirds, it does not mean that the human concept of art cannot undergo changes to become more inclusive of animal art. For example, one may believe that a work of art has to be made with the intention that it is created for the purpose of aesthetic contemplation. This model of aesthetic disinterestedness could be abandoned, in the same way as the demand that visual works of art have to be representative was given up. The extent to which the concept of art has to be modified in order to include animal art cannot be decided in advance: it is easily conceivable that illuminating ‘criticism’ on animal art and hybrid works of art that take inspiration from the animal world can invite human beings to reconsider what they have known to be art. Ultimately, the <italic>relationship</italic> between humans and animals is not a static one. New insights on animals, whether they come from scientistic research or the humanities, have the potential to open up new routes in our understanding of animals and ourselves.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>In the end, the question of whether animals possess music or art has to be considered with reference to the human concept of music or art. This implies that the question cannot be answered by a methodology uninformed by how concepts such as music or art function in the context of human life. I have tried to highlight that the concept of music inevitably involves evaluative elements: the ascription of music to humans or non-humans is a value-laden act, rather than a neutral choice regarding how to describe an entity. In addition, we need to pay attention to the fact that how human beings perceive music can partially define their very self-conception. The study of animal behavior informed by an artistic or aesthetic sensibility can no doubt cast light on the multi- faceted nature of the behavior itself. For such a project to proceed, it seems necessary to be attentive to how artistic and aesthetic concepts function in the context of human life. The study of animals is therefore a reflective process wherein the self-understanding of human beings operates in an implicit manner that shapes our perception and experience of ourselves and other non-human animals.</p>

<p>In employing the notion of intention as an attempt to define music, Andrew Kania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0539018413477748">2011</xref>: 7) writes: ‘It seems unlikely that even “higher” non-human animals have the capacity for the complex intentions necessary for the production of music. The animals we characterize as “singing” (particularly birds and whales) do not have the capacity to improvise or invent new melodies or rhythms (though they can make mistakes). Despite the name, then, bird and whale “song” should no more count as music than the yowling of cats. We call these displays “song,” of course, because they sound <italic>like</italic> music to us. But sounds can be music-like without being music.’ In response to Kania’s position, two comments can be made: (a) if making a mistake presupposes intention, it remains unclear how the claim that birds and whales can make mistakes can co-exist with their alleged lack of ‘complex intention’; (b) as the recognition that whales can ‘sing’ is a relatively recent discovery, it seems the possibility that whales can also create ‘music’ cannot be ruled out in advance.</p>

<p>The common demand in various forms of scientific inquiry for objectivity, understood as the observational stance which maintains a boundary between the subject and the object observed, can become an obstacle in the study of social concepts where understanding is premised on some level of participation. In addition, one may claim that the kind of attitude the requirement of objectivity invites the observer to adopt is characterized by detachment and impartiality. This carries the implication that the objective stance can actually modify the relationship between the observer and the observed (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0539018413477748">Winch, 1990</xref>).</p>

<p>The fact that entities such as birdsongs or ‘gibbon songs’ can be seen as aesthetic objects for appreciation by human beings may create the illusion that they are objects with ‘aesthetic qualities’ or that they are objects created explicitly for aesthetic appreciation. To avoid this misleading way of speaking, we should remind ourselves of the following: the fact that the creations of animals are appreciated aesthetically by humans signals a change in the <italic>relationship</italic> between such objects and human beings (as cultural creatures). The existence of this relationship need not rest on the objective properties residing in the objects in question. In other words, there is no independent reality that can ground this kind of relationship apart from its being maintained: provided that it is recognized as such, it is self-sustaining. From this perspective, one may compare the relationship between humans and works of art with human relationships such as friendship and the relationship between humans and inanimate objects such as buildings and places (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0539018413477748">Diamond, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0539018413477748">Gaita, 2003</xref>).</p>
