<abstract>
<p>Euthanasia/assisted dying, the desire to hasten death, and religious supportive care at the end of life are controversial issues that have been heavily debated within the academic and medical communities. Little research has been done on hospice patients’ views, despite hospices being political spaces, espousing a range of perspectives on assisted dying, religiosity, and “good deaths.” In this article I document the presence, articulation, and significance of these issues as perceived and experienced by 20 hospice inpatients in the last 4 weeks of their lives. Key themes to emerge included polarization in desire for hastened death and assisted dying in the hospice; the hospice as a morally bound space situated within particular notions of “dying well”; and the divisive character of religion as part of formalized hospice care. Theoretically, the participants’ perspectives on euthanasia/assisted dying and religiosity in the hospice provide a means of unpacking and revealing the moral economy of modern dying practices and the institutional governance and production of “timely deaths.”</p>

<p>Hospices<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1049732311421181">1</xref></sup> are an increasingly prominent space for dying in Australia, and offer a unique form of inpatient rather that at-home end-of-life care. As an institution, the hospice attempts to meet a range of patient needs, including those related to physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. In doing so, the hospice produces and embodies complex dynamics regarding the limits of biomedicine (an inability to cure) and the limits to biomedical intervention (an inability to end life; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311421181">Lloyd-Williams, Wright, Cobb, &amp; Shiels, 2004</xref>). Moreover, hospice care—some would argue inevitably—blurs the line between formalized biomedical expertise and cultural belief systems. That is, whereas palliative medicine is a formal subspecialty of biomedicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311421181">Clark, 2007</xref>), the very nature of hospice care and the dying process lends itself to a more diversified clinical context. Clinicians who might play a (relative) peripheral role in other inpatient health service delivery contexts (i.e., chaplains, psychologists, social workers) come to the fore in the hospice. This diversified site of care, I argue, reveals political positionings and cultural values often concealed in other biomedical contexts; these values are particularly evident within debates about the right to die and life after death.</p>
<p>Euthanasia/assisted dying<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1049732311421181">2</xref></sup> and religiosity are controversial and politically laden issues within the broader community, and within the hospice the emotions surrounding such concepts are even more acute. They are in many respects inseparable, given that existential questions have driven much lobbying against euthanasia/assisted dying (i.e., not “playing God”). Debate has been ongoing in the popular press, the community, and in the academic/medical literature regarding euthanasia/assisted dying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311421181">Givens &amp; Mitchell, 2009</xref>), with high levels of disagreement over its place in modern medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421181">Emanuel, Fairclough, Daniels, &amp; Clarridge, 1996</xref>) or its validity from a human-rights perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311421181">Dowbiggin, 2002</xref>). Hitherto, most academic literature in relation to euthanasia/assisted dying has sought to examine such issues as the possibility of consent, the capacity to choose, changes in views over time, the moralities of care, and medico-legal risk (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311421181">Eliott &amp; Olver, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311421181">Mak &amp; Elwyn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311421181">Mohammed &amp; Peter, 2009</xref>). Few researchers have sought to qualitatively explore terminal patients’ views about euthanasia, assisted dying, and religiosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311421181">Eliott &amp; Olver, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732311421181">Nissim, Gagliese, &amp; Rodin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732311421181">Somerville, 2003</xref>), despite recognition of the need to document patient perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311421181">Mak &amp; Elwyn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311421181">Mak, Elwyn, &amp; Finlay, 2003</xref>) and research with clinicians illustrating the intensity and importance of such issues in patient care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311421181">Denier, Dieckx de Casterlé, De Bal, &amp; Gastmans, 2010</xref>). To my knowledge, no research has until now explored these issues from the perspectives of hospice inpatients.</p>
<p>As such, through the lives of 20 people in the last 4 weeks of life, in this article I explore how institutional values and practices around dying and religiosity resonate and/or conflict with people’s own values. That is, the purpose is not to make an argument as to whether hospices should engage in euthanasia/assisted dying or espouse certain religious values, but rather, from a sociological bent, to explore how a group of hospice patients, at end of life, grapple with such things themselves, including debates regarding modern dying practices, the tensions between belief and technological control and intervention, and individual vs. cultural existential perspectives. Their stories and accounts offer significant insight into these sociocultural processes, but they also pose a range of important sociological questions around the implications of the organizational mediation of dying, the ideological influences on institutionalized care, and the moral framing of dying in the contemporary hospice in Australia.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section2-1049732311421181">
<title>Psychopathologies and the Right to Die</title>
<p>There has been considerable research on end-of-life preferences among different groups of patients (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311421181">Breitbart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311421181">Emanuel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311421181">Johansen, Holen, Kaasa, Loge, &amp; Materstvedt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311421181">Kelly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311421181">Kuuppelomäki, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311421181">Parkinson et al., 2005</xref>), although mostly in community or outpatient settings. Moreover, there is a significant body of literature in the social sciences on euthanasia, desire for hastened death, and assisted suicide (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311421181">Donchin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311421181">Givens &amp; Mitchell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311421181">McPherson, Wilson, &amp; Murray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732311421181">Seale &amp; Addington-Hall, 1994</xref>). A significant proportion of this work has focused on the views of cancer patients who are dying and their perspectives on euthanasia (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311421181">Eliott &amp; Olver, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311421181">2008</xref>) and/or desire for hastened death (e.g., Breitbart et al.). The majority of this work has also been informed by psychosocial or biomedical perspectives, focusing on the roles of depression, grief, and hopelessness as predictors of desire for hastened death (Breitbart et al.). Such work, although important for emphasizing supportive care needs at the end of life, can risk reconstructing and representing individual patient preferences for a hastened death or euthanasia/assisted dying as environmental or as about “better case management” rather than an authentic individual desire for a quicker death. For example, in their article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311421181">Johansen et al. (2005</xref>, p. 454) stated that the wish to die is an “ambivalent and fluctuating mental ‘solution’ for the future,” arguing that health care providers should be “aware of this when responding to utterances regarding euthanasia.” Such assumptions about the psychological underpinnings of euthanasia requests permeate hospice care, as evident in the results presented below. Yet, little qualitative work has been conducted as to hospice inpatients’ experiences of feeling like an end or hastening death.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732311421181">
<title>Autonomy and Moralities</title>
<p>Although I acknowledge here that in some cases desire for hastened death might stem from resolvable psychological issues or gaps in supportive care, it remains a possibility that for others it is a legitimate desire that persists over time. Such debates raise complex issues about individual autonomy and the right of rational, competent adults to make decisions regarding ending their life voluntarily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311421181">Donchin, 2000</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311421181">Dowbiggin, 2002</xref>). Moreover, the possibility of a person as an autonomous decision maker—or whether in fact autonomy is ultimately relationally produced and enacted—remains a debated issue (Donchin). In the context of the hospice—to an even greater extent than in other health contexts—carers, family members, and clinicians all influence and shape the patient’s wants, fears, and hopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421181">Kellehear, 2008</xref>), further problematizing ideas about individual autonomy and agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311421181">Frank, 1997</xref>). Furthermore, discourses around assisted dying and religiosity (see below for further discussion on the latter) reflect the broader moral economy of living and dying in a hospice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311421181">Booth, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311421181">Broom &amp; Cavenagh, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311421181">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311421181">Chattoo &amp; Ahmad, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732311421181">Sivaramakrishnan, 2005</xref>). That is, the saliency of issues surrounding death and dying constitutes the hospice as a key site of moral practice; an intersubjective process involving the production and reconstitution of the “competent social agent” takes place (Chattoo &amp; Ahmad). Moral practice, in this context, denotes ideas about how people should treat others and be treated by them, including, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732311421181">Sayer posited (2005)</xref>, matters of justice and fairness, and relations of recognition, care, and friendship. Such moral codes also produce interpersonal and cultural dynamics around responsibility, gift, and reciprocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311421181">Frank, 1997</xref>), which in turn shape the dying process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311421181">Broom &amp; Cavenagh, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311421181">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The moral underpinnings of cancer and cancer care have been emphasized previously by other authors. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732311421181">Seale (2001)</xref> has argued, the discursive and rhetorical practices often utilized by palliative and hospice care clinicians, carers, and other stakeholders (“be strong” or “fight hard”) morally bind patient choice and desire, producing “good patients” as well as “good deaths” (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311421181">Broom &amp; Cavenagh, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311421181">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311421181">Broom &amp; Tovey, 2008</xref>). Likewise, contemporary Australian hospice care is still largely informed by particular models of “dying well.” The “revivalist” good death, for example, is an agenda within palliative care that espouses being pain free, acceptance, closure, awareness, and individuality, among other things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311421181">Clark, 2002</xref>, p. 907; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311421181">Seale, 1998</xref>). Although such components are not prima facie problematic, their normative and prescriptive potential is worth considering. These models of “dying well” have tended to be driven by academic and clinical perspectives, with little research evidence available on how such ideas resonate with patients’ views (for an exception, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311421181">Gott, Small, Barnes, Payne, &amp; Seamark, 2008</xref>). Such moral codes around dying well intermingle with the politics of euthanasia/assisted dying and the role of religiosity in the hospice.</p>

<sec id="section4-1049732311421181">
<title>Euthanasia/Assisted Dying and the Hospice</title>
<p>Within the inpatient hospice context, wider philosophical debates about rights vs. ethics or psychosocial status vs. autonomy are often implicit and unspoken. In the last few weeks of life within such an organization, patient desire for an end vs. fighting on can be difficult to express given the audience and stakeholders listening to such “talk” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311421181">Breitbart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311421181">Donchin, 2000</xref>). The hospice, as an institution, offers a specific model of managing dying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311421181">Clark, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311421181">James &amp; Field, 1992</xref>); that is, in theory at least, a dying process with as little pain as possible and with various supportive mechanisms to assist in a comfortable death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311421181">Kubler-Ross, 1969</xref>). Yet, what is perceived as the role of hospice by patients and what is actually experienced in hospice might be considerably different. Indeed, euthanasia/assisted suicide operates largely outside the hospice setting (within the community). When entering the hospice, a person is exposed to certain ideological views on dying and institutional practices of “maintaining” life (until a “natural” death) that are often unexpected, and for some, even unwanted. Euthanasia/assisted dying is not considered a part of Australian hospice care and, as shown in other studies of palliative care contexts, staff are often reticent about interventions that are perceived to accelerate death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311421181">Rietjens, Hauser, van der Heide, &amp; Emanuel, 2007</xref>). This brings to the fore the degree to which hospice care is implicated in and inflecting people’s dying processes—particularly for those who seek or even expect an accelerated death. The hospice, I argue below, represents a site of contemporary governance of the “timely death” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311421181">Parry, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311421181">1994</xref>); a manifestation of a broader set of social contracts of rights (i.e., the right to dignity, life, and so forth) the modern nation state is obliged to provide. As we shall see in the following sections, such rights come with responsibilities, allowing certain possibilities and limiting human agency. Furthermore, such hospice values have tended to emerge, at least in part, from Christian religious values, and this history still underpins and informs contemporary hospice care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732311421181">
<title>Religiosity in the Hospice</title>
<p>As suggested above, some hospices in Australia have emerged from and continue to espouse certain religious notions of acceptance and redemption. As such, the Christian underpinnings of elements of hospice care in Australia continue to shape people’s experiences of end-of-life care and, ultimately, much hospice care represents an intimate interplay of medicalization and religiosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311421181">Ardelt &amp; Koenig, 2006</xref>). Although biomedical and nursing technologies and expertise remain at the fore of explicit reasons for entering the hospice, the day-to-day realities of inpatient hospice care involve a multifaceted environment that contains religious undertones around resolution and acceptance. Although patients are not asked to “talk religion,” nor is religion pushed on patients, the types of services offered (i.e., a chaplain and a chapel) provide a certain framing of dying that is situated within, in the case of the hospice examined here, a Catholic tradition. Catholicism has been stridently against euthanasia/assisted dying, perceiving suicide as an unforgivable sin. This has been reflected in regular statements and lobbying from the Vatican. On February 2, 2009, Pope Benedict XVI stated, “Euthanasia is a false solution to the drama of suffering” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311421181">Baklinski, 2009</xref>). Although religion is, no doubt, fundamental to the dying experience for many people (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732311421181">Sulmasy, 2006</xref>), there are debates around religion as coping (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311421181">Exline &amp; Yali, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732311421181">Pargament, Koenig, Tarakeshwar, &amp; Hahn, 2004</xref>) and the pressure/guilt associated with the allure of religiosity at end of life (Exline &amp; Yali). Moreover, in the hospice context, the moral framing of dying, from a religious perspective, might become intertwined with formalized models of dying well, including Kubler-Ross’s stages of grief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311421181">Kubler-Ross, 1969</xref>). Formalized palliative care models of dying well might in fact interplay—perhaps subtly and differentially, depending on the organization—with religious ideas about acceptance, moving on, and dying as a “stage.”</p>
<p>In this article I examine how hospice inpatients themselves reflect on, negotiate, and at times resist the “available resources” for dying in the hospice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1049732311421181">3</xref></sup> This represents not a critique of religious supportive care in the hospice—this is an important facet of hospice care—but an analysis of how patients themselves perceived and managed the pressures, allure, and comforts of particular endings. Religious support within the hospice, I argue, is intimately intertwined with the moral framings of the right to die, constructions of timely deaths, and hospice care belief systems around acceptance and resolution.</p>

<sec id="section6-1049732311421181" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The project was developed to explore people’s experiences of inpatient hospice care. Ethics approval was given by the university with which I am affiliated as well as the ethics committee of the regional health service that oversees the palliative and hospice care program. As part of obtaining ethics approval I, in collaboration with hospice staff, developed a formal protocol for identifying potential interviewees based on willingness and capacity to participate. Potential participants included patients currently enrolled in the inpatient palliative care program at the hospice for at least 10 days who had become stable after admission. Local clinicians were briefed on the study and were asked to identify potential participants. They were asked to consider for inclusion only those patients who were cognitively able (i.e., achieved a score of &gt;23 on the Mini Mental State Examination; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732311421181">Tombaugh &amp; McIntyre, 1992</xref>), without significant pain, and who had been assessed as being capable of giving consent (Tombaugh &amp; McIntyre). If patients expressed interest in participation after being told about the study, a member of the clinical staff provided an information sheet that explained the project in more detail. After approximately 24 hours, a clinical staff member then returned to the patient to answer any additional questions and ascertain whether the patient wished to discuss participation with me, the researcher. I had no involvement in patient care in the hospice and thus was responsible for gaining consent, completing the interviews, and deidentifying the data. It was emphasized (in written and verbal communication) that nonparticipation or withdrawal from the research project would not affect any ongoing clinical relationship with clinical staff.</p>
<p>In total, 28 patients expressed an interest in participating in the study; 3 opted to withdraw once the interview had begun, and 5 others who offered to participate initially were not cognitively able to participate once I arrived. The result was successful completion of 20 in-depth interviews with patients receiving inpatient hospice care; 18 had been admitted for pain and symptom management and end-of-life care, and 2 for respite care. In this context, respite refers to the form of hospice care in which it is not expected the person will die within the following few weeks, despite being “terminal,” but rather their condition is no longer manageable from home. Eleven of the participants were men and 9 were women, and all were Anglo-Australian. All the respondents were interviewed in their own rooms in the hospice unit, for between 20 minutes and 1 hour, depending on the onset of (additional) pain and/or fatigue. The interviews were digitally recorded and subsequently fully transcribed. The interviews were relatively unstructured, exploring patients’ understandings of and beliefs about inpatient hospice care; views on euthanasia, assisted dying, and religiosity within the hospice; and how organizational practices and values frame and shape the dying process.</p>
<p>Interview questions were situated around these themes and extended according to the story of the participant and the nature of the interview dialogue as it progressed. Examples included: What is the role of hospice care at the end of life? What do you believe is the role of spirituality within the hospice? and How do you view the issues around assisting dying now that you are living in a hospice? More often than not, such questions were posed quite naturally within a broader dialogue about living and dying in the hospice. I conducted each of the interviews, and as an experienced qualitative researcher in cancer and end-of-life care settings, this allowed an open and secure conversation about such challenging issues. My separation from the clinical day-to-day operation of the hospice also facilitated an analysis that was sensitive to aspects of their accounts that might question the hospice processes and value systems. In saying this, the focus remained firmly on developing a well-balanced, rounded account that allowed for all voices and positions in these issues to be heard.</p>
<p>There were times during the interviews when participants were emotional, and I ensured that they were able to stop the interview and withdraw from the study. Generally, patients registered on palliative care programs are within months, if not weeks, of death. Extreme care was taken to ensure that collecting data was always secondary to participant well-being, dignity, and comfort. Participants generally fed back through me and hospice staff that participation was not overly burdensome, and was even enjoyable at times. Strategies were put in place to allow me to also debrief as needed.</p>
<sec id="section7-1049732311421181">
<title>Clinical Context</title>
<p>The hospice examined here was established in 1993 and offers a 20-bed inpatient facility for people close to the end of life. It, and the hospital of which it is part, is owned by a Catholic organization that owns and runs hospitals and health care services in several locations throughout Australia. This organization was one of the first Catholic entities established in colonial Australia. It is funded through a combination of private and public funds, with an agreement with the local health authority to deliver certain health services. This funding arrangement gives more control to the organization itself, in terms of trajectory and representation, than in the case of purely state-funded organizations. This history and connectivity to the Catholic Church in all likelihood enhances the organization’s sensitivities toward and willingness to promote specific Christian values around death and dying. In saying this, referrals to the hospice come from throughout the region and the hospice is not promoted as a Christian service, but rather as an end-of-life care service. As such, the following results should be viewed as specific to this hospice, but also touching on important themes likely relevant to other inpatient hospice care facilities in Australia and internationally.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>The process of analysis began during data collection. This provided an opportunity to establish initial themes and then to look for deviant or negative cases, complicating initial observations and retaining the complexity of the data. The approach used was developmental, in that knowledge generated in the early interviews was challenged, compared, and built upon in later ones. The initial approach to analysis involved systematically reading through each interview several times, writing notes, discussing ideas with colleagues, and noting emerging patterns within the data collected. Within this process, the focus was on retaining the complexity of the respondents’ experiences, and documenting atypical cases, conflicts, and contradictions within the data. Following this initial analysis, I looked back through these notes to establish themes emerging across the interviews. Within this process, once a theme had been identified, I searched through the transcripts for other related comments, employing constant comparison to develop or complicate these themes further. This process meant that events that were initially viewed as unrelated could be grouped together as their interconnectedness became apparent. The final step involved revisiting the literature and seeking out conceptual tools that could be used to make sense of the patterns that had emerged from the data.</p>

<title>Euthanasia/Assisted Dying and the Right to Die</title>
<p>The interviews provided the opportunity to discuss with those at the cusp of death issues related to euthanasia and the desire for a hastened death. It is extremely rare to document the perspectives of people within weeks of death. The process of asking such questions was not without its difficulties in the hospice environment, both in terms of staff perspectives and patient sensitivities. The hospice unit was focused on ideas about acceptance and comfort, with no explicit discussion (with me during data collection) or ideological acceptance of accelerating the dying process. Yet, the issue of accelerated death, “helping me along,” or explicit euthanasia, kept emerging in our discussions, and largely without prompting by me. The hospice management would talk about such thought processes in their patients as representing a need for “more counsel” or “support from staff and carers.” Talk of euthanasia and “ending it” was viewed, in my informal conversations with staff, as a cry for help of sorts. Although it is not my aim here to resolve this tension—this was not the purpose of this study—the hospice staff’s broad dismissal of their patients’ desires for accelerated death created a range of moral and ethical tensions that were important to the participants. Each patient, as demonstrated below, had strong feelings about rights and dying, many of which had been enhanced by a disjunction between their expectations and the realities of hospice care:</p>
<list id="list1-1049732311421181" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Participant (P): I think they should have the same system as what the Dutch have, self-euthanasia. I believe in that. I think it should be like, you press a button and you say goodbye.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Interviewer (I): The right to die?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: The right to die. I mean it’s no good having people, it’s no good shooting seven thousand dogs a year, which is what they do in [specific Australian state], and leaving the humans to suffer, you know. That, to me, is not right. That’s what I think anyway.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I: How do you think the hospice [staff] view it?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: I don’t think they think of it. Most of them would just be getting the salary, that’s their main worry, feeding their families. It’s only when you reach the stage that I’m at, that ah, you start thinking about these things. I’m probably a little bit too severe in, when I’m talking about dogs, but it’s only a manner of speech.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Each of the participants held strong perspectives on the prospect of or debates around euthanasia/assisting dying. There was virtually unanimous support for an accelerated death if requested, and this was broadly how euthanasia/assisted dying was construed and articulated in the interviews. Moreover, there was a general view that the hospice was against using technological or pharmaceutical means to accelerate death. This is unsurprising to academic audiences, given the aforementioned philosophy of hospice care and the ideology of acceptance and facilitating “natural” deaths. This was surprising, however, to the majority of the participants. The idea of euthanasia/assisted dying was talked about in highly emotive and passionate terms. As mentioned previously, and in many of the other interviews, the idea of a “natural” ending with closure, acceptance, and dignity did not resonate with their experiences. Though often communicated in guilt-ridden terms (“I suppose I’m being too harsh”), these patients talked about the frustrations of institutionalized dying, the moral frameworks underpinning hospice care, and the ethics of prolonging life (or lack thereof). Being treated “worse than a dog” was a phrase several of the patients used.</p>
<p>One of the participant’s stories illustrated vividly the potential disjunction between institutionalized models of “dying well” and individual desire. He had recently attempted to commit suicide at home and, as a result of being “unsuccessful,” had been brought to the hospice. The staff had told me that he “needed more support to move beyond his negative outlook,” and that it was part of his process:</p>
<list id="list2-1049732311421181" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>I: Well, I always think it’s best to start [the interview] where you think it’s right to start. Where does it start for you?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: When I decided to commit suicide. . . . I had had a heart attack, . . . I was dead in the water. . . . I couldn’t walk and I was weak, and I’ve always been a fairly strong person, you know, able to do things.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I: So you’re losing those core things that you wanted to do?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: Yeah, um. They [the hospital outpatient palliative care unit] gave me this morphine derivative [for pain], so I drank it, in one gulp more or less, and about 150 mils, I thought that would help me along. And I think it was working. I don’t know, I passed out by this stage. One of my neighbors walked in on me, and she didn’t walk away. She rang [telephoned] the bloody ambulance and the doctors, and created a general fuss, and here I am.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I: What you said about palliative care, and helping you die, ’cause I mean, is that something that you would have liked them to do? Um, to help you in that way?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: Oh yeah!</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I: And why do you think they didn’t?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: I don’t, well they’re not allowed to by law to start with, is one of the things. Um, ah, why they didn’t do it? Religion would be one, would be the main one, I should imagine. And just morally that it’s wrong to take a life and so forth. But it’s my decision, and I should have been left alone. I do believe this, and I have lots of friends, who my children said that to: “You should have just left him alone. You go, you wanted to go. You’ve had your life.” I’m eighty-three in nine months.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I: You wanted to go in a painless way?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: Yeah, basically. . . . I don’t really understand what you mean by palliative care, when you, you don’t do anything substantial and so forth, you don’t help people along. ’Cause you can talk to elderly people, which I do ’cause I’m old, and they talk to you, and 95 to 97 percent of them agree that we should be able to go when we want to. The law should be changed.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The above exchange resonates with several of the participants’ experiences of managing and at times resisting hospice models of dying well. Although several were extremely focused on living as long as humanly possible, this was often situated within a moral framing of “holding on,” “being strong,” and not “giving up.” Moreover, there was a clear theme within the participants’ accounts of an impotency in the face of hospice “rules” around intervention (although these were not formalized or explicit). A common reflection was that, once one accepted entry into the hospice one was subsumed within its ideological framing of “the good death.” Whereas the majority accepted that this was a reasonable “sacrifice” so as to lower the burden on family through a more “controlled” death—again, reminiscent of ideas about gift, reciprocity, and obligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311421181">Broom &amp; Cavenagh, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311421181">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311421181">Chattoo &amp; Ahmad, 2008</xref>)—there was a concurrent sense of entrapment in their accounts. The gift, in this context, was a willingness to embrace or at least accept one’s dying process and its permutations. The reciprocity took the form of a right to die in a more controlled manner, without such a burden being placed on family and carers. Within this moral framework, an accelerated death was not part of the equation, and when verbalized, problematized ideas about reciprocity.</p>

<title>Questioning Euthanasia/Assisted Dying and the Desire to Live</title>
<p>It is important to emphasize that the participants’ perspectives on euthanasia/assisted dying were by no means linear, and there was significant (albeit minority) support for the hospice being a safe space that was not a covert form of euthanasia. Moreover, there was an emphasis on living within and enjoying the hospice phase. That is, counter to the participant perspectives examined above, there was support for a clear separation between hospice care and euthanasia/assisted dying:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It’s ah, it’s like the old horse and water situation, you ah, can open the stable door and you can take the horse out to the pond, but you can’t make him drink, sort of thing, you know? So it’s up to the individual, to, I think we need to have a lot more awareness of palliative care, what it is. . . . A lot of people are afraid, I think, that, they’re sort of getting the feeling that this is sort of “euthanasia by stealth,” sort of. . . . It isn’t. It’s given me a choice.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As shown in the next excerpt, some participants were thriving in an institutionalized dying setting, with no desire (at the point of the interview, anyway) for accelerated death. Although more research is needed to explore this, their perspectives came across as not embedded in the specificities of symptomatology (i.e., those in more pain wanted a faster death):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Well, I didn’t know what palliative care involved. . . . You hear all these stories like, “Oh well, that’s the end,” you know, “Once you get into palliative care mate, you’ve had it,” you know. “You’re on your last legs.” And I said, “No, I’m not. I’m not going to do it; I’m not ready yet.” And I’ve made up my mind: I am not ready, and as long as I can hang on, I am going to hang on.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The interviews reinforced the complexities and differentiated perspectives on euthanasia/assisted dying and desire to hasten death, even among a relatively small group of hospice inpatients. Moreover, their accounts illustrate the importance of accepting that assisted dying is an important, divisive, contentious, and persistent theme within the lived experiences of dying. The hospice staff—at least in this hospice setting—tended to view euthanasia/assisted dying as a subject not appropriate to discuss, and a practice that “doesn’t happen in hospice.” Yet the patients, whether for or against being offered euthanasia/assisted dying, did express a desire for discussion around the issue. As mentioned above, part of the reason that euthanasia/assisted dying is frowned upon in the hospice relates to the Catholic underpinnings of hospice care in Australia. Indeed, most of the participants talked about religion as the “unspoken driving force of hospice care.” Moreover, they recounted the presence of religious and moral codes underlying hospice interventions and possibilities around accelerated dying. In the day-to-day running of the project, if a nurse came in during an interview (out of necessity, to check on the patient), there would be comments like, “We don’t do that here,” or “You’re doing all right, aren’t you? We don’t want you to go yet.” These comments and the accounts of the participants provide a glimpse into the potential moral underpinnings of a hospice death and the omnipotence of religiosity in hospice care, whether explicit or implicit.</p>

<sec id="section12-1049732311421181">
<title>Religion, Redemption, and the Hospice</title>
<p>Much like euthanasia, religious beliefs often simmer under the surface of institutionalized end-of-life care settings and day-to-day interactions in hospices, yet rarely are they explicitly addressed in clinician–patient interaction. Indeed, discussions about afterlives, redemption, god(s), and so on, in the hospice, seemed natural, to some extent, but such could be at the same time morally laden and culturally bound. As discussed in the interviews, the participants experienced such discussions in differentiated ways as difficult, important, divisive, and at times intolerable. In this study, these issues were brought up naturally and sensitively, and none of the participants reacted negatively to these discussions. The idea was to examine how they viewed the place of religion as part of formalized hospice care and the role of the chaplain and hospice ideology in their dying process. Each patient had strong opinions on this issue:</p>
<list id="list3-1049732311421181" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>I: Spirituality and religion are obviously, for some people, quite important.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: Very important.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I: How do you think that’s . . . is that part of what the hospice should be about? Is that part of, for you, is that a personal thing, or what?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: No, I think it’s a personal thing. I mean, I don’t have any great religion. I do believe that there’s something out there. I believe that we go somewhere. I don’t believe that we drop off, wherever. I think we’ve got to go somewhere, the essence of us, has got to go somewhere. But, where that is, I don’t know. Call it God, call it karma, call it Santa Claus, who knows! I think it’s there, for everybody. I think everybody has their own belief of whatever. But, it should not be part of it [hospice care].</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Other participants shared the following:</p>
<list id="list4-1049732311421181" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>I: I guess everyone’s different, and whether they call it religion or spirituality or whatever, I guess it would be nice if you could tell me about whether you think that has a place in the hospice?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: No, not in my life it doesn’t. None of the above. I’m not religious, nor spiritual. . . . I really do believe that you are born, and that you live, and then you die, and in the meantime you do the best you can with what you’ve got. . . . What happens to me after I die, I don’t care. I mean, there might be a reward, and I might suddenly go, “Whoa, shit!” But I don’t imagine it’s going to happen.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I: Do you think that the hospice should be providing sort of, spiritual . . .</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: I don’t want them to. They asked me that when I came here and I said, “No, I’m fine thanks.” So they do, and they will, you know there’s a chapel up there if you need to go there, and they have pastoral care, if you care to tell them a story about it [your faith], and I just don’t. I’m not interested in religion; never have been.</p></list-item></list>
<list id="list5-1049732311421181" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>I: Do you think, for you, is it, is sort of religious and spiritual stuff important for the hospice? Is that important for you?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: No, no, no, no, no. I don’t go on with that sort of thing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I: Okay. Has the chaplain come along to talk to you at all?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: Well, they asked me to convert as soon as I come in the door, and I said, “No, I’m not worried about that mate.”</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>No, no. Religion has no business in here. That’s for yourself to figure out.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Evident in the above excerpts, and in the other participants’ accounts, the role of religion within the hospice and within the institutionalized dying process was controversial, and even frowned upon by some participants as inappropriate for a “medical environment.” Several suggested that religion has “no business” in a hospice, and that whether implicit or explicit, they felt pressured to “think about God” when visited by the chaplain. It should be noted here that in such an emotive environment—and an environment in which many people do desire pastoral care—there will always be some who find the supportive care ideologically difficult to accept. Yet, there are complexities here that deserve further examination; in particular, the hospice as a sphere for conversion, redemption, and evangelicalism, and also how informal systems operate within a public medical environment that espouses certain understandings (Christian, in this case) of theology, life after death, the meanings of living and dying. That is, the hospice is a grey area between expertise and faith, knowledge and belief, endings and beginnings, and technologies and ideologies. Preentry, the hospice tends to be viewed as a quasi-hospital environment, whereby pain can be controlled and bodily disintegration held in check. However, on admission, hospice offers, provides, and espouses much more than merely technologies of pain reduction and symptom control: it offers an ideological model of dying and resources for existential need—much of which, as I describe in the following section, is highly valued by patients themselves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1049732311421181">
<title>Positive Views on Religion in the Hospice</title>
<p>The interviews revealed significant differentiation in the importance and place of religion in the hospice. The participants were split almost equally in terms of their views on the appropriateness of Christianity as part of hospice supportive care. Those participants who supported religiosity as part of hospice life were not all explicitly religious (i.e., when asked, they did not all claim to be “Christian”); however, each talked about the comfort and importance of religious guidance and notions of afterlives for their well-being within the hospice:</p>
<list id="list6-1049732311421181" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>P: Yes, my wife and I, we have a Christian faith, and we do believe in a life to come, the resurrection and all that. So that sort of, is what I think, buoys us up, and you know, we’ve got hope for the future.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I: It’s not the end?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: No, it’s not the end.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I often sit in the chapel. I find great comfort from it. I think that that is where a lot of that help comes from. Life’s not all about money, and all of that. It goes a lot deeper than that. . . . It’s not any particular religion or denomination. I prefer to look at it from a spiritual point of view.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<list id="list7-1049732311421181" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>I: In terms of spirituality or religion, however you want to think about it, do you think that is an important part of what the hospice should offer, or is that a personal thing?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: Well, when you see the hospice and you enter it, it automatically comes to you that it’s in a religious place.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I: Right.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: Because it, it breathes that kind of thing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I: It does?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: Which is a very good thing. After all, you couldn’t make it a public hospital, could you? Everyone running around, clattering here and banging. I mean, it’s lovely and peaceful here. So if you want to die anywhere, die in a hospice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I: And is it something that . . .</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: [coughing]</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I: Is it something that you think should be actively provided? So, people coming around and talking about God?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: Well, I think they have a chaplain, don’t they?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I: They do.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: Who comes in regularly. I don’t think you could get much more than that. The, I think the chaplain should spend a little bit more time. I mean, I haven’t seen him around. But I think there should be a chaplain, probably here, maybe two or three hours a day, or maybe two or three hours every two days. I don’t know which way they would administer that. I certainly feel that there should be a chaplain ready to talk to people, like, to me.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In many respects the interview excerpts presented represent the conundrum of religious supportive care in the hospice. Religion was talked about in quite diverse ways by the participants, and was often talked about as instilling a moral conundrum for their clinicians, who were attempting to balance the dying process with cultural resources commonly drawn on to cope with death and loss (i.e., ideas about an afterlife, eternal life, forgiveness, and redemption). The focus here, once again, is not on critiquing the presence of religion within the hospice, but rather unpacking how its presence impacts on patients who enter this space. As mentioned above, the impacts and experiences of religiosity are actually experienced relationally—like other moral practices and dying rituals. That is, in the hospice, surrounded by other stakeholders, “doing religion” or not “doing religion” can have very different meanings and implications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049732311421181">
<title>The Pressure to Redeem: Hospice and Carer Expectations</title>
<p>Although not a theme emerging in all of the interviews, several participants revealed a pressure from carers and family members for acceptance of their death and “redemption” through “God.” That is, they described the broader relational and cultural expectation that one should find a higher meaning or existential closure before dying. This was viewed, at least in part, as encouraged by the presence of a hospice chaplain and chapel. The interviews illustrated how, in the last few weeks of life, some might feel pressure from family members and hospice workers to find peace with their impending death. Once again, and this time in the context of religious choices and beliefs, questions about autonomy emerge in an organizational setting involving a complex combination of vulnerability, giving, and reciprocity:</p>
<list id="list8-1049732311421181" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>P: A man has a true belief in God or Buddha, or whoever it may be, and he wants to include that in his death. I think he has the right to state his wishes, and as far as those wishes can be fulfilled, um, I think, between the family and the palliative care service, maybe we should do our best to provide it, because it will make it easier for him to accept.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I: What about for you?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: I’m not a very religious person. I sort of, I don’t believe that we human beings are the be-all and end-all of this universe, by any means.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I: Do you see that being a personal thing, or something that the palliative, the hospice should be involved in?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: Well, I believe there’s moves to put in that. I’ve had a guy [chaplain] down here, last Friday and the Friday before, sort of thing. He used to sit here for a few hours; he kind of works nondenominational, he’s . . .</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I: You can talk with him?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: Yeah.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>I: Did you find that useful?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>P: You know, his [the patient’s] family might be, he might have one or two saying, “Oh, we need this, we need that,” whereas the guy himself might not need it much, you know.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As illustrated above, and in several of the other participants’ accounts, acceptance of religious supportive care in the hospice might be, at least in part and for some patients, relational in character. That is, related to carer-, family-, and clinician-driven desire for acceptance and resolution. In this way, the participants articulated a relational ontology of religiosity in the context of dying that was, at least partially, morally driven and embedded in processes of reciprocity and mutual obligation. Yet, although a sense of obligation—to at least consider religion or talk to the chaplain—did emerge in their stories, it was more complex than a matter of subjugation to normative conceptions of “being at peace with God.” All participants accepted the need for religious supportive care at the end of life, just not as a standard aspect of hospice care. Moreover, for those who did not have religious beliefs or a desire to discuss religion, such pressures might in fact produce existential dilemmas that otherwise would not have emerged. This represents a key example of hospice as precariously placed between care of the body and care of the soul.</p>

<sec id="section15-1049732311421181" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Little qualitative research has been done to explore how people experience inpatient hospice care, and to my knowledge this study represents the first to explore their views on euthanasia/assisted dying and religiosity. The participants’ accounts raise a range of complex issues around autonomy and the right to choose within the hospice. Although there was acknowledgment that the hospice came with baggage (e.g., “You don’t get to die your way”) and distinct benefits (e.g., “No one sees you at your worst”), there was a sense of impotency once one had submitted to the organizational principles of “dying well.” I do not argue here that individual autonomy is denied or nonexistent in the hospice; it seems clear that autonomy becomes more and more relationally negotiated (i.e., situated within the values of staff, carers, and family; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311421181">Broom and Adams, 2010</xref>), and thus mediated by moral codes of obligation and reciprocity (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311421181">Kellehear, 2008</xref>, for dying as a social relationship). Organizationally, euthanasia/assisted dying and desire for death were not viewed by hospice staff as coherent or commensurable with the hospice model of care, and thus remained largely unspoken. Instead of viewing such “utterances” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311421181">Johansen et al., 2005</xref>) from patients as authentic desires to end their life, they were viewed as a “call for help” from the hospice staff.</p>
<p>Religious support was often viewed as a resource to assist those “calling for help” through euthanasia/assisting dying requests. Yet, the accounts presented reveal how religious guidance in the hospice produces a range of emotions and interactive processes that are worthy of significant sociological investigation. The chapel, chaplain, and religious “talk” were calming and therapeutic for some, while concurrently anxiety-provoking and/or irrelevant for others (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311421181">Edmondson, Park, Chaudoir, &amp; Wortmann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311421181">Exline &amp; Yali, 2000</xref>). Several of the participants felt that, in providing a chapel and chaplain, the hospice was breaching the boundaries between individual belief and formalized care. Ultimately, the religious and political positioning of the hospice was viewed as heavily shaping staff views on euthanasia/assisting dying and “dying well.”</p>
<p>Sociologically, this positions the inpatient hospice as a highly political and morally laden organizational setting. Although all organizational entities are bound by culture, politics, and social expectations, unlike most other medical specialties, the hospice contains, employs, and espouses explicit values about the existential. Moreover, it actively involves, encompasses, and often literarily accommodates stakeholders (i.e., family members and carers) in very different ways from an in-patient hospital ward. The hospice is thus a highly interactional and negotiated setting where complex combinations of grief, celebration, pain, and joy are interactionally enacted and expressed. Such interpersonal dynamics necessarily support and demand the moral practices of gift, obligation, and reciprocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311421181">Broom &amp; Cavenagh, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Such moral codes, in the context of the hospice, might be viewed as emerging from cultural constructions around the “untimely death” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311421181">Parry, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311421181">1994</xref>). Moreover, this study has illustrated how organizations such as hospices are complicit in the production and governance of such ideas. That is, their stories revealed a tension between a desire for a swift death and the organizational governance of a timely death (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311421181">Payne, Langley-Evans, &amp; Hillier, 1996</xref>). The idea of timely (or indeed, untimely) deaths relates to the politics of human dignity in modern nation states: a code of rights that also encompasses ideas about honor, respect, and glory. Such moral codes form the bedrock of the constitutional democracies of Western civilization.</p>
<p>To take a step back for a moment, there are in fact dual processes evident in the accounts presented here. The first is a moral economy of dying (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311421181">Booth, 1994</xref>) that, through cultural scripts around “good deaths” and ideas about gift/obligation, provides a relational framework for “dying well.” Intimately intertwined with quasi- or explicitly religious notions of “closure,” “acceptance,” and a “natural” end, this morality of dying produces interpersonal dilemmas; dilemmas about a responsibility to live as long as one can (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311421181">Broom, 2009</xref>); a responsibility to reconcile existential questions before death; and a responsibility to accept one’s end (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311421181">Broom &amp; Cavenagh, 2011</xref>). The second concurrent process is the governance of timely deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311421181">Parry, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311421181">1994</xref>), human dignity, and the universally recognized right to life. In the context of dying in a hospice, such rights are manifest within the organizational governance of the “unnatural” or “untimely death,” of which euthanasia/assisted dying might be viewed as a part. Such moral codes are anchored in the writings of social contract theorists such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311421181">Hobbes (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311421181">Rousseau (1973)</xref>. That is, a universally ascribed social contract/promise of life that the modern State is obliged to provide. Such social “contracts,” as evident in this setting, both allow certain possibilities and limit human agency. The hospice thus represents the bureaucratization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311421181">James &amp; Field, 1992</xref>) of the “timely death” buttressed by a religiously framed transitional mode of “exit” from this world. Religious supportive care—and various religious rationalities around suffering and acceptance—provide one resource for making sense of and coping with suffering in the absence of an assisted/ self-determined end.</p>
<p>Ultimately the revealing of the hospice as religiously and culturally bound does not limit its value in contemporary end-of-life care. Rather, here the aim has been to situate the hospice more clearly in cultural, political, and social context. Theoretically, further work is needed around the social and organizational expectations in and around dying in a hospice. In an increasingly globalized and eclectic cultural landscape, end-of-life care providers will need to be responsive to a widening range of cultural, religious, and moral codes. Revealing current alignments and politics is the first step in supporting such organizational adaptation.</p>

<ack>
<p>I thank the people who gave their incredibly valuable time while living in the hospice to make this study happen. Without the support of the palliative care clinicians, this study would not have eventuated. Finally, I thank Assa Doron for his academic input to the write-up of the results.</p>

<p>In Australia, and in this article, <italic>hospice</italic> is generally used to refer to end-of-life care in an inpatient unit. A hospice in Australia can be a small, free-standing, inpatient unit or, in one Australian State—that which is the focus here—a ward within a (Catholic) hospital. In the United States, hospice refers to a program in which patients are cared for at home. In the United Kingdom, a hospice can be a specific site, including both inpatients and outpatients, and broader, multifaceted care.</p>

<p>The concepts of euthanasia, assisted suicide, physician-assisted suicide, and assisted dying each have political undertones, and have particular meanings when deployed. Here, I take an interpretive approach to the use of such terms—that is, drawn from the data. The participants tended to use <italic>euthanasia</italic> and/or <italic>assisted dying</italic> as a means of talking about the right to die or the desire to hasten death. Thus, they are used here as consistent with participant accounts to reflect the most common articulations of this complex phenomenon.</p>

<p>The presence of a chapel and chaplain meant that most discussion of religion in the hospice was focused on Christianity. Further research is needed to explore hospices that employ chaplains from different religions.</p>
