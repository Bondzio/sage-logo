<abstract>
<p>According to Paul Wells, the lengthy and intimate relationship of the animation auteur to the animated text is similar to the writing process, and the animated form’s sense of its own artifice highlights the transformative aspects of adapting literary sources for the cinema. It is this expression of interiority, translation and textual process that makes the animated film a perfect vehicle for an adaptation of James Joyce’s <italic>Ulysses</italic> (1922), which utilizes multiple narrators to construct and deconstruct representations of urban, Dublin society in the early 20th century. It is the purpose of this article to consider Tim Booth’s animated short <italic>Ulys</italic> (1998), which is in part a commentary on Joyce’s writing authorship, and also an adaptation of Joyce’s novel. The author considers Booth’s use of animation to recover the ‘image-schemas’ that underpin <italic>Ulysses</italic>, and the ‘small spatial stories’ that inform human cognition of both the literary and animated text.</p>

<body>
<p>James Joyce’s novel <italic>Ulysses</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746847711428855">1986[1922]</xref>), first serialized in the American journal <italic>The Little Review</italic> in March 1918 and finally published as a single volume by Sylvia Beach in February 1922, firmly established the author as a key figure in a nascent Modernist literary movement that would later be seen to include Joyce’s contemporaries, such as Virginia Woolf, TS Eliot and Franz Kafka. Regarded as part of a canon of Modernist literature, it emerges from Western European social, economic and political conditions at the beginning of the 20th century, these conditions being dominated by increasing urbanization, industrialization and capitalist models of labour and product markets. As Johnson notes, the novel stands at a pivotal point in the development of 20th-century literary fiction, acknowledging the end of the 19th-century realist novel and opening up the more radical possibilities of stylistic form through its ‘literary improprieties’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1746847711428855">Johnson, 2008</xref>: ix), which would go on to inform explorations of representation and authorship in Modernist and Postmodernist epochs of cultural production.</p>
<p>At its most fundamental level, the novel relates a day in the life of Leopold Bloom, a ‘bourgeois advertising canvasser’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1746847711428855">Johnson, 2008</xref>: x), as he wanders the streets of Dublin city, musing on his domestic troubles, the death of his infant son, and his unfaithful wife. In the course of this apparently uneventful day, punctuated by the banalities of everyday existence in the city, he befriends a young scholar and poet Stephen Dedalus. The unlikely pair find themselves visiting a brothel and are haunted by emanations from their own interior, psycho-sexual drives, until finally returning to Bloom’s house in the early morning. There, Bloom’s wife Molly lies awake, and in a final internal monologue, her own jumble of desires, hopes and dreams are expressed: thereby the object of Bloom’s meanderings becomes a subject, returning once more to an object in Molly’s own self-examinations.</p>
<p>As Richard Ellmann (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1746847711428855">1986</xref>: ix) points out, <italic>Ulysses</italic> dispenses with a single authorial voice; instead the reader must negotiate a series of undependable narrators ‘who emerge and disappear without being identified’, and this is one of the defining traits of the novel. This lack of certainty makes <italic>Ulysses</italic> one of the progenitors of a Modernist agenda that questions notions of a monolithic realism and favours the exploration of fragmentation through processes of montage and simultaneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1746847711428855">Barker, 2000</xref>: 132). The novel proposes that beneath the calm surface of habitual existence, there lies a turmoil of thoughts, emotions and desires that occur simultaneously, creating profound uncertainties. Declan Kiberd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746847711428855">2009</xref>: 10) suggests that these uncertainties, reflected in Joyce’s refusal to adhere to a single, established literary convention, might be read as a resistance to an academy that seeks to monopolize knowledge in places of higher learning.</p>
<p>For Kiberd, <italic>Ulysses</italic> is a novel about the heroism of everyday life, and is written for everyday people. In a contemporary, post-literate society, the ‘everydayness’ of <italic>Ulysses</italic> might best be revivified in a populist visual medium such as commercial cinema. However, it is this uncertainty in the narrator’s voice and its resistance to rigid literary conventions, resulting in what Suzanne Buchan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746847711428855">1998</xref>: 32) identifies as a ‘polystylistics’, that makes <italic>Ulysses</italic> a problematic novel to translate into a populist, filmic form while maintaining the stylistic integrity of the original work.</p>
<p>Joseph Strick’s <italic>Ulysses</italic> (1968) and Sean Walsh’s <italic>Bloom</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1746847711428855">2004</xref>) attempt to construct a coherent and conventional narrative structure from the more identifiable scenes in Joyce’s text, but ultimately fail to engage with the more experimental aspects of the work. Margot Norris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1746847711428855">2004</xref>: 48) identifies the mixed reactions to Strick’s film, noting Ellmann’s disappointment at the conservative nature of the film’s aesthetics, but also pointing out how Joyce himself might have baulked at a more esoteric approach to a filmed adaptation.</p>
<p>The central issue for Norris lies in ‘whether <italic>Ulysses</italic> is to be valued for its enactment of an extremity of human intelligence or for its affectionate embrace of the complexity of human ordinariness’ (2004: 48). The answer is that, since the novel is both simultaneously, an adaptation must have the capacity to render notions of simultaneity, uncertainty and multiplicity in a palpable image, whilst engaging in a Modernist deconstruction of form itself. It therefore might be argued that the animated form, defined by Paul Wells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1746847711428855">2002</xref>: 31) as a form ‘preoccupied with the conditions of the modern, and its synthesis of art and culture’, could be the most apposite cinematic technique for an adaptation of <italic>Ulysses</italic> into a moving image form.</p>
<p>There are a number of key aspects in the use of animation as a method of literary adaptation, as pointed out by Wells. First, the production of animated texts can be seen as analogous to the production of literary texts (particularly for the independent animation auteur) in terms of its lengthy process and attention to detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1746847711428855">Wells, 2002</xref>: 64). Second, the interpretative aspect of the animated adaptation takes on a significant aspect due to the subjective nature of the animated form itself and the self-enunciating aspects of animation aesthetics; this generates an actively discursive form that adds to its original source material rather than negating elements of it. Third, and perhaps most important, underpinning the potential of animation adaptation is a key structural principle of animation itself: the capacity for metamorphosis. Like the literary text, animation can move seamlessly between interior and exterior states; it can transfigure the operation of metaphor, the animism of pathetic fallacy and interrogate the abstract nature of language, as Wells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1746847711428855">1999</xref>: 201) points out:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Animation is the most appropriate language by which to express the mental visualisations of images suggested by literary forms because its qualities are those which incorporate the hybridity, instability and mutability of the <italic>perception</italic> of textual allusion. (emphasis in original)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It is this hybridity, instability and mutability that is particularly relevant to an adaptation of <italic>Ulysses</italic>, a literary work that accentuates its self-reflexivity to the detriment of conventional narrative structure and character exposition, and revels in the Modernist deconstruction of aesthetic form, both of which can also be seen as inherent potentials of animation aesthetics. Suzanne Buchan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746847711428855">1998</xref>: 21) recognizes the appropriateness of animation as a method for adapting Joyce’s novel, a recognition which is prefigured by Joyce’s own interest in cinema and the work of Hans Richter and Walter Ruttmann. Buchan suggests the primacy of animation’s potential for metamorphosis as a way of creating a ‘visual polysemy’ (1998: 28) which is incumbent in Joyce’s experimental use of language and imagery.</p>
<p>Buchan’s conclusion that Joyce’s ‘polystylistics’ might only be successfully transfigured in animation was realized in Tim Booth’s <italic>Ulys</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1746847711428855">1998</xref>), a highly condensed telling of <italic>Ulysses</italic>, using hand-drawn animation techniques. The short film not only makes manifest the main events of the novel, but also comments on Joyce’s authorial process. Booth’s adaptation raises important issues concerning the historical and social context of authorship: if Joyce’s project was to produce a populist text that sought to challenge social orthodoxies, then to what extent has this been fulfilled in the animated form? And if both Joyce’s text and Booth’s film present the transitory nature of embodiment as a basis for ontology, then how might animation facilitate a cognitive approach to literary sources?</p>
<p>An initial contact point between both texts can be found in the social context of their production: both writer and animator were creating their works during moments of social upheaval in Ireland. Joyce appropriated the tropes of Homer’s <italic>Odyssey</italic> in creating <italic>Ulysses</italic>, using classical myth to question the myth of a national Irish identity in a period overshadowed by Ireland’s War of Independence, followed by its Civil War, as well as the chaos wrought across Europe by the First World War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1746847711428855">Whelan, 2003</xref>: 96). Booth retells <italic>Ulysses</italic> as the condensed <italic>Ulys</italic>, focusing on the ambiguous and metamorphic capacities of animation to both transfigure the radically discursive elements of the original text, as well as interrogating a myth of Irish identity in the midst of social change brought about by Ireland’s economic boom in the 1990s.</p>
<p><italic>Ulys</italic> can be seen as an animated text produced as part of the trend of literary adaptations identified by Maeve Connolly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1746847711428855">2005</xref>: 86) as a form of indigenous Irish animation production during this period. Connolly goes on to place this aspect of Irish animation production in the broader context of Irish cinema around the turn of the millennium, which saw the development of an Irish heritage cinema linked with an emerging enterprise culture. Writing in relation to similar social and economic changes in the UK during the 1980s, Corner and Harvey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1746847711428855">1991</xref>: 46) see heritage and enterprise being mobilized to help managed processes of transition in a period of rapid changes wrought by multi-national capitalism, stating how ‘heritage and enterprise form together a key mythic couplet for preserving hegemonic equilibrium and momentum during a period of major national reorientation’.</p>
<p>A similar moment of national reorientation can be identified in Ireland during the economic boom of the 1990s, known as the ‘Celtic Tiger’ period, when Ireland finally embraced the terms of a global capitalist modernity. As Ruth Barton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1746847711428855">2004</xref>: 149–150) notes, the development of an Irish heritage cinema at this time offered not only a sense of continuity to (and an evaluation of) an Irish past, but also a new way of selling Irishness in a global marketplace. Irish animation’s engagement with heritage discourses in the form of literary adaptations might also mark this as a period of transition for the industry itself; as Connolly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1746847711428855">2005</xref>: 84) notes, models for animation production shifted from the large-scale, industrial model to smaller independent means of production at this time, and Booth operating as an independent animator can be seen in this regard.</p>
<p>The entrepreneurial spirit that Connolly locates at the heart of the Irish animation industry finds some reciprocity in official strategies developed by the Irish Film Board’s CEO Rod <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1746847711428855">Stoneman (2005)</xref>, who sought to support a national cinema of ‘market responsive auteurs’, producing films of both critical and commercial merit. Booth’s film, partly funded under the Film Board’s <italic>Frameworks</italic> funding scheme, might be seen as part of this strategy as Joyce himself was something of a cinema entrepreneur, being a partner in one of Dublin’s first public cinemas called The Volta (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1746847711428855">Barton, 2004</xref>: 14). Booth uses the cinema auditorium as a framing device for his condensed version of <italic>Ulysses</italic> and, like the self-awareness of form demonstrated by Joyce through the experimentation with form and deployment of multiple literary styles, Booth’s acknowledgement of animation’s artifice as cinema is used to comment on the terms of Joyce’s authorship of a literary text, as well as his own authorship of an animated literary adaptation.</p>
<p><italic>Ulys</italic> begins with a blinking neon sign identifying The Volta cinema, which then cross-dissolves to the interior of the auditorium where Joyce sits as author and audience of his own work. Accompanying a voice-over that explains the condensed nature of what we are about to see, the onscreen title, which reads ‘<italic>Ulysses</italic> by James Joyce’, metamorphoses into ‘<italic>Ulys</italic> by Jim Joyce’. The <italic>Ulys</italic> title is rendered as if it is on a brass plaque, which then cross-dissolves to the interface of a contemporary word-processing software, with familiar menu headings across the top of the screen, such as ‘file’, ‘edit’, ‘view’ and ‘fonts’, which are accompanied by more unexpected options such as ‘wank’, ‘bloom’ and ‘molly’. Running down the left side of the screen are icons such as a penis, Joyce’s round spectacles and hat, a nude female torso, and the Martello Tower at Sandymount – the location of the opening scene in <italic>Ulysses</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1746847711428855">Figure1</xref>). A cursor points to the tower icon, and there is a cross-dissolve to a fly-by of the tower with character Stephen Dedalus standing on the top.</p>

<p>In this initial sequence, Booth collapses depictions of cinema and desktop publishing to generate a sense of continuity between Joyce’s authorship and his own. It also creates a continuity between processes of earlier forms of authorship and contemporary forms determined by information technology – the same technology that had rapidly revolutionized the Irish economy in the 1990s and profoundly changed Irish society during this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1746847711428855">O’Hearne, 1998</xref>: 73). The rise of the market-sensitive auteur marks a period of rapid social and economic change in Ireland and Booth’s use of the animated form in its ambiguous and metamorphic mode emerges as an appropriate method of expressing anxieties over such changes.</p>
<p>Arguably, it is in the metamorphic moments of Joyce’s novel – the multiple narrators that deny a stable viewpoint in the Wandering Rocks chapter, the mutability of form in the Circe chapter, the liveliness of inanimate objects in the Aeolus chapter and the multimorphic form of language itself, as noted by Buchan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1746847711428855">1998</xref>: 26) in the form of portmanteau words – that we can locate an anxiety over the stability of personal and cultural identity. Joyce offers the revelation that both national and personal identity are never stable but in constant flux, continually in the process of being constructed.</p>
<p>In <italic>Ulys</italic>, Booth uses animation in its most radical of Modernist modes to transfigure the mutability of Joyce’s text that challenges social and aesthetic orthodoxies. There are highly charged moments where locations, objects and characters mutate from one to another: following the more conventional, and static framing of characters and environments in the opening scene of The Volta, Booth then employs his hand-drawn animation technique to simulate a dramatic camera move, circling the Martello Tower where Stephen Dedalus stands on the rooftop, and then through an open window to reveal the interior of Barney Kiernan’s public house – a location from much later in the original text. In this single moment of condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1746847711428855">Wells, 2009</xref>: 76), animation has been used to collapse actual and narrative space, and the audience find themselves in the company of a character known only as the Citizen, a bigoted Irish nationalist in <italic>Ulysses</italic>, and his unkempt mongrel dog Garryowen, a satirical reference to one of Ireland’s mythic heroes – Cuchulain (the hound of Culan). Booth uses the Citizen as the main narrator for his adaptation and the audience is brought back to the pub several times in the course of the film.</p>
<p>Following the Citizen’s initial introduction, there is a cut to Stephen Dedalus walking on Sandymount strand and once more there is a dramatic, simulated camera move that circles Dedalus and then flies from the beach to Dublin city’s main thoroughfare, O’Connell Street, in a single, rapid sweep. This simulated aerial camera move is realized through a hand-drawn animation process, where dramatic changes in elevation are rendered frame by frame, resulting in a constantly shifting and fluid image that lacks stability in form and viewpoint. This dramatic shift in the use of animation prepares the audience for more unstable and metamorphic moments to come.</p>
<p>In <italic>Ulysses</italic>, the opening chapter does not begin with Dedalus on the roof of the Martello Tower but with his companion, Buck Mulligan. However, Booth’s focus on Dedalus establishes him as one of the main protagonists in the text, while the use of animation to simulate rotations of a camera around the environment successfully translates the swooping assonance of vowels that expresses Mulligan’s movements in the original text: ‘Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awakening mountains’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746847711428855">Joyce, 1986[1922]</xref>: 3).</p>
<p>Booth’s composition shifts seamlessly from Dedalus’s walk along the Sandymount strand in the ‘Proteus’ chapter of <italic>Ulysses</italic> and onwards inland towards the city. Kiberd’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746847711428855">2009</xref>: 71) analysis of Proteus establishes the importance of flux and change, Proteus being the god of change. This preoccupation with change is expressed in Joyce’s first interior monologue of the book, with its saccadic jumps of thought and language, further signified by Dedalus’s footsteps sinking into the sand and the ever-changing presence of the sea. In <italic>Ulys</italic>, this focus on change is expressed in the sweeping movement of the animated image, taking the viewer from the strand to the city.</p>
<p>Once on O’Connell Street, the instability of imagery continues – trams fly past, an ostrich’s plumage transforms into sharks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1746847711428855">Figure 2</xref>) and Nelson’s Pillar is destroyed in an explosion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1746847711428855">Figure 3</xref>). This single animated flow of imagery has taken the viewer to the ‘Aeolus’ chapter of <italic>Ulysses</italic>, where Dedalus tells his ‘Parable of the Plums’, a story of two old women ascending Nelson’s Pillar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746847711428855">Joyce, 1986[1922]</xref>: 119). Booth’s animated destruction of the pillar simultaneously relates to a later episode in Irish history, where the landmark, seen as a symbol for British Imperial rule, was destroyed by the Irish Republican Army. This metamorphic scene finally comes to rest in the kitchen of main protagonist Leopold Bloom, as he prepares breakfast in the ‘Calypso’ chapter of <italic>Ulysses</italic>. At this point in <italic>Ulys</italic>, the audience is no longer in a stable material world represented by animated figures, but rather negotiating the disruptive world of Booth’s subjective retelling of Joyce’s already unstable tale.</p>

</fig>
<p>Although this sequence can be understood by the viewer as a comparable movement of the camera in a live-action cinema context, it is in actual fact a metamorphosis – the lengthy transformation of one location into another, facilitated by the mutable form of animation itself. There are further moments in <italic>Ulys</italic> where acts of metamorphosis are used to express the rapid flow of Joyce’s stream of consciousness technique that finds fluid associations between internal and external worlds, ideas, thoughts, memories and physical feelings. A moment where Bloom drinks a glass of burgundy taken from the ‘Lestrygonians’ chapter of <italic>Ulysses</italic> becomes a complex flow of metamorphic forms in <italic>Ulys</italic>, connecting Bloom’s initial stream of consciousness regarding his choice of drink and ham sandwich, to his later musings of an amorous encounter with his wife Molly. Booth’s metamorphic imagery dispenses with the distinctions of a sensual world and the pleasure of eating and drinking can easily give way to sexual pleasure. Bloom’s initial internal monologue when ordering the food and drink drifts from an advertisement for potted meat, the funeral of Paddy Dignam and cannibalism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746847711428855">Joyce, 1986[1922]</xref>: 140):</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>– Tiptop . . . Let me see. I’ll take a glass of burgundy and . . . let me see.</p>
<p>Sardines on the shelves. Almost taste them by looking. Sandwich? Ham and his descendants mustered and bred there. Potted meats. What is home without Plumtree’s potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad! Under the obituary notices they stuck it. All up a plumtree. Dignam’s potted meat. Cannibals would with lemon and rice. White missionary too salty. Like pickled pork. Expect the chief consumes the parts of honour. Ought to be tough from exercise. His wives in a row to watch the effect.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Booth depicts this flow of ideas through the metamorphosis of Bloom’s glass of burgundy into a boiling cauldron of crucifixes and cannibalized bones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1746847711428855">Figure 4</xref>). And afterwards, this boiling cauldron transforms into a naked female form that flies from the glass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1746847711428855">Figure 5</xref>), capturing Bloom’s erotic memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746847711428855">Joyce, 1986[1922]</xref>: 144):</p>

<p>The translation of <italic>Ulysses</italic> into an animated form liberates its potential as a multimorphic tale, similar to a fairytale or folktale, which according to Bruno Bettleheim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1746847711428855">1976</xref>: 309) uses moments of metamorphosis to prepare children for their journey to adulthood, stating how ‘each fairy tale is a magic mirror which reflects some aspects of our inner world, and of the steps required by our evolution from immaturity to maturity’. For Marina Warner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1746847711428855">2002</xref>: 18), metamorphic tales emerge at moments of transition – which can mean transition between civilizations and cultures as well as personal transitions from childhood and adulthood. Warner identifies a heightened interest in the fairytale and gothic tale from the mid-1700s to the mid-1800s, which she aligns with the expansion of French and British colonies and moments of cultural contact through colonial experiences (2002: 25). Furthermore, the Grimm brothers’ project of recording definitive versions of folktales reflects the need for the compiling of a canon of official national literature as an ideological counterpart to the transition towards nationalism as a social model, which necessarily negates and absorbs smaller regional variations in culture into a national whole.</p>
<p>Joyce was writing in just such a transitional period in Irish history, where there was an active struggle to generate a legitimate Irish cultural hegemony, distinct from what would later be recognized as the imposition of British colonial rule. Joyce’s part in this struggle was to resist monolithic notions of Irish identity that sought to create a narrowly defined sense of Irishness which was conservative, Catholic and rural. Part of this struggle was an engagement with popular cultural forms, such as vaudeville, cinema and the folktale, alongside a recognition of everyday experiences, as pointed out by Kiberd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746847711428855">2009</xref>: 97): ‘the radical implication of <italic>Ulysses</italic> is that the colonial enterprise itself may be a distraction sought by those who have failed to appreciate and release the exotic elements in their own everyday lives.’</p>
<p>Wells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1746847711428855">2006</xref>: 84) utilizes a critique of Joyce’s work, being connected to a ‘visual apparatus and a popular form’, to illustrate the relationship between a Modernist literary idiom and the animated film. Joyce employs stream of consciousness techniques to emulate internal states of being and sudden jumps of detail influenced by the advent of a cinematic apparatus – these techniques are regarded by Wells as signs of modernity which are also expressed by the animated form (2006: 85). However, for Kiberd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746847711428855">2009</xref>: 170) and Gibbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1746847711428855">1996</xref>: 6), the disruptive elements of Joyce’s text that delight in the colloquial, the personal and the performative acts of being are also signs of a resurgent oral tradition in Irish storytelling culture, that pre-dates a bourgeois print-capitalism and the social/political models of nationalism suggested by print culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1746847711428855">Brennan, 1995</xref>: 55).</p>
<p>David Lloyd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1746847711428855">2000</xref>: 383) argues that there is an essential ‘non-modernity’ inherent in Irish cultural identity; furthermore, this can be related to what Richard Kearney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746847711428855">1997</xref>: 102) calls an ‘indigenous tradition of political disunity’ inherent in Celtic culture, where a societal model consisting of disparate tribes rather than a centralized government is the dominant form of social aggregation. Kearney contends that a sense of cultural unity under such conditions was not contained in political office but instead was ‘an imaginary concept to be safeguarded by fílí (poets)’ and the social processes of an oral tradition. The poet was a repository of culture, a conduit through which culture was expressed in the form of myth, poetry and song. In a similar way to the Barthesian concept of the modern scriptor as opposed to the author (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1746847711428855">Kearney, 1997</xref>: 146), these fílí were vessels containing the myriad of cultural references and influences that are combined to formulate a text.</p>
<p>In a similar way, <italic>Ulysses</italic> problematizes the notion of an omniscient narrator with a use of multiple voices and the text openly acknowledges its multiple points of reference, moving through a palimpsest of literary styles from stream of consciousness to theatre, to journalistic reportage. This effect is captured in <italic>Ulys</italic> not only in its metamorphic forms but also in the undecidability of the narrator’s voice – at times the audience is addressed by the Citizen in Barney Kiernan’s pub, then by Joyce, and then by characters within the story’s diegesis.</p>
<p>In the ‘Hades’ chapter of <italic>Ulysses</italic>, where Bloom attends the funeral of Paddy Dignam, there is a continuous shift between internal monologue and an external voice observing characters and events, thereby suggesting the presence of an omniscient narrator. The fluctuation between internal and external exposition is sudden, occurring between one sentence and the next. It is in this omniscient voice where Joyce resides most openly as a narrator, and this particular episode of the novel is used by Booth to place Joyce within the world of his fictional characters. During the funeral, Bloom spies an unknown man in a Macintosh raincoat and asks:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh? Now who is he I’d like to know? Now I’d give a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never dreamt of. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746847711428855">Joyce, 1986[1922]</xref>: 90)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Booth identifies the man in the Macintosh as Joyce, just as Joyce signals his own presence in the chapter when he observes: ‘Mr. Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746847711428855">1986 [1922]</xref>: 90), before becoming subsumed once more beneath the resurgence of Bloom’s internal counting of attendees: ‘Twelve. Thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. Death’s number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn’t in the chapel, that I’ll swear’ (p. 90).</p>
<p>As stated previously, both Joyce and Booth can be seen to use previous texts to structure their own – Joyce using Homer’s <italic>Odyssey</italic> and Booth using Joyce’s <italic>Ulysses</italic> – and therefore might be seen in the role of fílí, as repositories of cultural memory. Animation as a form has a particular effect on this repository of cultural material, readily allowing for the reactivation of older storytelling traditions and processes which had been usurped by the literary form throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. We can note how Jack Zipes’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1746847711428855">1995</xref>: 40) treatment of Disney’s adaptations of fairy tales is indignant at its compromising of literary experience:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Private reading pleasure is replaced by pleasurable viewing in an impersonal cinema. Here one is brought together with other viewers not for the development of community but to be diverted in the French sense of <italic>divertissement</italic> and American sense of diversion.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>But what Zipes fails to recognize is first the detrimental effects on society of private reading over the communal act of oral storytelling, and second the more radical effects contained within the Disney film in particular and the animated form in general, which resonate with the essence of the fairytale as an oral rather than a literary artefact. This essence is reflected in the use of metamorphosis and inherent instability of the form that makes manifest the multiplicity of animation authorship (both in the sense of a studio process but also the multiple pieces of artwork that are constructed to generate an illusion of movement) and the performative aspects of animated and oral storytelling. These are also the heightened concerns of Joyce’s <italic>Ulysses</italic> and Booth’s <italic>Ulys</italic>.</p>
<p>Arguably, the experiential aspects deemed so important to oral storytelling culture return in the performance aspects of the animated form, where the experience of the storyteller is displaced into the animated object and represented metaphorically in acts of anthropomorphism. Such acts in <italic>Ulysses</italic> connect his work to a broader Modernist agenda shared by other artists and writers of this period, as Kiberd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746847711428855">2009</xref>: 114–115) states:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>The young Joyce was a frequenter of the Dublin Hermetic Society and was intrigued by the notion that things could be endowed with consciousness . . . This is the modern form of pathetic fallacy, favoured not just by painters but by surrealist poets, who warned against those who take a merely exterior view of the surfaces of things.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The endowing of consciousness to inanimate objects in order to explore interior states of being is also a particular element of animation aesthetics, the subjective nature of the form being a key element in how it addresses notions of ‘realism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1746847711428855">Wells, 2009</xref>: 27). In the ‘Aeolus’ chapter, the creaking of doors and the sounds of the printing press are given the same eloquent presence as human voices, Joyce using the moment to interrogate the conditions of a modernity increasingly dictated by animate yet non-sentient machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746847711428855">Joyce, 1986[1922]</xref>: 100):</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Sllt. The nethermost deck of the first machine jogged forward its flyboard with sllt the first batch of quirefolded papers. Sllt. Almost human the way it sllt to call attention. Doing its level best to speak. That door too sllt creaking, asking to be shut. Everything speaks in its own way. Sllt.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In his attempt to give a voice to the non-sentient, he captures the performative aspects of oral storytelling through phonetic spelling and onomatopoeia. For Sean Cubitt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1746847711428855">2008</xref>: 55), a history of animated objects, from primitive automata to optical devices and animated film, can be seen to be informed by an ‘atavistic memory of local gods, spirits of place, multiple and warring tribes of demiurges’ and he goes on to state how ‘the anxieties associated with this complex repression of pagan thought, and its incomplete forgetting, are captured in miniature in the mythos of the puppet that comes to life.’</p>
<p>The role of the fílí, resurgent in the text of <italic>Ulysses</italic> and <italic>Ulys</italic>, was originally an element of the polytheistic, nature-based paganism of Celtic culture that was in part appropriated by the Catholic Church in its conversion of Iron Age tribes to Christianity. Joyce and Booth, in their role of fílí, facilitate the return of the experiential into the public sphere through the performative aspects of their respective texts, also reaffirming a communal social body that has been eroded by the solipsism of humanist ontology. This return of a Bacchanalian polytheism is an aspect of early animated forms as noted by Norman Klein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1746847711428855">1993</xref>: 35), who points out how the multimorphic cartoon characters of the 1920s and 1930s can be related to a pantheon of animal gods with their libidinous energy recalling the irreverent naiveté of the folktale, which in turn problematizes the propriety of a bourgeois social order. The possibility for reading moments of metamorphosis as expressing anxieties over social and personal order is taken up by Wells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1746847711428855">2009</xref>: 75) in an analysis of the Fleischer studio where he points out:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>The Fleischer brothers use their metamorphoses to reveal and emphasise the ease with which social destabilisation and collapse may occur. Their fantasy worlds only heighten the fragile premises of law and order, routine and process, expectation and fulfilment.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>What Wells hints at here is the consensual nature of law and order, while also questioning assumptions over the terms of desire, the fulfilment of pleasure and the apparent static nature of being. Sergei Eisenstein’s analysis of the ‘plasmatic’ nature of early animated films, i.e. the ability to assume any form, points out how this mutable freedom of form points to a desire for freedom from contemporary social constraints in capitalist societies such as the USA (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1746847711428855">Leyda, 1986</xref>: 21):</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>In a country and social order with such a mercilessly standardized and mechanically measured existence . . . the sight of such ‘omnipotence’ (that is the ability to become ‘whatever you wish’), cannot but hold a sharp degree of attractiveness.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Eisenstein’s understanding of metamorphosis suggests that we can use it to express anxieties over social/personal constraints, and to question social orthodoxies. As stated previously, Booth and Joyce were producing their texts during periods of social upheaval and transition in Ireland, and anxieties over these transitions might be seen as articulated in moments of metamorphosis highlighted in Booth’s adaptation. For Booth, this moment of transition was a movement from a harsh economic recession in the 1980s towards an economic boom in the 1990s that brought with it rapid social change and increasing cynicism concerning the traditional roles of Church and State in Irish culture. For Joyce, this moment of transition involved political and social unrest of Irish nationalism seeking a coherent identity to legitimize a nation-state separate from the UK, as well as a reaction to the modernizing forces of industrialization and urban living.</p>
<p>In the ‘Circe’ chapter of <italic>Ulysses</italic>, Joyce disrupts social order by taking his characters to Nighttown, the dark underworld of Dublin city, where they are approached by prostitutes, visit a brothel and brawl in the street. The desires of main character Leopold Bloom know neither stable form nor identity, and Joyce’s prose is vertiginous, over-produced and verbose, adopting what might be seen as a Baroque scopic regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746847711428855">Jay, 1988</xref>: 16). Booth in <italic>Ulys</italic> makes particular use of this episode to engage the metamorphic potential of the animated form, where the hallucination of his mother Ellen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1746847711428855">Figure 6</xref>) ‘in pantomime dame’s stringed mobcap, widow Twankey’s crinoline and bustle . . . appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746847711428855">Joyce, 1986[1922]</xref>: 358) transmutes into an exotic image of his wife Molly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1746847711428855">Figure 7</xref>), as described by Joyce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1746847711428855">1986 [1922]</xref>: 359):</p>

This constant shifting of form and focus denies a Cartesian perspectivalism that seeks to construct a definitive, disembodied and omniscient subject (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1746847711428855">Jay, 1988</xref>: 9); instead; it mimics the uncertain movement of embodied sight, which does not take place in isolation but in a matrix of seeing and being seen. This sense of embodiment sought by Joyce to question social order and rendered by Booth’s use of the plasmatic nature of the animated form might also be connected to the experience of nervous being, as suggested by Rosalind Krauss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1746847711428855">1988</xref>: 62), who identifies a pulse in the strobing imagery of the zoetrope, a precursor of cinematic animation processes, both being predicated on a frame-by-frame construction of the illusion of movement. Arguably, this pulse underlies all sequential forms of animated imagery that depend on a persistence of vision, a pulse that resonates with an almost imperceptible beat of a nervous and circulatory system. The experience of animation can therefore be seen as being connected to embodiment on a primal level.</p>

</fig>
<p>Whilst recognizing that the writing and reading of literary texts is frequently set aside as an exceptional cultural practice, Mark Turner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1746847711428855">1996</xref>: 7) argues that the human mind is essentially a literary mind, and that the act of storytelling is fundamental to human cognitive processes, which are inseparable from embodiment. Turner points out how story forms can be seen to illustrate cognitive processes, and how cognitive processes follow patterns of ‘small spatial stories’ (1996: 13), which are fundamental to human experience and understanding of being and time. These acts of micro-storytelling are so fundamental to human cognition that they are imperceptible to the conscious mind. Turner states how ‘we are built evolutionarily to learn to distinguish objects and events and combine them in small spatial stories at human scale in a way that is useful for us, given that we have human bodies’ (1996: 15). The spatial stories that help us to orientate our perceptions and understanding of the world are linked to what Turner calls ‘image schemas’, indicating the primacy of visual stimuli in human experience. These schemas help us to identify objects, events and stories, as Turner explains: ‘Image schemas are skeletal patterns that recur in our sensory and motor experience. <italic>Motion along a path, bounded interior</italic>, and <italic>symmetry</italic>, are typical image schemas’ (1996: 16, emphases in original).</p>
<p>Turner argues that the literary object utilizes the same fundamental building blocks of human cognition, the construction of spatial stories in relation to image schemas, in order to create narratives for the more specific purposes of entertainment and education. However, as Turner suggests, these small spatial stories require discrete human bodies and visual stimuli to generate meaningful information, and herein Joyce departs from a cognitive model that depends on such spatial awareness. In later episodes, Joyce disrupts the boundaries between discrete entities and spaces, thereby compromising the reader’s ability to orientate themselves within a narrative which no longer relates to their cognitive processes. Joyce also abandons the primacy of the image schema, giving us an alternative auditory schema to negotiate: his phonetic language celebrating the vernacular, and Kiberd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1746847711428855">2009</xref>: 170) points out how ‘He always asked that passages of his book be read aloud, because the reciter could supply with an appropriate vocalisation the rich play of possible meanings.’ Arguably, it is Joyce’s disruption of cognitive processes that are highly dependent on visual metaphor and the inability to transfer an alternative process to written language, that makes <italic>Ulysses</italic> a difficult book to read.</p>
<p>However, Booth’s <italic>Ulys</italic>, while celebrating the excesses of Joyce’s prose and the collapse of discrete bodies in moments of metamorphosis ultimately brings spatial stories and image schemas back to Joyce’s text. Where Joyce moves from one internal monologue to another, or from one internal monologue to an external dialogue without identifying discrete characters or spatial relationships, Booth uses animation to show the act of changing as it occurs – the process of metamorphosis between an external material event and the internal processes triggered by that event. In Booth’s adaptation of the ‘Lestrygonians’ chapter of <italic>Ulysses</italic>, Bloom’s glass of burgundy in the external world transforms into a cannibal’s cauldron in his internal psychological world, the image-schema of bounded interior linking glass and cauldron as bounding objects.</p>
<p>Booth not only uses animation to show the ability for discrete bodies to change, but also depicts the reality of discrete bodies that are permeated by their experiences of a material world. In his adaptation of the ‘Oxen of the Sun’ chapter of <italic>Ulysses</italic>, Booth uses animation to penetrate the body of a foetus through its oral cavity. In the original chapter, Joyce uses the analogy of a visit to a maternity hospital to explore the gestation of English-language literary forms that have eventually given birth to his own text. This attempt to permeate the boundaries of a literary episteme by shifting from one form to another results in an elaborate experiment with the development of form that overrides the function of character and plot. Booth embodies this intellectual exploration in the recognizable form of a foetus, permeating its body and travelling along its internal structure until exiting through a birthing canal to find Stephen Dedalus – suggesting perhaps the hubris of an artist trying to give birth to himself without the literary forebears satirized by Joyce throughout the chapter.</p>
<p>The physical embodiment of a purely intellectual exercise as captured by Booth in his use of the foetus attests to the reality of the animated film as primarily a visual medium and therefore predicated on some form of embodiment. How an audience processes the movement of images onscreen arguably resonates with Turner’s ‘small spatial stories’ that are fundamental to human cognitive processes. This primacy of embodiment is alluded to in John Halas and Roger Manvel’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746847711428855">1968</xref>: 62) analysis of the graphic outcomes of films produced by the United Productions of America studio:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>The graphic beings in UPA’s films are conceived in variously stylized outline . . . Their movements are simplified, mechanized, grotesque . . . but through these <italic>grotesqueries</italic> of movement shines the light of human observation, the comic realisation of the problems of human mass and weight, gravity and friction, the physical laws of nature.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Halas and Manvel argue that a process of ‘mobile composition’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746847711428855">1968</xref>: 24) defines animation as an artistic practice, where animators design graphic forms in time as well as space and ultimately this expression of time depends on embodiment in graphic forms. This also affects an audience’s identification with animated forms, as Halas and Manvel go on to state how ‘cartoons must depend, therefore, mainly on the appeal of movement and action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1746847711428855">1968</xref>: 146).</p>
<p>Before we have language, before we are drawn into a Lacanian symbolic order that thrives on difference and absence, we possess the undifferentiated physical and psychological plenitude of an ‘imaginary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1746847711428855">Eagleton, 1983</xref>: 164). This is derived from our sense of embodiment – and arguably, this is the logic that underpins Turner’s concept of small spatial stories where conceptual linguistic systems are constructed from a metaphorical physicality. As observed by Halas and Manvel, this is also the core form of recognition at the heart of the animation process, and from the recognition of bodies and movements we infer intentionality – a point explored by Patrick Power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1746847711428855">2008</xref>: 33) in relation to the work of AH Modell and the firing of mirror neurons in the human brain. This core recognition of bodies and movements connects animation and the written word in the form of adaptation. Animation foregrounds the metaphorical movement in language and returns the body to its place of primacy over a symbolic order. Where Joyce attempts to reintroduce a physical truth to the act of storytelling in <italic>Ulysses</italic>, his success is limited by the perceptual nature of his medium, i.e. the written word.</p>
<p>The limitation of live-action cinema adaptations of Joyce’s text, such as Strick’s <italic>Ulysses</italic> and Walsh’s <italic>Bloom</italic>, is that they do not address the metaphorical relationship between language and the body at a structural level, resulting in over-literal reproductions of the more accessible image-schemas used in the novel. In <italic>Ulys</italic>, Booth uses the structural affinity of linguistics and animation to clarify Joyce’s more obscure image-schemas, thereby demonstrating not a transformative form of adaptation but an archaeology that digs through the strata of a symbolic order to disinter a real, material body, that lies underneath.</p>
