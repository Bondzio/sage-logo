<abstract>
<p>This paper aims to provoke reflection and debate on researcher assumptions and the potential functions and consequences of truth claims made about leadership. A Foucauldian approach informs this comparative case study of key Classical Greek and transformational leadership texts, aiming to unsettle what we normally take for granted about leadership so as to enhance our capacity to explore new ways of thinking. Initially I address what is said about leaders, followers and their relationship in each case, after which I consider the historical context of these ideas, their potential effects for leader and follower subjectivity and their wider social function. The paper then identifies continuities and discontinuities in thinking, suggesting social context has a greater effect than is normally understood in shaping what is sayable and thinkable in respect of leadership, and revealing that leadership may possess mutable ontological foundations.</p>

<p>… knowing if one can think differently than one thinks, and perceive differently than one sees, is absolutely necessary if one is to go on looking and reflecting at all.</p>
<p>(Michel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455129">Foucault, 1985</xref>: 8)</p></disp-quote>
<p>The use of critical, social constructionist and post-structuralist perspectives to study leadership has grown rapidly in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742715012455129">Alvesson and Spicer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1742715012455129">Fairhurst and Grant, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1742715012455129">Jackson and Parry, 2011</xref>). The rich and sometimes surprising findings arising from such efforts (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742715012455129">Alvesson and Sveningsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742715012455129">Ford et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1742715012455129">Sinclair, 2008</xref>) serve as endorsements for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1742715012455129">Grint’s (2000)</xref> proposal that we acknowledge the limitations of a scientistic paradigm for understanding leadership. A recent review of leadership research confirms the continued reliance upon this paradigm as the predominant approach taken in our field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1742715012455129">Gardner et al., 2010</xref>), despite promising efforts to promote greater diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1742715012455129">Bryman, 2011</xref>). Consequently, in this paper my aim is to question some key assumptions of the mainstream of leadership studies, contributing to the literature which examines how research assumptions shape leadership knowledge (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1742715012455129">Alvesson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1742715012455129">Gronn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1742715012455129">Hunter et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Typically, leadership scholars proceed on the assumption that leadership has timeless and essential qualities, making it an enduring feature of the human condition (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742715012455129">Antonakis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742715012455129">Bass, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1742715012455129">Bennis and Nanus, 1985</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1742715012455129">Drath et al. (2008)</xref> argue the ontological assumption they call the ‘tripod’, comprising leader, followers and their common goals, thus both dominates and limits our understanding of leadership. The ideals of quantification and generalization also typically inform the work of leadership scholars, along with the expectation that universal laws about leadership can be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742715012455129">Alvesson and Spicer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742715012455129">Bass, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742715012455129">Bolden et al., 2011</xref>). The findings I present here will suggest such expectations may be unsound and such ideals unrealizable.</p>
<p>The assumption that leadership is a phenomenon vested in or possessed by leaders is one that has already come under greater scrutiny in recent years: in challenging this, relational, discursive and practice based theories of leadership have emerged, offering new perspectives and possibilities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1742715012455129">Carroll et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1742715012455129">Cunliffe and Eriksen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1742715012455129">Fairhurst, 2007</xref>). Despite a growing diversity of theories, however, leadership studies are still dominated by leader-centric conceptions of leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1742715012455129">Alvesson and Spicer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742715012455129">Bolden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1742715012455129">Sinclair, 2008</xref>). In this paper I examine some of the consequences of treating leadership as something which emanates from gifted individuals, expanding the existing body of critique of leader-centric thought (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1742715012455129">Fletcher, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1742715012455129">Gemmill and Oakley, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1742715012455129">Sinclair, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The approach taken here is to use the Foucauldian strategy of critical and comparative historical analysis which invites us to ask ‘why this idea?’ and ‘why now?’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715012455129">Foucault, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455129">1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1742715012455129">Knights and Morgan, 1992</xref>). In this problematizing approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742715012455129">Sandberg and Alvesson, 2010</xref>) what is said – the discourse on a specific topic – is treated as constitutive of social reality rather than as mere description (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715012455129">Foucault, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455129">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455129">1985</xref>). Arising from this view of language, analyses of this nature focus attention on the effects and consequences of ideas for who we are and how we live (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1742715012455129">Dean, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1742715012455129">Dreyfus and Rabinow, 1983</xref>). I contend that such issues warrant greater attention by scholars if ethical issues are to be placed not only at the heart of leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1742715012455129">Ciulla, 2004</xref>) but also at the heart of leadership knowledge.</p>
<p>The conventional narrative about developments in our field is that of the neutral and objective pursuit of ‘The Truth’ through the deployment of the scientific method (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1742715012455129">Antonakis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742715012455129">Bass, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1742715012455129">Northouse, 2004</xref>). As a result shifts in thinking or theoretical developments are normally understood as being the result of cumulative knowledge and/or scientific innovations which produce new paradigms: such innocent accounts of our intellectual history are challenged here. Using a critical perspective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1742715012455129">Knights and Morgan (1992)</xref> have established connections between the strategic leadership discourse which arose in the 1980s and a range of institutional, economic and political developments during that period which rendered the discourse both viable and attractive. Their analysis identifies the effects of this discourse in facilitating a ‘more coherent system of managerial control’ (1992: 185) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1742715012455129">Trethewey and Goodall’s (2007)</xref> examination of leadership theory in the USA since WWII shows how changing notions of leadership since 1945 have reflected and reinforced wider political, economic and technological shifts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1742715012455129">Western (2008)</xref> also identifies connections between developments in capitalism over the course of the 20th century and leadership thought. However, most of the history of leadership thought has not been subjected to a critical re-reading, meaning the potential of such analyses to provoke fresh perspectives on past and current knowledge has not been realized.</p>
<p>In this study selected ideas about leadership are situated in their historical context. The social function of these ideas is examined, as are the possible consequences for leader and follower subjectivity that arise when we treat leadership texts as offering identity scripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742715012455129">Ford et al., 2008</xref>). By treating such texts as elements of discursive regimes which construct and constitute the truth about leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1742715012455129">Foucault, 1970</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1742715012455129">1972</xref>), new insights emerge about how it is we have come to understand leadership in the way we now do, offering us a greater critical distance from our normal assumptions. The aim of this approach is to unsettle what we take for granted in order to provoke our inclination and capacity to think differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455129">Foucault, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742715012455129">Sandberg and Alvesson, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1742715012455129" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>This study is based on the examination of Classical Greek and transformational leadership (TL) texts which, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715012455129">Foucault (e.g. 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455129">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455129">1985</xref>), I treat as expert discourses worthy of analysis irrespective of the veracity of the claims they make. The key themes I address are the depiction of leaders, followers and their relationship, and the roles ascribed to leaders, as expressed in these texts. These themes were selected because they constitute central concerns of much of the literature today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742715012455129">Bass, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1742715012455129">Bolden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1742715012455129">Sinclair, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>I deploy here the methods of inquiry and analysis used by Michel Foucault in his later studies (e.g. 1977, 1978, 1985). This approach seeks to ‘disrupt the reproduction and continuation of an institutionalized line of reasoning. It means taking something that is commonly seen as good or natural, and turning it into something problematic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1742715012455129">Sandberg and Alvesson, 2010</xref>: 32). The method includes situating ideas in their historical context, assessing the potential effects for human subjectivity arising from accounts of who we are, and analysing the power effects of truth claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715012455129">Foucault, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455129">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455129">1985</xref>). Though the deployment of such de-familiarizing moves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742715012455129">Alvesson and Deetz, 2000</xref>) the aim is to obtain critical distance from the present in which we are normally embedded so as to stimulate fresh perspectives on issues of concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455129">Foucault, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>In foregrounding the historical context in which knowledge about a certain topic develops, Foucault explores matters such as professional networks, the problems and issues of the day, critical events, chance and power, along with the general structure of thought then operant (1970, 1972, 1977, 1978, 1985). This approach derives from his scepticism toward ‘grand narratives’ which set forth a teleological account of history: for Foucault both the development of knowledge and the process of social change is riven with uncertainty, chance and political interests (e.g. 1977, 1978).</p>
<p>Foucault argues that ideas circulate in subtle, complex and diffuse ways and that over time consensus on certain ideas may develop, until they come to be seen as ‘natural’ and ‘common sense’, irrespective of their intrinsic qualities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715012455129">Foucault, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455129">1978</xref>). Conceptually, Foucault ties knowledge and power tightly together, perceiving them to be in a co-producing relationship (1977, 1978; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1742715012455129">Gordon, 1980</xref>). Related to this he also argues that power (and hence knowledge) is diffuse, mobile and always present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715012455129">Foucault, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455129">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455129">1985</xref>). Consequently a Foucauldian intellectual history of developments in knowledge is simultaneously a critical, political analysis of power/knowledge in action. Assessment of the effects of power/knowledge claims on our understanding of who we are is a key focus in a Foucauldian reading.</p>
<p>Foucault thus developed an approach to analysis which puts aside questions about the accuracy of the truth claims made in the texts being examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715012455129">Foucault, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455129">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455129">1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1742715012455129">1986</xref>). Instead, these bodies of knowledge, these discourses, are examined for their historical origins, their assumptions, their social function, and the effects they have in constructing a version of the world and who we are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715012455129">Foucault, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455129">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455129">1985</xref>). The resultant analysis produces an account which considers both past and present and which attends to both broader political and philosophical concerns as well as to detailed scrutiny of the truth claims being made (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715012455129">Foucault, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455129">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455129">1985</xref>).</p>
<p>For the analysis of Classical Greek leadership knowledge offered here, the primary sources cited are Aristotle’s <italic>The Politics (Pols)</italic>, Plato’s <italic>The Republic</italic> (<italic>Rep)</italic> and <italic>Statesman (St)</italic>, and Xenophon’s <italic>Agesilaus (Ag)</italic> and <italic>Memorabilia</italic> (<italic>Mem</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1742715012455129">1</xref></sup> Plato and Aristotle’s enduring influence and reputations are such as to necessitate their inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1742715012455129">Russell, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1742715012455129">Tarnas, 1996</xref>). In contrast, Xenophon’s importance may now perhaps be questioned. However, like Plato, Xenophon was a pupil of Socrates and there seems little doubt that he was influential in his lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742715012455129">Cartledge, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742715012455129">Gray, 2007</xref>). It is also known that his work was studied by Roman thinkers and practitioners and in the medieval period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742715012455129">Cartledge, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742715012455129">Gray, 2007</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1742715012455129">Adair (2002)</xref> credits Xenophon as a key thinker on strategic leadership. For these reasons the inclusion of Xenophon in this study seemed warranted. While <italic>The Anabasis</italic> and <italic>Cyropeadia</italic> are the most famous of Xenophon’s texts, the works by Xenophon cited here (<italic>Agesilaus</italic> and <italic>Memorabilia)</italic> nonetheless offer an accurate (and more succinct) account of his views on leadership.</p>
<p>For the analysis of the TL literature offered here, the primary sources are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715012455129">Burns’ <italic>Leadership</italic> (1978)</xref> and Bass’s <italic>Leadership and Performance Beyond Expectations</italic> (1985). These were selected for examination because of their status as foundational classics within that literature: much of the subsequent TL literature is essentially a development of these works, which elucidate the foundational tenets of the transformational conception of leadership. Secondary sources comprise a variety of texts focussed on Classical Greece and the USA in the post-war period.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1742715012455129"><title>Classical Greek thought</title>
<sec id="sec4-1742715012455129"><title>Key ideas</title>
<p>I begin with a detailed description of key features of the Classical Greek discourse on leadership, considering firstly their conception of leaders. A central proposition in the texts I examined is that true leaders are wise, knowledgeable and completely moral, acting only in the best interests of followers (e.g. Aristotle, <italic>Pols</italic> 1260a: 15; Plato, <italic>St</italic> 296e;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1742715012455129">2</xref></sup> Xenophon, <italic>Ag</italic> 3.1). The claims made are portrayed as both a normative ideal and as facts (e.g. Aristotle, <italic>Pols</italic> 1265a; Plato, <italic>Rep</italic> 484d; Xenophon, <italic>Mem</italic> 3.9.5). Leader self-interest is explicitly rejected and the genuine leader’s exclusive concern is said to be with enhancing the well-being of followers (e.g. Aristotle, <italic>Pols</italic> 1259b: 35<italic>;</italic> 1333b: 25; Plato, <italic>St</italic> 296e; Xenophon, <italic>Ag</italic> 1.36). A leader is said to know the truth about leadership, knowledge which is held to be inherently both morally virtuous and wise, and so that is how the leader is said to act: mistakes are thus rendered impossible because it is claimed that to possess knowledge of leadership is to act accordingly (e.g. Plato, <italic>St</italic> 297a; Xenophon, <italic>Mem</italic> 3.9.5).</p>
<p>A leader is understood to be a person who is ‘second only to the gods’ (Xenophon, <italic>Ag</italic> 11.13). It is said of leaders that ‘when god fashioned you, he added gold in the composition of those of you who are qualified to be Rulers’ (Plato, <italic>Rep</italic> 415a). It is claimed the leader’s ability ‘to introduce order into the unlimited is the work of a divine power – of such a power as holds together the universe’ (Aristotle, <italic>Pols</italic> 1320a: 30). Accordingly, leadership was thought of as a phenomenon both divine and rare in terms of its basic ontological character, restricted largely to the man who is head of state (e.g. Aristotle, <italic>Pols</italic> 1254b: 20; Plato, <italic>Rep</italic> 503d; <italic>St</italic> 297b; Xenophon, <italic>Mem</italic> 3.4.12).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1742715012455129">3</xref></sup> Fake, sham and self-serving leaders are said to dominate the politics of the time (e.g. Aristotle, <italic>Pols</italic> 1301: 20–1307b: 25; Plato, <italic>Rep</italic> 545a–576b; <italic>St</italic> 291b, 291c, 303c), so an important goal of this discourse appears to be to develop a means of distinguishing between true and fake leaders.</p>
<p>To understand leadership and to determine if a given individual was a genuine leader Greek scholars considered that all aspects of a leader’s character and all his actions should be subject to scrutiny (e.g. Aristotle, <italic>Pols</italic> 1334a: 20–35; Plato, <italic>Rep</italic> 484–487; Xenophon, <italic>Ag</italic>). In his account of Spartan king Agesilaus as a genuine leader, for example, Xenophon considers his childhood, his treatment of friends and enemies, his eating and sleeping habits, his willingness to pay for army uniforms out of his personal funds, his modest clothing and living arrangements and his capacity for sexual restraint, as well as matters we would today see as relevant such as his capacity to motivate others (<italic>Ag</italic>). Greek knowledge of leadership, therefore, produced an all-encompassing gaze upon the person of the leader, denying him any private self or sphere. No detail of the leader’s life was to be ignored or deemed irrelevant in this project to speak the truth about leadership.</p>
<p>In this discourse followers are regarded as inherently flawed and of limited capacity: ‘natural’ inequality between persons is a core assumption (e.g. Aristotle, <italic>Pols</italic> 1254a: 20; Plato, <italic>Rep</italic> 503b; <italic>St</italic> 292e; Xenophon, <italic>Ag</italic> 11.13). Accordingly ‘it is the business of the ruler to give orders and of the ruled to obey’ (Xenophon, <italic>Mem</italic> 3.9.11) because ‘the lower sort are by nature slaves, and it is better for them as for all inferiors that they should be under the rule of a master’ (Aristotle, <italic>Pols</italic> 1254b: 20). Plato argues the follower’s temperament comprises either excessive courage or restraint, requiring the leader to intervene to balance these excesses and deficits (<italic>St</italic> 309). They are not said to live in despair, however, for they are not held to be completely without merit: with careful education and through exercising complete obedience to the leader it is claimed followers may achieve a greater degree of knowledge and virtue, although never to such a degree as that possessed by the leader (e.g. Aristotle, <italic>Pols</italic> 1325b: 1–10; Plato, <italic>St</italic> 308d; Xenophon, <italic>Mem</italic> 3.9.11).</p>
<p>Leaders are expected to directly attend to political, economic, legal, military and diplomatic issues; however, other matters such as child rearing practices, decisions about who should marry whom, the exercise regime of pregnant women and upholding good standards of speech and conduct also feature as important matters requiring leader intervention (e.g. Aristotle, <italic>Pols</italic> 1326–1331, 1334–1336; Plato, <italic>Rep</italic> 425; <italic>St</italic> 301–311 309c; Xenophon <italic>Ag</italic> 7.1; <italic>Mem</italic> 3.9.11). Given the flawed nature of followers and the perfect wisdom and morality of the leader in this discourse, leaders are, logically enough, granted unlimited rights, powers and authority to do whatever it takes to protect the well-being of the people and the state; there is no scope for dissent and consent is deemed irrelevant because followers are held to be incapable of knowing their own best interests (e.g. Aristotle, <italic>Pols</italic> 1254b: 20; Plato, <italic>St</italic> 297; Xenophon, <italic>Mem</italic> 3.9.11). To ensure the future well-being of the state and its people the leader must, therefore, ‘mould to his will the bodies of newly-born children’ (Aristotle, <italic>Pols</italic> 1335a: 5).</p>
<p>Knowledge claims in this discourse rely on empirical example, on recourse to traditional and religious knowledge being treated as of equal validity to other types of evidence and on logical and moral reasoning (e.g. Aristotle, <italic>Pols</italic> 1320a: 30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1742715012455129">Plato, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1742715012455129">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1742715012455129">Xenophon, 1923</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1742715012455129">1997</xref>). In building the case that is made, these various epistemologies appear to have equal standing. While the claims made fail the current view of what constitutes acceptable standards of evidence and proof, there is nonetheless an internal coherency to this conception of leadership.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1742715012455129"><title>Historical context</title>
<p>To understand how and why the Classical Greeks connected ‘leadership’ with ‘order’, ‘obedience’ and ‘inequality’ rather than other ideas such as ‘freedom’ or ‘consent’ I turn now to consider the historical context in which these ideas arose. Throughout these texts there is concern expressed about declining moral standards, the abuse of power, inter-class conflict, a perceived loss of respect for the gods and traditional authority and the vital need to protect the state from its enemies. The Classical Greek world is known to have been politically very unstable, with no lasting consensus in those of the city-states of which we have knowledge as to the appropriate constitutional form of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742715012455129">Finley, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742715012455129">Grant, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1742715012455129">Morris and Powell, 2006</xref>). It is also known there were limited formal mechanisms for peacefully resolving inter-class conflict and that military responses to geo-political issues were commonplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742715012455129">Finley, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742715012455129">Grant, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1742715012455129">Morris and Powell, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Plato, Aristotle and Xenophon’s conception of leadership can therefore be understood as an attempt to produce a comprehensive response to these concerns: <italic>if</italic> the leader is perfectly wise and moral, <italic>if</italic> the people are inherently flawed, <italic>then</italic>, for the Classical Greeks, it makes perfect sense that the leader should also have unlimited powers and that the people should obey him. This situation will, it is claimed, result in order, a vital force which is understood as being that which ‘holds together the universe’ (Aristotle, <italic>Pols</italic> 1320a: 30). By closely attaching ‘leadership’ to ‘order’ the Classical Greek scholars were therefore able to provide an intellectually satisfying response to the problems they saw as plaguing their society.</p>
<p>It is also known that Socrates, the teacher of Plato and Xenophon, was convicted of sedition by the Athenian democracy, leading to his suicide (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742715012455129">Finley, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742715012455129">Grant, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1742715012455129">Irwin, 1989</xref>). Plato’s family are known to have been actively involved in opposing a democratic form of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742715012455129">Finley, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1742715012455129">Lane, 2007</xref>). Xenophon was for a period exiled from Athens by the democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1742715012455129">Cartledge, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1742715012455129">Gray, 2007</xref>). And of course Aristotle was Plato’s pupil (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1742715012455129">Finley, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1742715012455129">Grant, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1742715012455129">Irwin, 1989</xref>). These biographical facts suggest that in thinking about leadership this network of scholars influenced each other and in turn were likely influenced by their association with the concerns of the Athenian aristocracy. Consequently, one way of reading this discourse is to note that a case is built <italic>against</italic> democracy (at least in part) via the case that is built here <italic>for</italic> leadership. ‘Leadership’, as it is conceived of here, thus functions as a strategic power/knowledge device which undermines the intellectual, moral and practical credibility of ‘democracy’ as an idea. This consequence arises irrespective of whether this was the conscious intent of these scholars.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1742715012455129"><title>Subjectivity effects and social function of these ideas</title>
<p>I consider firstly the potential effects of the Classical Greek concept of leadership for leader and follower subjectivity which arises when, following Foucault, we treat these texts as not simply descriptions of who we are but as constructions of who we might become (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715012455129">Foucault, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455129">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455129">1985</xref>). What is produced in this discourse, then, is the most perfect of men; the one who is equipped to lead. The ‘true’ leader here exhibits all and only that which is honourable, virtuous and admirable in every action: it is this exacting completeness, this fulfilment of human potential, which distinguishes the true leader from the fake. A masculine ideal in the very prime of life, comprising a well-honed, mature strength of body, mind and soul is placed before us as the truth about leadership<italic>.</italic> There is no weakness, no flaw, not even the merest hint of the feminine, the old, the weak, the vulnerable or the damaged in this account of the ideal leader.</p>
<p>The leader is presented as a superior being, yet humility, modesty and an understanding of the limitations of other people is also expected, for it is they who are said to be in such great need of his guidance. The leader’s perfection is depicted as being achieved through a combination of calculated and determined self-restraint, ebullient and free-flowing self-expression and a focussed intense desire to excel. It is portrayed as an act of will, the product of knowledge and as destined by nature into being. Here, each and every moment of the leader’s life is both an achievement and an expression of the multi-faceted, all-encompassing nature of leadership.</p>
<p>The depiction of a leader constructed in this discourse is that of someone driven to do that which is truthful, just, moral, honourable and in the best interests of others. In this account no sacrifice is too great, no hardship is too much to bear and no task is too onerous for the leader, provided it serves the well-being of the people and the state. There is to be nothing followers cannot ask of the leader; there is nothing the leader may deny them, provided only that what is sought is in their best interest. If it is not, then his right to deny it is to be beyond question. Every moment of every day is to be dedicated to the precious cause of the well-being of the people and the state.</p>
<p>It is also, however, an unending experience of duty, of scrutiny, of denial of the leader’s own interests and passions which is proposed. The leader, while master, can simultaneously be understood as servant and even slave. While followers must obey the leader, they are not to serve him: they do not exist to meet his needs. They may be subject to his rule and his authority but he is to serve them: his power over them is to be a power that exists only to serve them. Like a slave he is permitted no private interests. He must serve the state and the people only, and never himself. In all that he does and all that he is, the leader is constructed as a creature of and for the people.</p>
<p>Followers, in contrast, are depicted as deeply flawed persons in this discourse, existing primarily as a problem, as beings of limited capacity and potential. Followers are portrayed as persons with inherent and inescapable limitations, producing a need for intervention which is to be provided by the leader. The deficient persona depicted here seems induced to being awestruck by the leader’s capacity for truth, virtue and wisdom and directed toward passivity, deference, subservience and obedience: who are they, after all, to question or challenge the leader? The follower is thus one who implies a childlike dependency and waywardness that is exquisitely matched to the all-powerful, moral and wise parental figure of the leader.</p>
<p>The relationship between leader and follower in this discourse requires follower obedience and leader concern for follower well-being. This mirrors the concern a parent was expected to have for their child and the expectation that parents may legitimately tell their children what they may and may not do. Followers are thus rendered childlike in this discourse. A key expectation is that a leader will do ‘all they can to make them (followers) better people than they were before’ (Plato, <italic>St</italic> 297). However, insofar as this entails the leader striving to make followers more like himself – knowledgeable and moral – the relationship is not only akin to parenting but also to reproductive cloning by the leader of himself: a transformation of the person of the follower into the person of the leader is proposed.</p>
<p>Viewed as one of the ‘games of truth and power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455129">Foucault, 1985</xref>: 8) this discourse is hyperactive, productive and unrelenting. The persuasive strategies deployed are mutually reinforcing and comprehensive: so long as one follows the chain of reasoning <italic>on its own terms</italic> then the conclusions reached are logical, unavoidable and inescapable. Yet this discourse about ‘the truth’ of the perfect leader also flies in the face of an empirical reality which it explicitly acknowledges, that of the self-serving leader. In Foucauldian terms, this discourse can be understood as a strategic attempt to define what can be known and said about leadership, to carve out who shall rule, the terms of that rule, and who shall be subjected to that rule. It can be understood as an uncompromising game of power which presents itself as the search for the truth.</p>
<p>Turning now to consider the macro level function served by this conception of leadership, I propose that what is warranted here is a benign dictatorship where there are no limitations placed on what the leader may do beyond those derived from his own morality and wisdom. These attributes, along with the complete scrutiny to which the leader is to be subjected, equip (and constrain) him to do only that which is in the best interests of the people as he sees it. Ultimately, follower interests are here thought to be served through being transformed into clones of the leader himself, or as near as is possible. As an intellectual device for promoting social cohesion this conception of leadership is highly productive. For those seeking reassurance that in an uncertain world someone, somewhere knows the answer to our problems they need look no further than this conception of leadership. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1742715012455129">Table 1</xref> summarizes this analysis of the Classical Greek leadership discourse.

<sec id="sec8-1742715012455129"><title>Key ideas</title>
<p>I begin with a detailed description of key features of the TL discourse on leadership, considering firstly their conception of leaders. In the texts I have examined (Burns’ <italic>Leadership</italic> and Bass’s <italic>Leadership and Performance Beyond Expectations</italic>), the portrayal of ‘the leader’ who first emerges is an agent of morally uplifting change. Their relationship with followers is said to be one ‘not only of power but of mutual needs, aspirations and values’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715012455129">Burns, 1978</xref>: 3). In this account ‘leadership emerges from, and always returns to, the fundamental needs and wants, aspirations, and values of the followers… [it] produce[s] social change that will satisfy followers’ authentic needs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715012455129">Burns, 1978</xref>: 3). A key assumption at this early stage is that ‘followers have adequate knowledge of alternative leaders… and the capacity to choose among those alternatives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715012455129">Burns, 1978</xref>: 3).</p>
<p>As the approach developed and sought to substantiate its claims by deploying social science norms of speaking the truth, a more specific set of leader attributes emerged: a ready-made identity, available for wider dispersion and intended for replication was produced. The leader became more fully and formally specified as a charismatic individual with high levels of ‘self-confidence and self-esteem’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455129">Bass, 1985a</xref>: 45), capable of defining priorities and meaning in a manner which others find persuasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455129">Bass, 1985a</xref>). The leader is portrayed as someone motivated to inspire others through emotional appeals and intellectual stimulation and concerned also with individual follower’s needs, views and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455129">Bass, 1985a</xref>). It is claimed the leader acts by connecting with the needs of others, satisfying the leader’s own needs in the process of satisfying the needs of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455129">Bass, 1985a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715012455129">Burns, 1978</xref>).</p>
<p>The transformational leader is expected (and warranted) to induce changes in thought and practice in regard to such diverse matters as ‘who rules and by what means; the work-group norms, as well as ultimate beliefs about religion, ideology, morality, ethics, space, time, and human nature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455129">Bass, 1985a</xref>: 24). To achieve these kinds of results the leader ‘invents, introduces, and advances the cultural forms’ resulting in change to ‘the social warp and woof of reality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455129">Bass, 1985a</xref>: 24). Because it is now assumed that the leader functions in a workplace setting with formal authority, withholding or granting rewards dependent on performance also becomes part of the leader’s role (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455129">Bass, 1985a</xref>): the original assumption of follower choice in regard to who shall lead simply fades from view as the transformational leadership discourse enters the workplace.</p>
<p>Followers are portrayed in this discourse as persons with unmet needs and unrealized potential: to address these gaps in their lives consequently requires the intervention of the leader (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455129">Bass, 1985a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715012455129">Burns, 1978</xref>). It is said followers may not fully understand their own true needs and hence the leader is to be the one who can reveal these to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455129">Bass, 1985a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715012455129">Burns, 1978</xref>). Matched to this the follower is portrayed as someone in need of guidance, amenable to change, needing to be changed, requiring someone else to prompt this change, and benefiting from this change (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455129">Bass, 1985a</xref>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715012455129">Burns, 1978</xref>). Such a conception seems to replicate important features of the modern therapeutic relationship which Foucault has argued derives from medieval confessional practices (1978). Followers are said to be naturally self-serving but amenable to becoming self-denying. Via the leader’s intervention followers are expected to ‘transcend their own self-interest for the good of the group, organization, or country’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455129">Bass, 1985a</xref>: 15).</p>
<p>The qualitative and often overtly normative nature of the original claims made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715012455129">Burns (1978)</xref> were fairly quickly adapted to better fit the norms of a positivist social science paradigm (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455129">Bass, 1985a</xref>). Theoretical efforts were made to develop formal constructs and then subject these to empirical testing (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455129">Bass, 1985a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1742715012455129">1985b</xref>). Henceforth transformational leadership was more strictly spoken of as an empirical phenomenon, serving to naturalize and normalize its existence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1742715012455129">Alvesson and Deetz, 2000</xref>). Moreover, the basic proposition of leader-as-change-agent seems to have achieved a significant cultural resonance which heightened interest in it and helped advance its influence on the field and on practitioners. This focus on change is in stark contrast with the Classical Greek focus on stability: why?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-1742715012455129"><title>Historical context</title>
<p>The emergence of the transformational leader discourse in the USA of the 1970s and 1980s can be understood as a strategic response to a range of social, political and economic factors and events. At this time the USA had witnessed high-profile political leaders for several decades: their rhetorical flair as well as the content of their ideas excited a strong emotional response from both supporters and opponents. President Kennedy and Dr King are particularly noteworthy examples of this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715012455129">Burns, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1742715012455129">Heath, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1742715012455129">Roos, 1972</xref>). While Charismatic leadership theory (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1742715012455129">Conger, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1742715012455129">House, 1977</xref>) sought to account for the appeal of such individuals, TL theory offered a broader agenda with a greater focus on substantive change, and was perhaps also more palatable at a time when charismatic leaders such as Hitler and Mussolini remained etched in living memory. While both the Vietnam War and Watergate provoked significant unease about the moral authority of leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742715012455129">Ackerman, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715012455129">Burns, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742715012455129">Capitman, 1973</xref>), TL theory seemed to address such concerns via its (ostensible) focus on follower needs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455129">Bass, 1985a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715012455129">Burns, 1978</xref>). The on-going effects of the so-called counter-culture which questioned established ways of doing things meant it was increasingly difficult for those in positions of authority to secure willing obedience simply by reference to their authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742715012455129">Ackerman, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1742715012455129">Capitman, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1742715012455129">Peters and Waterman, 1982</xref>). America’s industrial sector had also been struggling to retain its competitiveness, with challenges such as the oil crisis and stagflation eroding confidence that American business and political leaders knew what to do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742715012455129">Ackerman, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1742715012455129">Magaziner and Reich, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1742715012455129">Peters and Waterman, 1982</xref>). TL theory thus spoke directly to an audience contemplating an environment which was seen as having dramatically changed and which appeared to require widespread reform and new ways of doing things to regain American dominance. TL theory put itself forward to offer ‘new answers to new questions… using a new paradigm or pattern of inquiry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455129">Bass, 1985a</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>In making these claims the TL discourse also provided a solution to another concern of its advocates: the then dismal state and status of the leadership studies field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1742715012455129">Hunt, 1999</xref>). Following Stodgill’s dismissal in 1948 of the results of close to five decades of research dedicated to developing a trait-based theory of leadership, various other theories and models were advanced with limited success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1742715012455129">Bass, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1742715012455129">Jackson and Parry, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1742715012455129">Miner (1975: 200)</xref> went as far as proposing that ‘the concept of leadership itself has out-lived its usefulness’. Soon after, Lombardo and McCall characterized the field as marked by a ‘mindboggling’ number of ‘un-integrated models, theories, prescription and conceptual schemes’; they claimed ‘much of the literature is fragmentary, trivial, unrealistic and dull’ and ‘the research results are characterised by Type III errors (solving the wrong problems precisely) and by contradictions’ (1978: 3). Fast forward to 1999, however, and Hunt claims that the development of TL theory has itself resulted in a ‘transformation of the field’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1742715012455129">Hunt, 1999</xref>: 130), while even more recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1742715012455129">Jackson and Parry (2011)</xref> suggest that there has never been a better time to study leadership. Hence TL theory, resonating as it did with the wider social context in which it developed, also provided a solution to the dilemma facing leadership researchers in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>The bold claims made about a leader’s ability (and right) to shape others’ reality, values and beliefs can, I argue, only plausibly be asserted in a cultural context already primed to see those in authority as fundamentally benevolent in intent and effect. This context shapes what is sayable in respect of leadership as much as it shapes the silences and omissions we can see in this discourse. The appetite to so readily accept the claims made about leaders, to grab at them with such enthusiasm, serves as an endorsement of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1742715012455129">Meindl et al.’s (1985)</xref> contention that a romantic view of leadership colours contemporary perceptions, generating a focus on the potentially positive aspects of leadership and a turning away from the potentially problematic aspects of a relationship based on inequality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1742715012455129"><title>Subjectivity effects and social function of these ideas</title>
<p>I consider firstly the potential effects of the TL concept for leader and follower subjectivity which arises when, again following Foucault, these texts as treated as not simply descriptions of who we are but as constructions of what we might become (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1742715012455129">Foucault, 1977</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1742715012455129">1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1742715012455129">1985</xref>). The subjectivity of leaders created here, then, is that of persons who express themselves through and in others, who influence others to become more like themselves. As with the Classical Greek discourse leader success is here too akin to reproduction by way of cloning. However, the transformational leader may now take a male or female form and she/he is no longer limited only to the position of head of state but instead can be found in factories and offices everywhere, encouraging others to become like themselves. As we have seen, the transformational leader may appeal to both reason and emotion, the latter being something the Classical Greeks would regard as dangerous.</p>
<p>Leaders as depicted here are persons who harbour no doubts as to their own capacity; the only challenge may be to find followers whose ‘authentic needs’ match those of the leader. Leaders’ ability and apparently fundamental need to change the beliefs, values and reality of others is to be governed by a relationship of symbiosis that is to be formed between leaders and followers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455129">Bass, 1985a</xref>). This presumably will suffice to ensure leaders do not abuse their position. Leaders’ capacity to imagine a different future, to engage others enthusiasm for that, to enhance others performance and to nurture their development means that leaders function here in creative, strategic, operational and interpersonal modes with equal ease. There is seemingly nothing of which the transformational leader is incapable.</p>
<p>However, the self of the transformational leader is also one that can never be satisfied with what exists outside itself, because change is rendered a compulsive requirement for the transformational leader. There is always to be something in the transformational leader’s environment needing improvement or change. There is no scope for stability, for modest goals or merely adequate performance. Everything and everyone must shine, always, in this conception of leadership. Nothing is ever quite good enough. There is a demand for constant movement: so long as something is changing the transformational leader warrants their own existence, their very being. If nothing changes it is as if the transformational leader ceases to exist as such.</p>
<p>Complementing this conception of the leader, the follower exists in this discourse as a person whose potential can only be achieved through the actions of a leader. Hence the transformational leader is one who frees followers from a life of unrealized potential to which they are otherwise condemned: the leader-as-saviour? It is as if followers are perpetually in limbo in the absence of the leader, waiting for the leader’s inspiration, advice, sanctioning or reward to guide their next move. Followers as depicted here offer a passivity which serves as a perfect counterweight to the energy of leaders. While followers are credited with possessing values, goals and dreams of their own these are simultaneously discredited as being self-serving and inauthentic in the absence of the influence of leaders.</p>
<p>The relationship between leader and follower in this discourse is full of (unexamined) paradoxes: leader self-expression is intended to bring about follower self-denial, yet this is simultaneously said to be in the follower’s authentic interests, of which she/he may be unaware. A follower’s potential can here only be achieved by leader intervention, implying an inadequate or non-existent agency on the part of followers. However, the leader’s very existence relies on followers being prepared to change themselves (to become more like the leader), suggesting the agency to resist resides in followers, posing a threat to the leader’s success. Problematically, it seems that if followers become leaders, a proposition posed as the ultimate achievement of leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1742715012455129">Burns, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455129">Bass, 1985a</xref>), this would result in both leader and follower losing their distinctive subjectivity and role and in the loss of their raison d’etre. As a potential identity script for actual persons to deploy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1742715012455129">Alvesson and Sveningsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1742715012455129">Ford et al., 2008</xref>), the TL discourse offers a precarious existence.</p>
<p>Turning now to consider the macro level function served by this conception of leadership, we have seen in this discourse that ‘leadership’ and ‘stability’ are placed in opposing camps. ‘Leadership’ is here associated with change, reform, upheaval, with whatever is bigger, better, faster, stronger and newer, expected to conquer whatever is smaller, slower, weaker and older. In the context in which it arose, then, the TL discourse can be understood to function as a strategic power/knowledge device which supports the requirements of capitalism to find new sources of profit by asserting the desirability and inevitability of constant change and improved performance. The role granted to leaders positions them as facilitators, as handmaidens to the requirements of capitalism, while followers function as consumers of leadership with the promise that such consumption will satisfy ‘authentic needs’. The discourse also functions to enhance the moral authority of managers and to extend the scope of managerial intervention: with the development of the TL discourse, managerial intervention extends beyond merely motivating the employee to work harder to defining the employee’s values, beliefs and reality.</p>
<p>In claiming that leaders can and should change followers’ reality, values and beliefs, individual autonomy and responsibility for such matters are pushed aside, yet we are told this is really in followers’ best interests. Instead, those in authority are tasked with addressing those concerns on followers’ behalf. There seems to be no issue too challenging for the truly transformational leader to take on, no problem beyond their capacity to solve. It is as if leadership is the answer, no matter what the question or problem, an essential force for good, and only good, in which leaders are imbued with special gifts. Here, their corner offices are akin to holy places, while their utterances have become the source of truth and salvation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1742715012455129">Table 2</xref> summarizes this analysis of the Transformational leadership discourse.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1742715012455129"><title>Change and continuity in leadership knowledge</title>
<p>Despite the many great differences between America in the late 20th century and Greece in the 5th and 4th centuries <sc>bc</sc>, there are some interesting continuities in the two leadership discourses. Leaders exist in both as perfect beings, more capable than all others, to be valued and admired. The possibility of seeing those persons who want to change others as potentially a threat to individual autonomy and responsibility seems beyond these discourses. Even though there is a clear concern with inadequate and immoral leaders, these are treated as aberrations meaning that ‘true’ leadership is regarded as intrinsically unproblematic.</p>
<p>As we have seen in both discourses, the conception of leadership put forward positions leaders as responsible for preserving and upholding pre-existing social relations. Despite the apparent emphasis on change in the TL discourse, which differs from the order and obedience emphasis of the Classical Greeks, in both it is also clear that leaders’ primary role is not to challenge but to maintain the dominant social values and norms of the time. Despite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1742715012455129">Bass’s (1985a)</xref> call that leaders challenge followers’ norms, values and reality, leaders are also expected to deploy the rewards and sanctions available to managers in the modern workplace. It is simply taken as read that leaders will pursue the performativity demands of a capitalist system. Such presumptions can hardly be read as implying a more radical agenda was contemplated for TL.</p>
<p>The transformation of followers appears as a central proposition in both discourses. In its contemporary form leader intervention is ostensibly limited to the public realm of politics and work and not to matters now understood as being within the private domain. Nonetheless, the modern transformational leader, like his/her Classical Greek counterpart, is warranted to work on the self of the follower. This suggests that the normal understanding that TL was a new concept first developed by Burns in the 1970s is incorrect: it is actually an ancient concept now recycled into a modern format.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, however, the all-encompassing gaze into every aspect of the Classical Greek leader’s life is sharply reduced in the modern discourse. The leader is now examined only in the public realm of work and political life and it is a parsimonious set of behaviours and characteristics which are examined. Moreover, the modern leader is warranted to pursue a self-interested agenda so long at that connects with others’ interests, something denied the Classical leader. It is as if in modern times we do not want to see the multiple selves of the leader and that self-serving behaviour by leaders has become acceptable. This suggests a confidence that those in positions of authority are benevolent and well-intentioned, which may not always be justified. In both discourses, but especially in the modern era, we can detect a turning away, a (deliberate?) not-knowing when it comes to the potentially adverse or problematic aspects of leaders and leadership.</p>
<p>Followers change in form in these discourses from inherently and irremediably flawed beings to persons-of-unrealized-potential; however, despite this the follower remains a fundamentally deficient being requiring the leader’s intervention. It is arguably merely a change in social norms of what constitutes a polite way to speak of others, rather than a fundamental change in the status of followers we see here. The parental relationship of the Classical Greek discourse has become something much more ambiguous in the TL discourse. This is because of the dependency leaders now have to express themselves through achieving change in followers. This ambiguity entwines leaders and followers in a dynamic where ‘success’ implies the possibility of mutual extinction. However, the avoidance of this requires followers to pass over key aspects of their selves and their lives to leaders, to exist forever in a state of dependency in which leader self-expression is realized through follower self-denial.</p>
<p>An important difference in these two discourses relates to the norms for making truth claims which each relies upon. For the Classical Greeks it is the philosophical mode of logical and moral reasoning combined with the selective use of traditional and religious knowledge which provides the medium for speaking the truth about leadership. For TL theory it is the norms of modern political science and social science which prevail. There are, however, a surprising number of commonalities in the substantive propositions made about ‘leadership’, despite these different modes of knowing. This suggests that axiological assumptions play a far greater role in leadership knowledge than is typically considered, indicating that a greater degree of researcher reflexivity over issues of values would benefit the development of the field.</p>
<p>The analysis here demonstrates that leadership knowledge can usefully be understood as situated knowledge. It can be read as something more than, or not simply, a truth-seeking endeavour, but instead as a strategic, interested response to a set of concerns. It can be understood as an inventive, creative and politically motivated endeavour, rather than a process of discovery.</p>

<sec id="sec12-1742715012455129"><title>Implications and conclusion</title>
<p>An analysis of this type raises many more questions than it answers because it unsettles what we normally take for granted, and may even rock our confidence that what we think today is superior to that of the past. Can TL theory be adapted to remove the assumption of follower inadequacy, for example, or is that an endemic and inextricable feature of the model? What might we make today of the Classical Greeks’ concern to eliminate all scope for leader self-interest, particularly given the dramatic increases in corporate leader remuneration in recent decades? More broadly, why is it that leadership studies today focus so much on behavioural and process aspects and largely ignore the substantive issues to which leaders and followers direct their attention in different settings? In contrast with the Classical Greeks, contemporary leadership theorizing appears strangely absent of content, as if the question of what all this leading and following is for is no longer a relevant issue for leadership scholars. In separating what we now conceive of as moral philosophy and political science from leadership studies, in developing an approach to leadership studies so heavily dominated by psychological perspectives, have we constrained our ability to grapple with the problematic of the power relationships which seem to lie at the heart of both the ancient and modern conceptions of leadership considered here?</p>
<p>The analysis here also calls into question an ontological assumption of both TL and many other contemporary scholars, namely that the capacity for leading is widespread amongst the population. This assumption is embedded in much contemporary research which treats leadership as a universal human phenomenon comprising certain essential features. However, as we have seen, the Classical Greeks claim that the capacity to lead is extremely rare: which view are we to take as correct?</p>
<p>The prevalence of a phenomenon is, of course, a key ontological characteristic requiring <italic>explanation</italic> if we are to claim a scientific grasp of that phenomenon. Perhaps it may be argued that certain aspects of modern society are more suited to releasing the leadership potential that otherwise lies dormant: this possibility warrants further research, as it is not something leadership scholars have attended to thus far. Alternatively, the conflict could be dissolved by dismissing the Greek account altogether and arguing that ‘true’ knowledge commenced in 1978 or some other date when positivist social science achieved a firm grip on leadership. However, pending further research which can explain why leadership might have changed so markedly, this study suggests that leadership is best understood as a fluid, unstable phenomenon. In turn this means the considerable on-going efforts to develop a generalizable set of universal propositions about leadership are unlikely to yield reliable or useful results. A different approach is needed.</p>
<p>This study into the way in which different social milieu have given rise to a different object called ‘leadership’ demonstrates that socio-cultural factors and historical context have a far greater impact on leadership and leadership knowledge than is typically understood. This broader context appears to shape what is do-able, knowable, attractive and sayable in important ways. Leadership knowledge thus seems not merely <italic>conditional</italic> and <italic>situational</italic>. It also appears to be <italic>conditioned</italic> and <italic>situated</italic> by the confines of the time and place in which it developed, as, it also seems, is the very phenomenon of which this knowledge speaks.</p>
<p>A fruitful research strategy for addressing these constraints, however, is also demonstrated by this study. By suspending any assumption of progress and seeking to understand what renders the claims that are made about leadership viable in the context in which they arise, the broad and diverse sweep of documented human history becomes of great relevance to contemporary leadership researchers. The aim of analysing this vast data set is not (mere) historical interest, but rather to deploy the resultant findings as a contrast to current knowledge and practices and to assess their relevance for contemporary conditions. This research strategy helps us to consider our current assumptions and preferences in a fresh light while also opening up new possibilities as we pick, choose and adapt from the past those ideas which might be able to help us today.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study foregrounds the critical influence that assumptions and social context have had in shaping our understanding of leadership today and in the past, and reveals the ontological basis of leadership may be far less fixed than is normally assumed. It demonstrates also that new ways of thinking about leadership can be prompted through critical and comparative historical analysis: by looking backwards in this way we can enrich our capacity to look forwards, situating our knowledge more clearly in relation to the future we wish to create for ourselves.</p>
