<p>Derek Hook’s <italic>A Critical Psychology of the Postcolonial: The Mind of Apartheid</italic> feels as if it is written with a concentrated passion, a compulsion to understand the racism of Apartheid, the persistent grip of its ‘bigoted social logic’ (p. 8), and the way that racism is at the same time a quintessentially subjective and a quintessentially structural social relation. The concentration and passion of the book’s engagement with these questions is evident in the force and clarity with which Hook extends the work of key postcolonial and psychoanalytic theorists to develop a complex account of the ‘libidinal economy’ of racist discourse. His conceptualization of the libidinal economy offers two levels of insight. First, it constitutes a close mapping of the psychopolitical constitution of colonial subjectivities, developed through a precise exposition and critique of the work of Fanon, Biko, Coetzee, Bhaba and Manganyi, alongside Kristeva, Zizek, Freud and Lacan. Hook traces, for example, the relation between Kristeva’s conception of the abject and Manganyi’s account of the allocation of ‘crass corporeality’ (p. 207) within racist culture; and between Freud’s account of the fetish and Bhaba’s theorization of racial stereotype. This dense rearticulation of colonial relations is supported through analysis of a range of empirical sources, including two rich narrative accounts from the Apartheid Archive Project that Hook returns to in each chapter, to illustrate the productivity of different conceptual perspectives.</p>
<p>At the same time the book develops a broader argument about the inherent antagonism between different levels of analysis: the way an essentializing focus on subjective experience comes to be set against types of structural analysis that elide or disrupt the coherence of the individualized subject. This aspect of Hook’s argument is framed in the Lacanian vocabulary of the imaginary and the symbolic:
<disp-quote>
<p>An analysis from the perspective of the imaginary produces a sense of already subsisting positive essences; and analysis from the perspective of the symbolic, by contrast, evidences how such positive properties are an effect of the exchange systems that frame a series of social relations. (p. 80)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The impasse between these two perspectives, Hook argues, cannot be resolved, but, rather constitutes a limit to analysis, ‘a deadlock of comprehension’ (p. 221). This is the essential impossibility of capture of the extra-discursive, bodily or affective excess that, in Lacanian terms, constitutes the real, and that Hook interprets as an unbearable bodily finitude at the heart of racism (p. 214). This excess, the impossibility of reconciliation between the imaginary and symbolic registers, produces a series of ‘antagonisms’ in racist discourse, which are the key object of analysis within the book.</p>
<p>One recurring set of antagonisms is traced in the intersecting movements between similarity and difference, and between anxious flux and the defensive appearance of calm. Hook illustrates the workings of these antagonisms in the psychical production of racialized subjectivity through his accounts of identification and desire, and of stereotype as a mode of disavowal. He draws attention to the way that desire itself can work as a marker of similarity/difference, which can in turn evoke anxieties over the coherence and unity of racialized and sexualized identities:
<disp-quote>
<p>Let us trace the perspective of the white male subject in racist/patriarchal/heterosexist society: you, the black man, must not desire the object (the white woman) of my (white man’s) desire. Why? For if I understand that you also desire this category of object, then I am forced to admit a similarity between us, by virtue of our <italic>shared</italic> desire for this object. The likeness of your desire, in other words, questions the distinctness of my racial identification as separate, especially considering how important I take this desire to be in constituting my identity as a heterosexual man. The apparent anxiety uncovered here is that of the problematization of (apparently distinct) racial identifications through the undeniable similarity of (heterosexual) desire. (p. 142)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The concomitant move, whereby a shared difference troubles desire, Hook suggests, can be seen in the identification of black man/white woman as similar in their difference to the white man: ‘If the black man and the white woman are thus somehow aligned, and I desire her, might I not also <italic>desire him</italic>?’ These instances foreground the impossibility of either sameness or difference, and the way that racialized identities try but fail to cover over the anxiety inherent in this impossibility. Importantly, a particular intensification of these identifications/desires must be understood to emerge in the specific context of colonial power ‘premised on the constant reiteration of difference … where the conditions of unexpected desire are being relentlessly produced’ (p. 142).</p>
<p>In a similar way, Hook argues that racialized stereotypes are analogous to the fetish object associated with disavowal. Disavowal, Hook explains, is associated with the sexual development of the boy child, and his first encounter with the naked, castrated female body: ‘This is a threatening experience for the little boy because it acts as proof of the possibility of his being castrated’ (p. 178). Faced with this existential threat, the child disavows what he sees, but also constructs a new object, the fetish, that can stand in for the not-penis of the mother, helping the child to manage their contradictory beliefs. Just as the fetish object supports the disavowal of sexual vulnerability, the stereotype represses the threat that the racialized other poses to omnipotent white identity:
<disp-quote>
<p>Inasmuch as perceived difference to me constitutes a potential threat – the magnification of a lack, a restating of my own potential castration – then yes I have seen something that figures as difference to me, but I nonetheless maintain that this difference does not matter. It does not matter because it is a difference of inferiority – a fact that needs to be continually affirmed – and it does not matter because the ongoing vexations of this difference are stabilized, made manageable – even if only temporarily – by a fixed emblem, a caricature, a constantly repeated discursive event that holds this profile of construed tendencies and characteristics in place. (p. 187)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Hook points here to two aspects of racial stereotyping: first, the stereotype essentializes difference through a process of metonymy ‘focusing on certain supposed attributes of the “other” ’ (p. 192); second, it fixes the essentialized object through ‘a constant reaffirmation of what one wants to be the case’ (p. 193). Hook’s account elucidates the way that the twin threats of sameness and disintegration, the compulsive movement between seeing and not seeing, are kept at bay through the repetitive assertion of the fetish/stereotype.</p>
<p>These antagonisms, between similarity and difference and between flux and an appearance of order and coherence, are reiterated in the structure of Hook’s text. The ongoing construction of a complex yet highly coherent conceptual framework is interrupted by Hook’s reflexive punctuations: on his own position as an already privileged white researcher writing himself into a trajectory of black theorists (p. 39); on the failure of his theorizing to offer a meaningful resolution to the problem of political engagement (p. 106); and on the difficulty of recognizing vernacular/political appropriations of concepts within the tightly elaborated critical tradition of academic discourse (pp. 34, 37). Each of these disruptive moments has the potential to seriously undo Hook’s intellectual endeavour, to shift attention to the gaps in his delicately constructed account of the workings of racism and racialized identity, and to raise questions about the performative effects, and affects, of this construction. However, Hook’s broader argument points towards the need to occupy, rather than to reject, the apparent contradictions of these alternative analytical perspectives.</p>
<p>Initially, each of the three instances above – the play of desire and identification, the workings of stereotype and the reflexive punctuations within Hook’s own theorizing – might appear to suggest we should repudiate imaginary identifications in favour of a position within the symbolic register. The white male subject, the stereotype, and Hook’s insertion of himself in a trajectory of canonical black theorists, each represents a mode of imaginary identification, which will be rightly disrupted by a recognition of the permeability of its boundaries, of the powerful symbolic relations binding each identity into hierarchies of power within a broader social and structural context. However, in its very suggestion of righteous authority, the symbolic analysis immediately slips back into the imaginary register, and Hook argues:
<disp-quote>
<p>Rather than falling in line with a variety of projects proffering imaginary or symbolic solutions to an impasse that is by definition irresolvable, we should forego attempts to ‘solve’ this real … it should be the antagonisms of the real that provide the starting point from which we attempt to grasp the uncanny persistence not only of racializing embodiment, but of racialization more generally. (p. 222)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is a position o\f radical, disruptive reflexivity, which might aim to undercut the authority of finalist academic interpretation, and to reveal it as perhaps just one element in a network of strategies in the political struggle against discriminatory logics.</p>
<p>These insights are important, not just for postcolonial studies and for our understanding of racism, but beyond that, for intellectual and political engagements with the discriminatory logics of gender, class, ability, sexuality. Hook’s explicitly psychosocial elaboration of the libidinal economy of colonialism constitutes a conceptual vocabulary that might inform research across these domains, and that will help us to trouble attempts to fix the site of politics as either psyche or structure, activism or academy.</p>
