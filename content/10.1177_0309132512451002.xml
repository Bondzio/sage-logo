<p>The <italic>PiHG</italic> annual essay prize is intended to encourage and highlight high-quality published work in human geography from early career scholars.  The prize is worth £250 of books from SAGE Ltd. It is awarded to the best essay published by an early career scholar (or scholars) in a year/volume of <italic>PiHG</italic>. For these purposes, ‘early career' is normally taken to mean within seven years of completion of a PhD or within seven years of a first full-time permanent academic appointment. For coauthored papers all the authors must be early career or else lead authors. Five papers were assessed by the editors from the 2011 volume, with advice from two members of the international editorial advisory board. As in previous years all the assessors felt that the essays were of a very high quality indeed. It was a pleasure to read them.</p>
<p> The editors are pleased to announce that <bold>Elaine Lynn-Ee Ho<bold> </bold>
</bold>is the third winner of the <italic>PiHG </italic>Essay Prize. Her paper ‘Claiming the diaspora: Elite mobility, sending state strategies and the spatialities of citizenship' was deemed to be an original, rigorous and significant contribution to research in human geography. Elaine Lynn-Ee Ho is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Geography, National University of Singapore (NUS). Prior to joining NUS, she worked at the University of Leeds and has also been a postdoctoral fellow at the University of British Columbia and Royal Holloway, University of London. Her research focuses on migration and citizenship (including ‘diaspora’ strategies), the politics of cosmopolitanism and emotional geographies. She has published in the <italic>Annals of the Association of American Geographers</italic>, <italic>Citizenship Studies </italic>and the <italic>Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies</italic> amongst other journals.</p>
