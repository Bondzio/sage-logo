<p>India, among other emerging developing economies of the world, had to confront the fall-out of the global economic recession in recent times, which impacted negatively by way of sharp decline in the GDP, escalating and alarming rise of inflation and rapidly growing unemployment. This has affected both the corporate world as well as the public life at large in equal measures. To combat and cope with this onslaught on our economy, the Government has taken certain short-term and long-term economic as well as financial measures—including greater financial access across wide-ranging socio-economic strata.</p>
<p>The foundation for promoting greater financial access in India can be traced to the findings of the all-India Rural Credit Survey in the early 1950s. Similarly, the origins of the current approach to financial inclusion can be traced to the United Nations’ initiatives (UNDP, UNCDF, The World Bank, 2008), which broadly underlined the main goals as also the broad frameworks and parameters of inclusive finance, as access to a range of financial services, including savings, credit, insurance, remittance and other banking services to all ‘bankable’ households and enterprises at a reasonable cost. Several programme initiatives taken by the RBI, NABARD, Commercial and Cooperative Banks, in totality, had lend active support to investors; as well as potential entrepreneurs to leverage these initiatives into creating new business opportunities. The current issue of <italic>APJMRI</italic> attempts to share some of the recent research thinking that surrounds convergence of multi-disciplinary approaches to cope corporate challenges to business development in an all-inclusive and sustainable manner.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, many firms have announced dividends which give conclusive, but indirect signal to the investors. Raju and Kumar investigate the signalling effect of the dividend announcements and also the significance of cumulative abnormal return of dividend announcements before and after the event day. They also trace the evidence of average abnormal return around the announcement date. Their findings strongly support that the share prices drift positively in the case of dividend announcements and the market particularly reacts more favourably to dividend announcements.</p>
<p>Kumar and Maheswaran in their article on ‘Evidence of Long Memory in the Indian Stock Market’ examine the dynamic nature of market efficiency in the Indian stock market by using a moving sub-sample window of 1,008 observations (using 4 years of daily data). Their findings support the presence of long-range dependence in the Indian stock market. Furthermore, S&amp;P CNX Nifty shows a highly dynamic behaviour in its efficiency characteristics. Kumar et al. studying ‘the seasonality and quarterly impact on Net asset value of the various equity-linked schemes’ found that (<italic>a</italic>) majority of the selected funds follow normal distribution, that is, seasonalised NAV is not skewed, (<italic>b</italic>) third quarter and fourth quarter of a calendar year are seen as appropriate for structuring investment decisions, (<italic>c</italic>) statistical significance exists among the seasonal indices across quarters. Their study confirms that mutual fund investments are beneficial to the investors in the long-run.</p>
<p>Sustainability reporting integrates economic, environmental and social performance of the company into one report. Siya Tuli’s study compares the sustainable development efforts by companies in developed (USA) and developing (India) nations. The study shows that companies are now more aware of sustainable development. In the present study, out of 20 AMEX major market index companies, 14 companies are providing sustainability information in a separate sustainability report, while in case of SENSEX, there are 16 companies out of 30 that are producing sustainability reports. In the USA, greater percentage of companies is disclosing sustainability information, while the quantity of information disclosed as per GRI’s G3 guidelines, in sustainability reports, is more in the case of Indian companies. Universally, most of the foreign investors generally tend to ponder: ‘Do Foreign Institutional Investors really drive the Indian stock market?’ To answer that question, Murthy and Singh’s article lays down the analytical framework for comparing the nature and role of the three players. It uses a framework for empirically testing the impact of each player on the Indian stock market. Their results show that FIIs are not the only active players who have an influence in Indian stock market; even DIIs have an influence, whereas Mutual funds are the passive players.</p>
<p>Shaban and Kavida investigate the impact of intellectual capital (IC) and its components on the financial performance and market valuation of Information Technology industry in India over the period of 2003–2011. Their results show that the relationships between the performance of a company IC’s and conventional performance indicators are varied and indicates that profitability and intellectual capital are positively associated, whereas no significant relationship is observed between intellectual capital with productivity and market valuation; but capital employed efficiency (CEE), which is one of the component of VAIC, found significant positive association with productivity and market valuation.</p>
<p>Mittal, Gera and Singhvi in their article on ‘Developing and Testing a Hierarchical Model of Customer Perceived Service Quality for Life Insurance Services’ attempts to empirically test a multi-dimensional and multi-level hierarchical structure of service quality in Life-Insurance services in India. The study draws evidence from India to develop and compare a second-order hierarchical model with a first-order model to draw better insight into the determinants and structure of perceived service quality in Indian Life-Insurance services. Their study results show that perceived service quality of Life-insurance services is a multi-dimensional second-order construct, consisting of the primary dimensions of Service Delivery, Sales Agent Quality, Tangibles, Value and the Core Service. Bagga and Bhatt, in their article on ‘Intrinsic and Extrinsic factors influencing consumers buying behaviour’, present a simple approach towards identifying the most effective Internet marketing tools that companies should employ and also help in better understanding the online consumer behaviour which differs from the traditional consumer behaviour across various dimensions.</p>
<p>Upadhyay, in his article on ‘Proposing a Model to Assist Indian Micro, Small and Medium Scale Enterprises in Their ERP Implementation’, presents the findings of a study based on analysis of ERP implementation issues in context to Indian micro, small and medium-scale enterprises with the objective of highlighting the key issues confronting them. The analysis showed statistically significant relationship between the predictor and the outcome variables for the four hypotheses.</p>
<p>In cognizance with the Sectoral priority of the Telecom service industry, Jain has contributed an interesting article on ‘Telecommunication Service Quality Assessment with special reference to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Reliance Communications Limited’. His study compared the customers’ perception of quality of telecom services provided by Reliance Communications Limited (a private player) and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (a public player) in western Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>A great deal of financial liberalisation, privatisation and internationalisation policies in emerging economies have significantly increased the corporate restructuring activities like mergers, acquisitions, share repurchases, and stock splits both in the developed and developing economy, including India. Reddy et al.’s article ‘Share Repurchases, Signaling Effect and Implications for Corporate Governance: Evidence from India’ would help financial analysts, financial advisors, corporate enterprises and regulatory bodies in designing policies on earnings distribution, managerial incentives, takeovers, and so forth of regulatory aspects.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that the readers will find the current issue of <italic>APJMRI</italic> informative. I would like to place on record our deepest sense of appreciation and gratitude to the contributors of articles who have shared their thoughts and wisdom with the other research workers through this Journal to stimulate innovative ideas in the diverse fields of Management.</p>
