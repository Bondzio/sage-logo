<p>HIV/AIDS is a global pandemic. The epicentre of this pandemic is sub-Saharan Africa, where 15% of the population is infected versus the global average of 3.9%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1757913911430909">1</xref></sup> Within sub-Saharan Africa, 60% of those infected with HIV/AIDS are girls or women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1757913911430909">2</xref></sup> Looking at the general female population, those who are poor and uneducated are much more likely to be or become infected than their more privileged counterparts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913911430909">3</xref></sup> Other markers of difference such as geographical location within countries, sexual orientation and marital status also differentially affect the probability of infection, thus demonstrating the complexity of characteristics and interactions to be considered when responding to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.</p>
<p>This brief paper will explore some of the limitations of the northern response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, namely how context is currently inadequately understood. We will detail social mechanisms that powerfully affect the female experience of the epidemic. Then, borrowing from the field of feminist scholarship, we will suggest a framework for exploring complex power structures to enable northern organizations to better understand the intricacies of context as they help to formulate a contextualized response to the epidemic.</p>
<sec id="section1-1757913911430909">
<title>The Northern response to HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa</title>
<p>A number of northern programmes have been developed to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Numerous international organizations have been created to fund and implement programmes around the world. In 2003, US$4.7 billion was available for HIV/AIDS programmes worldwide. Unfortunately, many of the funded programmes were built on top-down approaches to address HIV/AIDS, which often fail to take the local context into account and can result in programmes that are not effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1757913911430909">4</xref></sup> Examples of these approaches include: encouraging condom use without considering either a woman’s ability to ask her husband to use one or the repercussions she may face if she does; or the proliferation of abstinence programmes without defining ‘sex’ or considering the drivers of people’s sex lives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1757913911430909">5</xref></sup> In the first case, a better understanding of existing power structures is necessary, and in the second, special attention must be paid to cultural norms and social interactions around sexual activity. To devise more effective programmes, practitioners and scholars from the North must look more closely at the local context and its impact on health behaviours.</p>

<title>Mechanisms of context affecting HIV/AIDS among females in sub-Saharan Africa</title>
<p>Girls and women are at much greater risk of contracting HIV/AIDS because of both unique biological vulnerabilities and social determinants. Biologically, risk of infection is increased by hormonal fluctuations, a higher prevalence of other sexually transmitted diseases, vaginal ecology and physiology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1757913911430909">3</xref></sup> Gender disparities, poverty, lack of education, lack of power and gender violence all contribute to the increased risk of infection for females in sub-Saharan Africa. We will look first at the situation for girls (approximate age 15–19) and then for women (20 and older).</p>
<p>Nancy Luke,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913911430909">6</xref></sup> conducted a literature review of 45 quantitative and qualitative studies of sexual relationships of unmarried adolescent girls in sub-Saharan Africa. The review established that sex with older men that involves economic transactions are commonplace and are associated with unsafe sex, thus increasing the risk of HIV transmission. A study from Tanzania found that girls as young as 10 had exchanged sex for a bottle of Coca-Cola.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1757913911430909">6</xref></sup> One South African study found that 11% of girls report being raped, 71% report having sex against their will and 30% report that their first sexual encounter was forced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1757913911430909">7</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>This imbalance of power between girls and men unfortunately increases within marriage. One study found that married girls in Zambia and Kenya had higher rates of infection than their unmarried counterparts, citing increased frequency of sexual relations, decreased safe sex practices and the ‘virtual elimination’ of a girl’s ability to refuse sex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757913911430909">8</xref></sup> In sub-Saharan Africa, married girls do not typically have multiple partners, yet their husbands are three times more likely to be infected than younger men and adolescent boys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1757913911430909">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The situation for women is much the same. Discriminatory laws often prevent women from any recourse against violence and also contribute to their increased risk of infection by impeding their access to divorce, inheriting property or protecting themselves from forced marriage. Men control all the resources and retain all decision-making power. Women lack education both in terms of general schooling and knowledge of HIV transmission. This lack of schooling also hinders their future employment prospects thus increasing poverty among women. Poverty and HIV/AIDS have a bidirectional relationship: poverty is strongly linked to HIV infection and being infected with HIV/AIDS increases the likelihood of being impoverished.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1757913911430909">9</xref></sup>

<title>The contribution of feminist theory</title>
<p>These complex structures of gender disparity make any analysis of HIV/AIDS and women in sub-Saharan Africa daunting at best. The most commonly used models and frameworks tend to focus on either microsociological or macrosociological questions rather than an integrative approach of both layers. Having a ‘broad framework of macro and micro relations, institutions and processes that are involved in the social construction of inequity’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1757913911430909">10</xref></sup> can help overcome the traditional challenges that social theorists face with this sort of complexity.</p>
<p>The theory of intersectionality, popularized by Kimberlé Crenshaw in 1989,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1757913911430909">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913911430909">12</xref></sup> aims to fully encompass both micro- and macrosociological layers. Davis defines intersectionality as: ‘the interaction between gender, race and other categories of difference in individual lives, social practices, institutional arrangements, and cultural ideologies and the outcomes of these interactions in terms of power.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913911430909">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Intersectionality involves the examination of ‘difference’. Morris and Bunjun<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1757913911430909">13</xref></sup> highlight the need to examine multiple social categories such as ethnicity, religion, history, gender, sexuality, geographic location and family status. These many different attributes intersect to create a social location, which subsequently influences a person’s ability to navigate their way in a social world. Morris and Bunjun also stress the importance of acknowledging how history and social and economic structures work together to reinforce the status quo and prevent progress for women. Intersectionality provides researchers with a lens for examining the complexities of power and the ability to view how these identities interact in the social construction of inequities, oppression and, in this case, HIV/AIDS infection. In brief, intersectionality can be thought of as a ‘research and policy paradigm’ that ‘provides a theoretical foundation for the pursuit of social justice’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1757913911430909">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a complex arena, intersectionality gives us more than the social determinants of health approach: it advances the examination of the ‘causes of the causes’ by providing a systematic way of inquiring about which social determinants are of concern for a particular group of people based on their experience of privilege or oppression on several interlocking fronts.</p>
<p>To apply an intersectional analysis to women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa in relationship to HIV/AIDS, northern organizations could adopt a systemised technique of ‘asking the other question’, which is often employed in intersectional analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1757913911430909">12</xref></sup> We can apply this framework to a concrete problem such as trying to improve female adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ARV) in a given region. Asking the ‘other’ question implies that there is an initial question that only addresses part of the potential problem. In this case, that initial question might be: ‘Why don’t women take their medicine?’ Applying intersectionality to this issue would require digging deeper, asking questions to get at the structural limitations of why a given woman might not be adhering; programme planning might include exploring issues that pertain to her ethnicity, religion, history, gender, sexuality, geographic location, family status, social role, economic situation and so on. Such inquiry might find, for instance, that women might not be adhering because they are poor, they cannot afford the food needed to take the medication, they cannot get to the clinic where they receive the ARV because they are in a geographic location that is too remote and they cannot spare the time (or money) to take buses because they are required to work to support the family because of the designated familial role reinforced by their communities and religious beliefs, and so on. As we ask these ‘other’ questions, a holistic picture of the women’s lives comes to the fore, which facilitates a much more realistic, contextualized view of a population’s circumstances and may provide invaluable knowledge for the planning for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment programmes.</p>
<p>Applying intersectionality to HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa allows an analysis that considers the structures that surround women that create and recreate vulnerability and marginalisation. Intersectionality applied to public health offers an important lens with which to view the nuances of health and illness for a particular group of people, in the context of their environment and the unique obstacles faced. Using this type of inquiry could go a long way to enable northern organizations to deliver a much more appropriate response to health issues everywhere, but certainly to protect the health of girls and women in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
