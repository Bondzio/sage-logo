<abstract>
<p>Therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest improves neurologic outcome following adult ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest and perinatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Evaluation of therapeutic hypothermia in the pediatric cardiac arrest population has been limited thus far to retrospective evaluations and to date there have been no published prospective efficacy trials. Two retrospective pediatric cohort studies showed no benefit from hypothermia compared to usual care. The timing (intra-arrest or post-arrest) and duration of hypothermia may impact patient outcome. While overshoot hypothermia &lt;32°C, hypokalemia, and bradycardia are commonly associated with induced hypothermia, the risks of severe arrhythmia and bleeding are no worse than in normothermic controls. Despite this, rewarming has been identified as a vulnerable time for hypotension and seizure activity and may attribute to worse outcome. The American Heart Association’s current recommendation is “therapeutic hypothermia (32-34°C) may be considered for children who remain comatose after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. It is reasonable for adolescents resuscitated from sudden, witnessed, out-of-hospital VF cardiac arrest.” Ongoing research will help delineate whether induced hypothermia following pediatric cardiac arrest improves neurologic outcome.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Therapeutic hypothermia following cardiac arrest improves neurologic outcome in select populations. Following adult ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest and perinatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, hypothermia improves morbidity and mortality when compared to usual care.<sup>

</sup> Evaluations of which other patient populations will benefit from induced hypothermia are underway. Furthermore, the ideal timing of hypothermia treatment related to cardiac arrest and return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) is being characterized. The benefits of this therapy must be evaluated in the context of risks and whether the treatment can be applied safely. We will discuss which populations to cool, when to cool, and whether cooling can be implemented safely.</p>

<title>Who are the Right Patients to Cool?</title>
<p>In 2005, the American Heart Association (AHA), following the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation’s (ILCOR) evidence evaluation process, released an advisory statement stating that, “Therapeutic hypothermia (32°C to 34°C) may be considered for children who remain comatose after resuscitation from cardiac arrest. It is reasonable for adolescents resuscitated from sudden, witnessed, out-of-hospital VF cardiac arrest.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111418256">6</xref>
</sup> They also recommended cooling all unconscious adults following successful resuscitation from an out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillatory cardiac arrest.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111418256">7</xref>
</sup> To understand how these guidelines were formed it is important to evaluate the relevant literature.</p>
<p>In 2002, two landmark articles were published evaluating the use of therapeutic hypothermia following witnessed adult out-of-hospital VF arrest. Bernard et al randomized 77 patients to either normothermia or hypothermia (33°C for 12 hours).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111418256">1</xref>
</sup> Of these, 49% (21 of 43) of patients in the hypothermia group had a good outcome (discharge to home or a rehab facility) as compared to 26% (9 of 34) of patients in the control group (odds ratio [OR] 5.25; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.47, 18.76; <italic>P</italic> = .046). The Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest (HACA) study randomized 273 patients to hypothermia (32°C-34°C) for 24 hours or normothermia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111418256">2</xref>
</sup> Good neurologic outcome was defined as a 6-month Cerebral Performance Category of 1 or 2 (normal or mild dysfunction). In all, 53% (75 of 136) of the participants in the hypothermic arm had a good outcome as compared to 36% (54 of 137) of participants in the control group (OR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.81; <italic>P</italic> = .009). Of note, approximately 25% of participants in the normothermic arm had bladder temperatures above 38°C. Some experts have questioned whether this was a testament to the benefits of hypothermia or harms of hyperthermia. Despite these studies’shortcomings, induced hypothermia following adult VF arrest is now considered standard of care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111418256">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Induced hypothermia has also been rigorously studied in the neonatal population following birth asphyxia. Shankaran et al randomized moderately or severely encephalopathic neonates to induced hypothermia (33.5°C esophageal) versus usual care for 72 hours. In all, 44% (45 of 102) of participants treated with hypothermia had a poor outcome (death or disability at 18-22 months) compared to 62% (64 of 106) of patients in the control group [Relative Risk (RR) 0.72, 95% CI: 0.54, 0.95; <italic>P</italic> = .01]. When death was evaluated as an isolated outcome, there was no difference between the hypothermic and control groups (<italic>P</italic> = .08).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111418256">4</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Gluckman et al evaluated head cooling in neonates with moderate and severe encephalopathy. They further stratified brain injury severity based on amplitude electroencephalogram (aEEG) recordings within 5.5 hours of birth. They hypothesized that those neonates with severe aEEG background abnormalities would not benefit from hypothermia compared with those with moderate aEEG background abnormalities. Neonates were randomized to receive head cooling to a target rectal temperature of 34°C to 35°C for 72 hours or usual care. In all, 55% (59 of 108) of neonates treated with hypothermia had a poor outcome (death or disability at 18 months) compared to 66% (73 of 110) treated with usual care (<italic>P</italic> = .1).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111418256">3</xref>
</sup> Interestingly, a subanalysis evaluating only patients with moderately abnormal aEEG background patterns showed a decrease in poor outcome for those treated with hypothermia versus usual care (48% vs 66%; OR 0.47, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.8; <italic>P</italic> = .009). Induced hypothermia for the treatment of perinatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy is now the standard of care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-2150135111418256">
<title>When is the Best Time to Cool?</title>
<p>The previously described clinical studies implemented therapeutic hypothermia up to 6 to 12 hours following ROSC. Multiple preclinical studies have questioned the ideal timing of hypothermia following resuscitation. They have evaluated prearrest, intra-arrest, and postarrest induction of hypothermia to determine the effect of timing on neurologic outcome.</p>
<p>Kuboyama et al utilized a dog model of VF arrest resuscitation utilizing bypass to resuscitate and cool in order to compare neurologic outcomes in animals treated with normothermia, intra-arrest hypothermia (34°C during reperfusion), or postarrest hypothermia (34°C for 15 minutes post-ROSC).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111418256">8</xref>
</sup> The animals treated with intra-arrest hypothermia had a significantly better clinical and histologic outcome than those treated with delayed hypothermia or normothermia. A mouse model of cardiac standstill showed that those treated with intra-arrest hypothermia had significantly lower 72-hour mortality compared to those treated with post-ROSC hypothermia or normothermia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111418256">9</xref>
</sup> These studies give credence to rapid and early induction of hypothermia post arrest.</p>
<p>Clinical implementation of early hypothermia and early cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has been studied for refractory cardiac arrest. Nagao et al performed a before and after study evaluating patients who were unable to achieve ROSC within 10 minutes of emergency department arrival with standard Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS). They compared four groups (1) collapse to CPB &lt;55.5 minutes with cooling (&lt;34°C) &lt;21.5 minutes from CPB, (2) collapse to CPB &lt;55.5 minutes with cooling ≥21.5 minutes from CPB, (3) collapse to CPB ≥55.5 minutes with cooling &lt;21.5 minutes from CPB, or (4) collapse to CPB ≥55.5 minutes with cooling ≥21.5 minutes from CPB.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135111418256">10</xref>
</sup> Participants who reached a target temperature of 34°C &lt;21.5 minutes from bypass initiation had a significantly better outcome than those who reached 34°C ≥21.5 minutes, regardless of time to bypass initiation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2150135111418256">
<title>Can We Cool Safely?</title>
<p>Despite evidence that induced hypothermia benefits specific populations, clinicians are often concerned regarding the safety of maintaining a person post arrest, potentially anticoagulated on bypass, with a body temperature of 32°C to 34°C for 24 to 72 hours. Adverse events such as bleeding, hemodynamic instability, arrhythmia, and infection are cited as reasons to avoid hypothermia. The multiple randomized controlled trials have prospectively evaluated adverse events and have found that while cooling has side effects, there are almost no increased adverse events between hypothermic and normothermic controls.</p>
<p>The adult trials showed no increased risk of bleeding, sepsis or long-lasting arrhythmias, or differences in platelet or white cell counts between hypothermia and control groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111418256">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111418256">2</xref>
</sup> The neonatal trials evaluating 72 hours of cooling showed no difference between hypothermia and control groups for major arrhythmia, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, or infection.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111418256">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111418256">4</xref>
</sup> A small pilot study of cooling and neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) evaluated the risk of complications. Five ECMO patients per temperature group (37°C, 36°C, 35°C, and 34°C for 24 hours and 34°C for 48 hours) were evaluated. There was no evidence of severe bleeding or arrhythmia in the hypothermia groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111418256">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Rewarming has been identified as a vulnerable time. In a randomized controlled trial of induced hypothermia following pediatric traumatic brain injury, there was significantly more hypotension in cooled patients during rewarming than in the normothermic control.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111418256">12</xref>
</sup> Notably, there was no benefit from hypothermia treatment in this study and concerns that there was a trend toward higher mortality in the cooled patients. Nonconvulsive seizures and status epilepticus are common following cardiac arrest.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135111418256">13</xref>
</sup> Abend et al showed that seizures commonly start in the second half of cooling or during rewarming.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135111418256">13</xref>
</sup> This may be due to increasing metabolic rate and loss of neuroprotective benefits as cooling is terminated. Further study must delineate the ideal timing and rate of rewarming and how it may impact ongoing brain injury.</p>

<sec id="section5-2150135111418256">
<title>Does it Change Outcome for Children</title>
<p>While the efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia has been prospectively evaluated in the adult and neonatal populations, to date there is no published prospective data evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia following pediatric cardiac arrest. Two retrospective studies have described induced hypothermia and outcomes in two distinct pediatric populations. Doherty et al evaluated 79 patients from 5 centers of which 37% (29 of 79) were treated with hypothermia. Of note, 95% of these arrests were in hospital, 70% were due to a cardiac cause, and more than 75% of victims had had cardiac surgery. The patients who were treated with hypothermia were sicker than the control group, had longer durations of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), more medications, and more ECMO (79% of hypothermic patients vs 20% of normothermic patients). Despite the differences in these groups, the adjusted ORs for 30-day- and 6-month mortality and postarrest neurologic outcome were no different between the two treatment groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135111418256">14</xref>
</sup> Fink et al performed a retrospective trial comparing therapeutic hypothermia to standard care in a primarily asphyxial arrest population (&gt;90% of arrests).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135111418256">15</xref>
</sup> While the patients treated with hypothermia had longer cardiac arrests and received more intra-arrest epinephrine, when controlling for multiple covariates, there was no difference in mortality between the induced hypothermia and standard of care groups.</p>
<p>The results of these studies show that it is reasonable to have equipoise for evaluation of therapeutic hypothermia following pediatric cardiac arrest. Currently, the efficacy of therapeutic hypothermia following pediatric cardiac arrest is being evaluated by an National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded multicenter trial comparing therapeutic hypothermia (32°C-34°C) for 48 hours to controlled normothermia (36°C-37.5°C) for 48 hours and their effects on 12-month neurologic outcome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.thapca.org">www.thapca.org</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Therapeutic hypothermia following adult VF cardiac arrest and perinatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy improves neurologic outcome when compared to usual care. While the ideal timing to induce hypothermia has not been explicitly defined, it is evident that earlier therapeutic hypothermia can be achieved, the better the outcome. Cooling can be performed safely, even in patients who are heparinized and on extracorporeal support. The major question that remains to be answered is whether induced hypothermia will minimize neurologic morbidity and mortality for children post cardiac arrest as it has for their adult counterparts.</p>
