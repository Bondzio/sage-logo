<p>Aseem Prakash and Mary Gugerty edit a strong contribution to the nongovernmental organization (NGO) advocacy network literature in the book <italic>Advocacy Organizations and Collective Action</italic>, which focuses on the collective action of groups using the theory of the firm. They suggest that NGOs are similar to for-profit firms, given the particular transaction costs and agency issues associated with advocacy. A series of case studies applying collective action to the theory of the firm in a variety of NGO settings are offered to help to illuminate the concepts. The book presents a pioneering study in looking at the instrumental concerns and challenges facing advocacy NGOs through the connective thread of the theory of the firm. It is divided into four sections as follows: the study of institutional environment advocacy organizations, advocacy tactics and strategies, advocacy and market structures, and criticism and future research.</p>
<p>In the neoclassical literature, the theory of the firm analyzes a single principal in the principal–agent relationship. NGOs, however, have multiple principals giving rise to collective action issues. Multiple principals, similar to competing for-profit firms, suffer from problems relating to agency. The collective action approach to studying these organizations allows for a “unifying analytical approach” (p. 1).</p>
<p>Part 1 of the book considers the organizational development of NGOs studying the Natural Resource Defense Council’s origins. McGee Young suggests that an entrepreneurial model to find the money, the people, and the other instrumental logistics for success presents collective action problems associated with the firm.</p>
<p>In chapter 3, Anthony Gill and Steven Pfaff consider how advocacy networks supply club goods in the context of members of religious organizations. The authors specifically look at “religious economies” and apply microeconomic principles to religious organizations. Religious organizations, like advocacy organizations, supply goods to members to meet individual beliefs more efficiently than the market. Religions provide public, club, and credence goods to members based on unifying belief tenets while simultaneously excluding nonbelievers (of that religious group) from the circle.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Bloodgood, in chapter 4, considers how proscriptive or prescriptive regulations affect NGO advocacy efforts. Regulations may present barriers to entry in advocacy networks. She suggests that regulation and other economic incentives can help to overcome collective action problems including goal conflicts and host country political openness. Bloodgood also points out that when there is a goal conflict, one or more NGOs in an advocacy network may act on their individual goals rather than support the larger aspirational goals of the network. Bloodgood suggests that other advocacy network actors will self-police the common network goals and not allow a single NGO to advance its individual agenda.</p>
<p>Part 2 of the volume moves away from organizational structure concerns to actual tactical maneuvers and strategies used by NGOs in communicating their organizational message. Clifford Bob, in chapter 5, considers what human rights networks supply to members, including camaraderie and knowledge. Human rights NGOs are not strictly founded, organized, and sustained on the premise of moral theory. Moral theorists, when considering this type of NGO, have not looked at organizational conflicts, the role of power, and the role of the group. The economic framework allows scholars to consider the supply side of what these organizations produce, including membership benefits and knowledge.</p>
<p>Maryann Barasko considers the importance of brand for NGO advocacy organizations. Brand is more than just its public image, but the way in which the NGO uses shared norms and goals as a part of its branding technique. Barasko argues that marketing and branding have traditionally been associated with the private firm. Through their branding, NGOs seek to convey more than just having the best product on the market; they want to show that they provide common normative grounds. It is in this area that advocacy networks face collective action problems.</p>
<p>Sarah Pralle considers collective action problems when NGOs shop for policy venues. As environmental legislation was enacted, the organization shifted to provide technical support to actors within its network to seek environmental policy change in venues other than the courtroom. She likens this shift to being an example of punctuated equilibrium. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0899764011426405">True, Jones, and Baumgartner (2007)</xref> posited that policy making is cyclical and requires flexibility based on static pause and future changing events. Rather than looking at agenda setting, Pralle considers venue openings that will afford policy changes in the context of NGO advocacy actors. This chapter considers several cases in which organizations have both narrow and broad mission statements. Narrowly defined organizations are static. Broadly defined organizations are dynamic. Dynamic organizations have the ability to make policy change through a variety of venues including filing suits for litigation, advocacy, and lobbying activities to influence decision makers to introduce legislation.</p>
<p>Part 3 of the book considers international advocacy and corresponding market structures. Alexander Cooley and James Ron look at transnational advocacy actors in case studies in the Congo and Bosnia. They compare how the instrumental actions of advocacy NGOs and pressure from competitors and financial concerns shape NGO choices. Two qualitative case studies, although not generalizable, point out the problems of collective action within an international network seeking to do good and how these actions may be compromised.</p>
<p>Jesse Lecy, George Mitchell, and Hans Peter Schmitz consider how advocacy networks are similar to firms. The authors interviewed leaders of 152 transnational NGOs to consider collective action problems that these organizations face. Just like private firms, NGOs face issues of survival and competition. The authors found that there are gaps between well-funded and underfunded NGOs in reaching goals. They examine the challenges faced by Russian NGOs from their emergence under Yeltsin to regulation under Putin. In Russia, NGOs experienced difficulty in carrying out their mission because NGOs as organizations were viewed with suspicion. This chapter shows that as NGOs became domestically institutionalized within the country, the governments of these countries became grant funders to NGOs.</p>
<p>Finally, in the fourth section of the book, Thomas Risse criticizes using the theory of the firm as a single window of analysis for NGO advocacy networks. Risse points out the pitfalls that NGOs face when they are considered to be the moral authority and unique provider of knowledge, and maintains that the extant literature, which has looked at the normative values and goals of NGO advocacy networks, is still valid. In fact, each of the authors in the book notes that NGOs can be differentiated from firms based on issues surrounding multiple principals and shared collective normative values.</p>
<p>In the conclusion, Prakash and Gugerty summarize the chapters and suggest that NGOs as organizations have normative or charitable as well as instrumental aspects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0899764011426405">Frumkin (2002)</xref> suggests that the instrumental goals of nonprofit agencies may include the provision of goods and services when there is government and market failure from a demand side. The editors acknowledge that firms are competitive, cooperative, and complex structures, suggesting that the economic theory of the firm is just one angle for analysis. Future research in the area is needed surrounding decision-making structure and strategy when applying the theory of the firm to explain goal achievement in the NGO context.</p>
